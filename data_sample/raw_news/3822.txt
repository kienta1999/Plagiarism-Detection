Veteran journalist Dan Rather got philosophical to take apparent aim at President Donald Trump on Thursday.

The former CBS News anchor tweeted the following quote attributed to 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in what appeared to be a swipe at Trump’s habit of spreading misinformation.

"By a lie a man throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a man. A man who himself does not believe what he tells another … has even less worth than if he were a mere thing. … makes himself a mere deceptive appearance of man, not man himself." - Immanuel Kant — Dan Rather (@DanRather) March 15, 2018

“By a lie a man throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a man,” wrote Rather. “A man who himself does not believe what he tells another … has even less worth than if he were a mere thing. … makes himself a mere deceptive appearance of man, not man himself.”

On Wednesday, Trump admitted to making up trade deficit details during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — before then walking the entire story back.

Rather has not been shy about criticizing the White House in recent months, and previously used a food poisoning analogy to sum up the “age of Trump.”

His latest dig was well-received on Twitter:

This is wonderful but there is no chance @realDonaldTrump @POTUS would be able to understand a word of it. Well said. — Sawyer J. Webster (@SawyerJWebster) March 15, 2018

Thank you for being vocal Mr. Rather. Will always appreciate your voice. In French we would say “Vous ètes un sage”.



It’s a compliment. :) — René Laroche (is it Spring yet?) (@ReneLaroche67) March 15, 2018

Great quote - too bad the #LiarInChief wouldn't get it even if someone explained it to him ;) — Danine Pug Momma (@DaninePugHeart) March 15, 2018

True words so applicable to the current occupant of the White House. He’s so accustomed to telling lies he’s unlikely to know truth when confronted with it. — Cat Evans 🇨🇦 (@gg_evans) March 16, 2018

Mr. Rather, once again, you have perfectly captured the disgrace that is the current president. I'm so thankful we have your voice and that you continue to be on the front lines defending our liberty and our country. — WithLabs22 (@WithLabs22) March 16, 2018
