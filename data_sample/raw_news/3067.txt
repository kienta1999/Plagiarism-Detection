Jim Carrey is quick off the draw.

The actor on Thursday submitted his latest artistic rendering of Donald Trump to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery for consideration as the official presidential portrait.

Dear Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery @NPG, I know it’s early but I’d like to submit this as the official portrait of our 45th President, Donald J. Trump. It’s called, 'You Scream. I Scream. Will We Ever Stop Screaming?' pic.twitter.com/LrCmlXXpv7 — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 29, 2018

“I know it’s early,” Carrey wrote in a tongue-in-cheek tweet.

His artwork shows a nipple-fingering Trump screaming as he eats from what appears to be a bowl containing two scoops of ice cream.

It’s titled: “You Scream. I Scream. Will We Ever Stop Screaming?”

People who responded on Twitter appeared to enjoy the piece:

Keep it coming Mr. Carrey! Absolutely hilarious. Artistic exposition, great work sir!!! — Slink Grindstone (@slinkgrindstone) March 29, 2018

The Smithsonian hasn’t responded to Carrey’s submission.

Should Carrey’s Trump portrait not be to the gallery’s taste, maybe it would consider some of the actor’s other recent politically charged pieces:
