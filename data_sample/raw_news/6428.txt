Ellen DeGeneres struck an upbeat tone with her own spoof State of the Union address.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” the daytime television host joked that she hadn’t watched President Donald Trump’s Tuesday speech to Congress because she “had a thing.”

So, she delivered her own version, which ended with a beautiful message about “love and inclusiveness.”
