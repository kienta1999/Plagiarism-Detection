President Donald Trump brushed what he said was dandruff from the shoulder of French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday in the White House Oval Office.

“We have a very special relationship, in fact I’ll get that little piece of dandruff off,” Trump declared to reporters as the two leaders posed for photos before a meeting. “We have to make him perfect. He is perfect,” added Trump, flicking his fingers across Macron’s dark-suited shoulder.

It’s unclear whether anything actually was on Macron’s shoulder.

Macron chuckled awkwardly during the exchange, taking the moment in stride.

People on Twitter were incredulous:

During the formal state arrival ceremony, Macron talked about everything from “free and fair trade” to the environment to the Iran nuclear deal.
