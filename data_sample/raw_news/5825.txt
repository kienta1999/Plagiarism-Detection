Finally, proof that no one is looking at your Instagram anyway.

Similar to Snapchat snaps, Instagram stories have always had a shelf life â€• if you miss them, youâ€™re out of luck. But unlike Snapchat, which notifies people when followers take screenshots, Instagram has allowed you to freely screenshot stories without any notifications. Until now.

In a statement to TechCrunch, Instagram confirmed itâ€™s testing a feature that notifies users when a follower screenshots their story.

Good bye freedom to screenshot IG stories. ðŸ’” Thank you, Instagram for the warning. pic.twitter.com/y0pEaVR0Jq â€” mulan (@__cajb) February 8, 2018

Instagram already notifies people if someone screenshots a DM conversation theyâ€™re involved in; but letâ€™s be honest, screenshotting a DM seems shady.

But if weâ€™re not screenshotting Instagram stories as often, how will we show our kids the early days of skulking about social media, or gather blackmail evidence of our friendsâ€™ bad behavior?
