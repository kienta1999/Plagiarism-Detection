Accio jokes.

Earlier this week, a few British outlets published photos of Daniel Radcliffe filming a scene for his upcoming action comedy “Guns Akimbo.”

One of these images features the former “Harry Potter” star looking pretty unhinged as he totes two guns in a robe and crazy tiger-foot slippers.

Once this particular image made its way to Twitter Wednesday, users had a pretty difficult time seeing past the Boy Who Lived, and a pretty magical meme was quickly conjured.

Here are some solid jokes (some of which aren’t Harry Potter-related but were too good not to include) that would even make Minerva McGonagall crack a smile:
