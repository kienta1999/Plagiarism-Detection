Trevor Noah can’t stop vibing to President Donald Trump’s words.

“The Daily Show” host joined Jimmy Fallon on Friday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” and revealed how he sometimes catches himself singing Trump’s catchphrases out loud.

Trump’s speech patterns made it sound as if “he’s doing a bad rendition of a Bob Marley song,” said Noah, who then gave one of Trump’s current favorite phrases a reggae twist.
