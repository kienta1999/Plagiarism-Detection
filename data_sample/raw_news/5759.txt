LONDON (Reuters) - All flights to and from London’s City Airport were cancelled on Monday after an unexploded World War Two bomb was found in the River Thames at George V Dock, the airport said.

Police said the ordnance was found during work at the airport on Sunday and they set up a 200-meter exclusion zone.

The Metropolitan Police said properties within the exclusion zone had been evacuated and a number of roads were cordoned off.

Robert Sinclair, CEO of London City Airport, the city’s fifth biggest and the most central, said: “Theairport is cooperating fully with the Met Police and Royal Navy and working hard to safely remove the device and resolve the situation as quickly as possible.”

Regional airline CityJet said its flights from the airport had been rescheduled to land and take off from London Southend airport. Italy’s Alitalia said it would operate flights from London Stansted airport.

British Airways said it was trying to minimize disruption for passengers after the airport’s closure.
