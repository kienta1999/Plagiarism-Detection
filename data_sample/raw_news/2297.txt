Outlets investigated a claim that the National Enquirer’s publishing company paid off a doorman in Trump Tower to keep quiet about a child Trump supposedly fathered with a housekeeper. Several former employees of the publisher anonymously told The New Yorker that the tabloid’s reporters followed up on the story, and said the doorman passed a lie-detector test. The New Yorker, however, found no evidence of a Trump love child, and the Trump Organization denied the allegation.
