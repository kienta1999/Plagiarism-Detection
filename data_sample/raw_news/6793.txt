The official music video for “Trap” by Shakira and Maluma is here. And it’s, well, steamy.

The black-and-white video directed by Jaume de Laiguana had been viewed nearly 500,000 times as of Friday afternoon. The song describes a sensual back-and-forth, as Shakira sings about not wanting to get her heart broken and Maluma sings about seducing her.
