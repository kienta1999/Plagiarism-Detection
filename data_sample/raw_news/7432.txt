Political debate took its toll on British lawmaker Sir Desmond Swayne.

Video going viral shows the 61-year-old Conservative member of Parliament catching 40 winks as his colleague Ken Clarke discussed Britain’s looming withdrawal from the European Union in the House of Commons on Tuesday.

To Swayne’s credit, he later apologized “unreservedly” for the snooze.

“I just fell asleep,” he told the Daily Mirror. “No excuse.”

“I am annoyed I let it happen,” Swayne added to the BBC. “It is embarrassing and annoying.”
