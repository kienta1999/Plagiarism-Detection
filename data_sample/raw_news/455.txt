This is Camp Altiplano, where volunteers are using simple practices such as creating ponds and loosening hard earth to return the soil to health.

“When the first tractors arrived [in the 1950s and 60s], that was a big moment for the degradation here,” says Alfonso Chico de Guzman, who owns the plot of land where Camp Altiplano is located. With machinery, most farms increased their amount of productive land by cutting down trees and shrubs, which are vital for healthy soil, the farmer says.

In focusing on soil, Camp Altiplano’s ultimate goal is to learn how to bring degraded land back to life. If current rates of global soil degradation continue, it’s estimated we may only have 60 years of farming left. What’s more, restoring degraded soil worldwide has the potential to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, meaning soils can play an important role in climate change mitigation.

Camp Altiplano’s day begins with a dozen volunteers ― the current cohort are from Spain, the U.K. and the Netherlands ― gathering around a farmhouse table for a morning meeting. Tasks such as feeding the chickens, tending to the vegetable garden and making compost are allocated according to people’s skills and interests, and then the group sets to work for the day.
