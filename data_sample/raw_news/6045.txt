On Wednesday, anchor Shepard Smith openly ridiculed the president’s proposed parade during a discussion with Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin.

“He could go see the tanks at a military base if he wanted to,” Smith offered as a more frugal alternative. “Or they could give him replicas. Little mini replicas. I mean, he wants to see what he has. I had some of those when I was a kid.”

Smith later added: “You can get the little plastic ones and lay them out on the table and say, ‘Here you go.’”

Griffin joined in the teasing.

“We can play Strategy and Risk,” she suggested.

“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade is another Fox News personality skeptical about Trump’s grand parade.

On Wednesday, he broke ranks with co-hosts Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt, who supported the proposed event.

“I don’t know. It seems like a waste of money,” he said.
