The ESPN “SportsCenter” anchor will be exiting the evening news hour to write for the Undefeated, the network’s sports culture website, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Hill, who is one year into a four-year contract with ESPN, will act as chief correspondent and senior columnist for the site that describes itself as “exploring the intersections of race, sports and culture.” She’ll also host town halls and will be free to write longer reported pieces.
