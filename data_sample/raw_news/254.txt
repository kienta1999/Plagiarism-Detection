The “D.C.” in Washington, D.C., might now stand for “dirt collapse,” thanks to a sinkhole recently discovered on the North Lawn of the White House.

Voice Of America reporter Steve Herman first noticed the hole, and he says it’s getting bigger by the day.

“It was noticeably bigger between Sunday and Monday,” Herman told Quartz. “It’s more than a foot long right now.”

A second sinkhole has since opened up next to the first one, he said.

Erosion and water drainage can cause sinkholes, which sometimes grow large enough to swallow whole buildings.

The White House did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment about the sinkhole.

However, the sinkhole’s location in D.C. ― a city described as a “swamp” of corruption ― did not go unnoticed by Twitter users.

An actual sinkhole has opened on the White House lawn. It’s growing. And it's actually just hell opening up to welcome back it's children. https://t.co/NH6jZ2B90M — Kyle Louis Reynolds (@kylelreynolds) May 22, 2018

It's not like a growing sinkhole right outside the press briefing room at the White House has any existential meaning to it at all, right? — Jeff Urbanchuk (@jurbanchuk) May 22, 2018

“It was noticeably bigger between Sunday and Monday, it’s more than a foot long right now. A second sinkhole has opened up right next to it." Clearly it's a sign form God that the White House is a swamp that needs draining. https://t.co/MTGj6i38no — Nita Cosby (@5_2blue) May 22, 2018

Some people had theories. Lots of theories.
