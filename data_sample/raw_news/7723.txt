Celebrities are angrily calling out President Donald Trump’s reported description of Haiti and nations in Africa as “shithole countries.”

Movie stars, comedians, musicians, chefs and late-night talk show hosts condemned Trump over his comments, which he reportedly made during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers on Thursday.

According to The Washington Post, Trump asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” as he pushed against reinstating protections for immigrants from those areas. Trump then suggested the U.S. welcome more immigrants from countries like Norway.

The following day, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”

Musician John Legend used Twitter to call Trump a “racist,” chef José Andrés said the people of Haiti deserved an apology and TV personality Jerry Springer indicated Trump was putting “our own citizens in danger”:

Tomorrow is the 8th anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti. Violent dictators, natural disasters and raw injustice have conspired against the dignified, resilient and wonderful Haitian people for decades... — Ben Stiller (@RedHourBen) January 12, 2018

Haitians have been a big part of the American melting pot...

In 1990 14% of us Haitians were managerial and professional - lawyers, scientists, teachers, doctors, business managers. By 2010, this figure was 24%.... Haitians are a proud and resilient people and their country isnt — Ben Stiller (@RedHourBen) January 12, 2018

A shithole.



Wishing all those affected by the earthquake, the last hurricane and everything else they have had to deal with all the best from our country. #respect — Ben Stiller (@RedHourBen) January 12, 2018

The president is a racist. He has been for his entire public life. If you vote(d) for him, you do so because of that or despite that. We need a multi-racial anti-racist coalition to defeat him and try to heal our nation. — John Legend (@johnlegend) January 12, 2018

Mr. @realdonaldtrump @POTUS Let me introduce you to some amazing young Haitian women and men!Learning in our @WCKitchen cooking school in Port au Prince. Dreaming of a great future. Their ancestors survived hardships. They deserve respect. And your apology! pic.twitter.com/3X3n5kSTq5 — José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) January 12, 2018

Mr. President, immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti and the 54 countries in Africa likely helped build your buildings. They’ve certainly helped build our country. cc @POTUS https://t.co/hv1QYRoRy3 — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 11, 2018

When Trump calls other countries “shithole countries,” does he realize that puts our own citizens in danger? How is that presidential? — Jerry Springer (@jerryspringer) January 12, 2018

“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” This country’s greatness and true genius lies in its diversity. — James Comey (@Comey) January 12, 2018

Trump apparently wants more Norwegians and fewer people from ”shithole” countries in Africa. You know what’s a real shithole? Trump’s goddamned mouth. — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) January 11, 2018

I’m just gonna start calling him president Shithole. — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) January 11, 2018

"Let me be clear.... the people of Haiti have been through more, withstood more, fought back against more injustice... than our President ever has" Anderson Cooper choked back tears as he reflected on his relationship with Haiti, and its people https://t.co/3arEalkKOM — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) January 12, 2018

In a week Trump will do/say something that'll make today's "shithole" comment seem quant. Does anyone remember "Mexicans are rapists," "bleeding out of her whatever" and "good people on both sides"? Happy 11th day of 2018, everyone! — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) January 12, 2018

I'm the proud daughter of immigrants from British Guyana and the Congo. My immigrant family - my cousins, aunts, uncles and my husband's Jamaican family - have contributed MIGHTILY to this country. Yet Trump, of all people, views us as useless products of "shithole countries." pic.twitter.com/kYzEvNEdnV — Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) January 12, 2018

To paraphrase Stephen Colbert, those aren’t “shithole countries” because their president isn’t Donald Trump. — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 12, 2018

Very clever sir! Cancelling the trip, rather than admitting you're scared-silly at the prospect of facing massive protests you'd inevitably encounter upon your arrival, was a masterstroke! UK is just another shit-hole country, right? #MakeAmericaCringeAgain https://t.co/Kk3h1zmVsJ — @HamillHimself (@HamillHimself) January 12, 2018

The article has been updated to include that Trump has denied having used that specific language, and Durbin’s assertion that he did.
