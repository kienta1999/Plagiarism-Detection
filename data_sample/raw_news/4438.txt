It’s fun to imagine the lucky few who took home Oscars on Sunday sipping bubbly with their fabulous friends at ritzy parties late into the night. They’re glam Hollywood stars, so what else would they do? Well, Allison Janney, who won the Best Supporting Actress trophy for her turn in “I, Tonya,” shattered any illusions of that when she showed up to work Monday morning, Oscar in tow.

At least she had the opportunity to share her joy with her “Mom” co-workers, including her TV daughter, Anna Faris. (And it’s not like she went straight home after the ceremony, so surely there was some time for celebration.)

Another “Mom” actress, Mimi Kennedy, was just as happy for her co-star. She was also just as impressed by the weight of the award — 8.5 pounds.

In fact, the entire cast and crew applauded when Janney arrived, "Mom” producer and writer Adam Chase shared on Twitter.

Just as fun as the excitement of Janney’s co-stars is the T-shirt that she wore for her first day as “Oscar winner Allison Janney,” the way she will always be identified in movie trailers from here on out. Her shirt read, “I Survived Awards Season and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt.” Of course, it was also adorned with a colorful bird, like the one that sat on her shoulder throughout much of awards season, and, of course, a notice about her award winning-performance as Tonya Harding’s mother.

Looks like her Oscar will become her new accessory.
