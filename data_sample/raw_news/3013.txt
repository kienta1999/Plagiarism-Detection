ESPN baseball analyst Tim Kurkjian should never cover the Grammy Awards.

During the Opening Day broadcast of the Chicago Cubs-Miami Marlins game in Miami Thursday, the 61-year-old announcer hilariously confessed to striking out when it comes to music knowledge.

“I need to get out of the house a little bit more, I think that’s fairly obvious,” he told fellow commentators Eduardo Perez and Karl Ravech. “I thought Lynyrd Skynyrd was a guy ― I thought his name was Len, I didn’t know it was a band. I thought Jethro Tull was a guy instead of a band.”

“And ― this is really bad,” he went on. “For a very short time in my life... I wasn’t sure if Kanye West was a man or a woman. That’s how bad I am at music.”

For the record, there was a real Jethro Tull and a real Leonard Skinner.
