The Miami Heat plan to unveil new patches they will wear in honor of the victims of last week’s deadly shooting in Parkland, Florida.

The NBA team plans to unveil the new patches, which are still being designed, on Friday, according to WPLG Local 10 News. The Heat intend to wear the patches for the remainder of the season.

Last week, a 19-year-old gunman allegedly stormed into his former school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and opened fire, killing 17 people with an assault-style rifle and leaving many others injured.

Starting Friday and for the remainder of the season, the Miami Heat will be wearing a patch on their jerseys to honor victims of the Stoneman Douglas HS tragedy. The design is still being worked on. — Will Manso (@WillManso) February 21, 2018

Since then, a surge of protests have taken place across the state and country, with many being led by students from Stoneman Douglas. They have called out the NRA and demanded stronger gun reform legislation.

On March 24, many survivors of the shooting, along with others upset by the nation’s lenient gun control laws, plan to take to the streets in a march on Washington, D.C., and around the nation.

Also on Wednesday, Major League Baseball unveiled Stoneman Douglas hats that will be given to all 30 teams for players to wear in honor of the victims. The hat design is a replica of those worn by the high school’s baseball team.
