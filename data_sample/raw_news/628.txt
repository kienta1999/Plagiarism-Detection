Subject: Tweet Request for Bret Baier’s new book

Good afternoon—

Bret Baier’s new book is set to be released on Tuesday, May 15. Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of the Soviet Union, reveals as never before President Ronald Reagan’s battle to end the Cold War, framed around the historic, three-day 1988 Moscow Summit. You can find more information here: https://www.bretbaier.com/books/three-days-in-moscow/ [bretbaier.com]

We are asking for your help in spreading the word about the book via Twitter. If you feel inclined, we would be so grateful if you would consider sending out a tweet to your followers encouraging them to check out the book website and sharing your thoughts. We would love to get the word out Monday and Tuesday (May 14 and 15) especially, but anytime you can send one in the next week would be greatly appreciated!

I have scripted a few sample tweets below, but feel free to write and send your own. I have also attached a few quote cards we had made up if you want to share a photo as well.
