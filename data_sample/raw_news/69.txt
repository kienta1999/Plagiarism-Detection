Can you believe?

Bobby Berk, the interior design expert from Netflix’s “Queer Eye,” recently stopped by the AOL.com office to makeover my desk on behalf of Chase Ultimate Rewards ― and being the “hero” for a day was everything I’d hoped it would be and more.

Before Bobby showed up to clean up my work space, my desk at our New York office was simply overloaded with stuff. As an editor of the site, I get sent a lot of books and alcohol and other random knick-knacks and, because I live in New York and don’t have very much space in my apartment, I keep a lot of it at work ― that is, until Bobby gave his two cents.

As he showed on the incredible first season of “Queer Eye,” Bobby has a natural eye for design and what works best for a space ― regardless of how big it is. When he was done with my desk, it was simplified, sleek, decluttered and just overall more pleasant to work in.
