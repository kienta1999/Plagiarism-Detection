Accepting his SAG Award, Brown talked of the blessing it is to “do what you love for a living,” shouted out the acting profession, and thanked his respective families, on and off the screen.

“What an honor it is to be recognized by your peers for a job well done,” he said. “This room is a source of endless inspiration for me. I love all of you. People call us weird and strange; the truth of the matter is everybody’s weird and strange, and we just embrace ourselves for who we are.”

The actor then thanked wife Ryan Michelle Bathe, calling her “the best scene partner a brother has ever had.”

“To my glorious cast of ‘This Is Us,’ you feed me day in, day out,” Brown added.

“You raise the bar. To my white family, which thankfully is nothing like the family from ‘Get Out,’ I love you. To my TV wife, Susan Kelechi Watson, let’s keep on repping for the people. To the two young actors that play Randall, to Lonnie [Chavis] and Niles [Fitch], thank you for making the work so easy and so seamless.”

He also added that, as an actor, “fame won’t sustain you, money won’t sustain you. The love — keep that love alive. It will keep you going.”

Fans and friends on Twitter are loving the Sterling K. Brown moment that we’re all just living in.
