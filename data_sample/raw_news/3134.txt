Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted back that the comedian should definitely appear as a guest on “Hannity” since his audience is “her people.” Barr is an outspoken supporter of the president, and her character in the “Roseanne” reboot also supports Trump.

100% @seanhannity’s people are your people... that, and when you leave he won’t have a panel of 7 people who ALL despise you waiting to dissect and intentionally misinterpret everything you say. https://t.co/7hqE9u89c0 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 29, 2018

But it was Hannity himself who might have sealed the deal.

“Roseanne, would you like to host my show one night?” he asked. “DONE!! Just say yes!”
