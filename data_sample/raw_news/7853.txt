A lounging kangaroo has been causing quite a stir on social media for its, uh, sexiness.

The park and kangaroo experts have not immediately responded to HuffPost requests for comments on the kangarooâ€™s well-being.

Itâ€™s not clear whether the photo was staged, but HuffPost has reached out to Duniau for more information on the story behind it. She did not immediately respond.

Regardless of where or how it came to be, the photo is causing a ruckus on Twitter:
