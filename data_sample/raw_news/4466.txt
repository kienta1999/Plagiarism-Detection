President Donald Trump’s former campaign aide Sam Nunberg spent Monday afternoon sitting for a series of interviews on cable news shows, bombastically stating that he would not comply with a subpoena he received to appear before a federal grand jury regarding Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Before wrapping his appearance on Erin Burnett’s show, the CNN host said she could smell alcohol on his breath and asked Nunberg if he had been drinking.

“We talked earlier about what people in the White House were saying about you ― talking about whether you were drinking or on drugs or whatever had happened today,” she said. “Talking to you, I have smelled alcohol on your breath.”

Nunberg said he had not had a drink and had only taken his medication ― antidepressants ― earlier Monday.

The former Trump aide, who was fired from the campaign after racially charged social media posts he allegedly wrote surfaced, told The Washington Post on Monday that he would not cooperate with special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election.
