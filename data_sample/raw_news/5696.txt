Jimmy Kimmel had fun at the expense of former President Barack Obama and current POTUS Donald Trump on Monday night.

Kimmel seized on the unveiling of the Obama’s official portraits at the National Portrait Gallery earlier in the day to lightheartedly suggest where one of the artists got their ideas.

The comedian then amusingly imagined what Trump’s portrait will end up looking like. And it’s safe to say, it won’t be to everyone’s taste.
