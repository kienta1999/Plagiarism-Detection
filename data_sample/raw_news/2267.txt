You guys will cover it endlessly all day today, all day tomorrow and my guess is every day next week.”

Comey is set to release his memoir, excerpts of which have already been published. In it, he talks about his views on President Donald Trump, the man who fired him, and explains his thinking behind how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.

The book is expected to be a blockbuster, having already sold almost 200,000 copies before its release.

The White House and its Republican allies have hit back against Comey, branding him as a liar and a leaker.
