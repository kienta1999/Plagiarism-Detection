A 16-year-old boy shot a 15-year-old girl in a Texas high school cafeteria Monday, officials said.

The shooting took place at Italy High School, roughly 40 miles south of Dallas, a spokeswoman for the Ellis County Sheriff’s Office told HuffPost. Both teens were students at the school.

The unidentified 16-year-old allegedly “engaged the victim,” fired several shots from a semi-automatic .380 handgun and then fled. He was later arrested without incident.

“I saw him take out the gun and shoot the girl. After he shot her twice, he tried to shoot the guy she was with. He just went out the back door,” Italy High School sophomore Edgar Rodriguez told CBS-DFW.

The victim was airlifted to a Dallas hospital, and her condition isn’t yet known. An investigation is ongoing.

Students were moved “under guard” to the high school’s gymnasium, also known as “the dome,” she confirmed. Nearby Stafford Elementary School was also on lockdown as staff prepared to release students once police gave the all-clear, local ABC affiliate WFAA reported.
