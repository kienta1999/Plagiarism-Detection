The 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards put film and TV actors in the spotlight Sunday night.

Kristen Bell hosted this year’s ceremony in Los Angeles, which included a roster of almost all-female presenters. The awards show takes place in the midst of the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, which have brought discussions of gender inequality and sexual misconduct to the forefront of Hollywood.

Film buffs were likely watching closely, as the SAG Awards can often be a good indicator of who will take home Academy Awards. With four nods, “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” went into the night with the most film nominations.
