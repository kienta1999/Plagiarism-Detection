Mexican athlete German Madrazo may have finished last in the men’s 15km cross country at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Friday.

But the 43-year-old ― who hadn’t ever skied until last year ― won the hearts of TV viewers around the world for the emotional way in which his race concluded.

During the final straight, a fan handed him a Mexican flag:

The event’s winner, Switzerland’s Dario Cologna, walked over to congratulate the entire group.

Check out the video here:

Madrazo, who has lived in McAllen, Texas, for the last decade, finished in 116th place, almost 26 minutes behind Cologna. Two competitors failed to finish, and one was disqualified.

Many people on social media hailed the finish as a great example of the Olympic spirit.
