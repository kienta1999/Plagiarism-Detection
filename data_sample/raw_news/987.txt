As the model and daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin attempted to navigate the red carpet in her stunning Tommy Hilfiger gown, Mendes was caught on camera making sure that the fabric of her train fell just right.

The “Stitches” singer took precautions not to step on her dress as well.

And if all that weren’t sweet enough, Mendes, 19, walked backward up the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in order to help Baldwin, 21, navigate the stairs.

According to People, the couple — who made their red carpet debut Monday night — have been romantically linked since late 2017.

Although neither celebrity’s camp has officially confirmed their relationship as of yet, both posted photos from the event in which they looked pretty cozy with one another.
