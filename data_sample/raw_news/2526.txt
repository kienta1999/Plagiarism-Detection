High school student Micheal Brown made headlines last week for a remarkable feat: He was accepted by all 20 colleges he applied to, and each institution awarded him a full scholarship to boot.

Video of Brown, screaming with excitement as he learned of his acceptances surrounded by family and friends, went viral. Four Ivy League institutions ‚Äï Harvard, Yale, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania ‚Äï want him, as do Stanford, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins and 11 more top-rated colleges.

MUST SEE VIDEO! This is what it looks like when a hard working, 3rd Ward student gets accepted to his dream college. BTW... he was accepted to 20! Including 4 #IvyLeagues.

While the exceptional senior, who earned a 4.68 GPA at Lamar High School in Houston was praised by many ‚Äï from reporters to readers to President Bill Clinton ‚Äï a local news team in Washington has come under fire for harshly criticizing the student.

On Fox 5 DC last week, morning co-anchor Holly Morris and contributor Sarah Fraser laid into Brown for applying to 20 schools, calling his decision to do so ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù and suggesting he was showing off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little ridiculous that this kid applied to 20, taking away a spot and basically waitlisting another kid,‚Äù Fraser said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm urging my kids not to,‚Äù co-anchor Allison Seymour said in an aside.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little obnoxious because you can only go to one, you can only take one full ride, and you are taking a spot from someone else who worked really hard,‚Äù Morris said.

The backlash was swift and has grown over the past week as a Now This video criticizing the Fox 5 segment went viral.

Here's a new one: Local Fox anchors criticized this Black teen for working TOO hard pic.twitter.com/sIwyciCC9j ‚Äî NowThis (@nowthisnews) April 9, 2018

Twitters users are laying into the journalists, saying their comments seemed racially motivated.

This doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútake a space or a scholarship‚Äù away from ANYONE.



Yale isn‚Äôt going to suddenly enroll only 1,499 freshmen or only give $4,950,000 in financial aid if this kid goes to Stanford instead.



This is straight up, poorly coded, bigotry. https://t.co/ySdmNbml1x ‚Äî Aditya Sood (@adityasood) April 9, 2018

Michael Brown, I wish you would‚Äôve applied to 30 schools. Keep shining- you‚Äôre an inspiration to black and brown kids all over. Perhaps you could call it a representation of the fact so many of us have to work twice as hard to get half of what others get... https://t.co/VOU3AjijcW ‚Äî Don Champion (@DonChampionTV) April 9, 2018

Check out @FoxNews anchors call a young black man, Michael Brown, ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù for applying to and getting accepted with full scholarships to 20 colleges.



Either we‚Äôre ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and need to ‚Äúwork hard,‚Äù or we‚Äôre ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù when we excel for working hard.#Racist#SitDownAndShutUp pic.twitter.com/QWGPVVcdpD ‚Äî Bishop Talbert Swan (@TalbertSwan) April 5, 2018

So to sum up: Ferguson's Michael Brown who was murdered by the cop was a thug who wasn‚Äôt trying to do anything with his life so he deserved to die. THIS Michael Brown who applied to 20 colleges/universities and got full rides, is "obnoxious" for doing too much with his life. https://t.co/YXPXWAPrYv ‚Äî Daryle L.

In response to the backlash, Fraser tweeted an apology to Brown on Saturday, saying she learned a ‚Äúvaluable lesson.‚Äù Brown tweeted that he accepted her apology.

Bishop Talbert - I am sorry. I‚Äôm sorry to Michael b. I truly had no malice when I set this story up, we wanted to ask is 20 schools too much? But I see now that was petty. Michael is awesome and I have learned a lesson. ‚Äî Sarah Fraser (@heyfrase) April 7, 2018

Thank you for your apology. I appreciate it and accept it. ‚Äî Micheal Brown (@mbreezy101) April 7, 2018

Morris maintained that she was criticizing the act of applying to 20 schools, not Brown himself. She also said she would have had the same response if the student were white.

I just believe in a more targeted search. I think the common ap has changed the game and makes it too easy to apply to too many schools. Has nothing to do with privilege. Just my opinion. We can disagree... that‚Äôs ok. https://t.co/JsGsXAGTmV ‚Äî Holly Morris (@HollyLiveFox5DC) April 3, 2018

I also said he is an amazing young man. This is not a racial issue. I would have the exact same opinion if the boy was white. https://t.co/gq8Edty0s8 ‚Äî Holly Morris (@HollyLiveFox5DC) April 4, 2018

Brown said he had a Skype interview with Morris but has asked the station not to air it since the anchor has still not apologized.

This morning, I had a respectful Skype interview with @HollyLiveFox5DC , though I did not get an apology during the interview. I won't allow the interview to air until @fox5dc provides me with a public apology. Where's the #humandecency? ‚Äî Micheal Brown (@mbreezy101) April 6, 2018

Fox 5 DC, Morris, Seymour and Brown did not respond to HuffPost‚Äôs requests for comment.
