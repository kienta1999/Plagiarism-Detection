PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva has tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug, the Russian bobsleigh federation said in a statement on Friday.

The federation said in a post on its official Facebook page that the athlete had tested positive on Feb. 18, five days after a previous doping test returned a negative result for her.

Aleksandr Krushelnitckii, a Russian Olympic curler, was on Thursday stripped of his bronze medal after failing a doping test.
