Mark Hamill had fans praising him to the heavens after his guest stint on ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù season finale Thursday. (Spoilers ahead.)

Playing himself, the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù actor showed off his comic chops while officiating the wedding of Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Amy (Mayim Bialik).

But he also may have changed the pet-naming galaxy forever. Howard (Simon Helberg) finds a lost dog and calls the owner. Hamill himself shows up at Howard‚Äôs door to reclaim his pooch, gobsmacking Howard, who learns that the dog‚Äôs name is Bark, as in Bark Hamill. (Yeah, we loved that, too.)

Can you blame Howard? If @HamillHimself showed up at your doorstep, it would be pretty hard not to freak out. #BigBangTheory pic.twitter.com/0vYIDKHqwp ‚Äî The Big Bang Theory (@bigbangtheory) May 11, 2018

Howard strikes a deal with Hamill to hitch Sheldon and Amy instead of giving him a reward ‚Äï and keeps it a secret from the pair. Of course Hamill commands the big day. He fields questions from wedding guests during a delay ...

and gives all Luke Skywalker fans some moments to love and to cherish.
