Things weren’t looking so sunny for Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live’s” cold open that channeled the last dark episode of HBO’s “The Sopranos.”

Baldwin kind of enjoys a get-together with sort-of pals and lawyers Michael Cohen, (Ben Stiller), and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon) in the season finale. They’re meeting in the last place we saw the increasingly beleaguered Tony Soprano — Jersey’s Holsten’s restaurant — and listening to the same song: Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’.”

Cohen, sounding like a mobster, tells Trump: “They say I might do 20 years unless I give you up.”

Trump responds: “I’ve heard jail’s fun. It’s like camp — plus, there’s a free gym. Dude, you’re gonna get so jacked!”

Giuliani laughs that Cohen can actually get a “real” law degree in prison.

Then Donald Jr. (Mikey Day) saunters in as brother Eric (Alex Moffatt) tries in vain to parallel park his Big Wheels outside (again, a spoof of the “The Sopranos’” finale).

In walks Robert Mueller, played by Robert De Niro. He sits, ominously, at a nearby table and only Trump can see him. As Mueller heads to the restroom, he points at his eyes, then at Trump, silently warning him: “I’m watching you.”

Cut to black.
