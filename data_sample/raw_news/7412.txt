The National Hockey League‚Äôs excited announcement that Kid Rock will perform at its All-Star Game on Jan. 28 in Tampa, Florida, got a cold reception from some folks on Twitter.

Cold, but funny.

Critics had plenty of reasons to protest the league‚Äôs polarizing choice of the musician. He supported Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, used a four-letter criticism of Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs national anthem protest, and enthusiastically displayed the Confederate flag.

In addition, Kid Rock hasn‚Äôt had a Billboard chart-topping album since 2007 (‚ÄúRock N Roll Jesus‚Äù), and that was his only one.

Social media pretty much called out the NHL‚Äôs choice for all of the above.

Here‚Äôs a sampling:

NHL: Why don't any women, minorities, or people under 40 watch our sport?

Kid Rock will be headlining the entertainment for the NHL All Star game along with Tomi Lahren rapping, the woman who wore the MAGA dress singing, and Scott Baio pucking himself. ‚Äî Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 17, 2018

As if I needed another reason to not watch the NHL All-Star Game the fools at #NHL headquarters have hired Kid Rock one of Americas biggest asses to be the entertainment. Gary Bettman you have lost your effing mind. pic.twitter.com/OAeyv42yQ2 ‚Äî üçÅ Merlin üçÅ (@MerlinYYC) January 17, 2018

NHL exec: "Hey! Let's unnecessarily align ourselves with a divisive performer in a politically sensitive time in exchange for songs at an intermission event that no one cares about for a sport that is generally not political."

All: "this sounds like a good risk reward trade-off" ‚Äî Birdie Num Nums (@BirdieNumNums_1) January 17, 2018

Hey @NHL, did you actually discuss inviting Kid Rock to perform at the ASG or was it an intern error? ‚Äî Jason Kay (@JKTHN) January 17, 2018
