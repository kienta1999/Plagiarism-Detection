Billy Bush said Friday that he didn’t confront Donald Trump about the disgusting comments he made about women on an “Access Hollywood” bus in 2005 because he was worried it would hurt his career.

“I was the entertainment correspondent for NBC, he was the cash cow. He was pulling 20 million viewers a week or something,” Bush said on Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time with Bill Maher.”

Bush admitted he “sort of” had to suck up to Trump for the show.

“Or you can interrupt him and then you know how volatile he is, right, so he’d be like ‘I hate Billy Bush,’ he’s done, moving on, ‘Entertainment Tonight’ only, forget Billy Bush and then I have to explain why I lost Trump, the big fish,” he said.
