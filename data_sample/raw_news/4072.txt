TONIGHT: Trump wants to use prior restraint to silence Stormy Daniels but she’s got the receipts. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/5iQSjciOtH — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) March 13, 2018

Stephen Colbert is a little alarmed by a report surrounding porn star Stormy Daniels and her alleged affair with Donald Trump before he became president.

She’s offering to return the $130,000 she received in 2016 from Trump attorney Michael Cohen so she can tell her story.

As Colbert pointed out, she’s also hoping to share “text messages, photos and/or videos relating to the president that she may have.”

“The Late Show” host says that means there could be a Trump sex tape out there ― then, he envisioned just what the cover might look like.
