The truth about “The X-Files” is out there.

Well, with its star David Duchovny (aka Fox Mulder) at least.

In a clip “The Late Late Show with James Corden” posted to YouTube on Monday, the actor addressed some of the more bizarre fan theories that have circulated since the sci-fi drama first hit TV screens back in 1993.

Such as whether Dana Scully (played by Gillian Anderson) was actually immortal, or if aliens influenced the lead actors’ fashion choices.
