“Stranger Things” star David Harbour will go to great lengths to please fans.

The actor, who plays police Chief Jim Hopper in Netflix’s sci-fi series, joined a high school student in California for her senior photos last week after her Twitter request went viral.

Now, he’s promised to get ordained to officiate Twitter user @ErickaElizabth’s September nuptials, after her plea was retweeted 125,000 times.

What would it take to get @DavidKHarbour to be the Officiant at my wedding in September?! — Ericka (@ErickaElizabth) January 15, 2018

125k retweets. Provided date works with s3 shooting schedule, I will get ordained and perform ceremony. I get to read an esteemed love letter of my choosing, and after the cake is officially cut, I get the very first piece. #allthecakes https://t.co/rSku8qD7uT — David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) January 17, 2018

Harbour did add a few caveats to his involvement in the ceremony, however. Mainly, the date has to fit with his shooting schedule for the third season of “Stranger Things.”

And he has to be handed the very first piece of wedding cake.

Harbour’s post reached the 125,000 mark late Wednesday, and he immediately reached out to @ErickaElizabth to “get the ball rolling.”

Dammit. Not even 24hours. You’re kidding me. @ErickaElizabth DM me please to get the ball rolling. I’m making it seriously hard next time, internet, this is not over between us... https://t.co/Ht0kDCl5hz — David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) January 18, 2018

“I’m making it seriously hard next time, internet, this is not over between us,” he added. For reference, here’s how Harbour’s previous promise to a fan on Twitter turned out:

Could the newlyweds begin their married life with the Hopper dance?
