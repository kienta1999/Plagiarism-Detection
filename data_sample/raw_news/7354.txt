There’s no party like a Latino “Party of Five.”

The hit ’90s family drama is officially being rebooted with a Latino cast and a timely focus on immigration. Freeform has given the series a put pilot commitment, trade publications reported Thursday.

The original series followed five siblings who had to take care of each other after their parents died in a car accident. The remake will feature five children from a Mexican-American family whose parents are deported from the U.S.
