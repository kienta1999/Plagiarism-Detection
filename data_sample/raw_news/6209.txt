Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and another man were struck and killed on the side of an Indiana interstate highway early Sunday by a suspected drunk driver, police said.

Jackson, 26, had been traveling on Interstate 70 in an Uber about 4 a.m. when he suddenly felt ‚Äúill,‚Äù Indiana State Police said. His driver, Jeffrey Monroe, 54, pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, and both men stepped out, investigators said.

A pickup driven by Alex Cabrera Gonsales, 37, swerved onto the shoulder and plowed into both men, killing both, police said. Gonsales tried to flee the crash on foot, but didn‚Äôt get far before police captured him.

Police said they suspect Gonsales was intoxicated and was driving without a license.
