While the National Rifle Association continues to resist gun reform in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, Samantha Bee figured it was time for a little outreach.

In a mock PSA on “Full Frontal” Wednesday, the host offered an intriguing proposition for members of the gun group: join Scientology instead!

The comedian promised followers that they could blow away enemies with their brain instead of a rifle, but added a word of warning:

“Is Scientology safe?” she asked. “Of course not! It’s bonkers. But it’s like safer for the rest of us.”
