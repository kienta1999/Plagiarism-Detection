Sandwiched between the classic looks of the Golden Globes and SAG Awards and the elegant fashion we expect to see at the Oscars, the style of the Grammys allows celebrities to let loose on the red carpet.

Singer Joy Villas ― who drew attention with a Donald Trump-themed outfit last year ― wore another controversial political dress, this year choosing to take on abortion rights activists with a dress portraying a fetus and a purse that said “Choose Life.”
