Donald Trump was so excited to welcome the first lady home from the hospital that he misspelled his own wife’s name in a tweet Saturday.

And Twitter couldn’t be happier.

Trump referred to his wife as “Melanie” instead of Melania, as in “Melanie is doing and feeling really well” after treatment for a kidney condition. It was quickly corrected to Melania, but Twitterdom roared. (The first lady’s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Melania was resting comfortably back home and in high spirits.)

“Melanie” quickly trended on Twitter. Most of the responses were on the order of “please tell us about this ’Melanie,‘” with others wondering if “she” had contacted Stormy Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti.

Donald Trump has had so many mistresses he can’t even remember his own wife’s name anymore. It’s not Melanie, you Dotard! — Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) May 19, 2018

I know Donald Trump is trying to upstage the Royal Wedding, but I think it’s rude that he got married to “Melanie” just five days after Melania vanished. — Palmer Report (@PalmerReport) May 19, 2018
