‘THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF TRUMP’S STATE OF THE UNION IS WHAT HE DIDN’T SAY’ Here’s how the president presented immigration as a violent threat. While Trump talked about a large number of natural disasters ― even acknowledging Puerto Rico hurricane victims ― he did not mention climate change. Sen. Bernie Sanders was the only politician to mention that in his recorded response. Critics pointed out Trump only spent 49 seconds on the opioid crisis, which is killing 64,000 Americans a year. And Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) denounced Trump for “turning American life into a zero-sum game” in the official Democratic response. [HuffPost] [Tweet | Share on Facebook]
