That thing that much of America is anxiously waiting for is finally happening.

No, Robert Mueller hasn’t pointed at President Donald Trump and yelled, “He did it!” Yet. But after much anticipation, Hulu will add “National Lampoon’s Dorm Daze 2: College @ Sea” this month. If you don’t have a subscription, this would be the time to get one.

But if that title somehow doesn’t interest you, Hulu also adds many other movies and shows this month. Maybe “Earth Girls Are Easy,” starring Jim Carrey, Jeff Goldblum and Damon Wayans as truly insane-looking aliens, is more your thing.

Or maybe you’d rather just watch a classic like “Dirty Dancing.” Hulu has you covered this month regardless.

A few highlights:

Movies: “Dirty Dancing,” “Power Rangers,” “The Square,” “Young Adult” and many James Bond movies.

Shows: “American Idol” (Series Premiere), “American Ninja Warrior” (Season 9 Premiere), “Angie Tribeca” (Season 3) and “Roseanne” (Series Premiere).

A complete list of shows and movies below:
