Four people were injured on Tuesday when a woman entered YouTube’s headquarters in San Bruno, California, and opened fire.

During the incident, authorities ordered a lockdown at Walmart’s eCommerce in the next building and told workers to keep away from the windows, CNET reported.

After receiving the all-clear, the Walmart employees returned to those same windows ― not to gawk, but to send a message to any neighbors who might still be in the YouTube building:
