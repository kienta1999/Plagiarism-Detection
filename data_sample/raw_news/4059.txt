TONIGHT: Tom Brady doesn't usually drink beer, but when he does... pic.twitter.com/xGWdnlhJOR — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) March 13, 2018

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady says he’s not much of a beer drinker anymore.

“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert challenged him on Monday night, and Brady showed he’s as good with a mug as he is with a football.
