We all love a good travel deal, so avoid these two days.

There are two days of the year that are the absolute most expensive days of the year, according to the CEO of FareCompare ― November 22nd and November 26th. Understandably, that’s the Wednesday before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

If that’s not bad enough, these expensive flying days get pricier by the day to the tune of 50 to 75 cents a day ― that’s $1.50 more in September and $2.50 more by October.

As much as you may not want to, you better hurry to book your trip to visit your in-laws now, as procrastinators can pay an extra $200 or more for their trip! Yikes!
