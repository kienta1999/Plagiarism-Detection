Last week, between her back-to-back blowout performances at Coachella, Beyoncé announced that her BeyGOOD initiative would be giving $25,000 each to four historically black colleges and universities for the 2018-2019 academic year. Her historic headlining performance on April 14 was the “impetus to mark” the new scholarship program, according to the announcement.

Google then stepped in to match Beyoncé’s $100,000 grant and enable students at four additional HBCUs to receive $25,000 scholarships.

BeyGOOD’s scholarship funds are going to Xavier University of Louisiana, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University and Bethune-Cookman University. The Google-enabled scholarships will help Texas Southern University, Fisk University, Grambling State University and Morehouse College.
