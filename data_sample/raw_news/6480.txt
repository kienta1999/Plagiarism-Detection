Even the master of horror needs a laugh every now and then.

Author Stephen King took to Twitter on Wednesday to tell his fans he was feeling down and wanted to hear a joke:

Having kind of a blue day, Twitter, so tell me a joke. I'll re-tweet the first one that makes me laugh. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 31, 2018

The 7,000+ responses could’ve filled the pages of one of King’s books, but at first he didn’t get the laugh he was looking for:

Heisenberg & Schroedinger get pulled over for speeding.



The cop says “do you know how fast you were going?”



Heisenberg says “no but I know where I am.”



Cop says “did you know there’s a dead cat in your trunk?”



Schroedinger says, “I do now, asshole.” — Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) January 31, 2018

Sorry, but I only chuckled. Faintly. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 31, 2018

It took more than an hour, but eventually, King got his laugh.

Here’s the crack that tickled his funny bone:

How do you make a duck sing? Put it in the sun 'till it's Bill Withers — Lucy Gumble (@LucyRandallGum) January 31, 2018

Okay, winner winner chicken dinner. I didn't get it. Then I did. Then...ROFL https://t.co/Q5xDk7SE5H — Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 31, 2018

Of course, once you start laughing, it can be hard to stop.

“Now I’m laughing at all of them,” King wrote, sharing these:

Sorry you're having a blue day, Stephen. Here's a joke your fellow American author Tom Barbash told me. It's only a little risqué...
