Jimmy Kimmel marked President Donald Trump’s 2,000th lie in office on Wednesday night.

After The Washington Post highlighted Trump’s major milestone earlier in the day, the late-night host observed the occasion with the release of his spoof mini-documentary entitled “Pants Of Fire: The Road To 2,000 Lies.”

“His place in the fake history books is forever secure thanks to his total lack of shame,” the voiceover says of the president.
