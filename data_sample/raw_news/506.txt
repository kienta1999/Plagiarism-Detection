The nominations for the 2018 BET Awards have rolled in and DJ Khaled is leading the pack.

Scoring six nominations, including for album of the year, video of the year and best male hip-hop artist, Khaled is followed by Pulitzer Prize winner Kendrick Lamar, who received five nominations.

Also notable are Migos and SZA, with four nominations each. SZA was nominated for five Grammy Awards earlier this year, but was snubbed in all categories. Hopefully, the critically acclaimed “Love Galore” singer will be honored this time around.

Unsurprisingly, actors and actresses from the smash hit “Black Panther” dominate the acting categories, with Lupita Nyong’o, Letitia Wright, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya and Sterling K. Brown all receiving nods.
