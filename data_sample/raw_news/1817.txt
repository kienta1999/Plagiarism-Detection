Chrissy Teigen was following the royal baby news closely on Monday morning when she noticed something “weird” ― that Kensington Palace had tweeted out that the Duchess of Cambridge was in labor at a London hospital.

Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London earlier this morning in the early stages of labour.

Once the palace tweeted the news, news outlets quickly picked it up and prepared for the arrival of her third royal baby with the Duke of Cambridge.

Teigen, of course, perfectly encapsulated just how odd it was that the whole world was on “vagina watch,” as she called it.

“Guys. It is time. For. VAGINA WATCH, 2018 (how WEIRD would this be???)” she wrote.

Twitter

Kensington Palace made the same announcements for the former Kate Middleton’s previous two pregnancies ― tweeting out when she was in labor and again when she’d given birth to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

Here is the tweet from George’s birth in 2013:

And the one for Charlotte’s birth in 2015:

The third royal baby was born Monday morning and weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. According to the Palace, “Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well.”
