The White House is yet again facing fierce criticism over the lack of diversity of the participants in its intern program.

A photograph released Friday shows President Donald Trump posing with the spring intake, who are overwhelmingly white:

“The White House intern photo is like a Where’s Waldo for a non-white person — in a country that is about 40% non-white,” tweeted political scientist and Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas.

“Diversity this ain’t,” added France 24 correspondent Philip Crowther.

Other tweeters shared similarly biting comments:

Other commenters compared the current intake to those from former President Barack Obama’s time in office:

Trump’s White House faced similar accusations over the program last summer when people noticed how photographs of Vice President Mike Pence posing with interns featured very few people of color.
