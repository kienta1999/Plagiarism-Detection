“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” got the inside scoop on President Donald Trump’s (spoof) Twitter beef with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday night.

In honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, host Jimmy Kimmel sent a camera crew to ask people to take sides in the feud (which of course wasn’t real, due to Dr. King’s death in 1968).
