“His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,” Bornstein’s December 2015 letter read. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”

Trump’s speech on Friday at the National Rifle Association’s Annual Meetings was also chock-full of fibs. Among them was the claim that 98 percent of mass shootings occur in gun-free zones ― a figure stemming from a highly misleading study from a gun rights advocate. Earlier on Friday he also erroneously stated that special counsel Robert Mueller served under President Barack Obama for eight years (it was four).

These frequent contradictions make it hard to take any of Trump’s claims seriously, including his outrage this week that a list of questions Mueller plans to ask him were leaked to the press.

Multiple sources told The Washington Post that it was Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, who compiled the questions after talking with Mueller’s team.
