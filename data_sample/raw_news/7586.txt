A section of the mezzanine floor overlooking the main lobby of the Indonesia Stock Exchange in Jakarta collapsed on Monday, injuring at least 77 people.

According to Reuters, around a dozen people had been carried from the building on stretchers. Indonesian news outlet MetroTV reported that 15 ambulances were dispatched to the scene.

“The second floor of the building has collapsed,” said Vindy, a personal assistant to the exchange’s President Director Tito Sulistio, per Reuters.

Photos and video posted on social media revealed extensive damage to floors and walls at the exchange, with debris strewn throughout the building. Dozens of people were reportedly evacuated.

Journalist Adam Harvey, the southeast Asia correspondent with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, posted photos of people crowding around what appeared to be a large hole in the floor. He reported that a worker in the building had heard a loud “thud” before being evacuated.

One man purportedly at the scene posted several photos and videos to Twitter that showed extensive internal damage to the building:

Another witness posted a photo of a cordon outside the building, with many people milling about and a corridor blocked by debris.

Argo Yuwono, a Jakarta police spokesman, said most of the injured were college students who were visiting the building when the incident occurred, AP reported.

The building is part of a two-tower complex that Islamist militants targeted with a suicide bombing in September 2000. However, police have ruled out a bomb as the cause of Monday’s collapse, Reuters reported.
