Stephen Colbert has connected the dots on the relationship between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and President Donald Trump.

Colbert noted that the pair met last week to talk about the budget over one of Trump’s favorite meals: cheeseburgers.

“That’s smart,” Colbert cracked. “Get him all burgered up first.”

But if the two shared burgers, that could mean they shared something else as well.
