This “Stranger Things” fan will forever treasure her high school senior photos.

In October, California student Damaris Fregoso cheekily asked actor David Harbour ― aka police chief Jim Hopper in Netflix’s sci-fi horror ― how many retweets she’d require for him to take part in the shoot:

.@DavidKHarbour how many retweets for you take my senior photos with me — damaris ◟̽◞̽ (@postydamaris) October 29, 2017

Harbour spotted the 17-year-old’s tweet and replied, but with some cheeky conditions of his own attached:

25k. And I get to wear the school sweatshirt and hold a trombone. https://t.co/xPNEE681J4 — David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) October 29, 2017

“The idea of me in a small size sweatshirt of some high school, holding a trombone with this poor girl trying to take her high school photos seriously, I just thought that was so funny,” Harbour later told ThisIsInsider.com about why he replied.

The post soon garnered thousands of likes, with Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers in the show) giving Fregoso’s cause a helping hand:

Fregoso, who attends Orestimba High School in Newman, soon hit her hoped-for tally ― and Harbour vowed to fulfill his promise:

Holy hell, internet. How can you be in favor of this? Friends don’t lie. @posttdamaris DM me... https://t.co/xPNEE681J4 — David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) October 30, 2017

Three months after Fregoso’s initial tweet, Harbour made her dream come true when the pair posed for the snaps at Netflix’s Los Angeles’ HQ earlier this week.

Harbour shared the photos, in which he’s playing a trombone and wearing an Orestimba High School sweatshirt (as per his conditions), to Instagram on Friday:

“Voted most likely to hijack someone’s high school senior photos 24 years later,” Harbour wrote. Fregoso also shared some of the images on Twitter:

“Well this is certainly something I didn’t think would actually happen!” Fregoso wrote in a subsequent Instagram post. “David is such a sweet dude!”

Photographer Tommy Garcia said he enjoyed taking the pictures:

I don’t always take senoir portraits, but when I do, it’s because @postydamaris gets 25k+ retweets and @DavidKHarbour agrees to take them with her as long as he is allowed to hold a trombone. 😂 pic.twitter.com/XTmYjrvm9r — Tommy Garcia (@iamtommyg) January 12, 2018

Damaris’ school, meanwhile, appeared proud of its student:

The shoot also went down well on Twitter:

Damaris later thanked everyone who retweeted her original post:

It's still hard to believe that I met him, but I thank you, for the continuous love and support on all my social medias! y'all are too sweet! much love xoxo — damaris ◟̽◞̽ (@postydamaris) January 13, 2018
