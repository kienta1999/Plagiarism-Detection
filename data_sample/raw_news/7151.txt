A Philadelphia Eagles fan on Sunday went viral in the worst way on the night his team advanced to the Super Bowl.

As passengers watched from inside a subway car, the man ran on the platform to keep up and plowed into a pole, video posted on Twitter showed.

At least he presumably got to enjoy his teamâ€™s 38-7 home victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game.

Transit police said the unidentified man, who was showing off for passengers in advance of the game, got up after his smackdown, high-fived other travelers and boarded the next train, a SEPTA rep told HuffPost on Monday.
