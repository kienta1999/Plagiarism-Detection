“Be careful, because Muslims are waiting to rape you,” one of the children can be heard telling the others in the video.

The children can then be seen climbing on the mosque’s funeral van while one of the women warns them about the “dead Muslims” and “sex goats” that she claims were stored in the truck.

The brazen theft of the flyers, coupled with the racist disinformation that the young children in the video could be heard repeating, has alarmed the Muslim community in Arizona ― though it does not come as a shock. Islamophobia and aggression against mosques are at an all-time high in the United States.
