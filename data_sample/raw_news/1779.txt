“SNL” creator Lorne Michaels’ Broadway Video Entertainment company will help develop the production, with Andrew Singer as executive producer. Other executive producers include Elizabeth Banks, who originally optioned West’s memoir for TV in 2016, and Max Handelman’s Brownstone Productions.

Hulu described the production to The Hollywood Reporter as “the story of a fat young woman who wants to change her life, but not her body.”

Bryant and West’s supporters on social media are already buzzing about the news:

I just cancelled Hulu but it looks like I need to subscribe again to watch "Shrill." So excited for Lindy West, who totally deserves every great thing that happens to her and more. https://t.co/vXivkiyL1O — Ellen K. Pao (@ekp) April 24, 2018

SO PROUD OF MY SISTER IN LAWhttps://t.co/ySLBdS6HvU — Ijeoma Oluo (@IjeomaOluo) April 24, 2018

Bryant recently told New York magazine’s The Cut that she’s extremely selective about the projects she participates in, so her starring role in West’s memoir adaptation is notable.
