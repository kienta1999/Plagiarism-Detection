Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, executive director of Sri Lankan LGBT organisation Equal Ground, said the speech “paves the way for making some positive change for the LGBT communities of the Commonwealth”, nations home to about 2.4 billion people.

“I welcome this acknowledgement of the deep wounds left in our countries by bad colonial laws, wounds from which many of us are still bleeding today,” Malaysian activist Pang Khee Teik told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“It’s time to listen, learn, and heal.”

Some activists, however, did not think May’s comments would lead to permanent change even though she said Britain would support any country wanting reform.

“I am all to aware that these laws were often put in place by my own country, They were wrong then and they are wrong now,” May said.

Founder of NAZ Male Health Alliance in Pakistan, Qasim Iqbal, said May needed to create a policy on how the British government would help end discrimination.

“The prime minister needs to now present an advocacy framework on what role the UK government will play in ensuring that the entire Commonwealth is a place where people have the freedom to love a person of their choice,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
