Not only did the multi-talented star and creator of “Atlanta,” Donald Glover, host “Saturday Night Live,” but he also debuted powerful new Childish Gambino music on the program.

A number of elements in the performance echoed those in the official video for “This Is America” — which dropped on YouTube shortly before the “SNL” performance. Check it out below, but be warned: It involves two violent, disturbing scenes.

It’s the first new music Glover has released as Childish Gambino since his Grammy-nominated album “Awaken, My Love!” in 2016.

He was introduced on “SNL” by “Black Panther” and “Get Out” star Daniel Kaluuya for “This is America.”

The shirtless Glover was highlighted by laser beams as children in school uniforms danced. “Don’t catch you slippin’ now. Look at how I’m livin’ now. Police be trippin’ now,” he sang.

He debuted another new track titled “Saturday” for the first set of “SNL” and was introduced then by Zoe Kravitz.
