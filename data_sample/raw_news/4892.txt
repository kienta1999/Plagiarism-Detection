Fox News host Sean Hannity tried to play art critic on Twitter Monday night.

It didn’t go well.

Hannity shared a video of right-wing artist Jon McNaughton, who has painted things like Jesus holding the Constitution, creating his latest work. The piece features a stadium full of people watching President Donald Trump pick up a tattered American flag and appears to reference last season’s NFL protests against police brutality and racism.

“He holds it up to his chest and attempts to clean it with a rag,” explained McNaughton in the video. “And he says, ‘What are you doing?’”

Here’s Hannity’s tweet:

The “left” loves art, and especially taxpayer funded art that is “provocative”. Let’s get their reaction to this. https://t.co/WAVFB1Uqbx. — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 27, 2018

Here are some of the responses he requested:

This is literally the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Thank you for sharing. — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) February 27, 2018

The lips of the artist say, "What are you doing?"

The eyes of his subject say, "Where am I? What's happening?" — Chris Galford (@Aurinth) February 27, 2018

You're hyping the equivalent of collecting clown paintings for guys who get misty-eyed at Shelby Foote interviews. — ee ramone (@bizmarkiedesade) February 27, 2018

He looks disoriented, scared and possibly like he’s had a stroke. This artist is a genius who has captured the true essence of Trump — Neville (@1FightingIrish) February 27, 2018

He’s holding a flag that is in tatters, symbolizing what he and his crew are doing to the country. Art interpretation is fun. — John H (@onomatotwittah) February 27, 2018

a flag in that condition should be burned, and it's a really poor likeness of Trump. the skin tone is all wrong--it actually looks like skin https://t.co/Lvb0fZ8z1M — Peter Bright 👨‍⚕️🍕 (@DrPizza) February 27, 2018
