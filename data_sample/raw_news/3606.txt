The stars of “Stranger Things” just took a kid’s lonely birthday party to another dimension.

No classmates showed up to Aaron Alambat’s “Stranger Things”-themed bash in California ― complete with the wall of lights through which Joyce communicates with her missing son, Will, and a punch called “Demogorgon blood.”

So Aaron’s sister, Ayen Alambat, vented on the internet.

Cast members got wind of the party and sent messages of support on Tuesday. “Next year I would like an invite,” wrote Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven.

What!!!! Oh Well You can let them all know that everyone on behalf on Stranger things would’ve come! I think your awesome and next year I would like an invite... Please? 😘😘😘 https://t.co/gNir0sMpsm — Millie Bobby Brown (@milliebbrown) March 20, 2018

Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) chimed in that he could be counted on to provide dessert for the occasion.
