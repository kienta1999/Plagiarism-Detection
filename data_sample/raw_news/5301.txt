“Black Panther” star Michael B. Jordan almost wishes that the Marvel film didn’t have as much hype as it got before its release this past weekend.

The actor, who plays Erik Killmonger in the record-breaking film, spoke to AOL Entertainment over the phone the day before “Black Panther” was released in theaters and discussed how hype can occasionally backfire.

“There’s so much hype and I would almost rather it fly under the radar, have people not hype it up at all and we just blow people away,” Jordan explained. “With there being so much hype, people want to find reasons to try to pick at it. That’s what it is with anything. For me, there’s so much going on in this movie ― in the best way possible ― with so many different themes and a lot of different points of view.”

The 31-year-old star added that, regardless of the hype, he just wants “people to take away a sense of pride about where they come from” after seeing the movie.

Jordan likened the night before “Black Panther’s” release to “the night before the first day of school,” noting that he was tired of having to keep so many secrets about Marvel’s latest.

In the lead-up to the premiere of “Black Panther,” the actor and his production studio, Outlier Society, teamed up with Brisk’s Creators Class initiative to encourage and assist young artists.

“Their mission coincided with what my production company Outliers Society’s mission is,” he told us of the collaboration. “People often see the finished result, but they don’t know the journey or what it actually took to get to the finish line. The hours, the blood sweat and tears the failures it took.”

To convey that idea, Jordan directed a 30-second spot called “Hidden Hustle” that puts a spotlight on his own creative process of getting into character for “Black Panther.”
