“Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Kylie wrote in her Sunday announcement. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”

In addition to her message, Jenner posted a sweet, 11-minute video, called “To Our Daughter,” that shared moments from the past nine months.

There were a few butterfly references in the video (Jenner wears a butterfly chain and there were butterflies on what looked like the walls of the nursery). Many fans speculated that Kylie would name her daughter Butterfly, Mariposa (which means “butterfly” in Spanish) or Monarch, after Scott’s song “Butterfly Effect.”

Jenner and Scott also have matching butterfly tattoos.
