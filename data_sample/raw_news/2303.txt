West London police tweeted that they “disrupted an unlicensed music event” in the town of Hounslow ― and it turns out it was a rave organized in the abandoned husk of a Toys R Us store.

The department even made a fun graphic about the March 31 bust ― at least it has a sense of humor about it.

Police said they made five arrests and even seized the sound system. No word yet if that sound system was just a Teddy Ruxpin reading everyone stories by glow stick.

Police later warned other ravers via Twitter not to show up because everyone would be turned away.
