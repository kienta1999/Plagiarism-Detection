Rudy Giuliani’s confusing media appearances over the past week, in which his attempts to defend President Donald Trump backfired, have some wondering what happened to the once-respected former mayor of New York City.

John Oliver revealed the answer on “Last Week Tonight” on Sunday.

“Nothing,” he explained. “He was always this awful.”

Then, Oliver took a look back at the lowlights of Giuliani’s career before concluding that the former mayor and current president were basically ”two versions of the same person.”
