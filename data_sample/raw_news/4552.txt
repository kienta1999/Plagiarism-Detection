Hey, wine not?

Jennifer Lawrence was caught climbing over seats at the Dolby Theatre during the Oscars on Sunday night. The best part?

She did it in a gown and heels with a full glass of vino in tow.

The notoriously clumsy actress has a history of tripping and falling in public but seemed to successfully pull off the stunt.

Perhaps her success in not completely biting it was due in part to a lack of nerves.

The 27-year-old actress was not nominated for an award this year and appeared to be letting her hair down.

For instance, she was spotted being a straight-up goof on the red carpet.

She also chatted up actress Salma Hayek and fellow previous Oscar winner Meryl Steep.
