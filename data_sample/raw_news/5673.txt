“Are you ready to learn how to publish THE article of all articles?”



The other magazines looked around at each other. The room was silent other than a few nervous gulps. But, finally the silence broke, and they all spoke in unison.



“Yes GQ.” https://t.co/VWxpnhhu0K — g i n a 🍑 (@shadesoftimmyt) February 14, 2018

Chalamet’s interview with the magazine, written by Daniel Riley, discusses how he came up in the acting world, scoring roles in two of the hottest films of 2017 (“Call Me by Your Name” and “Lady Bird”), and reveals an adorable interaction with his grandmother. Riley describes the 22-year-old as “brimming” with “exuberance that’s reined in by a sober conscientiousness.”

GQ’s article also includes this lovely image of Chalamet offered by “Lady Bird” writer-director Greta Gerwig: “He’s Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio. A heartthrob but with thoroughbred acting chops. Everyone else will be amazed by what he grows into, but I won’t — I’ve always known that he’s a unicorn.”
