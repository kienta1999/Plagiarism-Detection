“What just occurred in the courtroom was scary and caused a level of discomfort. I’m sorry that happened,” she said.

“I know it is hard but I need to ask all of you to try and not react in any physical way. It is not appropriate, it does not send the right message,” Cunningham continued. “It actually just causes more pain and more discomfort and certainly we have enough of that in this courtroom as a result of the defendant’s actions.”

Later in the day, Cunningham said there was “no way” she would hold Margraves in contempt of court. The father of three apologized in a statement to the court, telling Cunningham that today was the first time he had heard his daughters’ impact statements.

“I lost control and I apologize a hundred times. … I’m embarrassed,” he said. “I’m not here to upstage my daughters, I’m here to help them heal.”
