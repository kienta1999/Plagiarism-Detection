Jimmy Kimmel thinks he knows how a porno video starring President Donald Trump would go down.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the comedian claimed to have obtained footage of Trump’s encounter with former adult actress Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels), with whom the president allegedly had “textbook generic” sex in 2006.

The spoof clip ends, of course, with Trump declaring it to be “far and away the greatest sex you’ve ever had.”

You be the judge.
