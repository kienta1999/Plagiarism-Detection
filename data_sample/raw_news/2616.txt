A private trip to Dubai by President Donald Trump’s sons has so far cost U.S. taxpayers at least $73,000, CBS News reports.

The money covered expenses incurred by members of a Secret Service detail for hotel rooms and car service during the trip from March 26 to April 8, according to purchase orders viewed by CBS.

The trip had nothing to do with government business. Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric met with “the team at Trump International Golf Club, Dubai,” a representative told CBS in a statement.

The brothers also spent time with Trump Organization business partner Hussain Sajwani and his family — and attended the wedding of Sajwani’s daughter, Amira, according to a tweet from the father of the bride. He called the Trumps “dear friends and business partners.” Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan, the deputy ruler of Dubai, also attended the wedding.

Eric Trump’s wife, Lara Trump, also posted a picture of herself at the wedding on her Instagram account.

The Secret Service confirmed to CBS that it was conducting a ”protective operation” in the United Arab Emirates, but would offer no other details.

President Trump has retained his ownership of the Trump Organization but announced after being elected president that he would hand over day-to-day operations to his two sons. He also said his company would not be involved in any new overseas developments while he was president. A second Trump-branded golf course in Dubai is now being developed on Damac property. The Trump Organization also last year announced the development of luxury villas near Trump’s current golf club in Dubai.
