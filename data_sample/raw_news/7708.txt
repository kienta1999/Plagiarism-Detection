Miley Cyrus is VERY excited about boyfriend Liam Hemsworth’s 28 birthday on Saturday.

So much so that she wished him a VERY happy birthday a day early.

On Friday, the “Malibu” singer posted a sweet Instagram story for her beau, accompanied by some VERY cute couple photos.

“Today is very special,” she wrote. “Because it’s someone VERY special’s birthday.”

It seems like the couple is VERY into extending their birthdays.

Hemsworth also wished Cyrus a VERY happy birthday the day before her 25 in November by giving her a personalized necklace.
