From the moment we meet him in “Black Panther” ogling ancient African artifacts at a British museum, one thing stands out about Michael B. Jordan‘s Erik Killmonger: his hair.

And Jordan thinks the distinctive style — shaved on both sides with a crop of dreadlocks drifting down on the right — is a look that could catch on in the culture after the success of the new box-office behemoth.

“I think it might set a little a bit of a trend,” the “Friday Night Lights” and “Creed” alum told Yahoo Entertainment (watch above). “I could see that.”

And that was exactly the goal. Jordan said he and director Ryan Coogler set out to craft a look that could potentially be adapted by “Panther” fans.

“He’s from Oakland, and I’m from Newark, New Jersey, and I used to have ’locs,” Jordan said. “So we were trying to figure out what that hairstyle would look like if it evolved. Something that was trendy that dudes would wanna rock once the movie came out. So we’ll see.”

For the record, there are already Reddit threads dedicated to that very thing.

“Black Panther” is now playing.
