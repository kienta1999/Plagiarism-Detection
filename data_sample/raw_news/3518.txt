Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool is great entertainment, pure and simple. We would watch this character narrate paint drying. Maybe for the next trailer.

The newest “Deadpool 2” preview dropped Thursday. It introduces the audience to X-Force, the mutant superhero team that first appeared in the comics back in 1991. Of course, also included are Deadpool’s usual vulgar cracks blasting through that fourth wall.
