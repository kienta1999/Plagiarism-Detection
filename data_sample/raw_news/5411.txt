Melania Trump promoted Random Acts Of Kindness Day on Twitter on Saturday, but it didn’t spark the reaction she was likely hoping for.

The first lady encouraged her 9.8 million followers to embrace the annual Feb. 17 celebration of compassion by testing “the power of kindness.”

I encourage everyone to test the power of kindness on #RandomActsofKindnessDay. It’s an opportunity to teach our children the importance of taking care of one another. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) February 17, 2018

“It’s an opportunity to teach our children the importance of taking care of one another,” she wrote.

Some people reacted positively, but the majority of respondents hit back by suggesting she give the same message to her husband, President Donald Trump. A sampling of the replies are below:

Tell your husband. — jordan (@JordanUhl) February 17, 2018

Don’t tell us, tell Donald, who would rather insult people than help — Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) February 17, 2018

Just encourage your husband and we will be alright. — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 17, 2018

You must be joking about this, how about you start your anti-bullying campaign? And I know just the place to start...can you guess? Here is a little hint:🍊🤡 — Erica J. Simpson 🌊 🇺🇸 (@Simpsioni) February 18, 2018

Start with teaching your husband to give up his NRA money and start doing something about gun control. That would be a kindness for our kids. — Marjie Cunningham (@missmarjiec) February 17, 2018

Can you take the phone away from your husband so he can’t Tweet hateful BS? Thx! — Linda Childers (@lindachilders1) February 17, 2018

This is a joke right? — JeanieB (@Jeaniebonotex) February 18, 2018
