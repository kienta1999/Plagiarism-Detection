Jennifer Garner’s clap-and-halt at the Oscars on Sunday remains shrouded in mystery ― and memes.

The actress was shown in the audience applauding. Then, suddenly she stopped, and a panicked look took over her face. Or was it confusion?

The internet wanted to know what came over her.

There were at least two chicken jokes, too. That alone should vault the “Dallas Buyers Club” star into Academy Awards meme history.
