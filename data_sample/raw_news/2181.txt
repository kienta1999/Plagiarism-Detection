Chris Mosier has made his fifth national duathlon team. He finished sixth in his men’s 35-39 age group at the Draft-Legal Sprint Duathlon National Championship in Greenville, S.C., on April 7, securing his place in the 2019 World Championship in Pontevedra, Spain.

Overall Mosier finished 47th out of 305 racers, beating 84% of all of the entrants across age and gender. He competes in the men’s 35-39 category.

“I set a personal record for the distance and for the 5k run,” Mosier told Outsports. “I was hoping to place higher in the standings, but it was truly the best of the best out there this weekend, and I couldn’t be happier with my performance.

“I really feel like my best racing days are ahead of me.”

Mosier has been turning expectations of transgender athletes upside down over the last few years. While so much attention is paid to perceived “advantages” of trans women in sports, Mosier is showing that trans men can compete against cisgender men on national and world stages and perform incredibly well.

He was Outsports’ 2016 Person of the Year.
