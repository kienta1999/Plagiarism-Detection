Donald Trump got a head start on his weekend tweets Friday night when — again — he called the investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and his campaign a “witch hunt.” This time, though, he said special counsel Robert Mueller should never have been appointed.

The comments again raised the possibility that Trump might be considering firing Mueller.

This time, he called concerns about collusion a “big Hoax by the Democrats.”

House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt! — Donald J.

The Republicans issued their conclusion just hours before NBC aired an interview with Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya in which she said she is a Kremlin “informant.” Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner at Trump Tower in Manhattan during the presidential campaign just months before the election to discuss turning over damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

The Twitterverse wasn’t impressed by the House Republicans — or Trump’s tweet:

So the House Intell Committee concludes no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Hmmm... I’m no Congressman but I think the evidence tells a different story. I think I’ll hold judgment until the Mueller investigation has concluded. Good luck Donald Trump. — John Carrell (@JohnCarrell16) April 28, 2018
