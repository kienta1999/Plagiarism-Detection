“Ladies, chances are your assailant is gonna be bigger, stronger and faster and that’s why you have @alexoathletica for your gun, your mace, or even your phone,” Lahren wrote in the caption.

Lahren has previously caught heat for blaming liberals for the Tide Pod Challenge, bashing Beyoncé and sharing a manipulated image of former NFL star Colin Kaepernick.

Now she’s embroiled in controversy for her yoga pants post, dated the day before the student-organized “March For Our Lives” protest against gun violence:
