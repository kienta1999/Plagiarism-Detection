Colin Jost and I wrote Lobster Diner in 2010. Simon Rich, Marika Sawyer and I wrote Switcheroo in 2009. Neither went past the table. Both made it to air tonight. (As did our 2012 writers wrap gift: the ITS NOT ROCKET PROBLEMS shirt.) Thanks to my family at @nbcsnl for letting us bring back those beloved orphans.
