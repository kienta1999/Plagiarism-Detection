Vicente Fox suggested Friday that this week’s deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, was a byproduct of the kind of racism spouted by President Donald Trump.

On “Real Time with Bill Maher,” Mexico’s former president said the “very sad event” in Florida was “what you get” when “you speak out of the White House this aggressive, violent language, when you discriminate, when you’re a racist.”

Fox then highlighted the need for more “harmony,” “love” and “happy communities.”

“And those concepts don’t come out of his [Trump’s] mouth,” Fox added.
