Happy Super Bowl Sunday Janet Jackson Appreciation Day!

Fans of the legendary pop diva flooded Twitter with messages of love and support for Jackson, whose third studio album, ‚ÄúControl,‚Äù dropped 32 years ago on Sunday.

‚ÄúA Queen. An Icon. Black History. Black Present. Black Future,‚Äù tweeted journalist and activist George M. Johnson.

Happy #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay

Justin Timberlake still aint sh**

The Super Bowl and JT owe The Icon an apology.

That's the end of my thread! The legend. The Stats. The Queen.

Filmmaker and former NFL player Matthew A. Cherry initially proposed the hashtag tribute to Jackson on Friday. It quickly gained the support of thousands of fans, including her nephew Taj Jackson. By Sunday afternoon, Cherry‚Äôs original #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay tweet had over 7,000 likes.

Appreciate the love for #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay today. Let's see if @rockhall is watching and listening. @JanetJackson is way overdue to be in the Hall of Fame among her peers. She wasn't even nominated this year. Spread this if you agree. pic.twitter.com/RSJ3m9rJD7 ‚Äî Taj Jackson (@tajjackson3) February 4, 2018

Cherry intentionally planned for the unofficial celebration to occur on the same day Jackson‚Äôs 2004 Super Bowl halftime show co-performer Justin Timberlake would take the stage again ‚Äï this time at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for Super Bowl LII.

Jackson‚Äôs friends and family slammed the NFL for not including her in this year‚Äôs show, despite Timberlake being invited back to perform for a record-breaking third time.

The pair‚Äôs 2004 halftime show famously ended in a ‚Äúwardrobe malfunction,‚Äù in which Timberlake exposed Jackson‚Äôs right nipple on national television after pulling off part of her outfit.

Jackson‚Äôs fans hoped she would make an appearance during this year‚Äôs show, but the five-time Grammy Award-winning icon squashed those rumors herself on Saturday.

Despite her expected absence at this year‚Äôs Super Bowl halftime show, Jackson‚Äôs fans did the best they could to make Sunday about her anyway.

Thousands of Twitter users, including celebrities such as Chance the Rapper and actress Laverne Cox, paid tribute to Jackson‚Äôs incomparable influence on music and culture.

Went to @JanetJackson‚Äôs recent Atlanta concert! Amazing artist. Legendary. Plus, she was so sweet to my mother. That matters to me :-). #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay pic.twitter.com/uGr6x3LZUR ‚Äî Be A King (@BerniceKing) February 4, 2018

#JanetJacksonAppreciationDay is proof that Janet is still relevant. Her media and radio support might've abandoned her, but the fan base has always been here. She is the embodiment of star power and will always be the most beloved female popstar of all time. A legend üòç ‚Äî I'm So Humble (@TheVelvetRoof) February 4, 2018

People talk about Madonna as a huge influence on modern pop singer and forget that Janet Jackson has also had a massive influence on Beyonce, Gaga, and others in the modern generation. #janetjacksonappreciationday ‚Äî Tour√© (@Toure) February 4, 2018

Time for my #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay

All the amazing things she has done (per Billboard). Time to celebrate the ICON!!!



1. She released her self-titled debut album Janet Jackson in 1982, at sixteen years old.



2. She performed on American Bandstand and Soul Train in 1982. pic.twitter.com/pkjEU2vnrz ‚Äî George M Johnson (@IamGMJohnson) February 4, 2018

My very first concert was Janet Jackson‚Äôs All For You tour. I went with my mom. 6th row stage left. I was a very young gay boy who asked my mom to take me and she did. I‚Äôll never forget how great I felt. The memories are some of my most vivid. #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay ‚Äî Phillip Henry (@MajorPhilebrity) February 4, 2018
