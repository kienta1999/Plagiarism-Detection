Jim Carrey is not letting up.

The actor/comedian/artist unveiled a new painting, and this one takes on Scott Pruitt, the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that the agency had approved a pipeline project while Pruitt was renting a room from the wife of a lobbyist representing the pipeline’s owner.

In Carrey’s painting, a pipeline features very prominently:

I looked on Trivago. The cheapest room in Washington is a youth hostel with bunkbeds at $81 a night. The $50 room Scott Pruitt got was a bribe from an energy lobbyist. Need your pipeline approved? Do it through Pruitt! pic.twitter.com/DaSdgvFPmv — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) April 5, 2018

The painting is part of an ongoing series Carrey has been sharing on social media. Earlier this week, he depicted right-wing media figures Sean Hannity and Alex Jones as pro wrestlers:

If u believe wrestling is real u may even believe Fox news, Info Wars and the robotic drones on Sinclair Broadcasting. But wrestling doesn’t harm viewers. Performers like Sean Hannity and Alex Jones should join the WWE where their hyperbole will do less damage to the culture. pic.twitter.com/HHsfvRaToJ — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) April 3, 2018

He’s also taken on President Donald Trump as well as members of his inner circle:

Dear Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery @NPG, I know it’s early but I’d like to submit this as the official portrait of our 45th President, Donald J. Trump. It’s called, 'You Scream. I Scream. Will We Ever Stop Screaming?' pic.twitter.com/LrCmlXXpv7 — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 29, 2018
