At this point in “The Walking Dead” timeline, longtime zombie hunter Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) could probably fire a weapon with his eyes closed, so the question is, uh, did he?

A certain optical mystery involving Carl has been plaguing fans since Season 7. It seems there was a pretty big mistake on the episode “Something They Need,” but we haven’t been able to confirm the truth.

Until now.
