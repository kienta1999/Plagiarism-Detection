White House spokesman Raj Shah dismissed former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman’s recent disparaging comments about President Donald Trump, telling reporters during a Thursday press conference that she was forced out of the role.

“Omarosa was fired three times on ‘The Apprentice,’ and this was the fourth time we let her go,” Shah said, referencing Newman’s previous appearances on the reality show Trump once helmed.

The comment conflicts with Newman’s past claims that she willingly resigned from the role in December.

Earlier Thursday, a clip from an upcoming episode of CBS’ “Celebrity Big Brother,” on which Newman is currently starring, shows the former White House aide saying she was “haunted by tweets” working under Trump and was attacked by other members of his inner circle.

Shah said the White House is not taking her comments seriously.

“She had limited contact with the president while here,” he said. “She has no contact now.”
