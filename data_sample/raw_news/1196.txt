One person is dead and a suspect is in custody after a dispute at a Nashville, Tennessee, mall led to gunfire Thursday, police said.

Officers responded to reports of gunshots fired at Opry Mills Mall on Thursday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department confirmed to HuffPost. The department said one person was shot and later announced the victim had died.

A 22-year-old suspect is in police custody, the department said.

James Chick, 31, and his family were walking around the mall after stopping at Starbucks when they heard what they believed to be gunshots.

“A crowd of people came running,” Chick told HuffPost. “My wife Ashley and I grabbed our two little girls and started running out the nearest exit and straight to our truck. As we drove out of the parking lot, dozens of police vehicles came speeding to the scene.”

The shooting happened just weeks after a gunman stormed a Nashville-area Waffle House, killing four people before being captured by police.
