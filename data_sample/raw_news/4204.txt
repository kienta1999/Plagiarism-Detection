“Paddington 2” may have earned only $40 million at the domestic box office, but with a $218 million global haul — as well as a 100 percent rating (after 191 reviews) on Rotten Tomatoes — it’s clearly one of 2018’s best-received releases. Those who fell in love with the cinematic version of Michael Bond’s iconic bear, however, will soon have their hearts seduced by another furry, pantless CGI creature when Disney’s “Christopher Robin” debuts in theaters in August. And the internet is already taking sides in this cinematic battle, resulting in some adorable ridiculousness.
