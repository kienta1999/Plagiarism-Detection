Fans will have to wait to see Adam Rippon appear regularly on the small screen.

The charismatic figure skater will not be joining NBC as a contributor, the network confirmed to HuffPost, after Rippon clarified the news during a Monday morning interview from Pyeongchang, South Korea.

“I am so flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent,” Rippon said on NBCSN. “But if I took this opportunity, I would have to leave the Olympic team and I would have to leave the [Olympic] Village.”

He continued, “It’s so important to me, you know, I worked so hard to be on this Olympic team, and my teammates and my friends were there for me during my events, and that meant so much to me, that I really feel like I need to be there for them during their events as well.”

He echoed the comment later on Twitter.

I am flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent for them here in PyeongChang. Doing this would require me to leave Team USA and move out of the Olympic Village. I don't want to do that so I had to declined the opportunity. — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 19, 2018

I love being on Team USA and representing our country. My teammates were there for me during my events, and now I NEED to be there for them. I look forward to being with them, and I’m very excited for the rest of the competition. Go Team USA!!! — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 19, 2018

I actually found everything out about the offer via twitter HAHA 😂😂 2018 is wild girl — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 19, 2018

USA Today’s Christine Brennan, who previously reported Rippon was joining the network, tweeted a similar sentiment, saying a source told her Rippon didn’t want to “relinquish his official Olympic standing ... and miss the closing ceremony.” According to Brennan, Rippon agreed to the gig but later turned it down after learning how he’d have to separate from the team.

After agreeing to an offer to work for NBC, Adam Rippon @Adaripp decided overnight that he would rather remain as an Olympian, source telling me. Didn’t want to

relinquish his official Olympic standing, give up credential, move out of Team USA housing and miss closing ceremony. — Christine Brennan (@cbrennansports) February 19, 2018

NBC did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.
