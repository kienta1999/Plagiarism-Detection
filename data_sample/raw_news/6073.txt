Milo Ventimiglia, “This Is Us” star and possibly the best TV dad ever, visited “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and talked about viewers’ reactions to finally seeing how his character, Jack, died. The episode of This Is Us implied that a slow cooker sparked the fire that killed Jack. So fans turned their ire toward Crock-Pot.

When Ellen asked if the device that killed Jack was a Crock-Pot, Ventimiglia corrected her by saying, “Slow cooker … I own a Crock-Pot; I love Crock-Pot.”

He added, “I think there was a lot of misdirected hate at Crock-Pot as opposed to a faulty slow-cooker.”

To help quell the backlash, Ventimiglia and “This Is Us” created a short ad that showed Ventimiglia awkwardly ladling chili from a Crock-Pot into a paper bowl and featured the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent.
