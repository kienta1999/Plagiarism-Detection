Millie Bobby Brown is flipping her fans‚Äô worlds upside down.

Folks online have noticed how the ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù star bears a striking resemblance to a young Natalie Portman. Twitter user @karianagrand brought the issue to the fore on Tuesday:

Other tweeters soon piled in with their own comparison shots:

The actors have yet to comment on the comparison, but the uncanny similarity continues to set Twitter alight, with some people suggesting Portman could play Brown‚Äôs character Eleven in a future flash-forward episode.

Food for thought, indeed.
