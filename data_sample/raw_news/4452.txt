Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria left a trail of destruction when they swept over the Caribbean last September.

Recovery has been slow in places like Puerto Rico, but itâ€™s well on its way in St. Martin, an island that is controlled by France in the north and the Netherlands in the south.

These GIFs show what the island looked like right after the hurricane and how it looks now.

The transformation is miraculous.
