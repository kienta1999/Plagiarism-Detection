A lawyer for President Donald Trump arranged a payment of $130,000 to a former adult film actress in October 2016, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal citing sources familiar with the matter.

Michael Cohen, a longtime representative of the Trump Organization, reportedly negotiated a nondisclosure agreement with a lawyer for the woman, Stephanie Clifford, over an encounter that allegedly occurred in 2006. Clifford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal would have been reached around the same time a leaked recording revealed the now-infamous lewd comments Trump made on the set of “Access Hollywood” in 2005.

The alleged consensual sexual encounter between Trump and Clifford is said to have taken place after the pair met at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament in July of that year. Jessica Drake, an adult film actress and director, says Trump grabbed her, kissed her and offered her $10,000 for sex at the same golf tournament.

Drake is one of more than 20 women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse over several decades. At least two of the alleged incidents involved rape. Trump has repeatedly denied the women’s stories, and the White House has said all of the president’s accusers are lying.

In statements sent to The Wall Street Journal, both the White House and Cohen strongly denied any sexual incident between Trump and Clifford, but made no reference to a payment to the actress, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.

The report notes that Trump may not have been aware of any payment.
