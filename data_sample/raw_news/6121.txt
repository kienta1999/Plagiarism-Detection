Brady, the Patriots‚Äô longtime quarterback, has won five previous Super Bowls with the team.

And although Brady‚Äôs wife, supermodel Gisele B√ºndchen, kept things classy by congratulating Eagles players after the game, many of the team‚Äôs fans were ecstatic that the Patriots ‚Äî and Brady ‚Äî had lost.
