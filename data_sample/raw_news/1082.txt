Streamline recommends “Moonrise Kingdom” as the movie you should watch on Hulu this week. The service adds this on Sept. 16.

“Moonrise Kingdom” stars two unknown child actors ― Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman ― along with a notable cast of adults that includes Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis. Wes Anderson directed this and co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola.

The two children run away and try to make a life for themselves together ― a very twee life. Then the adults start looking for them ― in a very twee way.

Although the Anderson aesthetic is kind of out right now during this more hardened, ultra-cynical Donald Trump era, I still love this movie. I think you’ll find much to enjoy whether you’re revisiting it or watching for the first time.
