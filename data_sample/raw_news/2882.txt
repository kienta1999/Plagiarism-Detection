Forget “Black Panther.” Comedian Tracy Morgan has his own superhero, “Black Bobcat.”

In a goofy bit on “The Tonight Show” Monday, “The Last O.G.” star told host Jimmy Fallon that the hit movie stole his idea. He then introduced a cardboard cutout of his caped alter ego.

Morgan’s crime-fighter seems a bit more pet-like than the central character in “Black Panther.” Black Bobcat sleeps 20 hours a day and drinks a lot of milk. He also possesses a unique superpower.

“He can hear things on porno that you can’t hear,” Morgan said.
