Artist Emanuel Santos gained worldwide notoriety last year when he unveiled his bust of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Not the good kind of notoriety.

The internet meme machine was savage to say the least, and Santos took the negative response very hard. Santos and his family had a rough time in the weeks and months that followed the unveiling, telling Bleacher Report that he suffered from feelings of humiliation and isolation.
