Pelosi got involved as a show of “solidarity in the face of what she calls attacks against LGBT people by the Trump administration,” a spokesperson for the congresswoman told The Washington Post.

The aide also said Pelosi, whose episode already taped, had a “fabulous” time, which the Democrat herself reiterated on Twitter:

All I can say is, you betta werk! Had a fabulous time with @RuPaul and good luck to all the queens. #DragRace https://t.co/ZrJDyDmuVh — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 18, 2018
