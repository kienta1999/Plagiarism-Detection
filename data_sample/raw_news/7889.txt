Jaylen Brown has spoken out about racism in the U.S. in the age of Donald Trump.

In an interview with The Guardian published Tuesday, the Boston Celtics star said Trump’s presidency has “made it a lot more acceptable for racists to speak their minds.”

“I just think Trump’s character and some of his values [make] him unfit to lead,” he said. “For someone like him to be president, and in charge of our troops? It’s scary to be honest.”

The 21-year-old also shared details of the racist abuse he endured on the court during his youth in Marietta, Georgia.

“I’ve had people call me the n-word,” he said. “I’ve had people come to basketball games dressed in monkey suits with a jersey on. I’ve had people paint their face black at my games. I’ve had people throw bananas in the stands.”

Brown praised former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick for sparking protests against police brutality and systemic racial injustice by taking a knee during the national anthem before NFL games last season.

“Often everybody is comfortable with their role in life and they forget about the people who are uncomfortable,” he said. “So for Colin to put his career on the line, and sacrifice himself, was amazing.”

″[Kaepernick] speaks for many people in this country ― including me,” Brown added.

Brown also offered his thoughts on David Foster Wallace, the Arabic alphabet and the psychological role of sports in society.
