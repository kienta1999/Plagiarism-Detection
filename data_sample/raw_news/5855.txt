The Republican National Committee is being mocked online after it asked people to take part in an approval poll for President Donald Trump.

We want to hear from YOU. Take the President's Official February Approval Poll today. https://t.co/rDj0Z0v5CQ pic.twitter.com/cSzAF7ncCj — GOP (@GOP) February 10, 2018

The RNC on Saturday shared a link to the survey on Trump’s official campaign website.

Folks on Twitter made fun of the poll because it only invited them to rate Trump’s job performance as “Great,” “Good,” “Okay” or “Other.”

The “other” section did allow people to expand on their thoughts, but critics dubbed the question as “biased.”

It’s fair to say that Trump won’t approve of some of the responses:

You guys are hilarious. Talk to me more about how millennials need participation trophies. 🙇🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/SCRESA01AT — Jay (@gaughanj) February 10, 2018

You don’t really want to hear from us. @realDonaldTrump stops listening when people disagree with him. He’s a snowflake and a failure. — Chris Taylor 🌊 (@christophurious) February 10, 2018

Approve of what? Should we approve of his vetting skills? Letting high level WH persons handle & view classified documents without proper clearance? Tax breaks to the wealthy & himself? His perpetual lying? What should we approve of? — Regina Parlapiano (@ReginaParlapian) February 10, 2018

Changed it for you. How has Trump done? — Leia, PhD (@OldLeia) February 10, 2018
