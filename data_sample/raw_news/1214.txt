Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is now part of President Donald Trump’s legal team, confirmed one of the reasons James Comey was fired as director of the FBI last year.

“He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation,” Giuliani told Sean Hannity on Fox News on Wednesday night.

“He’s entitled to that. Hillary Clinton got that and he couldn’t get that,” he said. “So he fired him and he said, ‘I’m free of this guy.’”

Trump has wavered in his explanations for Comey’s firing. He told NBC’s Lester Holt last year that it was at least in part due to the Russia investigation.

“I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it,” he said in May 2017. “And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election.’”

However, Trump last month claimed Comey “was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation.”
