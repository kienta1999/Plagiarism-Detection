Pride comes before a fall.

Jeremy Clarkson, the host of the revived British version of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” was convinced Friday that a contestant had correctly answered a multiple-choice question about what kind of animal an ibex is.

Clarkson didn’t bother to wait for confirmation from the show’s computer when the contestant, Alan, responded “deer.” The host immediately congratulated Alan on winning 32,000 British pounds (about $43,350).

“I’m not even going to look at the screen, that’s the correct answer,” Clarkson said. But both men were left stunned when the computer then revealed Alan’s answer was actually incorrect — because an ibex is a goat.

“What? It is a deer, is it not a deer? I’ve seen them in Africa boinging along like deers,” said a visibly embarrassed Clarkson. “Oh no, you’ve just lost 15,000 pounds.”

Alan walked away from the show with 1,000 pounds in winnings, but also a place in the public’s heart:

Watching #Millionaire on +1 and can't believe what I've just seen. To b fair to Clarkson I thought an Ibex was a deer too but surely he should have checked his monitor before telling the contestant he had gotten the right answer. This clip will be viewed again and again. Classic! — Sean O' Donovan (@henriksen1) May 11, 2018
