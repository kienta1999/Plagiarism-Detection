In Tuesday’s storyline, Becky (Lecy Goranson) learned her chances of getting pregnant were slim after a visit to the doctor. She later remarked to Darlene (Sara Gilbert) that she and Mark had been trying to conceive and that she hadn’t been able to “find anyone as good” since he died. Darlene then tried to persuade her to move on, explaining that it wasn’t a betrayal to Mark.
