All that’s currently known is that Annalise will appear on “Scandal” and then Olivia, President Mellie Grant’s chief of staff, will appear on “How to Get Away with Murder.” It’s still unclear as to how the two women will cross paths, but, if nothing else, it’ll definitely be dramatic.

Viola Davis told Entertainment Weekly that filming “was black girl magic on steroids!”

“Me and Kerry dancing to ‘Rock the Boat’? Hey, it can’t get any better,” she added.
