John Krasinski’s film directorial debut, “A Quiet Place,” has been anything but silent at the box office .

In the movie, Krasinski and real-life wife Emily Blunt play a couple with two small children (and one on the way) trying to survive in absolute silence after their world is invaded by blind, sound-hunting monsters.
