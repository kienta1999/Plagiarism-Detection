"Shaking Things Up: 14 Young Women Who Changed The World"

This book includes the stories of women who made their mark on the world early on. It features Ruby Bridges , the inspiring 6-year-old who helped desegregate an all-white school in the South, and Mae Jemison , the first African-American woman in space. The book, as noted on the cover, is "illustrated by 13 extraordinary women." (By Susan Hood)
