If you’re going to an Oscar party on Sunday and are freaking out because you haven’t seen any of the nominated movies, then consider this list your lifesaver.

Personally, I’ve been very bad at keeping up with the Oscar movies this year outside of a few highlights. That means I think “Lady Bird” or “Get Out” should win for Best Picture and “Icarus” was the best documentary, but I can’t say for sure against the other nominees.

You and I now have a little over 48 hours to catch up before the ceremony, so here’s how to stream this year’s nominees. Best of luck.

"Get Out" is on HBO Get Out
