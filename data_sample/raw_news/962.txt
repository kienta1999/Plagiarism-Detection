Janet Jackson will be honored at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards this month.

Billboard announced on Monday that the superstar will receive the coveted Icon Award at this year’s annual ceremony, on May 20 in Las Vegas. Jackson, 51, will be in good company. Other artists who have received the award include Stevie Wonder, Prince, Cher and Celine Dion. Correction: awesome company.

If that news weren’t amazing enough, she will also perform at the ceremony. It will be her first televised performance since the American Music Awards in 2009.

“Can’t wait! Thank u @bbmas,” Jackson wrote in an Instagram post on Monday.
