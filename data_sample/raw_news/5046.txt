Jimmy Kimmel has got his ear to the street when it comes to the fake crisis in the fictional country of Wakanda.

On Friday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the comedian’s staff asked random people what they thought about “the situation” in the made-up African nation, which features in the box-office hit “Black Panther.”

Kimmel explained how Wakanda is not a real place — “but not everyone knows that.”
