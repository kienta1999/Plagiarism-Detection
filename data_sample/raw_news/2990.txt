Stephen Colbert on Friday took aim at Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

“We’ve learned over the last few days that you’re not the customer,” he warned his audience during “The Late Show.” “Your life is their product. And Facebook is the pimp.”

Colbert boasted that he has never had a Facebook page. Then he taunted Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the social media platform: “You know nothing about me, Suckerberg.”
