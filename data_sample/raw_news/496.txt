The rapper T.I. was arrested on Wednesday morning in Georgia and charged with disorderly conduct and public drunkenness.

The Henry County Police Department told local news Channel 2 that the 37-year-old, whose legal name is Clifford Harris Jr., was arrested around 4 a.m.

He had arrived at the gated community where he resides but didn’t have his key, according to police. They said the “Whatever You Like” singer demanded the guard let him in and asked, “Don’t you know who I am?”

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that T.I. was “allowed into his gated community after an initial argument with the guard, but then returned on foot shortly afterward to confront the guy again.”

T.I. then reportedly called a friend who joined him to argue with the guard, which led to the police being called. The friend, who police said had a warrant out on him, was also arrested.
