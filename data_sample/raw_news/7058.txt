Seth Meyers poked fun at Donald Trump on Monday’s broadcast of “Late Night” by using the president’s own words against him.

Trump over the weekend blamed Democrats for the three-day government shutdown. But during the 2013 shutdown, Trump held former President Barack Obama responsible.

“For each Trump quote, there is an equal and opposite Trump quote,” Meyers said. “And the question of who’s to blame for government shutdowns is no exception, because when Obama was president, Trump was very clear about who was to blame.”

Meyers also noted that there was “literally not one situation where there isn’t an old Trump quote that completely contradicts his current position.”
