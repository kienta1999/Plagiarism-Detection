There‚Äôs basically been one thing on the minds of all of Asian Twitter, and that‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians.‚Äù

Since the release of the film‚Äôs trailer on Monday, which preceded a few advanced screenings this week, Asian-Americans are using social media to express just how much the movie means to them.

After all, with a more than two-decade gap since the release of ‚ÄúThe Joy Luck Club,‚Äù the last Hollywood film featuring an Asian-majority cast that isn‚Äôt a period piece, the hype is completely understandable.

#CrazyRichAsians is the kind of big, beautiful, vibrant rom-com Hollywood needs; the kind it hasn‚Äôt seen (or done well) in a while. That‚Äôs why it works. And it happens to star a big, beautiful, vibrant ensemble of Asians. Global Asians! All kinds of Asians. That‚Äôs why it matters. ‚Äî jen yamato (@jenyamato) April 24, 2018

Some pointed out how refreshing it is to see three-dimensional Asian characters on screen, while others noted the film‚Äôs characters depart from stereotypes. A few people even mentioned how the upcoming movie could inspire younger generations to embrace their heritage.

Here's the thing - first Asian American female protagonist in 25 years, since Joy Luck Club. Sure, the storyline was satire on late stage capitalism in Asia, but also gratuitous hot Asian men abs. And an American story w/ not one White face. So damned good! #CrazyRichAsiansMovie ‚Äî Taz Ahmed (@TazzyStar) April 24, 2018

Getting emotional just listening to these guys talk. As a film journalist, I have never been to an event with a cast like this before. ‚ú®üò≠ #CrazyRichAsians pic.twitter.com/BOxFYbr369 ‚Äî Susan Cheng (@scheng_) April 24, 2018

OMFG. ASIAN LEADS. ASIAN INDEPENDENT WOMEN JUST TRYING TO HAVE IT ALL. ASIAN SEXUALIZED HUNKS. ASIAN FAMILIES. ASIAN VILLAINS. ASIAN BEST FRIEND WHO SAYS "GURL, YOU GO THIS." ASIANS WITH DIFFERENT JOBS. ASIAN EXTRAS. ASIANS IN GORGEOUS GOWNS. ASIANS FALLING IN LOVE. ASIANS... https://t.co/Po02gcnBld ‚Äî Tobin Low (@tobinlow) April 23, 2018

You bet your sweet ass #CrazyRichAsians is historic. üôå



We've waited 25 years since The Joy Luck Club to see a second major Hollywood film feature an all-Asian cast.



25. YEARS.



Here's to the film's success and many more Asian-led projects to come. ü•Çhttps://t.co/iYHsHhDkma ‚Äî Eugene Lee Yang (@EugeneLeeYang) April 23, 2018

When is the last time you saw two Asian romantic leads on the poster for a major Hollywood motion picture? #CrazyRichAsians pic.twitter.com/WqvAdjQB4W ‚Äî Angry Asian Man (@angryasianman) April 23, 2018

I'm so excited for #CrazyRichAsians to come out! It is an entirely Asian cast where Asians are going to be given a complex and realistic background for once. Plus, Asian men are seen as attractive and desirable and Asian women are not overly sexualized. ‚Äî Theresa (@terocena) April 19, 2018

Pulled over in a shady part of burbank in 80 degree heat to watch #CrazyRichAsians trailer. This is a historic moment for Asian Americans and I could not be happier. Whatever happens, we‚Äôve already won. Thank you @jonmchu @wbpictures ‚Äî hayden szeto (@HaydenSzeto) April 23, 2018

When they said representation matters & fought for it, I didn't think they'd bring back my mom's hairdo too #CrazyRichAsians (fyi super stoked) pic.twitter.com/Zi0fUJyqe3 ‚Äî Atsuko Okatsuka (@AtsukoComedy) April 23, 2018

For Asian-Americans, securing proper representation in Hollywood has been a struggle. Research on diversity in Hollywood found that barely more than 3 percent of film roles in 2016 went to Asian actors. In contrast, more than 78 percent went to white actors.

It‚Äôs about time Hollywood released another movie with an Asian-majority cast because, as sociologist Nancy Wang Yuen points out, inclusive Asian-American representation in media skipped an entire generation.
