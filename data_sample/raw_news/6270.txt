The boys of BTS can add yet another achievement to their growing list of accolades.

It looks like the band‚Äôs ‚ÄúMic Drop‚Äù remix with Steve Aoki, featuring rapper Desiigner, was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The rapper revealed the news in a tweet on Saturday, and a representative from RIAA confirmed the information with HuffPost. A rep for BTS did not immediately return HuffPost‚Äôs request for comment.

‚ÄúMic Drop‚Äù has been on the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, peaking at No. 28.

The group is the first K-pop band to attain the distinction.

After Desiigner dropped the news, the band‚Äôs fiercely loyal fans, known as the BTS Army, created the hashtag #MicDropWentGold to celebrate the group‚Äôs new win.

Even the U.S. Embassy in Seoul got in on the excitement.

It‚Äôs not a coincidence how Micdrop went gold right on Yoongi Day. He dropped so many mics that the mic is turning gold on it own to prevent from being broken. Now It‚Äôs a fact that everything Suga touches turn gold.#BTSARMY #BestFanArmy@BTS_twt #iHeartAwards ‚Äî ‚ÄºÔ∏è[VOTE] BTS ARMY‚ÄºÔ∏è#SuperStarBTS Game Is OUT nowüåé (@BTSARMYNA) February 4, 2018

According to the RIAA, a song is eligible for gold certification after it surpasses 500,000 units in sales. While each permanent digital download counts as its own unit, 150 on-demand audio and/or video streams are regarded as a single unit by RIAA standards.
