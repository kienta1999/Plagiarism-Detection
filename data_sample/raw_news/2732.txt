After officers arrived, “the suspect then took a two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at the approaching officers,” Police Chief Terence A. Monahan said in a news briefing Wednesday.

Ten rounds were fired from the four officers, striking Vassell, who died on his way to Kings County Hospital Center.
