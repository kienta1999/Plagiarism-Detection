If you’re one of those people who has been hankering to stream reruns of Chad Michael Murray playing basketball, you’re in luck. “One Tree Hill,” which left Netflix in the fall of 2017, is coming to Hulu this month.

The streaming service is also adding several films, including “The Warriors” ― an older movie that definitely still holds up. Hulu is apparently involved in a remake of it, so now is a great time to familiarize yourself with this great New York City-based gang adventure movie.

A few more highlights:

Movies: “Akeelah and the Bee,” “Amelie,” “The Hurt Locker,” “Sin City,” “The Warriors” and both “Agent Cody Banks” movies!

Shows: “One Tree Hill,” “A.P. Bio,” “Broad City” (Season 4), “Archer: Dreamland” (Season 8) and “Parenthood”

One Tree Hill

The most notable Hulu original this month is a show called “The Looming Tower,” which will premiere Feb. 28.
