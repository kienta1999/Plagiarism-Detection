Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) initial reaction to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address was one for the books.

During Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Sanders was caught on camera slow clapping. It seemed as if he’d rather be anywhere else.

Later, Sanders offered a longer response to Trump’s comments, but his immediate reaction was noticed on Twitter ― where it became a viral meme:
