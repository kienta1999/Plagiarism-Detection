A British comedy series took on both race and religion in a sketch about a white churchgoer who seeks help and encounters Jesus. But the savior wasn’t what he expected.

Jesus was black.

“Have you heard my story?” Jesus asked. “I was arrested by a mob of angry government officials and beaten for a crime I didn’t commit. That shit doesn’t happen to white people.”
