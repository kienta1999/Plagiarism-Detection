Vice President Mike Pence doesn't have expressions. He has this face. He has this face when he's giving a speech; he has this face when he's breaking a tie in the Senate; he has this face when he's silently humming Pat Boone's cover of "Tutti Frutti" to himself -- which is always, probably.He'll be attending a two-hour dinner with congressional Republicans Wednesday evening. We suspect he will be making this face.Side note: If the Democrats retake the House in November, Nancy Pelosi could well become speaker again. That means Pence would be forced to sit alone with a woman in front of the entire country during next year's State of the Union. That might elicit a different face.
