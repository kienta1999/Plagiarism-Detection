Preparing for the Olympics is tough enough as it is. But performing your routine and having the perfect Valentine’s Day gift to follow it up?

It was no problem for Chris Knierim and Alexa Scimeca Knierim, U.S figure skating pair and husband and wife. Following the couple’s short program routine, Chris had a huge teddy bear and a “Will you (still) be mine?” heart ready as the couple met with the media.

It’s been a busy and emotional Olympic Games for the couple, who started skating together in 2012 and got married in 2016. Chris and Alexa wound up as alternates for the 2014 Sochi games after Chris broke his tibia during the preceding season. Still, they were able to respond with a national championship in 2015. But in 2016, tragedy struck again when Alexa suffered from a rare and life-threatening gastrointestinal condition. She needed several surgeries and dropped to 80 pounds.

Luckily, these Olympics are proving the story ultimately has taken a very happy turn. After winning another national title in January 2018, the couple helped the United States earn the bronze medal in the team skate Monday and got to skate together on Valentine’s Day as part of the figure skating pairs competition.

There’s love on the ice in PyeongChang, and giant teddy bears as well.
