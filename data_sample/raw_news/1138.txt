Mother’s Day can be a mother of a day when it comes to gift shopping.

Sure, you could go for generic items, like flowers, brunch or perfume, but that just sends Mom a message: You’re a cookie-cutter generic female.

We know that’s not the case: Your mom is one of a kind. How else could she create a weirdo like you? (That’s meant to be a compliment.)

So show Mom you know you appreciate her wacky side by giving her a gift on Mother’s Day that reflects it.
