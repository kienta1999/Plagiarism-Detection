Someone has cut a new trailer for “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” without a single taunt, newt or “Ni!” and it works surprisingly well.

YouTuber Testudo Aubreii made a trailer for the film as a “serious historical drama” for a school project.

While it’s not the first attempt at turning the comedy into a gritty historical drama, it’s certainly one of the best.
