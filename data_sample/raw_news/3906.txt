When “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek introduced Paris Themmen as an “entrepreneur” and “avid backpacker” on Tuesday night’s show, he failed to note that his guest had a famous past.

And Themmen didn’t mention it either.

But you can’t fool viewers, who quickly identified the 58-year-old contestant as the TV-obsessed little cowboy Mike Teevee from the 1971 film, “Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory.”

Twitter lit up.

Is nobody realizing that Paris on Jeopardy right now, is Mike TV from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?.... Like legit it’s the actor. — Rachel Michele (@rachelmichele25) March 13, 2018

WBZ interrupted the opening of Jeopardy! so I didn’t get his name until Alex Trebek repeated it - it’s @ParisThemmen, Mike Teevee from Willy Wonka! pic.twitter.com/NNPUQ09hV0 — Tim Colby (@timjcolby) March 13, 2018

Why wouldn't Paris Themmen mention those most amazing fact he had about himself:

I was making dinner in the kitchen, listening to Jeopardy when Alex Trebek started introducing contestants at the break. He said @ParisThemmen and I ran out saying MIKE TEEVEE !!! My wife thought I was nuts. Great job Paris! — Wildbill (@wildbill77) March 13, 2018

Wait, did @Jeopardy not mention that contestant @ParisThemmen was in "Willy Wonka," or did I miss it? It's not every day that Mike Teevee is on TV! #Jeopardy — Jonathan Padget (@dcjpad) March 14, 2018

And Themmen, whose character dreamed of getting on television, performed well on the tube, finishing second.

Not a golden ticket, but pretty good.
