Fergie says she tried her best in her ill-received performance of the national anthem before the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday night.

“I’ve always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem, and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA,” the artist said in a statement.

“I’m a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn’t strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best.”
