Trevor Noah thinks he knows what President Donald Trump’s was really watching on his teleprompter during the State of the Union address.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” Noah noted that limiting immigration into the U.S. was one of the main themes of Trump’s speech.

“Tonight, we heard so many stories about MS-13 and alien terrorists and other anti-immigrant shit,” said Noah. He then made a lighthearted suggestion as to why that was the case.
