If you’re using Hulu this May, it will probably be for “The Handmaid’s Tale” and the many new movies the service is adding this month.

The second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” premiered April 25 and will have new episodes on a weekly basis through May. Hulu adds only one other original show this month (“All Night”) so “Handmaid’s” will likely take up your attention.

You’ll be able to choose from quite a few movies, though, including “I, Tonya” from last year and popular series like the “Rocky,” “Matrix” and “Nightmare on Elm Street” movies. That said, “I, Tonya” doesn’t join until May 31, so you’ll have to wait a few weeks.

Many movies are also leaving Hulu this month, but not too many notable ones. It’s a shame that “Fred: The Movie,” “Fred: Night of the Living Fred” and “Fred 3: Camp Fred” are all disappearing, but you had your chance with those Criterion Collection shoo-ins.

Check out the full list of arrivals and departures below. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining streaming services on a weekly basis, make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.
