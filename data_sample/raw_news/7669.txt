Movie star Sean Penn has taken aim at President Donald Trump for reportedly calling Haiti a “shithole” country.

The Academy Award-winning actor — who founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization following the devastating earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 ― called Trump “an enemy of compassion” in a new op-ed piece for Time magazine.

Penn labeled Trump “an enemy of Americans, Republicans, Democrats, Independents and every new child born” in the article, published online Friday.

“An enemy of mankind. He is indeed an enemy of the state,” Penn added.

Trump sparked global outrage with the comment that he reportedly made during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers on Thursday.

The Washington Post first reported that Trump asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” while arguing against reinstating protections for immigrants from Haiti and some African nations.
