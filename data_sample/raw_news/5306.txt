Sibling figure skaters Maia and Alex Shibutani set the internet alight after winning bronze for Team USA at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday.

The brother and sister duo — known as the “Shib Sibs” — nabbed third in the figure skating ice dance event. Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir won gold, and France’s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron grabbed silver.

The siblings’ podium-ascending performance captivated people on Twitter, including “Saturday Night Live” comedian Leslie Jones, who shared this video of their routine:

Former Olympic figure skating champion Meryl Davis shared this adorable throwback GIF of the pair in celebration:
