After stirring perhaps the most-talked-about YouTube controversy in recent years, Logan Paul says that he deserves a second chance after being blacklisted from YouTube as a result of a since-removed vlog that featured a suicide victim in Japan’s “suicide forest.”

“Everyone deserves second chances, bro,” he told TMZ.

Paul has made a reputation for himself on YouTube as one of the site’s top users with over 15 million followers on his channel. After receiving nearly immediate backlash for his vlog in Japan, Paul issued an apology that was criticized as shallow, and announced that he would be taking a break from posting videos.

Since sharing the highly controversial video, Paul has been removed from YouTube’s preferred program, which gives large companies the opportunity to present ads via the top five percent of creators on the platform. He’s also been removed from the YouTube show “Foursome,” as well as other originals that had not yet been released. YouTube’s sentiment towards Paul matched much of the general public’s complaints: “Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.”

When asked about his plans to maintain income, Paul lifted his hoodie, a nod to an apparent venture into Logan Paul merchandise, but here’s hoping for much less of Logan Paul in 2018.
