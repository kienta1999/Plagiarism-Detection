UPDATE: 11 a.m. ― Sarah Jessica Parker on Thursday shed her neutral tone on Cynthia Nixon’s candidacy, wholeheartedly endorsing her “Sex and the City” costar’s run for New York governor. “My sister on and off screen, you have my love, support and vote,” Parker wrote.

This could get awkward.

Nixon last week announced she would oppose Democratic incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a September primary, prompting quick and enthusiastic reactions from “SATC” castmates Kristin Davis (Charlotte) and Willie Garson (Stanford Blatch).

But in a statement Wednesday to the New York Post’s Page Six, Parker doesn’t appear on board ― at least yet.

“Cynthia has been my friend and colleague since we were little girls,” she said through a spokeswoman. “I look forward to talking to her about her New York state gubernatorial bid.”

Another costar, Kim Cattrall (Samantha), doesn’t appear ready to join Team Nixon, either, saying last week: “I support & respect any former colleague’s right to make their own career choices.”

According to People, Nixon said all three of her former costars in “SATC’s” fictional quartet of women have “expressed love, support and excitement” about her political aspirations.
