The Hall said he had been in hospice care recently in Visalia, Calif. and had died of natural causes.

From 1962 through 1992, Harvey worked five World Series and 4,673 games during the regular season.

“You always respected him because he came out to his job and (did it) with a lot of class,” former manager Joe Torre once said of Harvey. “He was very consistent, and that’s the highest compliment you can pay anybody.”

Torre was the first player ejected by Harvey during the umpire’s rookie season in 1962.
