John Oliver says EPA chief Scott Pruitt’s big spending on security might be needed after all.

Some of Pruitt’s much-criticized $832,000 security tab for the first quarter included protection during a trip to Disneyland. On Sunday’s broadcast of “Last Week Tonight,” Oliver said that expense could actually be legit.

“If anyone needs security at Disneyland, it’s Scott Pruitt ― a man who even Mickey and Minnie Mouse would tell to go fuck himself,” Oliver said. ”‘Space Mountain’s going to be underwater in 10 years, you son of a bitch!’”
