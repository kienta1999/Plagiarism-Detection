On Wednesday, March 14, students across the nation came together to protest gun violence , one month after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., in which 17 people — 14 of them children — were killed. Student walkouts were timed to begin at 10 a.m. local time and lasted for 17 minutes, one for each Parkland victim.

Students carried signs that did not mince words, with direct messages aimed at politicians and anyone over 18 who can use their voices to vote. “We want to read books, not eulogies,” read a sign in New York City, while in Alexandria, Va., over 65 children from an elementary school wore orange and stood silently, as reported by the Guardian’s Lois Beckett. Their eyes downcast — many looked to be on the verge of tears — the kids held signs with school shooting victims’ names written on them, interspersed with messages such as “Never again.”
