Four former U.S. presidents were among some 1,500 mourners who gathered at a Houston church for her funeral, after the matriarch of one of the country’s most prominent political dynasties died on Tuesday at age 92.

Bush, the wife of the 41st president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush, was lauded at a televised but invitation-only service at St. Martin’s Episcopal Church, where she and her family have been members since the 1950s.

“She was candid and comforting, steadfast and straightforward, honest and loving,” said the historian and author Jon Meacham, who wrote a biography of George H.W. Bush and was one of three eulogists whom Barbara Bush herself selected before her death.
