Well, it seems that Paul Thomas Anderson has very good taste in funny women.

In fact, the ladies were so great together that people on Twitter immediately requested that they host the award show together next year.

Every other tweet in my timeline is people begging for Tiffany Haddish & Maya Rudolph to host next year and add me to the chorus. — Celeste Ng (@pronounced_ing) March 5, 2018

Twitter users seemed to collectively fall head over heels for the pair as soon as they strutted onstage holding their shoes in their hands.

“I had to take my shoes off,” Rudolph said.

“Girl, me too,” Haddish followed up. “I’ve been wearing these shoes since 11 o’clock this morning.” She then asked Rudolph how long she had been wearing her heels.

“Since the Critics’ Choice Awards,” Rudolph quipped.

But the jokes didn’t end there. (You can watch their other cracks — about white people with clipboards and pinky toes falling off — in the clip above.)

But if you’re not completely convinced, here are all the other projects that people on Twitter want Haddish and Rudolph to do together.

I know it's lazy to just be like "these two people onstage need to be in a movie together!!" but.........Maya Rudolph and Tiffany Haddish really should be in a movie together. And a miniseries. And a TV show. And on a spoken word album. — A.B. (@AlannaBennett) March 5, 2018
