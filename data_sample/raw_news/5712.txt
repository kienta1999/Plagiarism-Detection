It’s that time of year again. Time for dogs of all shapes and sizes to take center stage at the 142nd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and people’s love of dogs proved to be one of the few things that can bring out the best in Twitter.

Some people are going to get political, though, no matter what. One user posted, “Luckily, no dogs took a knee during the National Anthem before the #WestminsterDogShow.” An obvious reference to NFL players kneeling in protest during the National Anthem before games.

Another posted, “Damn it! The Russian Wolfhound won the Hound Group at #westminsterdogshow. These Russian hackers have taken over everything.”

The NFL Network’s Andrew Siciliano may have had the best idea ever, tweeting, “I wish we could combine tonight’s two big television events. I want skiing dogs. #PeyongChang2018 #westminsterdogshow”

Then there was the lighthearted shade thrown at Philadelphia Eagles fans. In a reply to another tweet, a user wrote, “NYC greased up all of the light poles outside of #madisonsquaregarden in anticipation of the German Shepherd win #westminsterdogshow.” For those not in the know, the Philadelphia Police Department greased light poles before both the NFC championship game and the Super Bowl to keep Eagles fans from climbing on them. It didn’t work.

No matter what happens with the dogs, the Best in Show already seems pretty obvious. One Twitter user pulled off the impossible.

She posted, “I should win an award for teaching my grandmother over the phone how to download adobe flash player and navigate to #foxsportsgo in order to stream the #westminsterdogshow live…”
