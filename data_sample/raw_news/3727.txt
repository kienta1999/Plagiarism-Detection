Katy Perry appeared to take a shot at Taylor Swift in their forever feud on Sunday’s “American Idol.”

“Entertainment Tonight” reported that Perry threw the shade in a montage of contestants making awkward first impressions, so viewers missed out on a fair amount of the moment, including the guy’s performance.
