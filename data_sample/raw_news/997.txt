When speaking with Gordon Chang, an author and foreign affairs journalist who regularly contributes to Fox News, Smith interrupted him when he said Trump and “gotten out of the Iran deal.”

“You can’t really get out of the Iran deal, though,” Smith said. “There’s no provision from that. You can make a decision to now violate the terms of the deal that you were a party to, but ‘pulling out’ is a bit of a misnomer.”

Trump fulfilled one of his main campaign promises on Tuesday when he announced that his administration would impose “the highest level of economic sanctions” on Iran, violating its involvement in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in which the Middle Eastern country agreed to curb its nuclear development program in exchange for the lifting of strict economic sanctions.
