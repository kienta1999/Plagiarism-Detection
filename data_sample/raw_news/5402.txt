UPDATE ― Adam Rippon said Sunday night that he would not be joining NBC as a correspondent after learning he’d have to leave Team USA and the Olympic Village for the new role.

PREVIOUSLY — Adam Rippon will continue to shine under the Winter Olympic spotlight.

NBC has recruited the 28-year-old figure skater as a correspondent for the rest of the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, reports USA TODAY.

Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics, helped Team USA to bronze in the team event and placed 10th in the men’s single skating.

He tongue-in-cheek described some of his skating as “witchcraft.”

Prior to the games, he hit the headlines for calling out Vice President Mike Pence over his intolerance toward the LGBTQ community.

It’s not currently clear how NBC will deploy its new star its coverage, with spokesman Greg Hughes only saying that Rippon would work on its television, digital and social media offerings.

Will it look something like the video below?

However Rippon’s imminent analysis of the games pans out, he’ll be sure to have at least two celebrity viewers in pop star Britney Spears and Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon.

They are HUGE fans already:
