Well, this isn’t going to help her Reputation.

On Friday the 13th, Taylor Swift released a new version of her song “Delicate” along with a cover of Earth, Wind & Fire’s 1978 hit “September” on Spotify as part of the Spotify Singles series.

Swift decided to record a folksy, banjo-filled rendition of “September” and changed the song’s opening lyric from “Do you remember the 21st night of September?” to “Do you remember the 28th night of September?”

In classic Swift fashion, the meaning behind the Sept. 28 date is unclear. Spin reported it may have something to do with a past relationship.

Yet, it wasn’t the slight lyrical change many online took issue with. Rather it was the mere concept of Swift turning a funk, R&B, soul and disco classic into a country ballad.

And although some people really liked the song…

Wow @taylorswift13‘s cover of September, suddenly i am frolicking in a field of sunflowers in a pale blue dress with my non existent boyfriend, he lifts me up & we twirl in the sunflowers & probably get an allergic reaction but we don’t care because there never was a cloudy day. — Carly Heading (@carlyylalaa) April 12, 2018

… And defended Swift’s artistic choices ...

step 1: don’t listen to it



step 2: continue to not listen to it



step 3: repeat — leading sessioner prosecutor (@kohesivekloss) April 13, 2018

Many of the people who listened to it absolutely hated it.

If you were curious to hear what unseasoned boiled chicken breast sounded like in song, take a listen to Taylor Swift cover Earth, Wind & Fire. https://t.co/5x1Ecwc1cw — Michael Arceneaux (@youngsinick) April 13, 2018

Like, despised it.

No one who respects Earth Wind and Fire or funk music would ever cover a song like that with banjos.



No one who loves that song takes a classic and makes it sound like unseasoned chicken. — Ray (@YarmondShore) April 13, 2018

Taylor Swift covering Earth Wind and Fire is the exact kind of evil the Devil tries to bring to pass on Friday the 13th. I suggest tossing some salt over your shoulder keeping it moving. — Kendra James, the "Literary Racist" (@KendraJames_) April 13, 2018

I can't wait to hear this on "coffee shop covers" — Mark Griffin (@chunnamark) April 13, 2018

That Taylor Swift cover of "September" sounds like housing discrimination — Zito (@_Zeets) April 13, 2018

Fellow white people: don’t forget to apologize to a black person today for what Taylor Swift did to “September.” — p-Aubielicious (@AubieIicious) April 13, 2018

I don't even think they play this in hell https://t.co/pD4BlnwMpM — Kofie (@KofieYeboah) April 13, 2018

Swift, who has a mostly white, female fan base, was criticized for cultural appropriation in 2014 for her “Shake It Off” video in which she crawled between the legs of a line of twerking dancers.

Yet, regardless of your opinion of Swift and her Earth, Wind & Fire cover, one Twitter user may have a pretty valid point about the whole kerfuffle:

The Taylor Swift cover of Earth, Wine & Fire's 'September' is just a distraction engineered by the Trump administration — Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) April 13, 2018
