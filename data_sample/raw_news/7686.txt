After Donald Trump tweeted that he wouldn’t show up for the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in London, an eerily similar presidential figure came to stand outside the building on Friday.

Madame Tussauds waxwork museum took matters into its own hands by placing a wax statue of Trump near the building, complete with unfriendly glare and extra-long red tie.

Construction workers and tourists posed with the faux POTUS, who remained surprisingly silent about this awkward turn of events.
