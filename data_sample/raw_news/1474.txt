President Donald Trump and his crew can’t seem to dodge Stormy Daniels’ telegenic attorney Michael Avenatti.

He didn’t have anything to say to CNN Saturday at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington about romantic entanglements involving his client, who has said she had a brief affair with Trump several years ago. But Avenatti did engineer a slick photobomb of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway.

It happened while Conway was talking to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about Trump’s future messaging. “I predict confidently that next year he’ll have more great economic and security news to tell,” she says on the video — as White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stands with her and tries to keep her cool during the smirking Avenatti’s photobomb.

Avenatti was a guest of The Associated Press. He said Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, turned down several invitations and skipped the gala, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

He tweeted that he met Conway at a party the night before, and they had a “spirited” discussion.
