On Wednesday, the league ruled that players who are out on the field must stand for the national anthem or fines will be levied against their team. The new regulation is an effort to counter the movement sparked by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began taking a knee during the anthem in the 2016 season to protest systemic racial injustice and police brutality.
