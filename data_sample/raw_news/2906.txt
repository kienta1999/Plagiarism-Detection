This squirrel is “Stayin’ Alive,” in some small part due to “The Office.”

Back in Season Five of the hit comedy TV series, Steve Carell’s character Michael Scott learns that a good tip for performing CPR is to do chest compressions to the beat of the Bee Gees’ 1977 disco hit.

And it was Carell’s hilarious scene that Central Michigan University student Natalie Belsito said she had in mind when she performed the life-saving technique on the critter, which a passerby had rescued from a pool on the Mount Pleasant campus as it was drowning.

“Honestly, when I was doing it, I was thinking of the episode of ‘The Office’ when they do CPR,” Belsito, 18, told student newspaper Central Michigan Life. “I was literally singing that song as I tried to do it.”

Belsito, who is studying biology wildlife conservation, revived the squirrel and took it back to her dorm, where she wrapped it in towels and warmed it with her hair dryer.

As the above footage that Belsito shared to Twitter on Thursday shows, she released the animal back outside, where it quickly scampered up a tree — much to the delight of her friends on the soccer team.

“Seeing the squirrel OK and running up the tree was an amazing feeling, and also having my team there to support the squirrel made it even better,” she told HuffPost on Tuesday. “I hope it’s inspiring people to help those that can’t help themselves!”

Belsito added to the student newspaper that “you gotta do what you gotta do if you’re going to save a squirrel’s life.”

The American Heart Association in 2011 used a public service announcement starring actor Ken Jeong to push “Stayin’ Alive,” with its 100-beats-per-minute tempo, as the perfect guide for performing CPR chest compressions:
