Folks had a field day Thursday after it was revealed that President Donald Trump would visit the United Kingdom on Friday, July 13.

The Friday the 13th date, which some superstitious people consider to be one of the unluckiest days in the calendar, prompted plenty of amusing comments.

“Either somebody really didn’t think this through... or they really did,” wrote one tweeter. “I don’t like superstition but I do enjoy irony,” added another.

Donald Trump arriving in the UK on Friday the 13th at least increases his chances of slipping on a banana skin or a pigeon shitting on his head. — Mike P Williams 🌹 (@Mike_P_Williams) April 26, 2018
