In a frightening video posted to Twitter, a man is shown making very racist, offensive remarks to a woman in a head covering and is subsequently asked to leave the establishment.

When the woman starts filming the interaction, the man is seen asking, “Is this Halloween or something?” while the two are in line at a coffee shop.

She asks, “Why would you say that?”

The two have a tense back and forth, with the man saying, “Why do you think I would say that?”

“Do you know I’m Muslim?” the woman asks him.

After confirming he has a problem with that, he says, “I don’t like it, that’s why. I don’t like your religion, it says to kill me.”

"I'm a Muslim [woman]."



"I know your religion and I don't want to be killed by you."

The man turns to the counter and the server appears to ask him to leave. A male voice can be heard in the background yelling, “Get out of here, get out you racist.”

The man then asks for the supervisor, whom the server who asked him to leave identifies herself as and gives her name. The man walks out the door.

“Why are you not serving him?” the woman asks the supervisor.

“Because he is disrupting a public place and being very racist,” she says.

“Thank you,” says the woman in the niqab.

The man who shared the video is journalist CJ Werleman, who wrote that the incident occurred at a coffee shop in California on Saturday.

People who watched the video said that they were glad the manager and other patrons stood up to the abusive man.

Thank you to the stranger who yelled at the racist pig and to the supervisor at Coffee Bean who did the right thing. Hey, Starbucks - you could learn from this. https://t.co/O7NiFN5hLG — Rita Lilly (@RitaLiLz) May 13, 2018

I'm so happy two people spoke up and one was the manager who refused to serve the racist. That's heartening. Perhaps not accepting all this poor treatment as the norm is what will turn the tide. — LaShawnda Jones (@SpiritHarvest) May 12, 2018

Others were horrified by the man’s behavior.

The man was wrong period. If nobody has physically touched you or said anything to you, you have no right to assume, judge or harass someone because of what they wear or religion. I'm not a Bible quotist but treat others as you want to be treated. Simple as that. — 👨🏾‍💻Keep1T100✌🏽 (@K33P1tR3AL100) May 13, 2018

The coffee shop was identified as the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, and we’ve reached out to the shop for comment. We’ll update this post if we hear back

Correction: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the woman’s head covering as a “burqa”; it is a niqab.
