Oprah Winfrey has shared Instagram videos of her Santa Barbara County, California, property after the area was overcome by floods, mudslides and even a gas fire.

The activist and former talk-show star ― whose name is being floated as a possible 2020 presidential contender after her rousing speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday ― posted one clip Tuesday showing her walking through deep mud. “The house in back is gone,” she says, presumably referring to her neighbor’s property.

“What a day!” she captioned the video gallery. “Praying for our community again in Santa Barbara.”

At least 15 have died and dozens were rescued by air and ground after rain-triggered mud and floods swept down mountainsides burned by wildfires in December.

According to People, Winfrey purchased her 65-acre Montecito estate in 2001. The area is also home to celebrities Rob Lowe and Ellen DeGeneres, who tweeted news of the devastation.

This is not a river. This is the 101 freeway in my neighborhood right now. Montecito needs your love and support. pic.twitter.com/jRNCBrp4b5 — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 9, 2018
