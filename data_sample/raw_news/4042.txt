Actor Chris Pine‚Äôs character in ‚ÄúA Wrinkle In Time‚Äù is reminding people of Gary Johnston, one of the puppet characters in the 2004 film ‚ÄúTeam America.‚Äù

While Pine has been compared with Gary before, the hairdo in his newest role looks a lot like the one on the puppet:

Pine has been compared with the Gary marionette more than a few times over the years.

Here are some others who‚Äôve noticed the resemblance:
