CNN is facing a backlash over an article about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, which critics claim paints her family’s repressive regime in a positive light.

The piece, published on Saturday, is headlined: “Kim Jong Un’s sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics.”

The article does note that Kim Jong Un “has ruled with an iron fist since coming to power” and operates “Nazi-style prison camps.”

It says Kim Yo Jong, whose attendance at the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, has attracted wide attention, is “seen by some as her brother’s answer to American first daughter Ivanka Trump.” Kim Yo Jong, the article says, “is not only a powerful member of Kim Jong Un’s kitchen cabinet but also a foil to the perception of North Korea as antiquated and militaristic.”

She “made headlines across the globe,” according to CNN, when on Saturday she invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to visit the North.

Critics including Russian chess legend and political activist Garry Kasparov have claimed the article is “propaganda.”

CNN did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Earlier this week, a CNN reporter was fooled by a witty North Korean propaganda parody account. Today, CNN is a North Korean propaganda parody account. https://t.co/A1xu8Ig3rq — Brent Bozell (@BrentBozell) February 10, 2018
