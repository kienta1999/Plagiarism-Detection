Trevor Noah hosted a spoof awards ceremony to see how President Donald Trump measures up to authoritarian leaders around the world on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show.”

“The Oppressys” celebrates “achievement in the autocratic arts,” and hosting was a gig that Noah joked he couldn’t turn down.

“You literally cannot turn it down, they kidnapped me and threw me in a trunk,” he quipped.
