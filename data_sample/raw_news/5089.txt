Ivanka Trumpâ€™s visit to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, has been widely criticized on Twitter.

President Donald Trumpâ€™s daughter and adviser will lead the U.S. delegation at Sundayâ€™s closing ceremony. Sheâ€™s also scheduled to dine with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and attend sporting events during the three-day trip.

Vice President Mike Pence caught similar heat for representing the U.S. at the opening ceremony. Team USAâ€™s two openly gay male athletes, skier Gus Kenworthy and figure skater Adam Rippon, both blasted the vice presidentâ€™s intolerance of the LGBTQ community.

Now, many are asking why the first daughter is representing the U.S. on the global stage:

Not sure why you are our representative for the closing ceremonies. You were not elected. â€” SPowl (@spowellnow) February 23, 2018

Doesnâ€™t her love of winter sports involve Aspen, designer onesies for the slopes, and hot chocolate in exclusive lodges? ðŸ¤” â€” La Fourchette (@lafourchette) February 21, 2018
