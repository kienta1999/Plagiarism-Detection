Parenthood ― bring it on.

Kirsten Dunst has delivered a “healthy baby boy,” a rep for the actress confirmed to HuffPost on Tuesday.

People reported that Dunst gave birth over the weekend.

“Everyone is doing great,” an unnamed source told the magazine, among multiple anonymous people it cited.

The child is the first for the “Spider-Man” actress, 36, and fiance Jesse Plemons, 30.

The two, who played a married couple on the TV series “Fargo,” were reported to be engaged in January 2017.

“It’s time to have babies and chill,” Dunst told Marie Claire last summer.
