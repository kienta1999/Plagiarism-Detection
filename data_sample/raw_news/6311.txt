There’s so much to say about the Republican memo criticizing the FBI and Justice Department’s investigation of a member of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. And what better way to say it than in the trending hashtag #YoMemo?

The memo, drafted by the staff of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), reveals little new information. And people on Twitter are outdoing each other, competing with the very best way to call the much-anticipated declassified memo a dud.

Even Alyssa Milano chimed in with not one but three #YoMemo quips:

Yo’ memo is so unqualified, Trump made it a cabinet member. #YoMemoJokes — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) February 3, 2018
