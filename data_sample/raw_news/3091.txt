Let us toast actress Hilary Swank for her excellent wine prank.

The two-time Oscar winner told host James Corden on CBS’ “The Late Late Show” Wednesday that she and her brother uncorked the fun stunt at a wine-tasting in Italy.

The two agreed that when the wines arrived, they would make “really strange” gestures in their tasting method but not let on that they’re joking.

and a little of this ...

They understandably got some puzzled looks from the servers.
