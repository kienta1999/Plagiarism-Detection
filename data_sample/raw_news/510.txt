Q. So you did not pass the information along to your father. Do you know if anyone else did?

A. I don’t believe they did, but I don’t know.

Q. Have you ever asked him if he was given this e-mail or told about this meeting?

A. No, I haven’t.

Q. Has he ever told you whether he saw this e-mail or knew about this meeting?

A. Not that I recall, no.

Q. And that is something you would recall?

A. Certainly not at that time. So I mean, obviously he’s aware of it now because he’s read it, it’s been in the papers, but that’s the extent of my knowledge of his knowledge of it.
