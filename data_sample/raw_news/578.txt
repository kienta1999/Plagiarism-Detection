Jim Carrey has taken aim at the National Rifle Association and its new president, Oliver North, with his latest politically charged portrait.

The actor/artist depicted North as a snake underneath blood dripping from the letters “NRA” in the piece that he shared on Twitter over the weekend:

Someday they’ll say we turned a blind eye to the suffering and slaughter of our own children and gave ourselves over to scoundrels and sadists. The NRA is a national disgrace. The venom of greed is killing America. pic.twitter.com/bhiMMHTVGN — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) May 13, 2018

“Someday they’ll say we turned a blind eye to the suffering and slaughter of our own children and gave ourselves over to scoundrels and sadists,” Carrey captioned the artwork. Carrey also described the NRA as a “national disgrace” and said that “the venom of greed is killing America.”

The NRA named North, a retired lieutenant colonel infamous for the part he played in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, as its new president last week. He has since claimed the gun group is a victim of “civil terrorism.”

Carrey also released this portrait of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a personal attorney to President Donald Trump, over the weekend:

In his desperate and neverending quest for significance, bleaching the bottom teeth just wasn’t a priority. Giuliani was back! And his breath was badder than ever! pic.twitter.com/oZyCiUiEPX — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) May 13, 2018
