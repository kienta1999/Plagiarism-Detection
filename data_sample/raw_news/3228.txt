JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the leader was taken to hospital on Tuesday for tests following an illness.

“The prime minister is suffering from a high fever and is coughing,” a spokesman for the 68-year-old Netanyahu, said in a text message.

Netanyahu’s personal physician believes the prime minister had not fully recovered from an illness two weeks ago and therefore decided he should undergo further tests at hospital, the spokesman said.
