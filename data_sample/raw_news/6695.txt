Jay-Z fans are not pleased with the Recording Academy.

In a year where it seemed hip-hop would prevail, the ‚Äú4:44‚Äù rapper left the show with zero of the eight awards for which he was nominated.

Instead, Hov‚Äôs moment of glory during Grammys weekend came when he was honored with the President‚Äôs Merit Award at Clive Davis‚Äô pre-Grammy gala on Saturday.

People on Twitter were unhappy that the 21-time Grammy Award winner and hip-hop icon didn‚Äôt win in a single category, despite being the most nominated artist of the evening.

the grammy's recognizes JAY-Z as an industry icon the night before but doesn't give him any awards at the actual show... okay. ‚Äî #freemeekmill (@lakinimani) January 29, 2018

4:44 content was too real for the Grammys to reward, they don‚Äôt want us believing in ourselves that much... ‚Äî Sad Pitt (@Bbillions) January 29, 2018

Jay-Z isn't leaving the Grammys empty-handed. He's going home with Beyonc√©, the First Lady of Music. That is well...that. pic.twitter.com/A4Y5DZyBRu ‚Äî Check 4 a neck (@Beyoncemyroc) January 29, 2018
