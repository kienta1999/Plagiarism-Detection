There are crossovers and then there’s James Harden of the Houston Rockets making an absolute mockery of L.A. Clippers’ Wesley Johnson on Wednesday night:

Harden’s crossover sent Johnson flying backward, but it didn’t end there. Harden then paused just to stare Johnson down before casually sinking a three-pointer on his way to a 25-point night.

The Rockets beat the Clippers, 105-92.

If an ankle-breaker main course with a side order of staring wasn’t brutal enough, Harden had some dessert after the game as he laughed the whole thing off:

The reaction on social media was swift, with some urging Johnson to enter the witness protection program:

Wesley Johnson has to go into a witness protection program. And James Harden must be brought up on charges for snatching this man’s soul. pic.twitter.com/7pM82he8kC — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 1, 2018
