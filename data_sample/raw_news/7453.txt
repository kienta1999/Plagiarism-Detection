Being a little bit extra paid off big for one boyfriend.

Texas State University pre-med student Alexia Dixon sent her boyfriend a mirror selfie while he was at work, and it left him literally on the floor. Dixon shared a screenshot of his incredibly extra reaction on Tuesday via Twitter.

I send my boyfriend some selfies I just took while he's at work and this is his response 😂 pic.twitter.com/nviQOYNjVf — A L E X I A 🌺 (@creoleegyal) January 16, 2018

Dixon’s tweet went viral and people applauded the effort her boyfriend put into the response and congratulated the couple for being relationship goals.
