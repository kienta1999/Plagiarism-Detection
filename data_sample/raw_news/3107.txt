You’re getting more value than usual with your Hulu subscription in April.

The service’s most popular show right now, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” returns for Season 2 on April 25. The horrific yet delightful series about an American family trying to keep their spirits up as The Man keeps knocking them down is well worth the watch. It’s both critic-pleasing (with Emmy wins) and crowd-pleasing, despite its strange penchant for using pop songs to soundtrack atrocities.

Multiple noteworthy movies also join Hulu this month, including many on April 1. So, you don’t have long to wait for new things to watch.

The Robert De Niro-starring classic “Taxi Driver” is one such movie joining on the first of the month. “Man In The Moon,” “50/50,” “Spaceballs” and Donald Glover’s “Mystery Team” are all great. And then there’s movies like “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” and the Justin Long-starring “Accepted,” if you’re into that.

A few reality show episodes also join, including “House Hunters,” “Flip or Flop” and “Property Brothers.” Every few months I Google whether “Property” is those handsome brothers’ last name, and I’m always disappointed (it’s not).

Check out the full list of arrivals and departures below. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining streaming services on a weekly basis, make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.
