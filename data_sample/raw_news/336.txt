At long last the “Saturday Night Live” colonialists finally ribbed the Brits after all the hoopla over the royal wedding.

The downright cheek was delivered in the form of an ersatz “Official Wedding Video 2018.” Prince Harry (Mikey Day) —“aka Ron Sleasley” — holds court at the reception. His bride, sadly, can’t be there. She’s in the hall trying to intercept “some of her white relatives from getting in because they’re mental,” Harry explains.

Kate Middleton (Cecily Strong) blows in tipsy, taking advantage of not being pregnant for once. And Meghan’s great uncle (Kenan Thompson) has his arm slung around a prim Queen Elizabeth (Kate McKinnon). “I was just telling her majesty here,” he says to Harry, “that she should start watching ‘The Crown,’ because they make her look like a bitch on that show.”

Prince William, played by Alex Moffat, is carrying his latest baby in a front pack and drinking a “virgin hot toddy,” i.e. tea. Harry zings his bro: “So sorry to hear that your hair could not make it.”
