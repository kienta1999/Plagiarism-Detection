As far as fake documentation goes, it certainly needed some more work.

An unidentified driver in Milton Keynes, southern England, presented a spoof Homer Simpson license to police during a traffic stop last Sunday night.

In addition to the bogus “Simpsons” identity document, officers also discovered that the man was driving without insurance.

Earlier this week, @tvprp's PC Phillips stopped a car in Milton Keynes.



When she tried to identify the driver's ID, she found the below...



The driver's car was seized and he was reported for driving with no insurance and driving without a proper licence.

“The driver’s car was seized and he was reported for driving with no insurance and driving without a proper license,” Thames Valley Police said on Twitter.

This was presented as a driving licence to us last night in @tvp_mk. Also had no insurance and therefore car seized and reported for both offences. #P6432 pic.twitter.com/JEZq0Fu4y6 — TVP Roads Policing (@tvprp) March 12, 2018

The incident has now gone viral and prompted a plethora of responses from other tweeters:
