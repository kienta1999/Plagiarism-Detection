The two women will develop the project through their respective production companies (Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine and Washington’s Simpson Street) with ABC Signature Studios. The show will be written by “Casual” writer Liz Tigelaar, who will also executive produce and serve as showrunner. Ng will be involved as well and act as a producer.

Though the show has yet to find a home, The Hollywood Reporter has learned that it is being shopped to streaming and premium cable networks.

Ng’s sophomore novel is about the wealthy town of Shaker Heights, Ohio, being torn apart after a white couple adopts a Chinese-American infant and the baby’s birth mother wants her child back.
