Kanye West and John Legend appeared to put their differing opinions about President Donald Trump to the side at a baby shower for Legend’s wife, model Chrissy Teigen.

The longtime collaborating musicians came together at the surprise shindig reportedly thrown by West’s wife Kim Kardashian on Friday night, the day after Legend questioned West’s support of Trump in a private text message that West then shared to Twitter.

West tweeted a snap of the pair hanging out at the bash. “We got love,” he wrote. “Agree to disagree.”

Legend retweeted the post. West later shared footage of Legend playing the instrumental intro to his 2004 hit “Ordinary People” on a piano.

“Lead with love,” West captioned the brief clip:

Teigen, meanwhile, shared this snap of herself, Kardashian and hairstylist Jen Atkin from the party — which appeared to show West and Legend together in the background.
