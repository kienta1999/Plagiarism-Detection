“You used to call girls and get rejected on the phone,” he said. “Now it’s all texting. If you text a girl and they don’t text you right back, it’s over.”

Also in the interview, Spade revealed he watched “all 600 hours” of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding. Then he took a playful swipe at her Hollywood fame, but the joke appeared to fall flat.

“He said he wanted a famous girl from America, that knew the crazy life, the paparazzi and the fame and everything. And I go, ‘Ah, you picked Meghan Markle? OK.’”

“It’s not exactly Jennifer Lawrence,” he continued. “She’s on ‘Suits,’ but she’s not even the most famous person on ‘Suits.’”
