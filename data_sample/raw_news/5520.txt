They all play out the same way.

So much so that The Boston Globe went ahead and wrote its article for this school shooting ― and what seems to be an infinite number of other mass shootings to come ― in advance.

It’s generic, yet exceedingly, tragically accurate. All we don’t know are “who, where, and how many.”

And it’s front page news:

Today's Paper: The same sad script of America's mass shootings, fear and security reminders in Mass. schools, Cruz confesses to shooting students, more. https://t.co/oXoiIQU8kg pic.twitter.com/CowXDBoqcP — The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) February 16, 2018

First, tragedy. The shooter, the gun, the cries of terrified children ― and the anguish of their parents ― will all be the same.
