Seth Meyers took a detailed look at how President Donald Trump’s crusade against the opioid epidemic has progressed.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of “Late Night,” the host concluded that it was not exactly living up to Trump’s campaign promise to solve the crisis.

Meyers acknowledged that some positive steps had been taken, but explained that poor staffing choices and unfulfilled vows to boost funding and resources meant the war was far from over.
