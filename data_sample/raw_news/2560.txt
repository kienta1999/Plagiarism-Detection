Cohen has maintained that Trump was unaware of the arrangement.

The White House has denied the affair. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he never knew about Cohen’s payment, which has drawn scrutiny over the possibility that it could have violated campaign finance laws.

Reports surfaced in March that special counsel Robert Mueller was examining documents pertaining to incidents involving Cohen. Stephen Ryan, Cohen’s lawyer, confirmed to the Times on Monday that the search warrant for the FBI raid stemmed from a referral by Mueller, though it reportedly was not directly related to the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference.

Trump has repeatedly called Mueller’s Russia probe a “hoax” and a “witch hunt,” leading to speculation over whether the president would consider firing the special counsel or otherwise halting the investigation.

On Monday, the president again blasted Mueller’s investigation as “a disgrace” and called the FBI raid of Cohen’s office “a whole new level of unfairness.”

When asked at a military leadership meeting whether he would fire Mueller, Trump responded: “We’ll see what happens ... Many people have said you should fire him.”

On Tuesday morning, Trump resumed his Twitter attacks, blasting the investigation as “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!” and claiming “attorney–client privilege is dead!”
