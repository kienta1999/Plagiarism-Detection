A police community support officer’s impromptu piano playing was music to a 93-year-old crime victim’s ears.

Officer Craig Bull couldn’t resist tickling the ivories after he spotted a piano at the Mansfield, England, home of a nonagenarian whom he and a colleague were checking up on following a theft.

In a heartwarming video that Mansfield Police shared to Facebook on Thursday, Bull sat down at the piano and played some classical music for the retiree.

“It truly made me feel good about myself and the job I do,” wrote Bull. “He felt wanted and reassured.” The whole encounter gave Bull great “job satisfaction,” he added. “It made his day, as you can see in the video.”

The Nottinghamshire Police service later tweeted it was “#proud” of Bull’s actions, which have now gone viral. “It’s staggering how much interest there’s been in the video,” said Bull, who’s been playing piano for almost 40 years.

“As I was playing the piece, when I got to a couple of difficult parts, I could hear him clapping in the background and when I watched the video later, seeing him playing along with his fingers, it was wonderful to see how much pleasure he got from it,” Bull told HuffPost.
