As the featured halftime performer for Sunday’s Super Bowl, Justin Timberlake may have wanted to avoid sensitive subjects at a press conference on Thursday.

But that didn’t happen.

When a reporter asked if Timberlake would support his almost-3-year-old son, Silas, if he wanted to play in the NFL someday, the “Can’t Stop The Feeling!” singer answered: “He will never play football.”

The performer hemmed-and-hawed a moment before adding: “It’s kinda like that thing where my main objective is that he become a great person and if he wants to get into the arts or sports, yeah, I mean, I would fully support that.”
