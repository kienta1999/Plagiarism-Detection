Jimmy Kimmel made fun of President Donald Trump’s upcoming physical during his Thursday night broadcast.

Trump is set to undergo his first White House check-up since taking office on Friday so Kimmel pretended that he obtained the presidential x-ray in advance.

After examining the contents of Trump’s stomach, Kimmel could only ask one question: “How that got in there?”
