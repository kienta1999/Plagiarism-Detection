An unnamed 30-year-old female staffer made a complaint at the time against Clinton’s faith adviser, Burns Strider. The woman said Strider had kissed her on the forehead, rubbed her shoulders and sent her suggestive emails. While Clinton’s campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, reportedly suggested that Strider be removed from his position, Clinton allowed him to stay. Strider was docked pay for several weeks and ordered to attend counseling, while the woman who accused him of harassment was moved to a different role.

Strider did not respond to the Times’ requests for comment.

“I didn’t think firing him was the best solution to the problem,” Clinton wrote in her post on Tuesday. “He needed to be punished, change his behavior, and understand why his actions were wrong. The young woman needed to be able to thrive and feel safe. I thought both could happen without him losing his job.”

Strider was later fired from a different role at Correct the Record, an independent group that supported Clinton’s 2016 presidential run, amid accusations that he harassed a female aide, according to the Times.

“That reoccurrence troubles me greatly. ... Would he have done better – been better – if I had fired him?” Clinton wrote in her post, of his subsequent firing for harassment. “There is no way I can go back 10 years and know the answers. But you can bet I’m asking myself these questions right now.”
