But to many, he’s most famous for his long-running stint on “Wait Wait... Don’t Tell Me!” where his voice was a key prize for contestants: He would record phone messages for the winners. He recorded more than 2,000 personalized voicemails before retiring in 2014 at the age of 80, NPR reported. Listeners can hear some of Kasell’s most noteworthy and hilarious messages on NPR’s website.

The newsman, who turned into an unexpected comedy star late in his career, previously said that his favorite time at the news organization had been when he worked on the quiz show.

In honor of his retirement, NPR flipped the script and invited loyal listeners to leave voicemails for Kasell. By the time he stepped away from the mic, he boasted a 50-year career in broadcasting. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2010.

Peter Sagal, host of “Wait Wait” who worked with Kasell for nearly two decades, spoke of the radio man’s humor. “As soon as he had the chance, Carl dropped his serious newsman persona, because what he really was, and really wanted to be, was funny,” Sagal said.

“He was, and remains, the heart and soul of our show,” Sagal tweeted Tuesday afternoon.
