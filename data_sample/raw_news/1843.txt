First lady Melania Trump attended the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush on Saturday without President Donald Trump, who was visiting one of his golf resorts in Florida.

Melania Trump was seated next to former President Barack Obama during the service, and at one point, the two shared a warm exchange that received plenty of attention on social media.

As organ music played and mourners thumbed through their programs, Obama leaned over and appeared to say something to Trump. Both briefly smiled ― and now, that moment has gone viral on Twitter:

add "make Melania smile" to the long list of things Obama can do that Trump can't — Jeff Tiedrich (@jefftiedrich) April 21, 2018

Do NOT tweet this photo to @realDonaldTrump. He'll hate knowing that the first time Melania cracked a smile in years was during a quiet chat with Obama. pic.twitter.com/4JwBHGUcP5 — Bob Cesca (@bobcesca_go) April 21, 2018

This photo from Barbara Bush’s funeral speaks volumes. After everything Trump has done to Obama, Obama still treats Melania with kindness and respect. What a diplomat and gentleman. That’s a real President. No way Trump would be half this warm to Michelle. pic.twitter.com/7BSqplbdhT — Adam Best (@adamcbest) April 21, 2018

Nothing said class like Obama making Melania smile and feel welcome...knowing she supported her husband’s birther movement and asked on national television to see Obama’s birth certificate. pic.twitter.com/fPbgLr4Mpy — Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) April 21, 2018

It really is the only time we've seen her happy. pic.twitter.com/1ANjQFNK4Y — Turi ✍🏽 (@Turi_TX) April 22, 2018

Haven't seen Melania smile this much in years. She's happier with the Obamas at a funeral than she is with her husband in the White House 😂 pic.twitter.com/pz4WauDxjq — #5 Junie Bey Jones 🐝BΔK SP18 (@BienSur_JeTaime) April 22, 2018

Y'all. Melania is actually happier with Obama at a funeral than she is with Trump at his inauguration dinner!#barbarabushfuneral pic.twitter.com/mDhGqWJjid — ⚠Kimexander Hamilton (@YippeeKimYay) April 21, 2018

This is Melania and Obama sitting together today at former First Lady Barbara Bush's funeral. Have you ever, ever, EVER seen Melania smile like this, and look this relaxed, beside her own husband? Ever? pic.twitter.com/9qYLT2glIH — Steve Silberman (@stevesilberman) April 21, 2018

Poor Melania. You never see her smile. Oh no, hold on... pic.twitter.com/x5oO3RymhU — David Schneider (@davidschneider) April 21, 2018

Only time I’ve seen Melania Trump smile in the last year was yesterday... while sitting next to President Obama — Hilary (@HilareeBanks) April 22, 2018

Finally Melania has something to smile about. She's sitting next to Barack at Barbara Bush's funeral. pic.twitter.com/O4zAr2uQwH — Elayne (laynie) (@LaynieR) April 21, 2018

Sad it took attending a funeral without her husband to see what Melania's natural smile looks like. pic.twitter.com/fAsTkcMFKp — JackWBower (@Trumpet1984) April 23, 2018
