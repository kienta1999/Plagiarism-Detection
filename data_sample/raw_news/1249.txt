It’s a hair-raising theory, but some people are suggesting that a so-called mustache battle is behind the departure of Donald Trump’s lawyer Ty Cobb.

The official word is that Cobb simply wants to retire, but moments after Wednesday’s announcement, Twitter users took to the platform to suggest Cobb’s real reason for leaving was right under his nose.

The rumor started to snowball. Some suggested Bolton’s stache pushed out Cobb’s.

HOW IT REALLY WENT DOWN...

Some just lamented the departure of Cobb and his incredible facial hair.

BREAKING: Ty Cobb is retiring. He's out. It's a shame because he was a moderating force in the White House. He was not a part of the swamp. And he had a kick ass mustache. 😁He'll be replaced by Emmet Flood

Meanwhile, some want to recognize the end of a facial hair era that we may not ever see again.
