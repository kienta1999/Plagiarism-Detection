A plucky squirrel was inches away from meeting its maker at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Saturday morning.

Austrian snowboarder Daniela Ulbing narrowly avoided striking the critter after it bounded onto the course during the women’s parallel giant slalom heat.

Perhaps even more incredibly, Ulbing maintained her composure enough to win the race. The close call sparked plenty of reaction on Twitter:
