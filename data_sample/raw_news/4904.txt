“Mr. Wynn has never been supplied with these unsubstantiated accounts or the names of these accusers by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department,” the statement said. “It’s revolting that the media repeated such inflammatory claims from events that supposedly occurred four decades ago without the slightest bit of fact-checking or skepticism. This is not journalism. It is the peddling of smut and it is atrociously unfair to Mr. Wynn, his family and friends. Mr. Wynn is left to ask this simple question: When did we abandon such fundamental fairness, due process and decency?”

A spokesman for Wynn Resorts declined to comment, noting Wynn no longer works for the company.
