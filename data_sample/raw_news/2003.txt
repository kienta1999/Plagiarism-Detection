Word that Erin Popovich, the wife of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, had died at age 67 on Wednesday generated heartfelt reactions from the basketball world.

The couple had been married four decades and had two children and two grandchildren, according to the team. She had an extended illness, ESPN reported.

Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant, whose team is playing the Spurs in the playoffs, said, via ESPN: “I just want Pop to know that the whole NBA family is supporting him and got his back through it all. It’s bigger than the game. It’s bigger than winning and losing.”

“I love Pop,” a visibly upset LeBron James said in the clip below. “Such a tragedy. My best wishes go out to Pop and his family. That’s devastating news. The NBA family, we all stick together. I know we compete every night. But something like this happens, it puts everything in perspective.”
