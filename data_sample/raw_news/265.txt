Two teen murderers killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999 while wearing trench coats. They were initially incorrectly described as members of a group known as the “Trench Coat Mafia.”

The Texas lieutenant governor said the problem in the Santa Fe attack was that there were “too many entrances” to the school. National Rifle Association head Oliver North blamed too many teenagers on Ritalin and a culture of violence.
