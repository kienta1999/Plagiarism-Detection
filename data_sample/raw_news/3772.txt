President Donald Trump wrote a celebratory tweet hours after former FBI deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed McCabe on Friday, two days before the deputy director was due to take formal retirement. Trump said it had been “a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI” and “a great day for Democracy.”

Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2018

“Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy,” Trump added. “He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!”

Sessions fired McCabe for an alleged lack of candor during a review of how the FBI and Justice Department handled a probe into Hillary Clinton.
