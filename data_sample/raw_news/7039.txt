Kim Kardashian was being Kim Kardashian on an episode of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” Sunday when a Twitter user griped that she’s “sooo self-absorbed.”

Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she’s saying Nothing.. 🙊 lol.. & I Like the Kardashians 💃🏽 #KUWTK — Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018

The criticism could have easily passed like a shout in the social media wind, but the reality star and beauty magnate didn’t let that happen. She actually responded. Bluntly. Hilariously.

No it’s not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018
