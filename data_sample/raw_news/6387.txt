President Donald Trump ordered the release of a secret memo that’s the centerpiece of the latest controversy surrounding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation into Russian election interference.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) wrote the memo, which Republicans claim features shocking information that proves FBI bias against Trump. Democrats argue the memo omits key facts, allowing for a GOP-influenced narrative that distracts from the Russia probe.

Trump’s push to release the memo prompted a response from the FBI, its first public clash under Director Christopher Wray with a president who’s often critical of the bureau.

“The F.B.I. was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the bureau said in a statement referencing the House Intelligence Committee. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”
