President Donald Trump‚Äôs stock market boom boasts are coming back to bite him.

Trump hasn‚Äôt shied away from claiming credit for surging indices in recent months. On Jan. 20, he tweeted about bringing ‚Äúunprecedented success‚Äù to the U.S. with a ‚Äúrecord stock market‚Äù:

Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2018

And in his State of the Union speech, Trump bragged about how the stock market‚Äôs surge was directly affecting Americans.

‚ÄúThe stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThat is great news for Americans‚Äô 401(k), retirement, pension and college savings accounts.‚Äù

But on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 index both took massive tumbles and suffered their biggest percentage drops in seven years.

People on Twitter were keen to let Trump take equal credit for the plunge:

Impossible. I was very clearly told that Donald Trump has completely turned around the economy and that the stock market would rise forever. https://t.co/78bEkxwVyc ‚Äî Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) February 5, 2018

Donald Trump: I am responsible for the amazing stock market performance!

Dow Jones fell nearly 1,200 points erasing its gains for the entire year and marking largest daily points plunge in history. #StockMarket has lost over $1 trillion dollars in value over the last 5 days. Why is Donald Trump not tweeting about it? They‚Äôd never stop if it was Obama ‚Äî ‚ôªÔ∏è Christopher Zullo (@ChrisJZullo) February 5, 2018

People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 1,175 points, after they bought stocks based on the False and Dishonest market hype of Donald Trump, should consider hiring a lawyer and suing him. https://t.co/pEi8KLEqPT ‚Äî Will Saletan (@saletan) February 5, 2018
