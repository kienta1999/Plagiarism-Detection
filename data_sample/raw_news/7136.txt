A half-baked SAG Awards graphic on Sunday showed that Judi Dench of “Victoria & Abdul” was among the nominees for outstanding female actor in a “leading roll.”

Viewers didn’t need any buttering up to pounce on the typo.

Great to see this nomination for Central alum Dame Judi Dench by @SAGawards! We always hoped she'd be a breadwinner #leadingroll https://t.co/Oq99uaHZP6 pic.twitter.com/rH872dxEf4 — Central (@CSSDLondon) January 22, 2018

I guess Judi Dench is playing a tumbler. Or maybe a bagel.... pic.twitter.com/TZMNxYNVSF — Andrew Passons (@AndrewP97) January 22, 2018
