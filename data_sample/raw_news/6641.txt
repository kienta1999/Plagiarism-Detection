BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z have reached dizzying heights of fame, but theyâ€™re not too big to be brought down a notch or two by their daughter, Blue Ivy.

Watch the adorable 6-year-old quiet her parents during Camila Cabelloâ€™s speech at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Blue Ivy deftly deployed the universal shush finger to BeyoncÃ© so she would stop clapping, then followed with a sort of put-on-the-brakes gesture with her hand to keep both mom and dad in check.

How cute is that?

The kid may have a producing career in front of her with the way sheâ€™s already calling the shots.
