President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Stormy Daniels’ claim that a man threatened her in order to silence her about an affair with Trump “a total con job.”

Referencing a police sketch of the man released a day earlier, Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory that suggests the image actually depicts Daniels’ husband.

Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said that, in 2011, a man approached her and her young daughter in a parking lot and told her to “forget about this story, leave Mr. Trump alone.”

“Oh it’s a beautiful little girl, would be a shame if something happened to her mom,” Daniels said the man told her.

Wednesday’s tweet was the president’s second direct response to allegations he had a sexual relationship with the adult film star. Earlier this month, he said he was unaware that his personal lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016 paid Daniels $130,000.

Cohen told reporters that he paid Daniels with his own money and that the Trump campaign was not involved.
