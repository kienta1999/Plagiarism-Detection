Gus Kenworthy, fresh off a Winter Olympics that saw his profile soar for being an openly gay athlete, will be the grand marshal of the Miami Beach Gay Pride parade, Sunday, April 8, beginning at noon along Ocean Avenue.

Kenworthy, a freestyle skier, will be joined at the head of the parade by Roxanne Vargas, a local TV anchor who is designated as the ally grand marshal.

“Gus and Roxy are two preeminent public figures who well represent and support the LGBTQ community. Gus for being a role model as an out and proud sportsman who excels at his craft and Roxy for being a prominent ally for the community and equal rights,” said Mark Fernandes, chairman of the Pride board of directors.

Kenworthy did not medal at the Pyeongchang Games, but became a sensation after his kiss with boyfriend Matt Wilkas before the slopestyle competition was aired live on NBC. Along with skater Adam Rippon, Kenworthy became an important symbol of living and thriving as an out athlete. Both men came out as gay in 2015.

Miami Beach Gay Pride is one of the earliest LGBT events in the nation, so it’s possible that this won’t be the only parade where Kenworthy is the grand marshal.
