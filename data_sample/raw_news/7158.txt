It’s not surprising that social distancing can put a strain on relationships. If you’re quarantined with your significant other, you might still be adjusting to so much time together or trying to be a supportive partner during this stressful and unprecedented time. If you’re social distancing separately from your S.O., this might be the longest you’ve gone without seeing them, even if you were already in a long-distance relationship.

Sometimes all that person needs is a reminder of how much you mean to them and how special you think they are. But in a time where you can’t really pick them up a gift or take them on a real date, how can you surprise them?

Fortunately, there are plenty of gifts that can be signed, sealed and delivered to your partner, whether you’re married or just started dating. Miss going to your favorite restaurant or bar for dinners and drinks? Surprise them with a cocktail or meal kit subscription that you can make and enjoy together or via a Zoom date.
