Tom Hardy is an actor known for physical transformations, be it sporting tribal tattoos for FX’s “Taboo,” developing a strapping physique for 2008’s ”Bronson” and then again for 2012’s “The Dark Knight Rises,” or donning a mask in two separate Christopher Nolan films (“The Dark Knight Rises” and “Dunkirk”), as well as, for a time, in George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road.” Nonetheless, his latest big-screen makeover may be his most drastic one yet — to the point that fans may not recognize him at all.

Hardy is next set to star as Eddie Brock, a reporter who bonds with an alien symbiote to become a spidery antihero in this October’s Marvel-based superhero film “Venom.” After that, however, he’ll be embodying one of America’s most notorious criminals, Al Capone, in “Fonzo,” about the 47-year-old mobster’s struggles with dementia following his 10-year stint in prison.

As proven by new photos from the ongoing production — in which Hardy chomps on a cigar, fires a rifle and wields a fishing rod while aboard a boat — he has packed on the pounds and lost some hair to play the iconic criminal, to the point that he barely looks like himself any longer. Which, in turn, is a stark contrast to the below sneak peek of a far more svelte Hardy in the role, which the actor posted on Instagram in late March:

Co-starring Matt Dillon as Capone’s friend Johnny, Linda Cardellini as his wife, Mae, and Kyle MacLachlan as his doctor, Karlock, the film will be the first behind-the-camera effort for writer-director Josh Trank since 2015’s troubled, and dismally received, “Fantastic Four,” whose failure reportedly contributed to his departure from a standalone “Star Wars” feature rumored to focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett. “Fonzo” doesn’t yet have a release date.
