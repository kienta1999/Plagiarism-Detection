Booking travel to take advantage of a flash sale or expiring travel deal is a pretty stressful endeavor. Not to mention then having to whip out a credit card and plug in all of those numbers before the time runs out and you’ve missed out on your $200 flight to California.

That’s why we sometimes opt for easy pay sites like PayPal that make it super efficient for you to check out and check out quickly. The good news is that PayPal has several participating business partners who accept the payment service for bookings on travel like flights, hotels, cruises and vacations.
