Beyoncé took the stage again at Coachella in Indio, California, over the weekend ― and this time she hit the floor.

Another fave moment was when Bey tried to pick up Solange and they fell lol pic.twitter.com/VWhkJqHXqS — queen miskeen (@agerenesh) April 22, 2018

There were no apparent injuries, but lots of laughter as they kicked up their feet for a few moments.

“Give it up for my sister!” Beyoncé said.

The funny moment happened Saturday, and the Beyhive was still buzzing about it on Monday:

Reason #1638506037262 why Beyoncé is the artist of my life: she falls and laughs at herself. #ClumsyIsCool https://t.co/uNICyH2fVu — 🌻Skye Alexis✨ (@HeavenlySkyes) April 22, 2018
