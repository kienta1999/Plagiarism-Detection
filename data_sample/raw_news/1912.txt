The memos of former FBI Director James Comey released to congressional leaders provide a trove of insight into President Donald Trump’s priorities and concerns.

They reinforce Trump’s widely reported obsession with pinning down leakers, his desire to protect his own reputation at all costs, and his preoccupation with loyalty. They also reveal snippets of conversation difficult to imagine happening inside the sanctum of the leader of the free world.

Here are some of the nuttiest parts:

Trump had doubts about Michael Flynn from the start.

The president felt his first national security adviser Michael Flynn had “serious judgment issues” after finding out that Flynn didn’t alert him soon enough to a congratulatory call from a world leader, according to Comey.

He made the comment during a lunch with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, whom Trump thanked for being the first world leader to call him and express her congratulations. Flynn, according to Comey, then told the president that another world leader had actually called first. Though the name was redacted in Comey’s memos, that person was Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to both The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press.

Trump on Friday responded to the memo, assailing Comey for making notes “so General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed.”
