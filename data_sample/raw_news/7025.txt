Greta Gerwig became only the fifth woman in history to be nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards.

Gerwig’s nomination for “Lady Bird” was announced on Tuesday morning and met with much happiness on social media:

The previous four female directors to have been nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are Lina Wertmuller in 1977, Jane Campion in 1994, Sofia Coppola in 2004, and Kathryn Bigelow in 2010. Bigelow notably won for “The Hurt Locker,” and is the only woman to have won the category.

“Lady Bird” was not just a massive success in the Best Director category, but took home five nominations in total, getting the nod for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress (for Saoirse Ronan) and Best Supporting Actress (for Laurie Metcalf).

Despite “Lady Bird” being a widely celebrated film that won Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards, Gerwig herself was left out of the Globe’s directing category ― a dig that led Natalie Portman to make a sassy comment at the show about the category being dominated by men.
