“The next thing that I, quite frankly, heard about it was that this $31,000 table had been bought,” Carson testified on Tuesday during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing. “I said, ‘What the heck is that all about?’ I investigated, I immediately had it canceled. Not that we don’t need the furniture, but I thought that that was excessive.”

Emails that the liberal watchdog group American Oversight obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that both Carson and his wife were involved in selecting the furniture.
