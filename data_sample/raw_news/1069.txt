“A storm’s a comin’, baby,” Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) cautions in a phone call.

“What do you need for this to all go away?” Baldwin/Trump asks earlier in the skit.

“A resignation,” she responds, to a hoot from the audience.

“Yeah right. Being president is like doing porn — once you do it, it’s hard to do anything else,” Baldwin/Trump explains.

The cold open was chock-a-block full of shaky White House characters — and stars — from Martin Short’s Dr. Harold Bornstein, to Ben Stiller’s Michael Cohen and Aidy Bryant’s Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Kate McKinnon pulled off yet another mind-boggling transformation, this time as Rudy Giuliani, who Trump calls the “greatest legal mind” since “My Cousin Vinny.”

“Cohen” has a question for “Giuliani” on the phone, and asks if he’s alone. “I’m pretty much alone,” McKinnon says — from the set of Fox News.

Scarlett Johansson’s Ivanka Trump pops up with Jimmy Fallon’s hysterical Jared Kushner to phone Stiller with a question: “Did we hear Giuliani call Jared ‘disposable’ on national television?” “Ivanka” asks. “Because Jared is furious.”

“Cohen” tells the first daughter that, yes, her father would “throw Jared under the bus in a heartbeat, “but she’ll be safe.

“What did he say?” asks Fallon. Johansson smiles: “He said you’re fine.”

And everything is being recorded by the FBI.
