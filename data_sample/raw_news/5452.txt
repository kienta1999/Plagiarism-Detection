Each time Japan’s figure skating star, Yuzuru Hanyu , concludes a routine, his fans throw their replica golden bears into the rink. It was no different after he scooped a gold medal in the men’s individual figure skating event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The practice reportedly began back in 2010 after fans spotted Hanyu carrying a Pooh-themed tissue box cover. Per The New York Times, the bear has now become Hanyu’s lucky mascot. As for the dozens of toys that rained down onto the ice in Pyeongchang, they will be donated to local charities.
