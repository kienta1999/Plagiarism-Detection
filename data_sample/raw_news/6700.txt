After skipping the red carpet, Rihanna turned heads when she hit the stage in a high-shine trench coat with Kendrick Lamar to accept the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for their collaboration on “Loyalty.” The award was Rihanna’s ninth Grammy.

The trench, worn as a dress with slouched boots and gloves, made Twitter go wild:
