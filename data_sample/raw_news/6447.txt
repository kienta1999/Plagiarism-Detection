Amazon is adding some recent cult favorites to its film lineup this month. Both “Good Time” and “Logan Lucky” had great reviews in 2017, so you’re in for a treat if you missed them when they first hit theaters.

The Amazon original shows debuting this month are also tempting. “Absentia” is a very solid crime thriller. “Mozart in the Jungle” has the occasional truly great episode. And “The Tick” has already established itself as a fan favorite.

Here are a few highlights arriving on the streaming service this month:

Movies: “The Warriors,” “Good Time,” “Logan Lucky”

Shows: “Absentia,” “Grand Prix Driver,” “Mozart in the Jungle,” “The Tick”
