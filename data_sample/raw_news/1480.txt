Yet this time around, Reid had steadfastly denied writing the posts, claiming on Monday her blog was hacked and that a cybersecurity expert had identified “unauthorized activity.” This appears to contradict with her Saturday comments alleging the outside experts were unable to prove she was hacked.

Reid did not address on Saturday her seemingly contradictory statements about the alleged hacking or detail whether cybersecurity experts were continuing to investigate the matter.

A representative for MSNBC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about Reid’s differing statements.

Jonathan Nichols, Reid’s hired cybersecurity consultant, said in a statement Tuesday that he “found evidence Joy Reid’s now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, was breached after a review of suspicious activity.” He did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Reid’s comments Saturday that appeared to state otherwise.

As HuffPost and other outlets have reported, only a pretty bizarre course of events would have led to those allegedly fraudulent homophobic blog posts.
