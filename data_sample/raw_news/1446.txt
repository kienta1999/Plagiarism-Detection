The second daughter of former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama spent some time with the rappers Cardi B and Offset over the weekend at Washington’s Broccoli City Festival.

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper and Offset, her fiancee and member of the band Migos, headlined the music event ― which, yes, is actually called the Broccoli City Festival ― and they apparently spent some downtime backstage with Sasha Obama.

How did this trio get together? We have no idea, but 16-year-old Sasha looks like she’s been part of the gang for ages.

People on Twitter were shook about the hangout, Sasha growing up, and everything in between:

Sasha Obama is definitely the Obama who has been writing down everything they been saying about her Pops & she's gonna want all the smoke when she's old enough. She's gonna be President in like 30 years. https://t.co/7zhXeSSo3i — 🇪🇨 J.A.M.🇪🇨 (@MrAcosta89) April 29, 2018
