Football fans were utterly distressed Sunday night as the New England Patriots secured a spot in yet another Super Bowl.

The Patriots scored in the last quarter of the AFC championship against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 20-24 win. Jacksonville was leading for the majority of the game and was up by 3 points in the fourth quarter when Patriots receiver Danny Amendola scored with less than 3 minutes left in the game.

This marks the eighth Super Bowl appearance for the team since 2000, and while Patriots fans are rejoicing, quite a few football fans are tired of the team’s repeated arrival to the biggest game in the NFL.

Twitter was overrun with disapproval and despair.

wife: how do the patriots keep doing this?

Me: because we live in a fallen world where evil must exist to facilitate an appreciation of joy. this too shall pass
