“Acrimony” director Tyler Perry told Jimmy Kimmel Monday what went down in his weekend bidding war against Blue Ivy at a charity art auction.

The 6-year-old daughter of Jay-Z and Beyoncé charmed the internet in footage that showed her bidding $19,000 for a painting of Sidney Poitier at LA’s Wearable Art Gala on Saturday.

Perry victoriously countered with a $20,000 offer, joking to Kimmel that he was glad to teach the pint-sized painting collector a lesson.

“You’re not gonna get everything you want!” Perry said.
