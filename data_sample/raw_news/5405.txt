This is Winter Olympics history in the making.

Leslie Jones, Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir are “Crazy in Love” with Pyeongchang, South Korea, in a Beyoncé-inspired video they created Sunday:

“Saturday Night Live” comedian Jones joined Olympians-turned-NBC analysts Lipinski and Weir to bust out some moves to Queen Bey’s 2003 hit in a hallway.

It was well-received on Twitter:
