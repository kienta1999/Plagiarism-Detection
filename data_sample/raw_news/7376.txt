With two months until “Silicon Valley” returns and, ugh, a year until “Game of Thrones” dominates our Sundays once again, what’s an HBO lover to do? Luckily, the premium cable company announced the first half of its 2018 documentary slate today.

From Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s final months to Mariska Hargitay’s investigation of rape kit backlog (we never said it was uplifting), here are nine original docs debuting on HBO the first half of this year.
