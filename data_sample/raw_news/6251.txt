Actress Arielle Kebbel’s sister has been missing for days, and she’s asking people on social media to help in the search.

Kebbel, who’s starred in TV series like “Unreal,” “Ballers” and “Vampire Diaries,” is trying to locate Julia Kebbel, who apparently was last seen on the night of Jan. 31 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles walking her chocolate Labrador.

The actress took to Instagram last week to alert her followers and provide photos and details about her sister’s disappearance.

“ALERT. My SiSTER JULIA KEBBEL is MISSING. She was last seen in silver lake, walking her chocolate lab, Cindy, at 11 pm wed night. 1/31/18,” the star wrote.

People reported there was a fire in Julia Kebbel’s apartment the day she went missing.

Arielle Kebbel later posted a missing persons flyer with her sister’s description.

“She has tattoos on both fore arms. She has a spiritual symbol with a key and the words promise on one forearm and a blue Phoenix rising on the other,” the flyer says.
