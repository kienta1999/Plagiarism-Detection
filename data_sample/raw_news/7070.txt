Philipps appeared to go the extra mile for her hurting friend. She shared a sunset photo she took from a plane with a red-heart emoji before she and Williams were pictured together.

Williams and Ledger fell in love on the set of “Brokeback Mountain” and had a daughter Matilda in 2005. They broke up as a couple just months before his death on Jan. 22, 2008, from an accidental overdose at age 28. In 2009, he posthumously won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for playing the Joker in “The Dark Knight.”
