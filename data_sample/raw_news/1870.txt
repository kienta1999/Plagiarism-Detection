Trump described Cohen, who is at the center of a federal investigation into reports he paid off two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump, as “a fine person with a wonderful family.”

Haberman responded with this tweet, in which she mocked Trump for initially misspelling her name in a now-deleted tweet and suggested that her article reporting that Cohen would no longer “take a bullet” for Trump could have sparked the president’s anger:
