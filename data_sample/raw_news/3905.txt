Demi Lovato marked six years of sobriety on Wednesday, and her fans celebrated with her.

The “Sorry Not Sorry” singer proudly tweeted her anniversary, saying she was grateful for her joy while reminding those struggling that kicking substance abuse “IS possible.”

Just officially turned 6 years sober. So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible. 🙏🏼 — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) March 15, 2018

The former Disney Channel star has been fairly open about her battle with drugs and alcohol.

She’s had her temptations, like her recently disclosed night at the 2016 Met Gala that nearly drove her to drink and sent her right into an AA meeting. But that became just one of many obstacles the 25-year-old Grammy nominee has overcome.

“What keeps me on this path is there’s a drive that I have to stay sober because I know that my life depends on it,” Lovato told “Entertainment Tonight” last year. “If I would have continued down that road, I don’t know if I’d be here today.”

People on Twitter congratulated Lovato.
