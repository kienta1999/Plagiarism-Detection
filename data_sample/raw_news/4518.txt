Cochran, who has been battling health problems for quite some time, is not up for re-election this year. The seven-term Republican was absent from the Senate late last year as he recovered from urinary tract infections.

Cochran denied that he was physically unfit for office, CNN reported at the time. But his resignation could help the political fortunes of his colleague, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).
