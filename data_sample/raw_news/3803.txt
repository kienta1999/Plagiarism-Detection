To sum up the “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” trailer that dropped Thursday, we need only borrow the words of two regulars in the clip.

“We’re older, but I don’t think many of us are wiser,” Ronnie Ortiz-Magro said amid new rounds of drinking and fist-pumping ― the kind of behavior that attracted big ratings for the gang in the original “Jersey Shore.”

Indeed, a few more birthdays do not appear to have inspired wisdom. That’s why we can’t wait for April 5, when the Miami-transplanted “Family Vacation” debuts on MTV.

“As we age, we just get more delinquency,” Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi said (in a slightly mangled thought) above.

Cheers to that.
