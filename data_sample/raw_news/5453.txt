TV host Bill Maher posed a question for President Donald Trump’s supporters on Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time.”

“What is left for you?” Maher asked, after dissecting the day’s earlier news that a federal grand jury empaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller had indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election and seeking to boost Trump’s campaign.

“[Trump is] plainly a traitor who doesn’t defend his own country,” said Maher.

The comedian went on to note how the president this week had backtracked on his campaign pledge not to cut certain programs in the budget.

“These Trump supporters, they’re not conservatives,” said Maher. “They’re Drew Barrymore in ‘50 First Dates.’ If you lose your memory every night, it all starts to make sense.”
