Daniels says she and Trump had the affair in 2006, and Trump attorney Michael Cohen arranged the payout to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence her ― an exchange that may be illegal. Now, Daniels is fighting in court to get out of the agreement.

The adult film star, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told Penthouse Magazine that if she wins, she’ll give the money to the family planning organization in Trump and Cohen’s names, according to The Daily Beast. Penthouse will feature Daniels in an in-depth interview titled “Getting Intimate With The Most Wanted Woman In America,” which hits newsstands on May 8, the Daily Beast reported.

The interview will reportedly contain some “NSFW” details that were excluded from Daniels’ recent “60 Minutes” interview.

“He knows I’m telling the truth,” Daniels told “60 Minutes” about Trump, who has denied the affair ever happened.

Daniels says the affair with Trump started a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to Trump’s youngest son, Barron. Her story received renewed attention in January when it was revealed that Trump attorney Cohen arranged a $130,000 payment.
