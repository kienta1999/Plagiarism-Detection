Looks like it’s good riddance to the bad blood between Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.

On Tuesday, Swift posted a tweet showing that Perry had sent her an olive branch as a gift to celebrate the opening night of her stadium tour in Glendale, Arizona.

The olive branch ― an ancient sign of peace ― came with a note that began:

“Hey old friend, I have been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us. I really want to clear the air ...”

TMZ reports that Perry also wrote she was “deeply sorry” about something, but the outlet wasn’t able to read further.

The peace offering came after Perry appeared to take a shot at Swift on “American Idol.”

Last May, Perry told talk show host James Corden the feud started when some of her usual dancers went to perform with Swift.

Perry said she had no problem with this, but asked the dancers to make sure their contracts included a provision allowing them to bow out when Perry went back on tour in a year.

She said that when she was getting ready to tour, the dancers went to Swift’s management to discuss leaving ― and got fired.

As you might expect, the news that the two stars’ feud is over sent shock waves through the world.

Some people put the thaw in proper perspective.

If Katy Perry can stop hating Taylor Swift, every random verified blogger with less than 3,000 followers can too. — xgiacoppox126-Vinnie (@xgiacoppox126) May 8, 2018
