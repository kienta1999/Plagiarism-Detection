Oh my, my, my, Troye Sivan‚Äôs latest single off his upcoming album is a sweaty, sensual dance party. And fans are LOVING it.

‚ÄúBuzz cut/I got my tongue between your teeth/Go slow./No, no go fast/You like it just as much as me,‚Äù the saucy lyrics say.

The song, entitled ‚ÄúMy My My!,‚Äù dropped with a flashy new video directed by Grant Singer.

By ‚Äúflashy,‚Äù we mean literally flashy: The video comes with a sensitivity warning for those with ‚Äúphotosensitive epilepsy.‚Äù If you can‚Äôt bear to watch, think lots of flashing lights, intimate close-ups, and hips gyrating.

Despite the warning, Twitter users have come out in droves to share their support for the seductive tune:
