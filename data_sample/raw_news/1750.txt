Fox’s popular buddy cop comedy “Lethal Weapon” may look very different in Season 3.

Clayne Crawford — who has co-starred as Martin Riggs opposite Damon Wayans’ Roger Murtaugh since the show’s premiere in 2016 — has reportedly created an on-set atmopshere so toxic that it’s threatening the show’s renewal, according to an exclusive report from Deadline.

The entertainment site claims that the 40-year-old actor has a “history of bad behavior” on the series and has been “disciplined several times over complaints of emotional abuse and creating a hostile environment.” His behavior has become so extreme, the report alleges, that other actors and crew members “feel uncomfortable being on set with him.”

Crawford responded to the allegations in an Instagram post on Tuesday, writing that he had been reprimanded twice on set.

“I am sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts,” he wrote. Crawford added that he attended “studio-appointed” therapy as a result of a clash with a guest director and assistant director.

Of the show’s fans, Crawford wrote, “I hope they will stick with me, and stick with the show.”

According to Deadline, the network is allegedly considering recasting its co-lead if the show is indeed picked up for a third season — which the outlet notes that it likely will due to its solid ratings. The current season averages around 4.25 million viewers per episode.

“Lethal Weapon” airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.
