The Washington Post’s first edition headline covering President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address didn’t go over well on social media.

Twitter users panned the original five-column headline:

The Washington Post

By the time the evening was over, the newspaper had given its front page a major makeover, replacing the “call for bipartisanship” of what many called a highly-partisan and even extremist speech with a quote from the address instead.

Ironically, that line was first delivered by Hillary Clinton in 2010:

The Washington Post

While it’s not unusual for newspapers to undergo changes between editions, it’s unclear what role the more than 3,000 comments on Twitter ― mostly negative ― played in this case.

The newspaper later released a statement saying those changes were in fact due to newsroom discussions and not the social media outcry.

Executive editor Martin Baron said the early headline was for an edition with a 9:15 pm ET deadline, just as Trump was starting his speech.

“As the speech was being delivered and observed, editors quickly concluded that a different headline would better reflect the full speech,” he said, adding:

“Like most newspapers, The Post often rethinks, refines and rewrites headlines from one edition to the next based on its own internal discussions about what best captures the nature of a story. Headline changes last night were based exclusively on our customary internal conversations.”

Here is some of the reaction to both the initial headline and the later version:

Are you insane? He equated immigrants with Ms-13 and want to stop family reunification . No way. That's as divisive as it comes. — Arriadna 🗽 (@Arriadna) January 31, 2018

it would be nice if



a) you didn't need to be scolded into fixing a ridiculous headline

Congrats on a headline you absolutely, positively won't regret tomorrow. — Kevin M. Kruse (@KevinMKruse) January 31, 2018

Twelve editions from now, you'll have it absolutely nailed. — The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) January 31, 2018

You do realize that line, the "new Anerican moment" line, was lifted from a Hillary Clinton speech in 2010. It was a very Melania moment indeed. — mikey_shriver (@mikey_shriver) January 31, 2018

I guess WTF was too pithy? — Bronco Bama (@BronckoBamma) January 31, 2018

why is it not obvious to you that this is also bad? — Eric Armstrong (@_ericarmstrong) January 31, 2018

Keep trying. — Cari Dick (@CariDick) January 31, 2018

In its second attempt at a cover, Wa Po is still sanitizing and normalizing DT’s speech. #sotu pic.twitter.com/kC4BVVep42 — Nia Spencer (@niaaspencer) January 31, 2018
