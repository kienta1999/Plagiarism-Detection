Like father, like son.

Donald Trump Jr. used Twitter to launch an unprovoked attack on U.S. Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon on Tuesday night.

President Donald Trumpâ€™s eldest son responded to a report in The Hill that said Rippon, 28, didnâ€™t want his experience at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to be defined by his stance against Vice President Mike Pence.

Really? Then Perhaps you shouldnâ€™t have spent the past few weeks talking about him. I havenâ€™t heard him mention you once??? https://t.co/8lcCsoyBsq â€” Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 14, 2018

Trump Jr. overlooked one key detail. Pence mentioned Rippon on Twitter just last week, and also reportedly asked to meet with him before the Winter Games.

.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Donâ€™t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get â€˜em! â€” Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8, 2018

Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics, helped Team USA win a bronze medal in the figure skating team event on Monday. Last month, he called out Penceâ€™s intolerance toward the LGBTQ community, and blasted the vice presidentâ€™s decision to lead the U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. The athlete also said heâ€™d rebuff a White House invite to a post-Games party.

Rippon has not commented on Trump Jr.â€™s tweet.

Some respondents suggested the skater should leave politics out of the Olympics. The majority, however, called out Trump Jr.:

Hey, Don...Itâ€™s really not like you to get your facts wrong...What would your father say about you spreading FAKE NEWS? SAD! pic.twitter.com/yngPsDhTFj â€” Eoin O'Callaghan (@EoinOCallaghan) February 14, 2018

Sorry...Does that contradict the LIES you have been told by Fox? pic.twitter.com/eqYZgPKvl0 â€” Rose Nelson (@RoseNels1951) February 14, 2018

Mike Pence tweeted about him explicitly. â€” C (@c_f_392) February 14, 2018

I dunno Donny... I like @Adaripp - He seems charming, talented, hardworking and passionate... ya know, all the things youâ€™re lacking. â€” Joshua Mann (@JoshuaLeeMann) February 14, 2018

Dude, go. Away. Shut up. Please. Pence hasnâ€™t talked about him? Yes. Yes he has. Pence has also, in his lifetime, been a prejudicial dickbag against all gay people. â€” Tal (@giantcu92) February 14, 2018

How many times has POTUS wished OUR Olympians good luck at the games so far since they began? ZERO !! â€” C. Rafael Parish (@parishiner) February 14, 2018

Ummm... your father attacked the entire NFL all summer just because some of them kneeled.



They kneeled to protest racially biased police brutality.



Yeah, your father had a problem with people not wanting to get shot for no reason. â€” Victor Stoddard (@VicStoddard) February 14, 2018

WHY do you do this? Just sit back and count your money itâ€™s much more becoming than attacking Olympic athletes over political views! â€” Paul Neaville (@pneaville) February 14, 2018

Honestly he hasnâ€™t said anything insulting, the only reason heâ€™s even mentioned him so much is because NBC wonâ€™t stop asking him about it. â€” Jenna Wallgren (@TwoLLsOneE) February 14, 2018
