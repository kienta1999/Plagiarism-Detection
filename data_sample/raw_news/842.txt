Olinsky’s future was already looking precarious in the previous episode. After landing behind bars on an unjust murder charge, he was stabbed.

Olinsky died early on Wednesday’s finale, giving viewers plenty of time to sound off on social media.

Executive producer Rick Eid explained to Entertainment Weekly why the show killed off good ol’ Al. “From a dramatic point of view, we all thought it was really interesting,” he said.

One Twitter user urged the show to somehow rescind Olinsky’s ascendance to TV detective heaven.

Ok. Enough! Find a way to raise Al from the dead!!! Love #EliasKoteas — Angela Harrison (@Angela_s_harris) May 10, 2018
