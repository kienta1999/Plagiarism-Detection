Mother’s Day isn’t just about celebrating the woman who gave birth to you.

For many, Mother’s Day is a day to celebrate all of the empowering mother figures who’ve supported them throughout their life. From sisters, aunts and grandmothers, to step-mothers, mothers-in-law, friends and mentors, female love and support comes from all kinds of people in your life.

No matter the role these women have played in your life, they deserve some love and recognition. And you can show that love by showering them with some of the Best Mother’s Day Gifts for 2021. They may be surprised, but, you know, they’re worth it.

And you can’t forget the most important part: the card. If you’re looking to celebrate all of the badass, supportive women you know, check out these alternative cards for the women you love who aren’t your mom:
