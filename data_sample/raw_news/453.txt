Former Mexican President Vicente Fox issued a cutting rejoinder to President Donald Trump on Wednesday night after Trump angrily called immigrants “animals.”

Fox used Twitter to hit back after Trump’s anti-immigration rant during a White House meeting with California leaders.

“You’ve got to get your shit together,” Fox tweeted at Trump.

.@realDonaldTrump, you’ve got to get your shit together: migrants are people who have left everything behind - not by choice, to pursue a better life. You must show compassion and humanity. your golden head and a #FuckingWall won’t stop these people’s dreams and hopes. https://t.co/JC1NETBKqP — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) May 17, 2018

“Migrants are people who have left everything behind — not by choice, to pursue a better life,” Fox added. “You must show compassion and humanity. Your golden head and a #FuckingWall won’t stop these people’s dreams and hopes.”

Fox has repeatedly criticized Trump over his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and force Mexico to pay for it. In April, he promoted a T-shirt portraying Trump as a baby constructing a wall from toy bricks.
