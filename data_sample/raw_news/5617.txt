The star of “Black Panther,” Chadwick Boseman, visited The View and reacted to the joyous viral video of a middle school celebrating after learning that they’re going to see “Black Panther.”

On “The View,” Boseman said, “That’s why you do this. That’s the reason why you, for me, it’s one of the reasons why I get up in the morning and I do what I do. There’s actually a couple of kids that I’ve connected with while I’m shooting “Black Panther” and would literally, when I was tired, I would just think of them.”
