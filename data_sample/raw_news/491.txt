Stephen Piscotty just hit a shot straight to the heart.

In his first game back from bereavement leave after the death of his 55-year-old mother, the Oakland Aâ€™s outfielder blasted a home run in his first at-bat Tuesday at Fenway Park in Boston.

He patted his heart and then looked skyward as he touched home plate for a quiet tribute to his mom, Gretchen, who had battled ALS. Piscotty, a Bay Area native, was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals to the Aâ€™s in December, enabling him to care for his mother at their Pleasanton, California, home. She died earlier this month.

All the feels.
