″#Janethevirgin Add another Latina director to that list,” Rodriguez wrote in the caption.

“Jane The Virgin” is currently on a midseason break but is expected to return to The CW on Jan. 26. Dawson is the latest addition to the show’s cast. Earlier this month the network announced the “Daredevil” star would have a multi-episode arc this season.

Dawson seems to have arrived on set just in time for the boricua’s big debut behind the scenes. The star helped Rodriguez celebrate the big moment with a gif shared via Instagram on Wednesday.
