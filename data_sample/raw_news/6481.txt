Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren apologized on Wednesday after her lewd meltdown on social media.

Lahren used a vulgar insult to refer to Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) after his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday.

She called Kennedy a “little limp dick,” described his speech “pathetic” and “embarrassing” and ended her tirade with an “oh my God.”

She deleted the video, but IJR’s Josh Billinson shared a copy on Twitter:

In an earlier video, she called Kennedy a “little nasty ginger.”

What does being a ginger have to do with it? pic.twitter.com/j5ImJ39J6T — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) February 1, 2018
