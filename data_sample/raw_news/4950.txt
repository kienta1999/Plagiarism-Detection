John Oliver began his show on Sunday night with a brief moment of celebration.

Last week, a West Virginia judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Oliver that was filed by coal baron Robert E Murray, the target of a biting “Last Week Tonight” segment last year.

Murray Energy told The Hill it planned to appeal.

Oliver’s 2017 segment featured a giant talking squirrel who mocked a report that said Murray was told to operate his own mines by a squirrel ― something Murray has denied.

On Sunday, the squirrel ― Mr. Nutterbutter ― was back with a new message for Murray.
