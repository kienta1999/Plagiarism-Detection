Fans of the “Orange Is the New Black” actress hope so. A Change.org petition calling on Mattel to make its first trans woman Barbie has already fetched 100 signatures and counting — not to mention the support of Cox herself.

The trans star tweeted her approval of the online campaign, which comes after Mattel’s announcement that it’s releasing 17 new Barbies for its “Sheroes” line in honor of International Women’s Day. In addition to Kim, the new dolls are modeled after inspiring real-life women, from iconic artist Frida Kahlo to “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins.

“Laverne Cox is the definition of the ‘inspiring woman,’” the petition, started by a fan named Jason Preston, states. “To many young women and men around the world Laverne Cox is a symbol of what you can achieve if you are true to who you are. She epitomizes not only the messages of the Inspiring Women and Sheroes Barbie doll lines but that of Barbie herself. [She] brings its message of being who and what you want to be into our ever-changing world, from inspiring the limitless potential in every girl to inspiring the limitless potential in every person.”

It wouldn’t be the first major milestone for Cox. In January she became the first openly trans person to grace the cover of Cosmopolitan. She’s also the first openly trans actor to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy.
