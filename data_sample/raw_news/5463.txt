Foxx presumably doesn’t like to be asked about Holmes.

How do we know this?

Watch this exchange on Friday between Foxx and ESPN’s Michael Smith before the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Los Angeles. Smith’s question was referring to images that have circulated of the couple outside a gym on Valentine’s Day, with Foxx holding a basketball.

At least the “Django Unchained” star left with a smile.

Smith commented on the encounter later on Twitter.
