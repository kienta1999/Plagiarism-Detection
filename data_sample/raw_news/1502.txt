While many people in the United States were sleeping Friday, the two nations of North and South Korea were making history .

North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in started it all with a handshake at the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries. From there, Kim attended an inter-Korean summit in Panmunjom, South Korea, where the two leaders declared their willingness to bring about an official end to the Korean War after 65 years and a commitment to denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.
