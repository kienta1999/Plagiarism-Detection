Adams cites other reports and implores the 40-year-old rapper to “start by dealing with the facts.”

“Love deals with truth. Over the past ten years, I have tolerated all the errors, misinformation and frank lies told be reporters, journalists and people on the street out of respect for the doctor-patient privilege and your mother. Nonetheless, do not mistake kindness for weakness,” wrote Adams toward the end of the letter.

Recent reports say that the rapper is set up to launch a social program for Chicago on behalf of his mother called DONDA Social. The initiative will supposedly “help Chicago residents in need and will serve as the latest offshoot of the DONDA creative collective.”
