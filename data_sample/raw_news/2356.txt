AZCHET: As the doctor bills started to come in, me and my wife were worrying on how we are going to pay for these doctor bills. And then our company, Universal Plumbing, came to us and gave all the employees thousand dollar tax cuts. And with those, we were able to pay our doctors’ bills.

TRUMP: Thank you very much.

AZCHET: Thank you very much.

TRUMP: It’s beautiful.
