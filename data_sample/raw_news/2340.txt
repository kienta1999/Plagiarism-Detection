LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Comedy Store owner Mitzi Shore died Wednesday, according to a statement from the Comedy Store. She was 87.

“It is with great sadness and very heavy hearts that we report the passing of Mitzi Shore, the legendary Godmother of the world famous Comedy Store,” the statement said.

“Mitzi was an extraordinary businesswoman and decades ahead of her time who cultivated and celebrated the artistry of stand-up comedy. She was also a loving mother, not only to her own four children, but to the myriad of comedians who adored her. She leaves behind an indelible mark and legacy and has helped change the face of comedy. We will all miss her dearly.”

The Comedy Store will be closed Wednesday.

Mitzi Shore, the mother of comedian Pauly Shore, founded the legendary Los Angeles comedy club, the Comedy Store, in 1972 and became owner two years later. During her tenure, she influenced careers of up-and-coming comedians such as Robin Williams, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Chevy Chase, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, and Richard Pryor.

Mitzi Shore is credited for naming the club, which co-founded by her husband at the time, Sammy Shore and fellow comedian Rudy DeLuca. When Sammy and Mitzi divorced in 1974, Mitzi gained ownership of the club.

At the Comedy Club, Shore famously did not pay her comics, instead, insisting the club provided training to hone their craft, along with exposure to industry insiders. Eventually, comedians went on strike in 1979, demanding to be paid for their work. The strike eventually ended with Shore agreeing to pay comics per set.

Shore was born in Michigan and grew up in Wisconsin. She studied at the University of Wisconsin before leaving to marry Sammy. The two moved to Los Angeles in 1964. The couple had four children, Peter, Scott, Pauly and Sandy.

Comedians and fans took to Twitter to share their tributes to Shore:

Mitzi Shore was a pioneer who gave more comics their start than I can count...I did my first legit comedy gig at the Store. She was a woman in a male dominated business who pulled no punches, something I always admired. My heart goes out to @paulyshore and the entire Shore family pic.twitter.com/kabGgWMVuR — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) April 11, 2018

Mitzi Shore started my career when I was 21 by believing in me. I will forever be indebted to her and love her and always knew that she loved me.

RIP Mitzi Shore - She was and will forever be the most innovative and influential person in stand up comedy. The Comedy Store is not just a club, but a community where I've met friends that I will have for the rest of my life. Mitzi - Love you, you're impossible to follow. — Al Madrigal (@almadrigal) April 11, 2018

Mitzi Shore, watched as Mom and Dad grew up, and I played and slept under booths, roamed hallways filled with comedy ghost. REST IN PEACE and own that comedy club in the sky. #MitziShore #ComedyStore pic.twitter.com/R3Ql5PKufA — Rain Pryor (@RainPryor) April 11, 2018

The great Mitzi Shore, owner of the famous Comedy Store, has passed away. No words can express the gratitude I have for her. We met in 1979. She opened the door to my dreams! If she loved you, you did well. If she didn’t, you did something else. I will love her forever. ;^) pic.twitter.com/lBNXnW0mEr — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) April 11, 2018
