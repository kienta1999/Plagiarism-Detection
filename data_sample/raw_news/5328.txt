WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has charged a lawyer with lying to investigators about his communications with Rick Gates, a partner of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort who also has been charged in the Russia probe.

The indictment against Alex Van der Zwaan also accuses him of deleting or otherwise not producing emails sought by the Special Counsel’s office, which is investigating possible ties between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.
