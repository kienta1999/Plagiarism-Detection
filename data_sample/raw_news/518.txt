The RNC’s tweet linked to a fundraising page on Trump’s official website, which encourages people to donate to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee ― “a joint fundraising committee authorized by and composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. and the Republican National Committee” ― and have a shot at winning transportation, accommodation and one ticket to the event.
