President Donald Trump is “bringing stupid back” in Randy Rainbow’s latest musical parody.

The YouTube comedian gave Meghan Trainor’s 2014 hit “All About That Bass” a Trumpian twist with his spoof, “All About His Base,” which he shared online Monday.

Rainbow sings about the loyalty of “unmanageable maniac” Trump’s supporters in the clip, which ends with a remix of another Trainor song.
