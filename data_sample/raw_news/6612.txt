The Hollywood premiere for the long-awaited “Black Panther″ movie had a dress code that told guests “royal attire requested” and, damn, they delivered.

On Monday night, actors, actresses, and other attendees gathered to celebrate African culture and rock truly stunning outfits in every color of the rainbow.

“I was hoping for this,” “Black Panther” costume designer Ruth E. Carter said on the purple carpet.

“All of the award shows I was watching on TV, I was like, ‘Oh, you wait until ‘Black Panther’ red carpet rolls around. It’s a celebration.”

Carter added: “How best to get the party started than to, on premiere night, have the cast, have the crew, have the directors and everybody participate in this explosion of patterns and African prints? Everyone can join in the fun!“

Twitter also loved what was happening on that purple carpet:
