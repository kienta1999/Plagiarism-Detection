It does seem like an animated fairytale.

To mark Tina Fey’s return to “Saturday Night Live” as host for the season finale this weekend, the show issued a cartoon history of her career on Wednesday.

The journey spans her ascent at “SNL” ― where she says she “mastered the art of sleeping with my eyes open” ― to “other stuff.”

“Then I got to help write a musical,” the “30 Rock” star said, referring to the red-hot theatrical version of her 2004 movie hit “Mean Girls.”
