Fake Melania Trump had her say on Michael Wolff’s tell-all book about her husband’s administration on Wednesday’s “The Late Show.”

The first lady, played by Laura Benanti, called Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House “pure fiction” and a “fake book.”

“Every single word is lie,” she told host Stephen Colbert. But the fake first lady did later admit that at least one aspect of the tome rang true.
