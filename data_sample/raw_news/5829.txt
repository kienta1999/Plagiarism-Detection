Finnish snowboard coach Antti Koskinen is up to his old tricks at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Or should that be knits?

On Saturday, Koskinen was caught on camera knitting at the top of the slopestyle course in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as athlete Roope Tonteri was waiting to compete, reports Yahoo.

Tweeters couldnâ€™t believe their eyes:

If Koskinen knitting on the slopes seems a familiar sight, thatâ€™s because it is. He attempted to keep himself and his athletes calm in a similar fashion during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, per BuzzFeed. He also became a meme.
