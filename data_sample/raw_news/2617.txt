Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump struggled to read, battled to remember the names of three Baltic nations and fought to stay awake after daydreaming about Roseanne Barr at a staged press conference on “Saturday Night Live.”

Finally, he admitted to reporters, with a little sashay: “Here’s the thing: I don’t care about America, okay? This whole presidency is a four-year cash grab — and admitting that will probably get me four more years. I do not care about any of you.”

The SNL cold open featured Balwin’s Trump with the leaders of Lithuania (Kate McKinnon), Latvia (Alex Moffat) and Estonia (Heidi Gardner) on a spoof version of the Fox News program “Outnumbered,” with Leslie Jones playing Harris Faulkner. Baldwin variously referred to the countries and leaders as “hufflepuff,” “freak shows” and “Stankonia.”

He stumbled through a statement to “prove I can read,” then jumped to “freestyle.” He went to add a “big congratulations to Vladimir Putin, who won a great, great very transparent election ... even though no one’s been tougher on Russia than I am, including Hitler.”

As McKinnon’s character began speaking, Baldwin’s Trump thought to himself: “Oh God, I’m already so bored. I wish I was watching ‘Roseanne’ ... Roseanne loves me, she’s like a good Rosie O’Donnell.”

He blew off a question from the press about Stormy Daniels, then veered into a riff about “caravans full of immigrants ... barreling across the desert” that sounded exactly like a scene from “Mad Max, Fury Road.” He then started snoring.

To top it all off, an eye-glass wearing giant bunny suddenly appeared at the side of Baldwin’s Trump. He’s convinced it’s a “Donnie Darko situation.”
