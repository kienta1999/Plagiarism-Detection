Fake Melania Trump, played by Laura Benanti, is not a huge fan of her new waxwork at Madame Tussauds in New York.

“She looks nothing like me,” the spoof first lady joked on Friday’s broadcast of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

But there was one detail the figure’s creators got “right,” Benanti said.

“Wax Melania won’t hold Donald’s hand either,” the bogus FLOTUS quipped, before suggesting another amusing use for the sculpture.
