Team USA snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis on Friday just barely missed the chance to take a place at the podium during her fourth Winter Olympics.

The veteran athlete missed a bronze medal by 0.03 seconds in the snowboarding cross final. She trailed gold medalist Michela Moioli by a mere 0.46 seconds.

She led at the start to the midway point but was later thrown off by a crashing rider, NBC reports.

Jacobellis, 32, won a silver in 2006 but a showboat move caused her to fall and give up a huge lead ― and the gold. She was then disqualified in the semifinals in 2010 and crashed in the semis in 2014.

Away from the Olympics, she has had a stellar career, earning 10 golds at the X Games and five world championships.

But another Olympic letdown (see video of the race here) didn’t seem to get her down too much.
