Thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., Saturday to attend the March For Our Lives protest and bring attention to the issues of gun control and gun violence.

Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, spearheaded the event after 17 people were killed last month in a mass shooting at the school.
