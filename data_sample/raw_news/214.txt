Tyler Merritt just wants “you to get to know me better before you call the cops.”

The Nashville, Tennessee, actor shines a light on the recent spate of incidents in which people have called the police on black people without valid reason in a moving monologue that NowThis shared online Tuesday.

Merritt, in the clip, reveals tidbits about his life to show that he’s a regular guy. He hates spiders and bananas, is a vegetarian, can recite every word from the musical “Oklahoma!” and NWA’s “Straight Outta Compton” album, spends most Sunday mornings teaching kids, has “never been to jail,” “never owned a gun,” and hates “that anyone at all might possibly be afraid of me.”

“I’m a proud man,” Merritt says. “I’m a proud black man.”

But he then asks: “Does any of this really matter?”

“No. I just wanted you to get to know me better before you call the cops.”

The video struck a chord with people on Twitter, who called it “excellent” and “powerful.”

This is a very powerful message and I wish everyone took the time to truly watch this and listen. And yes this video matters. You matter. I, too, would go around the world and back again if i knew that single act might make your day better. ❤️ — CarolineA (@carolinebha2) May 22, 2018
