Actress Arielle Kebbel’s sister has been missing for days, and she’s asking people on social media to help in the search.

Kebbel, who’s starred in TV series like “Unreal,” “Ballers” and “Vampire Diaries,” is trying to locate Julia Kebbel, who apparently was last seen on the night of Jan. 31 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles walking her chocolate Labrador.

The actress took to Instagram last week to alert her followers and provide photos and details about her sister’s disappearance.

“ALERT. My SiSTER JULIA KEBBEL is MISSING. She was last seen in silver lake, walking her chocolate lab, Cindy, at 11 pm wed night. 1/31/18,” the star wrote.

People reported there was a fire in Julia Kebbel’s apartment the day she went missing.

Arielle Kebbel later posted a missing persons flyer with her sister’s description.

“She has tattoos on both fore arms. She has a spiritual symbol with a key and the words promise on one forearm and a blue Phoenix rising on the other,” the flyer says.

Kebbel encouraged fans to contact either her or the police with any relevant information.

“Please share this info with anyone and everyone,” she said.

Famous friends of the actress, including Amy Schumer, Shiri Appleby and Odette Annable, have joined in on the search, sharing the post on their own accounts and writing heartfelt messages.

“Arielle Kebbel, a cast mate from Life Unexpected and UnReal, is in need of our help. Her sister is missing. Please read below, take a look at the photos and if you see or hear anything, please reach out,” Appleby wrote on Instagram.An East Los Angeles graphic artist has created six Selena Quintanilla-inspired Valentine’s Day cards that would make anyone’s heart go bidi bidi bom bom.

Josue Morin’s vintage-style cards feature the Queen of Tejano music in some iconic outfits and include wording that any Selena fan is sure to recognize.

“I wanted to incorporate some of her famous song lyrics on each card so that’s when my wife, Maria Madriz, came up with the wording,” he told HuffPost.

A post shared by Josue Morin (@jm_illustrations) on Jan 31, 2018 at 8:24am PST

The Mexican-born artist is currently selling the cards via Etsy, but says he initially created them only for his wife.

“People have reacted amazingly,” Morin said. “I first wanted to do the cards for my wife but my wife decided to share on social media by doing a giveaway and it went crazy! My Instagram [posts] ... got reviews and shout outs we didn’t even know about! I was just so excited people liked them because I worked hard creating them.”

Madriz isn’t the only Selena fan in the family, though. Morin says he loves the Tejano singer as much as his wife and hopes his two daughters will become fans.Snow covers Dani Fontaine Billings’ farm in Longmont, Colorado, where later this year she’ll plant multiple varieties of hemp. One such variety, grown for its cannabidiol, faces legal challenges. Sophie Quinton, The Pew Charitable Trusts

Customers are snapping up a cannabis extract derived from hemp. But conflicting federal laws and competition from more regulated sectors are casting a shadow over the market.

By Sophie Quinton

LONGMONT, Colo. — In a few months, Dani Fontaine Billings will plant 80 acres of hemp at her farm here, out behind a clapboard farmhouse with views of the Rocky Mountains.

Some of the plants will grow tall, like bamboo, and yield grain and fiber for textiles and other industrial products. Others will look and smell like marijuana and yield a cannabis compound. The profitability of that compound, Billings said, is drawing many farmers and would-be farmers to the hemp industry.

Few people had heard of cannabidiol, known as CBD, before a 2013 CNN documentary, “Weed,” that featured its healing powers. Now entrepreneurs put CBD into pills, tinctures, candies, body lotions and dog treats, and customers use it to ease health problems from anxiety and sore muscles to seizures.

Billings and her mother, Tracee Box, own and operate Nature’s Root, a hemp spa tucked beside the American Legion in this suburb north of Denver. As many things in the spa as possible are made of hemp, from the bathrobes to the massage oil. But cannabidiol-infused products are among the bestsellers, said the 31-year-old Billings. “We have a very large clientele that just wants to use the CBD on their bodies.”

CBD can be derived from marijuana or hemp — both are varieties of the cannabis plant — but the marijuana version is only available in states that have legalized the drug. The hemp version, however, is easy to find online and in stores all over the country, including in spas and grocery stores. And because the hemp version isn’t psychoactive, it could attract a bigger market: people who want to feel better without getting high.

But for growers and sellers there’s a problem: The federal government is divided on whether the hemp CBD extract is legal. The 2014 federal farm bill says cannabis becomes hemp — and legal to grow and market — when its psychoactive potential drops below a certain level. But the 1970 Controlled Substances Act says only certain parts of the cannabis plant can be legally sold as hemp. That definition excludes the cannabis flowers, which are usually harvested for CBD.

This month, a federal court in San Francisco will hear arguments in a lawsuit — brought by Hemp Industries Association, a trade group, and two hemp companies — that seeks to overturn the DEA classification.

The current hemp CBD industry also faces long-term threats beyond questions about legality. As more states legalize marijuana, the industry may face more competition from marijuana-derived cannabidiol. And pharmaceutical companies are getting in on the action. Two cannabidiol drugs are moving through the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process, and one of them — an anti-seizure medication — could hit the market this year.

The New Hemp Boom

Hemp was historically grown to make rope, sailcloth and textiles. But it fell out of favor as a cash crop in the 20th century, as states and the federal government banned marijuana, and cotton and synthetic materials became cheaper to produce.

Hemp’s resurgence began four years ago when Congress passed the farm legislation, defining “industrial hemp” as cannabis with a concentration of the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, of no more than 0.3 percent by weight. The law says states can allow universities and agriculture departments to grow hemp in order to study the plant’s growth, cultivation and marketing.

“That word marketing — it was the crack in the door,” says Brent Burchett, director of plant marketing for the Kentucky Department of Agriculture. In Kentucky, where officials have argued that the only way to conduct market research for a product is to allow it to be bought and sold, private hemp farmers get a license from the state and share their experience growing, processing or selling the plant.

Two-thirds of states have enacted legislation to allow hemp to be grown under the farm bill, according to Vote Hemp, a nonprofit that advocates for hemp. Of those states, nineteen had active hemp programs last year. The vast majority of them — including Kentucky and Colorado — allowed commercial sales.

Farms in Colorado and Kentucky generated about half the nation’s hemp crop last year, according to industry estimates. Burchett expects 6,000 acres to be planted in Kentucky this year, up from 30 in 2014. Initially, most farmers grew for hemp fiber. Now, more than half is planted for CBD, he said.

In Colorado, where close to 10,000 acres of hemp was planted last year, the harvest, which had long been mostly used for CBD, has shifted to other uses recently, according to Duane Sinning, the assistant director of plant industry at the state Department of Agriculture. More farmers are choosing to grow hemp for its grain, he said. Hemp seeds, also known as hemp heads, are gaining prominence as a “superfood” like chia or flax seeds.

But at a recent cannabis trade show in Denver that featured marijuana and hemp companies, most entrepreneurs were selling wares infused with CBD.

Along the “Hemp Hallway,” passersby could reach out for free samples of everything from caramels to pills packaged to look like medicine. Peggie Baker, of the Little Flower Colorado Hemp Company, stood behind a cloth-draped table decorated with succulents and poured samples of sticky, tangy CBD tincture onto a spoon.

Her target customers are interested in the product’s health benefits but would never walk into a marijuana dispensary, she said — that’s why the company has a pretty logo and retail partnerships with a few spas and a grocery store. “I want to get to places where women and grandmas would walk in,” she said.

Under FDA rules, companies selling cannabidiol extract can’t market their products as cures for specific diseases because none are approved as medical drugs. The FDA says companies can’t call CBD products supplements, either.

Yet many companies either flout those rules or walk right up to the line. At the Denver expo, many sellers had a story to tell about a miracle improvement, such as a client whose Parkinson’s tremors subsided or a wife whose muscle pain eased. Some, like Baker, simply said they got into the business because they wanted to help people around them who were sick.

Relaxing in an armchair in the lobby of his daughter’s spa the day before the trade show, Bill Billings — who runs a second business with her, advising newcomers to the hemp industry — said that since he started using CBD, the swelling and pain in his arthritic knee have subsided. Two poodles trotting around the spa lobby that morning were also CBD users. They’re given the extract to ease their arthritis and anxiety, Dani Billings said.

Industry analysts say the CBD market will only grow. The Hemp Business Journal, a Denver-based organization that publishes industry estimates, predicts that within two years marijuana, hemp and pharmaceuticals will split a combined CBD market of more than $1 billion. Other estimates for the hemp-derived market are much higher.

A Legal Gray Area

Some legal experts caution, however, that buying and selling hemp-derived cannabidiol might be illegal.

That’s because of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which says cannabis is marijuana — except for the stalks, fiber and oil of the plant traditionally used by industry. That means cannabis flowers, the source for CBD extract, qualify as marijuana no matter the THC level of the plant.

The Drug Enforcement Administration leaned on the latter definition when, in 2016, it classified all cannabinoid extracts as dangerous drugs. Local law enforcement agents have raided CBD sellers in North Dakota and Iowa, and Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill concluded last year that it’s illegal to sell cannabidiol extracts there. Indiana law does permit patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy to use the substance, Hill said in his legal opinion.

Daniel Shortt, a Seattle-based attorney at the law firm Harris Bricken who works with cannabis industry clients, said hemp CBD products occupy a gray area.

“The thorny question is whether these CBD products derived from industrial hemp can be legally sold and distributed online,” he said. Some major retailers won’t sell CBD, others will. “A lot of it comes down to what level of risk businesses are willing to take.”

Bob Hoban, a Denver-based lawyer whose firm represents the hemp companies suing the DEA, said Congress has for the past three years cleared the way for hemp products to move across state lines by adding language to spending bills that prevent the DEA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture from interfering with state hemp programs.

Hemp CBD’s potential legal troubles don’t end there. The FDA also has sent many businesses warnings chastising them for selling unapproved drugs, making unfounded health claims — such as that their product shrinks tumors — and in some cases selling products that don’t contain cannabidiol at all.

Seeking to distance hemp from marijuana, some hemp companies have chosen to expand in places that don’t allow marijuana cultivation.

AgTech Scientific recently established a hemp product development center in Kentucky partly for that reason, said Mike French, the company’s president. He said the overlap between cannabis industries in other states can make banks reluctant to serve hemp businesses.

In Colorado, many cannabis entrepreneurs dabble in both varieties of the plant. Billings and her mom, for instance, owned a medical marijuana edibles company before selling it in 2012 and switching to hemp.The idea that women are dainty about eating snacks has put a bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths — and made them eager to poke fun at the concept of chips designed for women.

Last week, PepsiCo’s CEO Indra Nooyi discussed women’s supposedly meek snack-consuming habits in a Freakonomics interview.

The show’s host, Stephen Dubner, observed, “I understand that men and women eat chips very differently” and asked Nooyi to describe the difference.

She gave an example using Doritos, one of PepsiCo’s products. According to Nooyi, men enjoy licking Dorito dust off their fingers with “great glee,” and when they’re done with a bag, they enjoy dumping the “little broken pieces” from the bottom into their mouths.

But Nooyi suggested women are way too refined or self-conscious to eat Doritos that way.

“Women would love to do the same, but they don’t,” Nooyi said. “They don’t like to crunch too loudly in public. And they don’t lick their fingers generously and they don’t like to pour the little broken pieces and the flavor into their mouth.”

When Freakonomics asked Nooyi if PepsiCo was playing around with the idea of creating “a male and female version of chips,” Nooyi said the company was.

“It’s not a male and female [version] as much as, ‘Are there snacks for women that can be designed and packaged differently?’” Nooyi said. “And yes, we are looking at it, and we’re getting ready to launch a bunch of them soon.”

Women: We want equal pay for equal work and an end to sex discrimination in the workplace.



Society: Here’s a bag of Lady Doritos so you won’t have to crunch too loudly in front of your male colleagues. — Marie Connor (@thistallawkgirl) February 5, 2018

Cheer up, gals! We may not get a lady president, but we do get lady Doritos! — 𝕁𝕖𝕤𝕤𝕚𝕖 𝔻𝕖𝕒𝕟 (@NicCageMatch) February 5, 2018

Though Nooyi did seem to confirm that the company was working on new snack products geared specifically toward women, she never specifically mentioned which brand would make these products or what they would be called. (PepsiCo also owns brands like Lays and Cheetos.) A spokesman for PepsiCo declined to comment to HuffPost about whether the company had conducted research about snack consumption based on gender.

But that didn’t prevent the phrase “Lady Doritos” from trending on Twitter on Monday ― and let’s just say people found the entire idea pretty crummy.

Questions I have about the forthcoming lady Doritos:

1. May I request they be salted with the tears of our enemies?

2. Will they be priced to align with the gender pay gap?

3. If a lady is OK with crunching, crumbs and public eating, is she banned from purchasing them? — Kim Bongiorno (@LetMeStart) February 5, 2018

A humbling Super Bowl defeat like the one the New England Patriots suffered against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday could stir some hard feelings, even among the players’ families.

But Gisele Bündchen, the supermodel wife of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, kept it classy.

She congratulated every Eagles player she encountered as she departed U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a back walkway, Yahoo’s Dan Wetzel reported.

Conservative Christian singer and TV personality Fabricio Alvarado skyrocketed to the top of the 13-person field after speaking out against a January ruling by the region’s top human rights court calling on Costa Rica to give equal civil marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples.

If no candidate wins at least 40 percent of Sunday’s vote, a run-off election with the top two finishers is set for early April.

The 43-year-old Alvarado, a congressman with the National Restoration Party, has called the ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights a violation of the country’s sovereignty and an affront to traditional values.

“We have to stand up to those who want to trample on the family,” he said at the campaign’s final debate, threatening to pull out of the court over its resolution.

Rival Antonio Alvarez, a banana entrepreneur and candidate of the National Liberation Party, has said while he personally opposes the court’s decision, he would respect it if he wins.

Among the few candidates who embraced the court’s resolution is Carlos Alvarado, a former labor minister in the outgoing government of President Luis Gillermao Solis.

Elsewhere in the region, gay and lesbian couples can marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and in parts of Mexico.

Running a close second in one recent poll, conservative Juan Diego Castor, a former justice minister, is aiming to lure voters with an anti-crime platform as well as pushing for less restrictions on miners and oil companies.

A high-end coffee exporter, Costa Rica is well-known for its environmental stewardship and thriving eco-tourism sector.

Solis, a former diplomat and history professor, won in a landslide four years ago but has seen his popularity slide as an investigation into an influence peddling scandal has unfolded.

He is barred by law from seeking a second term.

Solis gained international attention when he hoisted a rainbow flag along with the Costa Rican flag atop his office just a week after he took office as a statement against homophobia.A Republican Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice failed to disclose a $25,000 campaign donation from a top Republican lawmaker who is a defendant in a lawsuit challenging the state’s congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy filed an updated disclosure in the case on Monday, noting the $25,000 donation during her Supreme Court candidacy from a PAC supporting Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati. She apologized for failing to disclose the money before the Supreme Court heard the lawsuit, and said she still believes she can judge the litigation impartially.

Mundy was one of two GOP justices who disagreed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court majority struck down the state’s congressional map in January and ordered a new one.

Her failure to disclose the donation, first reported by Mother Jones, is the latest in an escalating fight over the gerrymandering decision that challenges the impartiality of the justices on Pennsylvania’s highest court. On Friday, House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Scarnati moved to disqualify the vote of Justice David Wecht, a Democrat, because he made statements against gerrymandering when he was a candidate in 2015.

Plaintiffs in the gerrymandering case won’t seek to disqualify Mundy’s vote over the donation disclosure, said Barbara Grimaldi, a spokeswoman for the Public Interest Law Center, a Philadelphia-based group representing them.

Scarnati said in a statement Monday that he and Mundy had properly disclosed the donation from his PAC in campaign finance reports. He also said three Democrats on the Supreme Court failed to disclose contributions from a PAC supporting Gov. Tom Wolf (D), who also is a defendant in the gerrymandering case. Those justices ― Wecht, Kevin Dougherty and Christine Donohue ― also did not disclose millions in donations from labor unions that filed amicus briefs in this case, Scarnati said.

Scarnati said the push to disqualify Wecht had nothing to do with donations.

“Justice Wecht and Justice Donohue promised an outcome prior to the League of Women Voters’ filing of the lawsuit,” Scarnati said, adding, “Justice Wecht’s numerous unequivocal statements regarding “gerrymandering,”, calling it an “abomination” on several occasions, establish that even before he was elected to the Supreme Court, his mind was made up.”

Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and an expert on judicial ethics, said a $25,000 donation would be enough to push for Mundy’s recusal. But the justice wouldn’t necessarily have to disclose the contribution to litigants if it had been publicly available information, he said.

The donation was included in campaign finance reports posted on the Pennsylvania Department of State website. “If the information that could serve as the basis for recusal is readily available on a court’s website or in financial disclosure filings, the judge can assume that the lawyers are doing their homework” and know about it, Gillers said in an email.

Campaign finance reports show two Republican members of Congress from Pennsylvania ― Reps. Charlie Dent and Brian Fitzpatrick ― also made $1,000 donations to Mundy’s 2017 campaign, which she failed to disclose.

Munday, in a statement filed in November, did disclose a donation from Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel. Lawrence Tabas, an attorney at the firm, represented Republican voters in the gerrymandering case.After the New England Patriots lost Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, a game in which several receivers dropped catchable passes, Gisele Bundchen famously said her quarterback husband “cannot fucking throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time.”(Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling nearly 1,600 points during the session, its biggest intraday decline in history, as investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation.

The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow suffered their biggest percentage drops since August 2011 as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened.

The financial , healthcare and industrial sectors fell the most, but declines were spread broadly as all major 11 S&P groups dropped at least 1.7 percent. All 30 of the blue-chip Dow industrial components finished negative.

With Monday’s declines, the S&P 500 erased its gains for 2018 and is now down 0.9 percent in 2018.

Many investors have been bracing for a pullback for months, as the stock market has minted record high after record high with investors encouraged by solid economic data and corporate earnings prospects, the latter bolstered by recently passed U.S. corporate tax cuts.

Friday’s January jobs report sparked worries over inflation and a surge in bond yields, as well as concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected.

“The market has had an incredible run,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist At JonesTrading In Greenwich, Connecticut.

“We have an environment where interest rates are rising. We have a stronger economy so the Fed should continue to tighten ... You’re seeing real changes occur and different investments are adjusting to that,” O’Rourke said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,175.21 points, or 4.6 percent, to 24,345.75, the S&P 500 lost 113.19 points, or 4.10 percent, to 2,648.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 273.42 points, or 3.78 percent, to 6,967.53.

The S&P 500 ended 7.8 percent down from its record high on Jan. 26, with the Dow down 8.5 percent over that time.

Even with the sharp declines, stocks finished above their lows touched during the session. At one point, the Dow fell 6.3 percent or 1,597 points, the biggest one-day points loss ever, as it breached both the 25,000 and 24,000 levels during trading.

The stock market has climbed to record peaks since President Donald Trump’s election and remains up 23.8 percent since his victory. Trump has frequently touted the rise of the stock market during his presidency.

As the stock market fell on Monday, the White House said the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong.

The CBOE Volatility index , the closely followed measure of expected near-term stock market volatility, jumped 20 points to 30.71, its highest level since August 2015.

Until recently, gains for stocks have come as the market has been relatively subdued, and any declines were met with buyers looking for bargains.

“People who have been buying the dip are now going to be selling the rip,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “The psychology of the market changed today. It’ll take a while to get that psychology back.”

About 11.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 7.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 8.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.92-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 38 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 164 new lows. 37.32Photo: Getty Images

In a frightening video posted to Twitter, a man is shown making very racist, offensive remarks to a woman in a head covering and is subsequently asked to leave the establishment.

When the woman starts filming the interaction, the man is seen asking, “Is this Halloween or something?” while the two are in line at a coffee shop.

She asks, “Why would you say that?”

The two have a tense back and forth, with the man saying, “Why do you think I would say that?”

“Do you know I’m Muslim?” the woman asks him.

After confirming he has a problem with that, he says, “I don’t like it, that’s why. I don’t like your religion, it says to kill me.”

"I'm a Muslim [woman]."



"I know your religion and I don't want to be killed by you."

The man turns to the counter and the server appears to ask him to leave. A male voice can be heard in the background yelling, “Get out of here, get out you racist.”

The man then asks for the supervisor, whom the server who asked him to leave identifies herself as and gives her name. The man walks out the door.

“Why are you not serving him?” the woman asks the supervisor.

“Because he is disrupting a public place and being very racist,” she says.

“Thank you,” says the woman in the niqab.

The man who shared the video is journalist CJ Werleman, who wrote that the incident occurred at a coffee shop in California on Saturday.

People who watched the video said that they were glad the manager and other patrons stood up to the abusive man.

Those fired include Newsweek Editor-in-Chief Bob Roe, executive editor Ken Li and reporter Celeste Katz, multiple sources told HuffPost.

Nancy Cooper, managing editor at the International Business Times, one of Newsweek’s sister sites, has taken on the role of acting editor at Newsweek, according to an internal memo.

HuffPost

The company confirmed Roe and Li’s firings in the memo but declined to comment on any other personnel changes. Katz confirmed her dismissal in a tweet.

Sources told the New York Daily News that Josh Saul, a reporter for Newsweek, was also fired, but HuffPost was not able to independently confirm this.

It was initially reported that Josh Keefe, a reporter for the International Business Times, had also been fired. However, multiple sources later told HuffPost that the company backed down after other employees threatened to quit if Keefe was dismissed.

Newsweek senior writer Matthew Cooper quit in solidarity with the other staffers fired, citing the company’s “reckless leadership.”

Some staff members working under the parent company reportedly believe Monday’s firings may be related to critical coverage of Newsweek Media Group that the fired staffers were involved in. Katz, Saul and Keefe had all reported about financial issues at the magazine and about a related investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, which raided the company’s servers in January.

Other staffers told HuffPost they suspect those employees were fired for investigating Olivet University, a California Christian college, and its financial ties to Newsweek Media Group.

“It’s all the people who were investigating the church,” said one staffer close to the situation. “So it’s pretty clear.”

The source added, “They fired the special counsel, essentially.”

Katz alluded to the possibility of retaliation in a tweet Monday afternoon.

“My warmest thanks to the brave Newsweek editors and colleagues who supported and shared in my work — especially our recent, difficult stories about the magazine itself — before my dismissal today,” she wrote.

Newsweek staffers gave Katz a standing ovation as she was escorted out of the offices, sources told HuffPost.

Last week, Etienne Uzac, the company’s co-owner and chairman, and his wife, Marion Kim, the company’s finance director, both stepped down amid the financial probe.

Their departures came after a report by the consulting firm Social Puncher, which found that Newsweek Media Group had fraudulently secured a major ad buy from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by purchasing “cheap junk traffic with a share of bots” to inflate the number of visitors to the International Business Times site. An investigation by BuzzFeed News corroborated the claims.

Then there was the infamous “wardrobe malfunction,” in which, many people argued, Timberlake managed to emerge largely unscathed while Janet Jackson’s career took a heavy and humiliating hit, partially because he failed to come to her defense in the wake of the scandal.

These things certainly did not help Timberlake’s pop culture standing. Nor did his recent rebranding as a “Man of the Woods” for his forthcoming album ― a hodgepodge of rustic, down-home Tennessee imagery of Timberlake in the nature wearing artfully weathered denims and confusing singles like “Filthy” which sound, for the most part, like watered down versions of the tracks he’s been making for the last 10 years.

Timberlake’s halftime show, then, had a lot riding on it. Not only was the performance a chance for him to reconcile with black fans and perhaps atone for his perceived sins against Janet Jackson (who, on Sunday, was celebrated on Twitter with the #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay hashtag as a kind of protest), but also to establish his new era and persona which, up until now, has been vague at best, nonsensical at worst.

Timberlake achieved none of these things in what was, for the most part, a perfectly adequate show. Adequate, teetering on forgettable. Despite the undercurrent of possible controversy, the most striking thing about Timberlake’s show was how carefully it tiptoed around anything taboo.

Dressed in a camouflage suit and red bandana , Timberlake danced and sang to all his best bangers of yesteryear, including “SexyBack,” “Cry Me A River” and “My Love” ― pop tunes infused with hip-hop and R&B cool. But the songs, censored and edited down for prime time, felt sanitized.

The show was punctuated by a much-discussed and criticized tribute: a projection of the late singer Prince singing ‘I Would Die 4 U’ while Timberlake accompanied on piano, right before a wide overhead shot of the stadium and surrounding area bathed in a warm purple light and The Purple One’s symbol.

This, too, was a gesture that was adequate, safe and just fine ― an appropriate way to honor and hold space for an iconic black performer without having to acknowledge Ms. Jackson.

The rest of the medley was a blur of less memorable Timberlake hits, including backup dancers who looked like extras from a Gap or United Colors of Benetton ad, and a final moment where Timberlake, among the crowd, bellowed “Supa Bowl Selfies!” as a young fan in the audience snapped a picture with him.

This last moment was what really cemented Timberlake’s place as the new face of dad-pop ― when every older millennial who went through high school grooving to “Justified” realized that they are officially old.

Dad-pop consists of releasing a song called “Filthy” that isn’t really filthy, mostly just mediocre. Dad-pop is lyrics like: “I’ll be the wood when you need heat/I’ll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity.” Dad-pop is releasing a song on the “Trolls” soundtrack.

For the past several months, there’s been so much speculation about what’s going on with Timberlake’s new album, about why his popularity has seemed to wane. It’s really not that complicated. He has a great catalogue of music. He’s a talented performer. He put on an entertaining, if cheesy show. But Timberlake, like all pop stars (especially white pop stars who cull much of their inspiration and persona from black culture), got old and corny.

And that’s perfectly fine.

Many artists, from U2 to Eminem, reach this moment of dad-i-fication, when they’re at the pinnacle of their careers, yes, but also simultaneously irrelevant to the culture. They sell out stadiums and concert halls, but the people who populate these arenas are not the ones who dictate what is “cool.” This is not an indictment of Timberlake, but merely an observation.

In this way, Timberlake’s halftime show was especially fascinating. Not because of the show itself but all that it represents ― the passage of time, our changing politics, and the stark and subtle differences between 2004 and 2018.Pink isn’t going to let trolls ruin her Super Bowl performance.

The singer lived a dream on Sunday night when she performed the national anthem before the Philadelphia Eagles took on the New England Patriots in Minneapolis. She sang despite having the flu.

A Twitter troll insulted Pink, saying that she sucked and anyone who liked her performance was “dumb.”

“Yeah but at least I suck while singing our countries [sic] national anthem, and you just suck by yourself on a dirty couch. #winning,” Pink replied on Sunday night.

Yeah but altleast I suck while singing our countries national anthem, and you just suck by yourself on a dirty couch. #winning https://t.co/SfLQr9hVTq — P!nk (@Pink) February 5, 2018

Pink grew up just outside Philadelphia, and expressed her excitement at being able to perform for her hometown team’s Super Bowl appearance. In an Instagram post, she said performing the anthem had been her dream since 1991, when Whitney Houston sang.MISSING! This is my brother Christopher Cattrall or Chris as we call him.

A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 3, 2018 at 9:11pm PSTSinger-songwriter Troye Sivan has made a name for himself by incorporating unabashedly queer themes into his music videos and live performances.

But Sivan, who came out in a 2013 YouTube video that has been viewed more than 7 million times, is set to tackle a different, more troubling aspect of the LGBTQ experience when he returns to the big screen this fall.

The star will appear in the film adaptation of Garrard Conley’s memoir, “Boy Erased.” The movie, which hits theaters in September, follows a teenage Conley (Lucas Hedges), who is sent to an ex-gay “conversion” therapy camp by his fundamentalist Christian parents (Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe).

“It was a heavy shoot. The subject matter was pretty intense, obviously,” Sivan, who plays Gary, one of the teens in the camp, told The Herald Sun of the experience. “I was going to the camp every day for 14 hours a day, for a month. I’d hear this rhetoric of intolerance and seeing such talented actors bring them to life really made it feel very real.”

Noting that he was “was happy to get out of there at the end,” Sivan added, “I think it’s going to be a very special and important movie.”

In the meantime, Sivan is heavily focused on his music. Last month, he dropped “My My My!,” the first single from his second album, due this spring. Pitchfork called it “one of the first great songs of [2018],” and NPR said its accompanying video “cemented his image as a gay pop icon.”

After Sivan performed “My My My!” on “Saturday Night Live” Jan. 20, he was praised by former Savage Garden singer Darren Hayes.

Hayes, who came out as gay after Savage Garden split in 2001, wrote:

I'm only just catching up on SNL tonight. Oh my word. @troyesivan was sublime. The freedom he must feel, to be himself. I can't imagine having that 20 years ago. So proud of how far we've come. — Darren Hayes (@darrenhayes) January 22, 2018

Sivan said he aimed to portray the LGBTQ experience in a nuanced way in the “My My My!” video, which was directed by Grant Singer.

“The thing that was most important for me was that it was communicating a young gay person enjoying themselves ... letting them be exactly how they want to be,” he said. “I hoped that in its own right would be something that would push things along.”Kristen Bell recalled how Dax Shepard stepped up to care for her health.

Oversharing is essentially baked into Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard’s celebrity couple DNA at this point, so consider us surprised that we hadn’t already heard every TMI detail from those two.

The “Good Place” star recently launched a new web series, “Momsplaining,” about her adventures in parenthood, and on the most recent episode she regaled “Scandal” actress Katie Lowes with a story about breastfeeding.

“I was in Atlanta. We couldn’t call a doctor, and this was right after the baby stopped nursing,” Bell explained. “So I said to my husband, ’I really need you to suck this out. We could talk about it, we could be weird about it, or you could just go ahead and nurse.”

Bell revealed that on three occasions she has suffered from mastitis, an often painful inflammation of the breast caused by a build-up of milk in the ducts that can lead to serious infection. The mother of two has taken antibiotics to treat the issue, but that was not an immediate option in Atlanta.

“So what do you do … Kristen?” Lowes responded. “Oh. My. God.”

“He pulled it out,” Bell continued, referring to Shepard. “He had a cup next to him. He was pulling out and spitting into this cup, and I’ve never been more in love. In my life.”

Bell and Lowes also discussed the often burdensome expectations placed on new mothers, as well as the difficulties of getting babies to latch on during breastfeeding.

“It is a little bit strange to go from an autonomous woman to all of a sudden being a food truck, ’cause that’s essentially what you are,” Bell said.Former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar on Monday was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for sexually abusing young athletes under the guise of medical treatment.

Nassar, 54, was sentenced in a Charlotte, Michigan, courtroom on three counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, adding to long prison terms he already faces for additional sex crimes.

“I am not convinced that you truly understand that what you did was wrong and the devastating impact that you have had on the victims, their families and friends,” Judge Janice Cunningham told Nassar in court before handing down the punishment. “Clearly you are in denial. You don’t get it. And I do not believe that there is a likelihood that you could be reformed.”

Nassar read a statement in court before he was sentenced.

“The words expressed by everyone that has spoken, including the parents, have impacted me to my inner-most core,” he said. “With that being said, I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain and trauma and emotions that you all feel. It’s impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved.”

Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, in her closing argument, reminded the judge how far-reaching Nassar’s abuse was.

“The breadth of the defendant’s abuse and destruction is nearly infinite,” the prosecutor said. ”... Few sports were saved from his predatory behavior, over a dozen different sports brought athletes to him who he abused.”

Povilaitis also applauded the bravery of survivors who spoke against Nassar.

“We are taught to trust. We have to trust ... We are, above all, taught to trust doctors, especially those who appear to be world-class doctors,” she said. “I truly believe we’ve seen the worst humanity in the last few weeks and we’ve also seen the best.”

The disgraced former physician, who is accused of sexual abuse by more than 265 young women, pleaded guilty to the charges on Nov. 22. He is already serving 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, and an additional 60 years on child pornography charges.

The sentencing comes after more than 60 survivors delivered powerful victim impact statements in court to Nassar.

Former gymnast Tiffany Dutton said during the sentence hearing that she came forward with her story because of the “courage and bravery” of the other women who have already accused Nassar. “It takes a monster to sexually assault a child,” she said. “But it takes a monster backed by ego, experience and power ― fueled by multiple institutions ― to sexually assault a child in front of their own mother.” Among Nassar’s victims are Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. According to court documents, Nassar served as team doctor for USA Gymnastics, various MSU sports teams and at a local Michigan gym called Twistars. As such, he gained the trust of girls and their families, which gave him cover for exams during which he fondled and digitally penetrated the girls. Larissa Boyce, the first woman to report Nassar’s abuse back in 1997, ended her impact statement on a powerful note. “My sisters, they have risen up and they have spoken their truths,” Boyce said, referring to the hundreds of survivors. “Don’t forget. Don’t forget these truths. Don’t forget me. Don’t forget my story. Don’t forget the 265 ‘me toos.’ Don’t forget us.”But he may want to get his basic facts straight.

Trump authorized House Republicans to release the memo on Friday, as part of a broader effort to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian officials. Nunes was widely maligned for basing the memo on cherry-picked evidence, and the document’s contents mostly confirmed previous reporting about the investigation, rather than revealing any new bombshells.

Among other details, the memo corroborated The New York Times’ reporting that the original FBI investigation into Trump’s campaign began with then-campaign adviser George Papadopoulos drunkenly admitting to an Australian diplomat that he’d been informed that Russian officials had “dirt” on Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, who served on a foreign policy advisory council for Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty in October for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, a major turning point in Mueller’s investigation.

While appearing on Monday’s edition of “Fox & Friends,” Nunes tried to downplay Papadopoulos’ role in Trump’s campaign.

“As far as we can tell, Papadopoulos never even had met with the president,” Nunes said.

One slight problem with Nunes’ claim: There is photographic evidence of him meeting with Trump during the campaign, from a March 2016 gathering of the council on which Papadopoulos served.

A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Mar 31, 2016 at 7:09pm PDT

Papadopoulos is seated four places to Trump’s right in the above photo.

Trump and his allies have offered dubious defenses in an effort to distance the president from the Russia probe. They’ve done this in part by trying to minimize the roles of indicted aides like Papadopoulos.

In October, Trump tweeted that Papadopoulos was merely a “young, low level volunteer” whom “few people knew” ― even though during his campaign, Trump had praised the foreign policy adviser as “an excellent guy.”

Former Trump adviser Michael Caputo memorably dismissed Papadopoulos as just “a coffee boy” for the campaign.

When asked about the photo of Trump and Papadopoulos, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders minimized it.

“The president has thousands of photographs with millions of people,” she told reporters in October.

PARK CITY, UTAH ― The new documentary “Half the Picture” opens with a stirring speech from actress Jessica Chastain, in which she addresses the lack of female representation on screen at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival.

“This is the first time I’ve watched 20 films in 10 days,” Chastain tells a room of festival jurors and members of the press. “The one thing I really took away from this experience is how the world views women from the female characters that I saw represented. It was quite disturbing to me... I do hope that when we include more female storytellers, we will have more of the women that I recognize in my day-to-day life. Ones who are proactive, have their own agency, don’t just react to the men around them.”

Chastain’s statement sets the tone for first-time feature director Amy Adrion’s film about gender bias in the entertainment industry and how it’s wreaked havoc on the careers of female directors.

Adrion and her mostly female production team began meeting with these women over two years ago, but they’ve watched in awe as the recent #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have brought the omnipresent power imbalance at the heart of “Half the Picture” to the fore of popular conversations. For Adrion, that imbalance has always been stark, long before reports of producer Harvey Weinstein’s egregious sexual misconduct hit headlines and prompted a flood of allegations about other powerful men.

Thankfully, people are starting to take notice of these damning statistics ― and the workplace environment that makes them possible ― courtesy of women like Adrion.

“We’re lucky that the awareness about women directors and representation behind the camera has really grown,” Adrion told HuffPost during a sit-down interview in Park City, Utah. “I’m a female director and I was having trouble getting my own projects going, and I was vicariously reading all of the studies, reports and articles about the number of women directors. The statistics and information are totally discouraging.”

“I knew a bunch of women directors who were successful and who I worked with,” she went on. “And I just thought, ‘Let me see if I can sit down with them and ask them how they got their first film made. How did they break through?’ So that’s where it started.”

Throughout the course of her interviews, Adrion spoke with women directors who relayed painfully similar stories of “overcoming no” in their industry. For many, success in the mostly “pale and male” world, as “Thirteen” and “Twilight” director Catherine Hardwicke puts it, involves persistently seeking means of control over their own work.

Jill Soloway, for example, says that prior to acquiring total control of her Amazon show “Transparent,” she was always “complaining about how the stuff I was writing was turning out.” After watching predominantly male directors bring her scripts to life on “Six Feet Under” and “United States of Tara,” Soloway concluded that the best and possibly only way to truly helm a project was to write, develop and produce it herself.

Getting to that point, however, often takes time. The great Ava DuVernay was only given the rare chance to helm a $100 million studio film, the upcoming “A Wrinkle in Time,” after she fought tooth and nail to make smaller projects like “Middle of Nowhere,” “Selma” and “13th.”

“I went into all of it with a[n attitude of] ‘I’m going to do it myself,’” DuVernay tells Adrion. “‘I will do it alone. I don’t need you. If you want to join in, great, but I don’t need you because this is going to happen regardless,’ was my armor in that time.”

Yet even when they’re in charge, many women reported that male crew members continue to challenge their authority. In “Half the Picture,” Lena Dunham recalls how a male colleague attempted to steer control of a Bleachers music video she was directing. Today, Dunham is “doggedly committed to defending my work,” she says.

And then there are the additional hurdles faced by mothers and caregivers at every point of their careers. “Me and You and Everyone We Know” director Miranda July tears up when describing to Adrion how much easier it is for her husband, fellow director Mike Mills, to go off to work.

“I was a little apologetic about [asking the motherhood question] because nobody asks James Cameron what he does with his four kids when he’s making ‘Avatar 2,’” Adrion told HuffPost. “But I have two little boys and manage the whole family and career thing, and I was grateful for the time the women gave us, and their very candid answers.”

“You can do it all. It's just going to be fucking hard.” - "Fifty Shades of Grey" director Sam Taylor-Johnson in "Half the Picture"

Even when men and women find themselves in similar positions in the film industry, with full control of their work, the issue of pay disparity rears its ugly head. Someone like Zack Snyder can expect to make around $10 million for a big-budget superhero movie, but fellow DC/Warner Bros. director Patty Jenkins made $1 million for “Wonder Woman” ― and was only recently given a significant raise to lead the next installment.

In Adrion’s film, Hardwicke talks about how she took a 57 percent pay cut to direct Warner Bros.’ “Red Riding Hood” following the immense success of “Twilight,” which earned $393 million worldwide. The studio asked her to accept a lower salary after they shrunk the production budget on the Amanda Seyfried-fronted film to $40 million from $75 million.

This is why “Wayne’s World” and “Black Sheep” director Penelope Spheeris (the comedic relief of “Half the Picture”) decided to trade in her life as a director for a more stable existence as a home renovator. Spheeris said she grew tired of “taking a lot of shit when you take a lot of money” and being made to feel less-than in an industry dominated by the opposite sex.

“The sexism that many women directors face is just not having their work valued,” Adrion said.

For filmmakers, value is often expressed through awards. Earlier this year, Natalie Portman introduced the 2018 Golden Globe nominees for best director with a short yet powerful ad-lib that summarized how award shows under-celebrate women. Standing alongside Ron Howard to present the award, the actress confidently uttered: “And here are the all-male nominees.”

“I’m definitely sensing a rising tide of courage, and we’re all feeding off each other in that way,” Adrion said. “Like the whole Natalie Portman thing about her introducing the all-male director category at the Golden Globes ― that was a very gutsy move. And a lot of the women in the audience and at home look at that and go, ‘OK, if Natalie Portman is going to put herself out in that way, what can I do in my life to be braver and stronger?’”

Portman is far from the only woman putting herself on the line. Actresses from Uma Thurman to Eva Longoria have come forward to speak about sexism, sexual harassment and assault, and unequal pay in their field. This time of reckoning signals hope for the women of Hollywood, and beyond.

But why, then, is a documentary so perfectly timed to this movement having trouble finding a buyer? “At this time the film is still looking for distribution,” a rep for “Half the Picture” confirmed to HuffPost Monday.

Adrion’s doc not only delves into the sexist world of directing; it addresses the unfortunate culture surrounding the industry as a whole, including the male-heavy circles of film critics, sales and distribution representatives, and studio executives. Are they not interested in a film about empowering women behind the camera? Let’s hope that’s not the case.Zendaya might be high-flying with Zac Efron on the big screen nowadays, but she hasn’t forgotten where she came from: the Disney Channel.

The singer and actress recently wrapped up a three-season run on network TV for her spy series, “K.C. Undercover,” which helped solidify her as one of the all-time Disney Channel greats. While there’s no doubt the 21-year-old is moving on to bigger and better things, she has every intention of creating space for those coming up behind her.

“I definitely want to maybe produce another show with Disney Channel, maybe develop something or create more stories that I think are powerful roles — especially for women and women of color,” Zendaya told Entertainment Weekly. “So, I think it’s important that young people see themselves on the screen and are able to relate to that.”

As a producer on “K.C. Undercover,” Zendaya actually retooled her character in the development stages to have a more empowering bent.

After nixing the show’s “whack” original title, “Super Awesome Katy,” she also demanded that the show feature a family of color and that her character’s talent not be singing or dancing, like the characters of past Disney starlets.

“The No. 1 thing for this show all along was empowerment — especially female empowerment,” she told Entertainment Weekly. “I wanted to make sure that there was a strong female character, and I think it’s cool that young women and young men can both look up and say, ‘Wow, I want to be like this girl.’ If you love something and you’re excited, there should be nothing holding you back from doing that.”

Zendaya essentially live-streamed her reactions to the last episode of the series, uploading videos of herself watching the finale on social media. She also shared a heartfelt post on Instagram thanking her followers for “continuing to grow with me.”

WASHINGTON ― The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday morning that a federal ban on sports gambling is unconstitutional, paving the way for sports betting to spread across the United States.

The ruling in the case known as Murphy v. NCAA is the result of a 2014 legal challenge from the state of New Jersey and will invalidate the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, which prohibited wagering on single sporting contests except in Nevada.

BREAKING: U.S. Supreme Court rules that federal ban on state-sanctioned sports betting is unconstitutional. Decides case in favor of New Jersey. Floodgates now officially open for other states to allow sports betting. #RIPPASPA — Daniel Wallach (@WALLACHLEGAL) May 14, 2018

New Jersey passed laws to legalize sports gambling in 2012 and again in 2014, only to have its attempts shot down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, which ruled that PASPA prohibited states from allowing gambling on sports. New Jersey responded by suing and built its case on the argument that the federal government could not compel states to regulate activities Congress had chosen not to police itself.

Six justices joined the majority to invalidate the law, while Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the majority opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer elected to join most of the majority, but said in his own opinion that he also agreed, in part, with Ginsburg.

It was, essentially, an argument not over sports gambling but over the powers of the federal government in a federalist system. And the court sided with New Jersey, with Justice Samuel Alito writing in the majority opinion: “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”

The four major men’s sports leagues ― the NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL ― and the NCAA all opposed New Jersey’s efforts. However, an outcome in favor of sports gambling was widely expected after oral arguments in December, when a number of justices indicated support for the state’s arguments.

The ruling will allow New Jersey to regulate sports gambling almost immediately, and other states could follow soon: Pennsylvania has already legalized sports gambling, and was only waiting for the Supreme Court decision to continue moving forward. West Virginia and Mississippi could also continue their efforts to legalize the practice. At least a dozen other states are considering legislation to legalize sports gambling.

“Today’s decision is a victory for the millions of Americans who seek to bet on sports in a safe and regulated manner,” the American Gaming Association said in a statement after the ruling. “Today’s ruling makes it possible for states and sovereign tribal nations to give Americans what they want: an open, transparent, and responsible market for sports betting.”

The Supreme Court decision could also push the issue onto the agenda in Congress, which could choose to legalize and regulate sports betting on the federal level. That’s the approach favored by sports leagues like the NBA, which sought to block New Jersey’s efforts not because it is opposed to sports gambling, but because it prefers a federal regulatory scheme to a patchwork of various state laws.

Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) last year introduced legislation known as the GAME Act to provide federal oversight on sports gambling and said Monday that the decision should push Congress to act on his bill.

“The states are going to go wild, wild west for a while.” - Paul Martino, an investor in FanDuel

“Now that the Supreme Court has struck down this unlawful and confusing law, it is time for Congress to move the GAME Act forward to ensure that consumer protections are in place in any state that decides to implement sports betting,” Pallone said in a statement.

Progress on that front, however, could be slow, especially in an election year, meaning states will likely continue to set the agenda on sports gambling.

“I think there’ll be a full year until the federal government comes in with guidance. Stranger things have happened, but I’d put it low on the list,” said Paul Martino, an investor in FanDuel, one of the largest daily fantasy sports operators. “The states are going to go wild, wild west for a while.”

In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that while his league still favors “a federal framework that would provide a uniform approach to sports gambling in states that choose to permit it,” it will “remain active in ongoing discussions with state legislatures.”

The NCAA, which has previously threatened to move events from states that legalize gambling, said in its statement that it “will adjust sports wagering and championship policies to align with the direction from the court.”

Though gambling was the central issue in the case, New Jersey’s states’ rights argument also turned Murphy v. NCAA into “perhaps the most important federalism case the Supreme Court has heard in years,” Daniel Wallach, a gambling law expert, said after oral arguments in December. As such, Monday’s ruling could have implications far beyond the world of sports, including immigration, gun rights and marijuana legalization.

That’s because New Jersey argued, and the Supreme Court ultimately agreed, that PASPA violated the “anti-commandeering doctrine,” a somewhat controversial legal theory that says Congress cannot compel states to enforce federal laws in place of the federal government.

The doctrine has become more significant in recent years as President Donald Trump has threatened to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities that place some limits on their agreements to enforce federal immigration laws. A federal judge blocked Trump’s executive order targeting sanctuary cities in November, arguing that it violated the Constitution’s protections on separations of power, and legal experts have suggested that a ruling in favor of New Jersey in the gambling case could bolster sanctuary cities’ fight against the administration.

The question at the heart of the gambling case also applies to city and state efforts to legalize marijuana despite federal prohibition laws, a growing movement that likely also received a boost from the Supreme Court ruling on Monday morning.
