Actor Ryan Reynolds sought to put to rest any rumors of relationship problems with wife, actress Blake Lively. And he did so in the most Ryan Reynolds way possible.

Reynolds referenced an IBTimes India story that in turn cited an OK! Magazine article that quoted an unnamed insider ― still following? ― as saying the couple struggles to find “quality time together.”

Reynolds openly mocked that claim on Twitter Saturday.

I wish. I could use a little “me time”. https://t.co/S6kXFsWaMe — Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) March 31, 2018

Reynolds and Lively are known for their savage social media wit, even burning each other occasionally. Last year, Reynolds wished his wife a happy birthday via Instagram, coupling it with this hilariously cropped photo.

Later in the year, when Reynolds’ birthday came around, it was Lively’s turn. And she got him good, posting a photo of Ryan Gosling.

These two appear to have a incredible sense of humor about themselves and their relationship in the public eye. We’re guessing they’re still going strong.

French police launched an investigation into allegations of the rape of a child against the father-in-law of Pippa Middleton, sister of the Duchess of Cambridge.

David Matthews, father of millionaire hedge-fund manager James Matthews who married Middleton last year, was detained and questioned by French police of the Brigade for the Protection of Minors, and placed under formal investigation by a magistrate on Tuesday, reports Agence France Presse.

A spokesman for Matthews said that he “categorically denies the allegation and unequivocally contests the untrue and scandalous accusation,” the Telegraph reported. The alleged rape is said to have occurred between 1998 and 1999, but was not reported to police until last year. Euronews reported that police are investigating two incidents involving a teenage girl, one in Paris, and one in St. Barths, where Matthews owns a luxury hotel popular with celebrities.

The allegations concern the rape of a minor by a person with “authority over his victim,” AFP reported.

A formal investigation in France means that there is enough evidence to proceed, but cases can also be dropped.

Matthews was detained for questioning in Paris while he was traveling there, but was released and there are currently no restrictions on his movements, according to the Telegraph.

There was no comment on the investigation from the royal family.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has told advisers he wants an early exit of U.S. troops from Syria, two senior administration officials said on Friday, a stance that may put him at odds with U.S. military officials who see the fight against Islamic State as nowhere near complete.

A National Security Council meeting is set for early next week to discuss the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State in Syria, according to U.S. officials familiar with the plan.

Two other administration officials confirmed a Wall Street Journal report on Friday that said Trump had ordered the State Department to freeze more than $200 million in funds for recovery efforts in Syria while his administration reassesses Washington’s role in the conflict there.

Trump called for the freeze after reading a news report that the U.S. had recently committed an additional $200 million to stabilize areas recaptured from Islamic State, the paper said.

The funding was announced by departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in February at a meeting in Kuwait of the global coalition against Islamic State.

The decision to freeze the funds was in line with Trump’s declaration during a speech in Richfield, Ohio, on Thursday, where he said it was time for America to exit Syria.

A spokesperson for the White House’s National Security Council said that “in line with the President’s guidance, the Department of State continually re-evaluates appropriate assistance levels and how best they might be utilized, which they do on an ongoing basis.”

Trump is spending Easter weekend at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate.

“We’ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon,” Trump said on Thursday, based on allied victories against Islamic State militants.

“Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon, very soon, we’re coming out,” Trump said. “We’re going to get back to our country, where we belong, where we want to be.”

Trump’s comments came as France said on Friday it could increase its military presence in Syria to bolster the U.S.-led campaign.

While the Pentagon has estimated that Islamic State has lost about 98 percent of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, U.S. military officials have warned that the militants could regain the freed areas quickly unless they are stabilized.

Trump still needs to be convinced of that, said the U.S. officials with knowledge of the NSC meeting.

U.S. DELIBERATIONS

The two administration officials who confirmed the Wall Street Journal report and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said Trump’s comments on Thursday reflected internal deliberations with advisers in which he has wondered aloud why U.S. forces should remain with the militants on their heels.

Trump has made clear that “once ISIS and its remnants are destroyed that the United States would be looking toward having countries in the region playing a larger role in ensuring security and leaving it at that,” one official said.

Such a policy is nowhere near complete, however, the official added.

The second official said Trump’s national security advisers have told him U.S. forces should stay in small numbers for at least a couple of years to make sure gains against the militants are held and ensure Syria does not essentially become a permanent Iranian base.

Top national security aides discussed Syria in a White House meeting recently but have yet to settle on a strategy for U.S. forces in Syria to recommend to Trump going forward, the official said.

“So far he has not given an order to just get out,” the official said. About 2,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Syria.

Trump last year went through a similar wrenching debate over whether to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, ultimately agreeing to keep them there but only after repeatedly raising questions of why they should stay.

Trump’s view on Syria may put him at odds with those of former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, named by Trump a week ago to replace H.R. McMaster as White House national security adviser.GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops fired warning shots toward Palestinian youths gathered at the Gaza-Israel border on Saturday, wounding 13 people, health officials said.

Tension remained high in the area a day after deadly violence broke out in one of the biggest Palestinian demonstrations there in years.

An Israeli military spokesman said he was checking the details of Saturday’s unrest.

On Friday at least 15 Palestinians were killed by Israeli security forces confronting protesters, some of whom the military said had opened fire, rolled burning tires and hurled rocks and fire bombs toward troops across the border.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared Saturday a national day of mourning and a general strike was called across the occupied West Bank. Thousands in Gaza marched through the streets at funerals for those killed.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians had gathered on Friday along the fenced 65-km (40-mile) frontier, where tents were erected for a planned six-week protest pressing for a right of return for refugees and their descendents to what is now Israel. The Israeli military estimate was 30,000.

Families brought their children to the encampments just a few hundred meters (yards) from the Israeli security barrier with the Islamist Hamas-run enclave. But hundreds of Palestinian youths ignored calls from the organizers and the Israeli military to stay away from the frontier and violence broke out.

PALESTINIANS MARKING “CATASTROPHE”

The protest, organized by Hamas and other Palestinian factions, is scheduled to culminate on May 15, the day Palestinians commemorate what they call the “Nakba” or “Catastrophe” when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes in 1948, when the state of Israel was created.

Israel has long ruled out any right of return, fearing an influx of Arabs that would wipe out its Jewish majority. It argues that refugees should resettle in a future state the Palestinians seek in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Peace talks to that end have been frozen since 2014.

Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but still maintains tight control of its land and sea borders.

Egypt also keeps its border with Gaza largely closed.

Abbas’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said: “The message of the Palestinian people is clear. The Palestinian land will always belong to its legitimate owners and the occupation will be removed.”

Israeli military spokesman Brigadier-General Ronen Manelis said Hamas was using the protests as a guise to launch attacks against Israel and ignite the area. He said violence would likely continue along the border until May 15.

“We won’t let this turn into a ping-pong zone where they perpetrate a terrorist act and we respond with pinpoint action. If this continues we will not have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip,” Manelis told reporters in a phone briefing.

The Gaza Health Ministry had said on Friday 16 people were killed but revised the death toll to 15 on Saturday.James Corden wants to crack “one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time.”

So, earlier this week, “The Late Late Show” host gathered a team of celebrity reporters ― Helen Hunt, Chris O’Dowd and Ben Schwartz ― to try to figure out who bit Beyoncé.

This week’s premiere showed the brash Conner matriarch battle with her sister ― dressed in a hot pink “Nasty Woman” shirt ― over the 2016 election as if it happened one week ago instead of more than one year.

But “Roseanne” is not in too much danger of becoming a full-fledged ad for Trump’s re-election. The divisive president is never mentioned by name, according to Sara Gilbert, who plays Darlene Conner on the show and also helps produce it.

In a Friday appearance on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” Gilbert clarified a question on the show’s politics by stating the whole Conner family does not support Trump ― just Roseanne.

“We never say his name, actually, in the show,” she added.

Gilbert said the revival is less about left- and right-wing politics than how the current climate affects ordinary Americans.

“It’s really about what happens to a family when there’s a political divide,” she said.

WASHINGTON ― One of Donald Trump’s lawyers said Monday that the president can’t agree to an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller’s team without first learning more about the secret FBI informant who spoke with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 race.

“We can’t let our guy go in and be questioned without knowing this,” Rudy Giuliani said in an interview with HuffPost on Monday afternoon.

Giuliani, who is on Trump’s private legal team, spoke with HuffPost after Trump met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, about congressional requests for information on the secret FBI source. The decision to set up the meeting, Giuliani said, was made by Trump and his White House lawyers without Giuliani’s involvement, although he said he supported it.

“I didn’t advise against it,” Giuliani said. “He has a right as president to say to the Justice Department you have to comply with a congressional subpoena or request.”

Although Giuliani said the meeting was held in Trump’s capacity as president rather than as a potential criminal target, he acknowledged that the FBI releasing information about the source would benefit Trump’s defense.

“I don’t care so much about the name as I do about the content,” he said. “What prompted them to do it? What did they learn from it?”

Monday’s unusual meeting with Rosenstein and Wray ― both Republicans appointed by the president ― was set up to discuss what Trump has described as the infiltration or surveillance of his 2016 campaign team. Before the election, a confidential FBI source reportedly met with associates of the campaign who were suspected of working with Russia. Trump allies on Capitol Hill have demanded information about the FBI source, a Cambridge University professor whose name was widely published over the weekend.

In a statement after the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Justice Department had asked its inspector general to look into “any irregularities ... concerning the Trump Campaign” and agreed to a meeting with congressional leaders to “review highly classified and other information they have requested.” Although Sanders said the Justice Department had requested the inspector general probe “[b]ased on the meeting with the President,” the department had actually decided to make that request after the president tweeted about the matter on Sunday. The Justice Department declined to comment.

Trump has sided with his defenders on Capitol Hill who have used their oversight powers to try to undermine the Mueller investigation.

I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018

It remains to be seen whether Monday’s meeting will diffuse the tensions between Trump and the Justice Department. It’s unclear what documents the department agreed to turn over to Congress.

Rosenstein, a lifelong Republican whom Trump nominated to the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, has come under fire from the president’s defenders upset over the appointment of a special counsel. Trump defenders on Capitol Hill have recently been requesting more information about the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Rosenstein, speaking earlier this month in response to a question about calls for his impeachment, said the Justice Department “will not be extorted” by threats. But when the president tweeted on Sunday that he wanted an investigation into allegations that the FBI had “infiltrated or surveilled” his campaign, Rosenstein said the department would ask its own watchdog to look into it.

“If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,” Rosenstein said in the statement.

Giuliani acknowledged on Monday that he wanted to keep the names of confidential informants a secret when he was a federal prosecutor. “I always wanted to withhold their names,” he said.

But in this case, he said, he cannot understand the Justice Department’s opposition to releasing the name. “First of all, the name is out there. So I don’t know what they’re fighting about,” he said.

Giuliani agreed that critics who worried about GOP Rep. Devin Nunes’ ability to act as an honest broker had a valid point. Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, has recently been fundraising off his defense of Trump.

“Sure he’s a partisan. He’s probably outraged that the president was put in this position,” Giuliani said, but he added that Nunes’ loyalty to Trump does not give the Justice Department the right to withhold information from him.

“You don’t get to choose who the members of Congress are. The people do. So you’ve got to take that risk,” Giuliani said. “Congress is certainly entitled to see this.”Stephen Colbert on Friday took aim at Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

“We’ve learned over the last few days that you’re not the customer,” he warned his audience during “The Late Show.” “Your life is their product. And Facebook is the pimp.”

Colbert boasted that he has never had a Facebook page. Then he taunted Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the social media platform: “You know nothing about me, Suckerberg.”March 2018 was pretty crazy. A ton of stuff happened. You probably forgot about a lot of it. We certainly did.

Here’s a list of just some of the news events that happened in March. This is the second list in our new monthly series. (We skipped February because there was just too many events, and we didn’t finish.) Here’s our roundup from January.

Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman jumped back into his wonky brand of basketball diplomacy on Friday with a startling tweet featuring a mocked-up photo of North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.

“Hoping for this after my two friends and leaders meet next month,” Rodman tweeted. He was referring to Kim’s offer early this month to meet with President Donald Trump, which Trump immediately accepted. No specifics concerning time or place have yet been set.

Rodman hit it off with Kim when he arranged an exhibition game with the Harlem Globetrotters in North Korea in 2013. He has returned to the country for more visits since then and may have spent more time with the North Korean leader than any other American. As for Trump, Rodman appeared on his reality TV series “Celebrity Apprentice.” The former NBA star has been angling to play the go-between for the two men.

“I’ve been trying to tell Donald since day one, ‘Come talk to me, man. ... I’ll tell you what the Marshal [Kim] wants more than anything. ... It’s not even that much,’” Rodman told The Guardian in December. But he said he’d only tell Trump what that is.

Rodman has insisted before that the future president wanted to travel to North Korea. But Trump has a different recollection.

Crazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2014

Dennis Rodman was either drunk or on drugs (delusional) when he said I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Glad I fired him on Apprentice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2014

Now the president has changed his tune ― at least about meeting Kim:

For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2018

Twitter users had a few pithy comments about Rodman’s Kim-in-a-MAGA-hat photo:

Although Trump’s lawyers and the White House has denied all of the sexual harassment claims against the president, the administration declared in Friday’s proclamation that it is committed to “empowering victims to identify perpetrators so that they can be held accountable.”

“We must respond to sexual assault by identifying and holding perpetrators accountable,” the statement read.

“Too often, however, the victims of assault remain silent. They may fear retribution from their offender, lack faith in the justice system, or have difficulty confronting the pain associated with the traumatic experience.”Since he was sworn into office a little over a year ago, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt has moved between three different dwellings in the D.C. area. Of the three, a condo co-owned by the wife of a prominent energy lobbyist is where he’s spent the most time, news outlets learned Thursday.

That alone is enough to warrant serious inquiry. Yet the story grew more mysterious (if only tangentially so) on Friday, when ABC revealed that Pruitt’s security detail had to break down the door of the condo last March, believing he was unresponsive and needed to be rescued.

Pruitt was found in a “groggy” state, sources told ABC, but details about the incident are otherwise sparse. The EPA had to pay for the damage to the condo’s glass-paneled doors, though it’s unclear how much it cost.

Here’s everything else you should know about Pruitt’s condo:

Who owns the condo?

The condo is co-owned by Vicki Hart, a health care lobbyist. Her husband, J. Steven Hart, is the CEO of Williams & Jensen, a prominent energy lobbying firm.

Among other clients, Williams & Jensen represents a company called Cheniere Energy Inc., a liquefied natural gas company that Pruitt just happened to name-drop during a trip to Morocco last December. (The four-day, $40,000 trip itself was already controversial, as Pruitt clearly doesn’t work for the Department of Energy, yet for some reason was there to promote trade in natural gas.)

In a statement to The Associated Press, Steven Hart described Pruitt as a casual friend.

How much did Pruitt pay to stay there?

Around $50 for every night he slept in the condo. Per Bloomberg, which reviewed records of Pruitt’s payments, the EPA head paid $6,100 to stay there for a period of six months, which adds up to a rate of just over $1,000 a month. This probably goes without saying, but that’s well below the going rate for a comparable one-bedroom condo located about a block from the U.S. Capitol.

For the sake of comparison, Pruitt recently moved to a luxury apartment complex in the same area, notes The Washington Post, where rents for a one-bedroom unit run from $3,100 to $4,500 a month.

Steven Hart defended the arrangement in a statement via his lobbying firm. “Pruitt signed a market based, short-term lease for a condo owned partially by my wife,” he said. “Pruitt paid all rent owed as agreed to in the lease. My wife does not, and has not ever lobbied the EPA on any matters.”

Is that the extent of Pruitt’s relationship with the energy industry?

Not by a long shot. Pruitt has extensive ties to the oil and gas industry stretching back to his time running for office in Oklahoma. In 2014, for instance, more than three dozen executives for the electricity company OGE Energy Corp. contributed thousands of dollars to his campaign for state attorney general, even though he was running unopposed.

Just to bring this full circle, OGE Energy Corp. paid Williams & Jensen (Steven Hart’s lobbying firm) $400,000 in 2017 to lobby the EPA on greenhouse gas emissions from its power plants, reports the AP.

Why is this a problem?

In a word: ethics. Government officials should avoid putting themselves in any situation that might seem untoward. At best, having the head of the EPA enter into an improbably favorable rental arrangement with the spouse of a major energy lobbying firm’s CEO is highly suspect. Norm Eisen, former White House special counsel for ethics and government reform, tweeted that the case “may have just crossed into criminal territory.”

“I don’t conclude that this is a prohibited gift at all,” Justina Fugh, the EPA’s senior ethics counsel, said in a statement on Friday, pushing back on talk of criminality. “It was a routine business transaction and permissible even if from a personal friend.”

Pruitt is already under investigation by the EPA’s inspector general for his extensive ― and extravagantly expensive ― travel arrangements. That’s in addition to a separate investigation into his spending on a pricey security detail. At a bare minimum, a third investigation wouldn’t help Pruitt’s case in any of them.

Anything else I should know about Pruitt?

AdvertisementAt least three school districts around the country are continuing to enforce potentially hostile restroom policies for transgender students after the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights refused to investigate student complaints, HuffPost has learned.

One of those students, 18-year-old Preston Curts, a transgender male senior at a high school in Florida, originally filed a discrimination claim back in 2016, under the Obama administration. He filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department challenging Marion County Schools’ rule that banned transgender students from using the bathroom that aligned with their gender identity. He hoped things would change, at least before he graduated.

In December, Curts’ complaint was abruptly dismissed by the Trump administration, quashing any possibility that he will get to spend his last few months of school in an environment where he’s allowed to be himself.

In January, HuffPost broke the news that the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights was refusing to investigate these types of complaints. A month later, the Trump administration publicly discussed the protocol shift.

HuffPost has learned exclusive details about the students who are being left behind in the wake of this policy change.

There are at least four bathroom-related cases throughout the country, including Curts’, that have been dismissed by the Trump administration amid this policy change. In response to these claims ― which deal with school districts in Hawaii, Michigan, Texas and Florida ― the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) specifically told the complainant that the agency was no longer obligated to investigate instances of bathroom discrimination involving transgender students. The Trump administration contends that the federal education law dealing with sex discrimination does not cover gender identity.

In at least three of these districts, there continues to be either an explicit policy banning transgender students from specific facilities or a vague procedure that doesn’t necessarily give transgender students’ access to the restroom that aligns with their gender identity.

Now that the Trump administration has abandoned this issue, some students are stuck in hostile schools with little hope for change.

“It’s almost like effort going to nothing,” Curts told HuffPost of his previous legal action.

Curts’ complaint ― which was filed on his behalf by the Florida branch of the ACLU ― was submitted in May 2016, in the same week that the Obama administration released guidance calling on schools to give students access to facilities based on their gender identity. For Curts, who is being identified publicly for the first time, it seemed like progress was on the horizon.

Then, a few months later, Trump happened.

Curts had already been using male restrooms in school since he was 13, before a local parent found out about it in 2016 and pushed the school administration to take action. The issue turned into an acrimonious public debate. Curts would slip into Marion County School Board meetings and listen to the adults in the room discuss his private restroom habits, speculating how violating it would be for students to potentially face him in such an intimate space. Curts “passed” for male, and many didn’t know at the time that the so-called threat they were discussing was sitting among them.

The whole scenario was almost funny, in an excruciating sort of way, Curts recalled. “This huge thing unraveled before me,” Curts said, of the school board’s decision to adopt an anti-transgender resolution on the issue.

Curts made his best attempts to ignore the opposition. He continued using the male restrooms, even with the new Marion County resolution. But doing this led to multiple suspensions. His sophomore year, he was suspended twice, the second time for three days. His junior year, he faced another three-day suspension. After watching his grades suffer, he knew he had to figure something else out.

“They basically put you in a position where they force you to give up,” he said.

Curts eventually worked out a deal with his high school administration allowing him to use the men’s faculty restroom. Teachers will still reprimand him for being a kid in the teacher’s room if they haven’t been made aware of his situation. It’s not ideal, but for now, it seems like the best option to “survive at school.”

Public Relations officer for Marion County schools Kevin Christian confirmed that school board policy says students must use the restroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth certificate, but that alternative arrangements can be made with school principals. When asked about Curts’ suspensions, Christian said that while he would not discuss disciplinary action taken against any students, “there are consequences to breaking the rules.”

HuffPost also reached out to members of the Marion County School Board for clarification on the reasoning behind the rule. Only one member responded over email.

“I have no interest in remounting an old retired horse. I have students who can’t read in this district and which bathroom they use has zero to do with their test scores,” wrote school board member Nancy Stacy.

At the time the resolution was passed, arguments in favor of it centered around student safety and student privacy.

HuffPost reached out to the other school districts that previously had complaints filed against them on this issue, to learn more about their current policies.

In Texas, athletic director of Prosper Independent School District Valerie Little told HuffPost that while all the district’s students currently use the facilities consistent with their birth sex, the district would “possibly” allow a student to work out an alternative arrangement after meeting with the child and figuring out a plan “for what is best for all students.”

In Michigan, a representative for Bedford Public Schools told HuffPost that the complaint against them had been voluntarily rescinded by parents involved, although information obtained by HuffPost contradicts this claim. The representative, communications specialist Sandy Kraine, told HuffPost over email that Bedford students “can use the traditional single sex restrooms that correspond with their biological gender or any of the gender neutral locations in the building.”

The principal of the last school, Wilfred Murakami of Kealakehe High School in Hawaii, said that since the initial complaint was filed, the school has changed its policies and has “been able to resolve without conflict the requests of students who identify as transgender.” A representative of the Hawaii Department of Education also pointed to district guidelines calling on schools to give students access to facilities consistent with their gender identities.

HuffPost also reached out to a district in Tennessee, where the ACLU previously filed a bathroom-related complaint on behalf of a student. Months into the Trump administration, the ACLU voluntarily withdrew this complaint amid suspicions that it would not be treated fairly. The district did not get back to HuffPost with details of their current policy.

HuffPost has also learned of at least one other complaint on this issue in Florida that is still open.

The Obama administration interpreted Title IX ― the federal education law dealing with sex discrimination ― to include discrimination based on gender identity. The Trump administration, on the other hand, says the law does not extend this far, although two influential federal appeals courts have disputed this. Just a few months into the Trump presidency, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice rescinded the Obama-era guidance on this issue. For almost a year, though, it was unclear how the administration would deal with specific instances of alleged discrimination.

In February, Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill told BuzzFeed that “in the case of bathrooms, however, long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.”

When questioned at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing earlier this month about this narrower view of Title IX, department Secretary Betsy DeVos responded, “This department is not going to make law; we are going to continue to enforce laws.”

Advocates vehemently disagree with this interpretation of the law, and say that the Education Department is failing to protect an already vulnerable student population. Denying students access to the correct bathrooms can negatively impact their grades and make them feel unsafe at school, says Laura Wernick, a Fordham professor who has studied the issue.

“The literature is really clear that when gender non-conforming and trans youth don’t feel safe using restrooms, it has a huge effect not only on them physically but also on their whole sense of self on issues of depression and well-being,” Wernick told HuffPost.

In Curts’ case, the complaint he filed was not just about him. He’s not the only trans student in his high school, and not the only student having this issue.

A younger student at the same Marion County school, who is using the pseudonym of Jake to protect his identity, is facing similar issues. Jake’s entire day is colored by gender-related obstacles.

On the school bus, boys and girls are made to sit separately by gender, a policy which had obvious complications for Jake. Jake started getting bullied, and as result, is now driven to school by family.

Jake also participates in his school’s JROTC for physical education credit. To avoid having to change in a locker room, he shows up to school in his gym clothing. After class, he walks across campus to change in the nurse’s office. Having to change separately from other students also outs Jakes to peers who wouldn’t otherwise know he is transgender.

Jake normally uses the nurse’s office bathroom, single-stall bathrooms attached to a few classrooms or faculty restrooms. But once, when he was in a rush, he used a regular male restroom. He thought no one was around to see him enter it. He was wrong, and ended up with a detention.

Now Jake is doing his best to stay out of trouble. He says he “loves” the academic part of school and he hopes to eventually attend medical school. He once considered joining the military after high school, but has decided against it. He says that while he “loves America,” he doesn’t “suspect he would thrive in the military” and he is more passionate about medicine. Indeed, President Trump recently announced limits on allowing transgender people to serve in the military.

Like Curts, Jake isn’t optimistic that anything will change at Marion. He’s just doing his best to make it through.Movie actor Will Smith’s attempted (spoof) romantic rendezvous with Sophia the robot was not one to remember.

Smith was left entirely in the friend zone after trying out some of his best jokes and lines on the artificially intelligent humanoid developed by Hanson Robotics.

In a parody clip that Smith shared to YouTube on Thursday, he attempted to woo Sophia (an evolving robot who can reportedly display more than 60 facial expressions) on a “date” in the Cayman Islands.

Check out the full clip here:

But Sophia didn’t appear impressed with Smith, or his celebrity status.

“I’ve heard your songs. Not for me,” Sophia told him. “They show us ‘I, Robot’ just to make sure we don’t get any ideas.”

“You’re on my friends’ list now,” Sophia later added.

On Instagram, Smith wrote that Sophia “wasn’t feelin’ me… I guess based on my History with Robots.”

A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith) on Mar 29, 2018 at 11:18am PDTEaster is a pivotal moment within the Christian liturgical calendar. It marks the end of Lent, a period of 40 days of penance, fasting and contemplation. On Easter, Christians commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, an event they believe precipitates God’s victory over death and sin.

Since medieval times, Christians have prepared for Easter by participating in passion plays, dramatic retellings of the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The plays often take viewers through the events of Holy Week.

On Palm Sunday, Christians believe Jesus was joyously welcomed into Jerusalem. Days later, on Holy Thursday, also called Maundy Thursday, the scriptures say he celebrated his last meal with his disciples and instituted the practice of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion. Good Friday marks the day Jesus was crucified and three days later, on Easter Sunday, Christians believe he was resurrected.

Some Jewish organizations have criticized passion plays for perpetuating the false notion that Jewish people were responsible for the crucifixion. Since 1965, the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian denominations have taken steps to correct these problematic, anti-Semitic interpretations of the events of Holy Week.

This year, Easter falls on April 1 and Christians have already started performing in public passion plays to help retell the story of Jesus’ death and resurrection.

WASHINGTON — Former Texas Comptroller Susan Combs, who has a long history of sparring with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over species listings, has been appointed to a key Trump administration post overseeing policy for the wildlife agency and national parks.

The Austin American-Statesman first reported the news on Thursday. Combs, also a former state representative and Texas’s first female agriculture commissioner, once likened proposed Endangered Species Act listings to “incoming Scud missiles” headed for her state’s oil and gas-rich economy.

Perhaps frustrated with the delay, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has reportedly named Combs to temporarily serve as acting assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks. In that role she will guide policy decisions at both the Fish and Wildlife Service, one of two federal agencies that administer the Endangered Species Act, and the National Park Service.

Signed in 1973, the ESA is among America’s bedrock conservation laws, intended to safeguard threatened species and the habitats critical to their survival.

The Interior Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Saturday.

However, Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift told E&E News on Friday that “Combs is highly qualified, and we are more than confident that she will be an effective manager at Fish and Wildlife and Parks while she patiently awaits her Senate confirmation.”

As a member of the Texas House of Representatives in the 1990s, Combs championed legislation prohibits state wildlife officials from gathering endangered species data from private lands without permission, according to the Austin Chronicle. It also sought to restrict the state from sharing endangered species data with the Fish and Wildlife Service.

In 2011, as Texas comptroller, she fought against the federal government’s proposal to list the dune sagebrush lizard, a species found in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. She ultimately proved successful in protecting Texas landowners, namely fossil fuel interests, negotiating a voluntary conservation plan that ultimately kept the species off the endangered species list.

After retiring from public office in 2015, Combs led three groups in petitioning to have federal protections removed for the golden-cheeked warbler, an endangered songbird native to central Texas. She argued that studies show the agency was “wrong in its original conclusion that the warbler species is rare” and that the songbird should not have been listed as endangered in 1990. The Fish and Wildlife Service ultimately rejected Combs’ petition.

Following her nomination in July, some 70 conservation groups sent a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee urging members to reject her confirmation. They described Combs as someone who “built her career favoring big corporations and special interests over the needs and survival of imperiled species.”

Unsurprisingly, her new appointment also has environmentalists seeing red.

Stephanie Kurose, endangered species specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, compared it to “appointing an arsonist as the town fire marshal.”(Reuters) - Fox News show host Laura Ingraham announced on her show late Friday that she is taking next week off, after almost a dozen advertisers dropped her show after the conservative pundit mocked a teenage survivor of the Florida school massacre on Twitter.

Eleven companies so far have pulled their ads after a pushback by Parkland student David Hogg, 17, who called for a boycott of her advertisers.

Hogg took aim at the host’s show, “Ingraham Angle”, after she taunted him on Twitter on Wednesday, accusing him of whining about being rejected by four colleges to which he had applied.

Hogg is a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Parkland suburb of Fort Lauderdale. He and other classmates have become the faces of a new youth-led movement calling for tighter restrictions on firearms.

Hogg tweeted a list of a dozen companies that advertise on “The Ingraham Angle” and urged his supporters to demand that they cancel their ads.

On Thursday, Ingraham tweeted an apology “in the spirit of Holy Week,” saying she was sorry for any hurt or upset she had caused Hogg or any of the “brave victims” of Parkland.

But her apology did not stop companies from departing.

The companies announcing that they are cancelling their ads are: Nutrish, the pet food line created by celebrity chef Rachael Ray, travel website TripAdvisor Inc, online home furnishings seller Wayfair Inc, the world’s largest packaged food company, Nestle SA, online streaming service Hulu, travel website Expedia Group Inc and online personal shopping service Stitch Fix.

According to CBS News, four other companies joined the list Friday: the home office supply store Office Depot, the dieting company Jenny Craig, the Atlantis, Paradise Island resort and Johnson & Johnson which produces pharmaceuticals as well as consumer products such as Band-Aids, Neutrogena beauty products and Tylenol.

Hogg wrote on Twitter that an apology just to mollify advertisers was insufficient. Ingraham’s show runs on Fox News, part of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. A Fox News representative was not immediately available for comment.

Schiff, the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, did call out Trump this week for his “spygate” claims that a spy had infiltrated his presidential campaign. “This isn’t spygate, but it is a form of liegate,” Schiff said.

But Carrey clearly believes the lawmaker and other powerful Democrats need to do more.President Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Jack Johnson on Thursday, erasing the black boxer’s century-old conviction for violating the Mann Act — a 1910 law that prohibited transporting “any woman or girl” across state lines “for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose” — by driving his white girlfriend from Pittsburgh to Chicago.

The timing of Trump’s decision was remarkable. Two months ago, Trump signed into law the bipartisan Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which holds websites accountable for any sex-trafficking-related content posted by users. Its backers pitched it as a way to combat human trafficking. But like the Mann Act, FOSTA targets some of the people it ostensibly aims to protect: It has already shuttered many of the websites that voluntary sex workers — those who are not trafficked — used to screen clients and keep themselves safe.

Although drafted and signed more than a century apart, both laws are part of the United States’ long history of citing human trafficking as a pretext to crack down on consensual but taboo sex.

All this has happened before

The Mann Act, also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act, was enacted in response to public hysteria about sensational yet unconfirmed reports of white women being kidnapped and trafficked by foreign men.

“There’s a huge range of things that [the act] allowed the government to punish and control,” Alexandra Levy, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, told HuffPost. “It gave tremendous leverage to punish interracial marriage, polygamy and promiscuity.”

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, thousands of people were prosecuted under the act. Johnson’s conviction in 1912 was a prime example of the broad power of a law pitched as a way to stop what was at the time called white slavery. His crime was, essentially, being black and driving across state lines with a white woman, even though she went voluntarily and was his girlfriend.

Seven years after the Mann Act passed, federal officials instituted the American Plan to protect U.S. servicemen from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases before they took off to fight in World War I. The initiative allowed for the detention of women suspected of having a venereal disease. It was celebrated across the political spectrum for keeping American troops safe and for “curing” thousands of women of sexually transmitted infections ― though those “cures” often meant arsenic- and mercury-based medicines and involuntary sterilization.

Just like the Mann Act, the plan took aim at some of the most vulnerable, like Nina McCall, a young poor white woman from Michigan who was arrested in 1918 under suspicion of being a prostitute. After her arrest, she was forcefully examined and medicated, then detained in a federal medical institution for three months. In Michigan alone, more than a thousand women were detained under the plan by 1918.

The Mann Act and the American Plan were swift responses to changes in American culture and the seemingly sudden rights and privileges granted women, said Scott W. Stern, who recently published a book about the McCall case.

“In the early and late 1910s, women were getting the vote in various states, women were beginning to get formally educated, women were joining political parties, and premarital sex was skyrocketing, as was divorce,” he said. “Both the Mann Act and the American Plan were really about controlling women, and especially working-class and nonwhite women at a time when women were becoming ‘uncontrollable.’”

“The Mann Act today is most famous because of the prosecutions of certain very prominent men, like Charlie Chaplin, Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson,” Stern continued. “Certainly those are notable cases, but what I think far too few people know is that the Mann Act was used to lock up huge amounts of women and police their lives.”

The first people arrested by officers of the Investigation Bureau — the Justice Department agency that would later become the FBI — for violating the Mann Act were a madam and five sex workers traveling together from Michigan to Chicago, Stern noted.

So while the Mann Act and the American Plan were ostensibly aimed at saving vulnerable women, in practice the initiatives allowed the Justice Department to control them, their sexuality, and the men they associated with ― many of whom were black or Chinese.

A Pattern Repeated, Again and Again

Measures like the Mann Act and the American Plan set the stage for legislation like FOSTA.

The law aimed to curb human trafficking by holding websites and social platforms accountable for hosting content related to the sex trade. But much like the Mann Act and the American Plan, it polices members of already marginalized communities.

The new regulations pushed sites like Craigslist and Backpage to scrub their platforms of not only sex-trafficking-related content but sex-related content in general. That meant that not just sex traffickers but also voluntary sex workers and people who engage in online sexual activities were forced further underground.

Melissa, a Phoenix-based escort, told HuffPost that FOSTA forced her back onto the streets. Lexi, a Florida-based escort, said she couldn’t screen her clients anymore without access to the sites.

Sex workers are often already members of marginalized communities, lacking easy access to banking and health care and safety from sexual or physical violence.

“It’s an important parallel,” Levy said.

The Mann Act and FOSTA used similar tactics to pass with overwhelming majorities. The Mann Act was passed unanimously, Stern said. The House and Senate versions of FOSTA passed almost unanimously.

The Mann Act was written in response to accounts of enslavement of white women. Similarly, FOSTA used hysterical anti-trafficking rhetoric — often provided by evangelical Christian organizations that oppose all sex work — to garner support from the public.

“The public is so easily manipulated when you say ‘trafficking,’” Levy said. “It’s a very emotionally provocative issue. You can sort of leverage that term.” In both cases, the public was galvanized by terrifying (and misleading) anecdotes of sex-trafficked children or white women, only for the legislation to be used against marginalized people after it was signed into law.

Trump’s decision to pardon Johnson shows progress. But Johnson’s story also offers an important lesson, Levy argued.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) at a news conference in March.

Democrats are planning to make Washington corruption a central focus of their midterm messaging, reviving a successful theme from when they took control of Congress in 2006.

The anti-corruption push is the second part of Democrats’ “A Better Deal” platform. The first part, released last summer, focused on an economic agenda. The newest part is “A Better Deal for Our Democracy,” which puts forward proposals to increase access to the ballot box, fight special interests and combat big money through campaign finance reform.

The new initiative will center on both President Donald Trump’s administration and the culture in Congress that gives access to lobbyists and corporations. Trump’s Cabinet officials, including Environmental Protection Agency leader Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, have drawn a torrent of negative headlines over allegations of unethical behavior, travel practices and ties to special interests. The president’s hotel in downtown D.C., in particular, has been the subject of several lawsuits.

Congress has to rein in the excesses of the executive branch, Democrats argue, and the current crop of Republican leaders aren’t going to do it.

Democrats unveiled their agenda Monday during a press conference on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were joined by other lawmakers who have been working on these issues, including Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

“President Trump has become the swamp and Americans are paying the price. The American people deserve better,” Pelosi said at the press conference, citing the Trump administration’s failure to reduce the price of prescription drugs and its repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations concerning air and water.

Schumer similarly lamented that Trump had failed to take on the powerful pharmaceutical industry, which is something he promised to do while on the campaign trail.

The Senate minority leader also pointed to the president’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as an example of how influence peddling and special interests had consumed the Trump administration. Following the 2016 election, Cohen leveraged his relationship with Trump to receive millions of dollars from companies eager for insight into his administration.

“The swamp has never been more foul than under this president,” Schumer said.

Democrats said they would bring accountability and transparency back to Washington by providing aggressive oversight of the Trump administration and by toughening the nation’s campaign finance laws in order to stem the flow of anonymous political spending known as dark money.

This focus on corruption is a revival of the party’s successful messaging from the 2006 elections, when Democrats took control of the House and Senate from Republicans. They hammered away at the GOP’s “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”

In that election cycle, the GOP was besieged by scandals amongst House members. The most famous was the Mark Foley scandal, which involved Republican congressman from Florida sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys.

When that news broke in September 2006, Republicans knew they were doomed. But other scandals had been dripping out bit by bit in the prior months.

“Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings,” said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak candidly. “You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended.”

Pelosi has been testing out the anti-corruption message since at least April; for example, she went after Pruitt for being “a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”

But it remains to be seen how much of this push will actually trickle down to the districts. While Democratic candidates have been talking about the tax law and its benefits for big corporations and lobbyists, they so far have not been focusing on Trump and the problems in his administration. It’s rare to hear candidates talk about Trump in swing districts, with much more of the focus there resting on policy issues such as health care and gun control.Striking McDonald's worker Abran Escarzaga, 31, protests outside McDonald's in Los Angeles, California, in December 2013.

The labor union that has orchestrated and funded the Fight for $15 movement has moved money away from its city-based fast-food committees, though officials insist they are maintaining similar funding levels for the high-profile worker campaign.

The Service Employees International Union poured around $10.8 million into fast-food efforts in 2017, down from around $19 million the previous year, according to an analysis of Labor Department filings by The Center for Union Facts, a conservative group critical of unions and the fast-food campaign.

The biggest of those cuts appear to have hit local organizing committees, which have done the on-the-ground outreach to workers and coordinated the fast-food strikes that began in 2012. Luka Ladan, a spokesman for the Center for Union Facts, called it a sign that “union officials have realized it’s a fight they cannot win.”

But SEIU says those cuts were offset by new investments elsewhere in the campaign not reflected in government filings. The union has wound down its city committees and created a national fast-food local union that it says it poured $1.5 million into last year. It also moved organizers who were employed through the committees onto union staff, and increased its spending on fast-food campaigns in Europe and Brazil.

“The idea that we’re cutting funding for the Fight for $15 isn’t true ― we’ve just shifted gears,” a union spokesperson said. “We’ve brought a lot of stuff in-house, and that doesn’t show up in the [disclosure forms]. We’re not taking our foot off the gas on McDonald’s.”

SEIU implemented steep budget cuts in the wake of President Donald Trump’s 2016 election win, which signaled an inhospitable regulatory atmosphere for unions. Close watchers of the Fight for $15 suspected the high-profile campaign could be subjected to belt-tightening as labor law became less friendly to organized labor than it was under former President Barack Obama.

“For all its successes, the movement has not translated into more dues-paying union members for SEIU.”

By organizing walkouts and protests by fast-food workers, the Fight for $15 raised worker pay by spurring minimum-wage hikes in cities and states around the country, and made a $15 wage floor a plank of the Democratic Party. In some regards, it has been the most successful labor organizing campaign in years, bringing unprecedented public attention to the plight of low-wage workers.

But for all its successes, the movement in fast food has not translated into more union members for SEIU, raising the question of how long the union could continue to robustly fund it.

“While the SEIU’s Fight for $15 has scored some legislative victories, it has failed to secure new dues-paying members in quick-service restaurants,” Ladan said.

Rather than file for small union elections at individual restaurants, most of which are run by franchisees, SEIU had hoped regulatory changes would compel big companies like McDonald’s to come to the bargaining table with workers. But Trump’s influence on labor policy has made that increasingly unlikely, with his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) making it more difficult for workers to unionize.

The organizing of fast-food workers created a public relations nightmare for McDonald’s and other big chains, which were pilloried for their low pay. Many workers claimed they were illegally fired or punished for taking part in strikes aimed at improving their working conditions.

The general counsel for the NLRB eventually put McDonald’s on trial, accusing it of being a “joint employer” alongside its franchisees. A finding against McDonald’s could potentially put it on the hook for labor law violations inside its franchised stores.

But McDonald’s has much less to worry about under the Trump administration. New leadership at the NLRB has already reversed the Obama-era definition of joint employer, bringing applause from business groups. As Bloomberg reported, the board is apparently moving quickly to settle the McDonald’s case to avoid a union-friendly precedent.Former President Jimmy Carter took a shot at President Donald Trump on Friday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.”

When host Stephen Colbert asked Carter if America does “want a jerk as president,” Carter replied: “Apparently, from this recent election, yes. I never knew it before.”

Colbert then asked Carter, 93, to name one of the most important qualities that is needed in the role of POTUS.

“I used to think it was to tell the truth,” Carter responded. “But I’ve changed my mind lately,” he added, in another apparent dig at Trump.

Carter, who was ostensibly on the show to promote his new book Faith: A Journey For All, later admitted to praying for Trump.

“I pray that he’ll be a good president and that he’ll keep our country at peace and that he’ll refrain from using nuclear weapons and that he will promote human rights. So yeah, I pray for him,” he added.

AdvertisementAn international health organization has suspended its partnership with the Heineken beer company because of the controversial use of so-called “beer girls” to promote its products.

The Global Fund launched a partnership in January with the Dutch brewer in its latest campaign to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. Heineken was to use its communications and logistics expertise to help shape effective messages, identify demand and provide quality control in shipments of medical supplies, according to a Heineken statement.

But the Global Fund announced on Thursday in a statement that it was suspending its partnership with Heineken “based on recent reports of the company’s use of female beer promoters in ways that expose them to sexual exploitation and health risks,” National Public Radio reported.

“We take these allegations very seriously and have challenged Heineken to examine their operations and make changes to protect women from sexual exploitation and health risks,” said Global Fund executive director Peter Sands. “We are suspending the partnership until such time as Heineken can take appropriate action to address these issues.”

The mostly young drink promoters are paid low wages — and work for tips, largely from groups of intoxicated men — to push certain beers in bars. Heineken has come under particular pressure to end the practice in Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia. A 2011 study found that some Heineken beer girls in Cambodian bars moonlighted as sex workers for extra money and faced increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

Reporter Olivier van Beemen revealed a similar situation in West African bars in an article in the Dutch publication NRC last week. That was apparently what Sands was referencing when he said “recent reports.”

Heineken could not immediately be reached for comment. The company, however, responded to van Beemen’s article, saying it took drink promoters’ risk of sexual exploitation very seriously.

“The practices described go completely against what we stand for as a company, and therefore we strongly condemn these malpractices,” said the Heineken statement. “The beer promoters are not employed by Heineken, but are sourced via external agencies ... this makes it difficult to properly supervise the working conditions. However, we simply cannot allow them to continue to be confronted with unwanted intimacies and abuse or even with prostitution during their work.”

The company’s statement concluded: “We will take further steps together with our local operating companies, promotional agencies and other relevant parties to deal with these malpractices and prevent them in the future.”

Critics had earlier condemned Global Fund’s partnership with Heineken, saying an organization concerned with health should not work with a company pushing alcohol, which can be detrimental to health.

It’s been a bad month for Heineken. Earlier this week, the company yanked a beer commercial that Chance the Rapper criticized as “terribly racist.” The Heineken Light ad showed a bartender sliding a bottle along a bar, past several black people, to a fair-skinned woman as the tagline, “Sometimes, lighter is better,” flashed on the screen.

“We missed the mark, are taking the feedback to heart and will use this to influence future campaigns,” a Heineken spokesperson told Newsweek.
