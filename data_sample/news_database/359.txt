Missy Elliott remembered close friend and collaborator Aaliyah with a moving Instagram post on Tuesday.

In honor of what would have been the late singer’s 39th birthday, the “Work It” artist posted four photos of herself with Aaliyah and a loving birthday message.

“Aaliyah so many people LOVE your Style & Music TIL this day!,” Elliott wrote on Instagram. “I wish they all got a chance to meet you to see how CARING you were to EVERYONE you met!” Her message continued with emoji-filled emotions.

Aaliyah tragically died in a plane crash near the Bahamas at the age of 22 in August 2001. The singer had been filming her “Rock the Boat” video on the islands before the accident.

Rapper and music producer Timbaland also remembered the star in a tweet.

Elliott and Timbaland produced Aaliyah’s second studio album, “One in a Million” in 1996. Many fans joined the two hip-hop legends in remembering the late singer on Twitter.

Missy, Aaliyah truly truly changed and impacted my life in ways that I did not even know was possible. Since I was four years old, she resonated with me not only on a musical level - but you could tell that she was such a magnetic and transcendent young woman.

The number of disappearances grew to three and then six in little more than a decade. Each of the missing girls was younger than 18, and each was gone without a trace.

Authorities have no physical evidence linking the girls, and only one of the cases has been ruled a homicide. However, authorities are now considering the possibility that a man incarcerated for the killing of a 13-year-old girl north of Detroit could be responsible for each of the unsolved disappearances.

“The suspect in this case did brag about murdering four to six people,” Warren Police Commissioner Bill Dwyer said Wednesday.

According to Dwyer, police recently learned that Arthur Ream, an inmate at a Muskegon Heights prison, had told multiple jailhouse informants that he’s a serial killer.

Ream, 69, is serving a life sentence for the 1986 rape and killing of 13-year-old Cindy Zarzycki. He’d has a prior criminal record, which includes an arrest and conviction in the rape of a 15-year-old hitchhiker in 1975, police said.

At the time of Zarzyki’s death, she was dating Ream’s son. Ream ultimately led detectives to the teen’s body, which he’d confessed to burying in a shallow grave in Macomb Township. Ream denied killing the girl and told police she fell down an elevator shaft. Still, court documents obtained by CBS News state Ream once “admitted to having a fetish for 13- and 14-year-old girls.”

Police are now hoping the same swampy plot of land where Zarzki’s body was found ― a property about 30 miles northeast of Detroit ― contains answers in several cold-case disappearances.

There is “probable cause to believe this is a grave site, no question about it, that Kimberly King and other young female victims were murdered and are buried here,” Dwyer said.

State and federal investigators began searching the 24-acre property on Monday. The cases authorities are hoping to find answers in include:

Cynthia Coon, 13, last seen in Washtenaw County in 1970. Nadine O’Dell, 16, reported missing from Inkster in 1974. Kimberly King, 12, vanished in Warren in 1979. Kim Larrow, 15, missing from Canton since 1981. Kellie Brownlee, 17, last seen at a Novi mall in 1982.

Kimberly King’s sister, Konnie Beyma, told ABC News she is hopeful her sister is found.

“Police are very confident that they will find something … so I am trying to hold on to that hope,” she said.

On Thursday, Dwyer told the Detroit Free Press that searchers have found an item of interest, but he declined to elaborate. “What we have found makes us very cautiously optimistic that we’re on the right track,” he said.

The search is expected to continue Friday.

Dwyer said authorities could “find something in the next hour or in the next few days.”

“It’s not easy,” he told the Detroit Free Press. ”[We’re] looking for remains that have been in the ground for decades ... it’s very, very difficult.”Ben Nelms via Getty Images

It’s been quite a year for Canadian pairs figure skater Eric Radford. In June, he proposed to his boyfriend Luis Fenero (he said yes). And this weekend, he qualified along with skating partner Meagan Duhamel for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Radford, 35, will be skating in his second consecutive Olympics and his first as an openly gay man. Radford and Duhamel cemented their Olympic invitations with a win Saturday at the Canadian national championships.

Radford is the second openly gay male Winter Olympian to qualify, joining American skater Adam Rippon, 28. They will likely be joined by American freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy when that team is selected next week. Kenworthy, 26, took a big step towards Pyeongchang on Sunday when he won the ski slopestyle in an Olympic selection event at the U.S. Grand Prix.

Radford came out in 2014 and a year later was Outsports Male Athlete of the Year after winning the 2015 world title with Duhamel.

In his coming out interview with Outsports, he highlighted one benefit of being a male pairs skater who is gay.

“A lot of pairs end up dating one another,” Radford said. “It can become risky because your on-ice training can be affected by your off-ice relationship. If you have a fight at home, it makes that training difficult. I used to joke around that I’m the ultimate pair-boy. I never had to worry about developing an off-ice relationship.”

The Winter Olympics start Feb. 9.The White House and its surrogates appear to be coalescing around a particularly hot take regarding President Donald Trump’s reported “shithole” remarks: Trump actually used the phrase “shithouse countries” to describe African nations, Haiti and El Salvador.

Like other excuses for Trump’s latest racist immigration remarks, this one is very, uh, shitty.

The line of argument began over the weekend, after GOP Sens. David Perdue (Ga.) and Tom Cotton (Ark.) denied Trump had called the places “shithole countries” during an Oval Office meeting on immigration reform. Instead, according to a tweet from the Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey, the senators maybe heard Trump say “shithouse.”

White House official told me tonight there is debate internally on whether Trump said "shithole" or "shithouse." Perdue and Cotton seem to have heard latter, this person said, and are using to deny. — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) January 15, 2018

Such parsing is a clear departure from Trump’s approach ― which has been to reject the reports outright and claim once again he is “the least racist person” ― so it wasn’t immediately clear why the specific fecal phrase mattered.

On Tuesday, however, the “hole” versus “house” debate took another twist, as some Republicans reportedly began claiming the two phrases could be interpreted differently ― with “house” being less bad.

Why are some Trump allies arguing that POTUS said "shithouse" rather than "shithole"? Some Rs say "shithouse countries" refers to poor countries w/no plumbing -- places where u have to walk out to the shithouse -- and therefore the phrase is NOT racist. — Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) January 16, 2018

For what its worth, here's new spin from source very close to WH: When Trump said "shit house" countries (not "shit hole") at immigration meeting, he was actually thinking about real estate. — Michael Isikoff (@Isikoff) January 16, 2018

But this scandal was never about Trump using profanity. It was about a president with a lengthy history of racist comments making clear that racial stereotypes about majority black and brown nations are actively guiding his approach to immigration policy. Trump’s obvious antipathy toward those countries continues to serve as an ideological underpinning for an agenda that would allow fewer of their residents into the U.S., while instead favoring people from whiter countries. (Trump reportedly suggested during the meeting that the U.S. should bring in more people from places like Norway.)

It was this troubling sentiment that drew widespread condemnation from figures across the political spectrum, who saw Trump’s comments as contrary to American ideals that supposedly value diversity and espouse compassion for the less fortunate.Actors Timothée Chalamet (left), Rebecca Hall (center) and Griffin Newman (right) have all expressed regret over working with Woody Allen on his new film "A Rainy Day in New York." All three actors have said they will be donating their salaries from the film to charity. Reuters/Getty

Actors Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, who star in the upcoming Woody Allen film “A Rainy Day in New York,” announced in Instagram posts within days of each other that they’ll donate their salaries from the film to support efforts against sexual assault. Both also expressed regret for choosing to work with the embattled director, who has been accused by his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow of child sexual abuse.

The announcements follow actor Griffin Newman’s decision to donate his salary from the film to charity. Newman, who has a small role in the movie, said in October that he believed Allen was “guilty” and that he’d donate his salary to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network.

Hall said on Instagram last week that she’d thought “very deeply” about her decision to work with Allen, who also directed her in his 2008 film “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” ― a role for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe. Hall said “reading and re-reading” Farrow’s accounts of what happened ultimately convinced her of what she needed to do.

“I see [now] not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed,” Hall wrote. “That is not something that sits easily with me in the current or indeed any moment, and I am profoundly sorry. I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today.”

Hall added that she would donate wages from “Rainy Day” to Time’s Up, a legal defense fund set up to support victims of workplace sexual harassment. She called the move a “small gesture and not one intended as close to compensation.”

“Rainy Day” castmate Timothée Chalamet on Monday announced his decision to donate his salary to Time’s Up, RAINN and the LGBT Center in New York.

Chalamet, who was recently nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in the film “Call Me by Your Name,” said in an Instagram post that “because of contractual obligations,” he’d been unable to comment on the allegations against Allen. The actor said he decided to donate his entire salary from “Rainy Day” to the three charities because “I don’t want to profit from my work on the film.”

“I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve,” Chalamet wrote.

“Rainy Day,” slated for release in 2018, also stars Selena Gomez, Elle Fanning, Jude Law, Diego Luna and Liev Schreiber.President Donald Trump’s comments last week that the United States should try to attract immigrants from places like Norway instead of “shithole countries” like Haiti or El Salvador weren’t just racist. They also expose his immigration policies to challenge in federal court, and may even allow some of the people he’s trying to deport to stay in the U.S.

Here’s why: Trump made the “shithole countries” remark while defending his decision to cancel Temporary Protected Status ― a designation that offers deportation relief and work authorization to people from countries afflicted by natural disasters or war ― for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.

Stripping people of TPS is well within the president’s authority. But if Trump did so with the intention to discriminate against them because of their national origin or race (most Haitians are black, while most Norwegians are white), his administration may once again find itself in federal court defending the constitutionality of its actions.

Immigration lawyers who defend people facing deportation will be sure to cite Trump’s comments, too.

“I can guarantee I’ll be making an argument that this administration is discriminating based on national origin and race when I have a client who happens to be from Haiti, El Salvador, or Africa,” said Luis Mancheno, an attorney for Bronx Defenders, a nonprofit legal services group. “Or, honestly, anyone who’s not from Norway.”

No group has yet announced a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to cancel TPS for countries he reportedly derided as “shitholes.” But lawyers told HuffPost the comments could be used as evidence to support a claim that Trump canceled the program with discriminatory intent.

“This administration gives us an almost continual flow of circumstantial evidence that would support a conclusion of racial discrimination and bias,” Thomas Saenz, executive director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told HuffPost. “This latest fiasco certainly provides an important piece of evidence. It’s a pretty strong indication that [Trump] has racially discriminatory views that then influence his policy concerns, including cancelling TPS.”

The Trump administration already faces several lawsuits accusing the president of discrimination. The courts temporarily blocked his restrictions on travel from several Muslim-majority countries last year, partly over the allegation that he changed U.S. policy with the goal of targeting Muslims. And a lawsuit filed in New York by a coalition of 15 states, along with the District of Columbia, accuses Trump of ordering the cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as part of an “animus-driven” effort to discriminate against Mexicans. (DACA, an Obama-era initiative, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors to avoid deportation and to work legally. More than three-quarters of DACA recipients were born in Mexico.)

Those lawsuits are peppered with Trump tweets and and passages from campaign speeches. He announced his candidacy by referring to Mexican immigrants broadly as “rapists” who are “bringing crime,” the New York lawsuit notes. One of his tweets referred to protesters carrying the Mexican flag as “criminals” and “thugs.”

“For those of us in the immigrant rights world who seek to defend the interests and rights of immigrants, we always welcome the president saying exactly what he feels,” Justin Cox, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing to overturn the DACA cancellation, told HuffPost. “Even though that can be exceedingly painful for everyone to see.”

Challenging officials on equal protection grounds is often difficult. Those making such claims in court have to prove discrimination was intentional in an era when public officials rarely make overtly racist comments. Instead, those legal challenges often have to show that a new law or policy disproportionately impacts a certain group, or that authorities violated normal procedures to push through a change ― a standard laid out in a 1970s Supreme Court housing discrimination case Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.

But every time Trump fires off a statement that punctures the barriers of political correctness ― like the “shithole countries” comment, or when he reportedly said the United States shouldn’t take more immigrants from Haiti because they “all have AIDS” ― he makes it that much easier to prove in court that his administration is changing immigration policy for reasons that have more to do with personal prejudice than national security.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued an order detailing claims the Trump administration will face in the challenge to kill DACA. He allowed the claim alleging discriminatory intent to move forward.

In that ruling, Alsup cited a case in which Arizona banned the Tucson school district from teaching Mexican-American studies classes. The lawyers who challenged the ethnic studies law based their claim that officials discriminated against Hispanic students in large part on the Arlington Heights case.

But one of the officials who carried out the Mexican-American studies restrictions was John Huppenthal, the former head of the state public education system, who was outed as an internet troll in 2014. Huppenthal’s mean-spirited comments about Hispanics played a major role in overturning the ethnic studies law.

“Huppenthal’s blog comments provide the strongest evidence that racial animus motivated the enforcement of” the state law against the Mexican-American studies program, Judge A. Wallace Tashima wrote in the opinion finding the restrictions unconstitutional.Penelope Cruz doesn’t mind getting into a little bit of trouble for a fun cause.

The actress stopped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Tuesday to discuss her role as Donatella Versace in FX’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.” But Cruz and the talk-show host took a brief break from the chat about the movie for a Spanish lesson.

Cruz started with a relatively simple phrase that she asked DeGeneres to repeat. Then the Spanish-born star upped the ante with a Spanish phrase she knew would be bleeped out on television.

“I’m not suppose to teach you this but ― me cago en la leche,” Cruz said. When DeGeneres asked what it meant before repeating, the actress hesitated.

“Now I’m in trouble if I have to explain what it means,” Cruz said with a laugh. “It’s better if you just learn it and trust me.” Sure enough, the words, “We can’t show the translation on TV” appeared on-screen as Cruz spoke.

For those curious what “me cago en la leche” means, HuffPost has you covered. The sentence directly translates to “I shit in the milk,” but it’s a phrase often used to express frustration or anger in a way that means “fuck.”Folks online think President Donald Trump sucks at the nickname game.

Trump bestowed his latest insulting moniker on Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) while refuting claims he called Haiti and some African nations “shithole countries” during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers last week:

Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can’t get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2018

Yes, Trump used Twitter to call Dick Durbin, “Dicky.”

Many people online rebuked Trump for his immature name-calling while others poked fun at the president for his “uninspired” comeback (which took him four days to make).

The allegations come just days after actress Eliza Dushku accused Kramer, the longtime personal stunt double of Arnold Schwarzenegger, of sexually molesting her in a Miami hotel room during the filming of 1994’s “True Lies” when she was 12 years old. Kramer at the time was 36.

Laura Albert, a stuntwoman who worked under Kramer on the film “Virus,” told Deadline that her then 15-year-old sister, and her sister’s 16-year-old friend, had a sexual encounter with Kramer in 1997. Albert invited the teenagers, who were both in 10th grade at the time, to join the stunt cast for go-karting in Wilmington, North Carolina, after a day of shooting.

“Unbeknownst to me, my boss, Joel Kramer, had lured the girls to go swimming at the pool in his hotel,” Albert said.

While the three were in the pool together, Albert said, Kramer “pulled his dick out and said, ’You cannot handle this,′ and then began to swim towards them.” Albert’s sister promptly left, Albert said, but her friend remained. “Joel had sex with the 16-year-old girl,” Albert told Deadline. “She was 16. He was 39.”

Albert said that after learning about the incident, she called the Wilmington police and they informed her that the age of consent in North Carolina is 16.

In response to the allegations, Kramer told Deadline that he did have a sexual encounter with the 16-year-old, but he disputed some of the details.

According to Kramer, he was doing laps in the hotel pool when the two teenagers showed up.

“Did I expose myself? NEVER!!!” Kramer told HuffPost by email on Tuesday. “That is an absolute made up lie on Laura’s part to just further humiliate me! In Gods nam [sic] I don’t know why she would manipulate her story just to further make me out to be something I am not!! And then she adds in her own dialog and puts it as if I said that? Absolutely disgusting on her part, I’ll stand on a court and expose her for those lies.”

Kramer told Deadline that the 16-year-old came to his room of her own accord later that evening, and that the two “fooled around” but did not have intercourse. He said he did not know her age and that once he found out, he was “devastated.”

Albert told Deadline she confronted Kramer about the alleged encounter, and that at the time, he admitted to having sex with the teenager.

“Laura’s sophistry [is] sickening [and] deceitful,” Kramer told HuffPost.

Another professional stuntwoman, whose name has not been reported, told Deadline that Kramer sexually assaulted her in Los Angeles County in the late ’70s or early ’80s. Though she did not work for Kramer, the incident allegedly occurred when a group of stunt workers got together for drinks. At one point, the group decided to change locations, and the woman carpooled with Kramer. On their way to the next spot, the woman says, Kramer pulled over in “a quiet residential area,” exposed himself and then forced her to perform oral sex on him in his car.

Kramer told HuffPost that the anonymous woman’s allegation is a fabrication.

“Just another vicious lie on my person, never happened,” he said.

The anonymous woman told Deadline she had only been in the business a few years at the time of the alleged assault.

“I did not tell anyone, because I was frightened, scared and ashamed,” she told the outlet. “I also knew that if I were to report this to the stunt group, the police or [the Screen Actors Guild], I would have no chance in a career as a stunt woman.”

She mentioned to Deadline that she was inspired to come forward after hearing about Dushku’s alleged experience.

Dushku, known for her work on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Dollhouse,” wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday that Kramer sexually molested her when she was 12 during the filming of “True Lies.”

The now 37-year-old actress said that Kramer “made me feel special” and “methodically built my and my parents’ trust” before luring her to his hotel with a promise of swimming and her first sushi meal.

Dushku also accused Kramer of intentionally injuring her during a “stunt-gone-wrong” not long after an adult whom she’d told about the alleged incident apparently confronted Kramer.Tiffany Trump, pictured in December, helped platonic friends get married in Vegas on Sunday in a small ceremony.

In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act, which, written at the height of the culture wars, included a provision addressing "Obscenity and Violence." Among other things, the bill required all new television sets to include the "V-chip," technology that allows parents to control what their children watch on TV.

Critics of the legislation claimed it was unconstitutional on the grounds that aspects of the amendment violated basic First Amendment rights. I'm a writer and director, and the freedom to tell stories that capture life in all of its glories, and even its ugliness, is vital to what I do. But it seems reasonable to give parents tools to moderate what their children are exposed to—and the Supreme Court ultimately agreed. While the anti-decency provisions were struck down, the V-chip survived.

Rolled out in 2010, YouTube's "Restricted Mode" similarly filters out content on the popular video-sharing platform that may be inappropriate for minors. It was perhaps an inevitable development given the increasing ubiquity of internet video. The sheer volume of content, however, led to a keyword-based filtering system, and in March of last year, changes to the algorithm resulted in thousands of LGBTQ creators discovering that our videos had been restricted.

At the time, a YouTube representative informed me via email that the company was taking the issue seriously, referring me to an official statement on the matter. YouTube's website proudly states, "Sharing stories about facing discrimination, opening up about your sexuality, and confronting and overcoming discrimination is what makes YouTube great, and we will work to ensure those stories are included in Restricted Mode." Specifically, "Some educational, straightforward content about sexual education, affection, or identity may be included in Restricted Mode, as well as kissing or affection that's not overly sexualized or the focal point of the video."

Nearly a year later, LGBTQ creators continue to be affected and videos that meet the description above are still restricted. Despite multiple requests for review, most of my content is not visible in Restricted Mode, including my contribution to It Gets Better, a campaign specifically designed to prevent suicide among at-risk youth.

Sadly, the ongoing issue with Restricted Mode was only the beginning of what has turned out to be a devastating twelve months for YouTubers, specifically LGBTQ creators. Last summer, advertising revenue on my channel suddenly plummeted due to the implementation of a widely criticized new filter, resulting in what's been coined the "adpocalypse." Videos that include anything that might be deemed objectionable are flagged by YouTube as "not suitable for most advertisers" and thus demonetized, preventing many creators from making money from their work.

The criteria for what YouTube deems not suitable is alarmingly expansive, including "controversial issues and sensitive events," a sweeping classification that encompasses politics, war, and "recent tragedies, even if presented for news or documentary purposes." It also, apparently, includes anything even tangentially LGBTQ-related.

In short, unless you create makeup tutorials or supercuts of cats napping, you're no longer permitted to earn revenue on YouTube. And if you're a queer creator who happens to make those kinds of videos, you may not make any money either. (No offense, sleepy kittens!)

Advertisers absolutely have the right to decide where, when, and to whom their content is shown. But YouTube's draconian new policies are too broad, allowing LGBTQ videos of even the most benign nature to get swept up in the process.

Several of my videos have been deemed not suitable for advertisers, including my short film Great Escape, about a restless retiree who leaves her husband for another woman, and the trailers for my films Pink Moon and Requited. Meanwhile, the violent, expletive-filled trailer for I, Tonya is loaded with ads, and if the double standard weren't already blatantly obvious, it also includes a homophobic epithet.

Last November, my film Sam, about a bullied trans boy who embarks on a journey of self-discovery, suddenly no longer appeared on my channel or in search results, and it's been demonetized. YouTube claims this is the result of new efforts to prevent "predatory behavior" on the site by demonetizing or removing videos that "target children."

Sam has screened at film festivals around the world, has been shown to kids in classrooms, and has been viewed over six million times on YouTube. But now it's being hidden from you.

This is unacceptable.

I say all of this not just because LGBTQ content deserves to be seen, or because people have the right to access it freely, but because queer creators have a right to earn a living. I'm not a traditional "YouTuber"—that is, I don't create videos specifically for YouTube—but being able to share and monetize my films on the site has helped me pay the bills, making it possible for me to continue making movies.

More importantly, ad-based revenue allows creators like me to keep content free and accessible to everyone. LGBTQ stories aren't just important, they're essential. These are our lives—our loves, our struggles, our triumphs—and there is nothing "sensitive" or offensive about them. These stories save lives. Every day I hear from people who have been affected by my work. I recently received a call from a friend I hadn't spoken to in years; she'd just met a bartender who said Sam changed his life. People desperately need—and deserve—to see themselves in art and media.

YouTube's inaction sends a message to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning young people that their stories, their work, their careers—their lives—do not matter. During a conference call with two YouTube representatives last month, I was assured that steps were being taken to fix what they admitted where flaws in the system. One of the representatives also wanted me to know that these issues are important to him because he's gay. But it's mere lip service unless things change.

The V-chip works by blocking inappropriate TV programming based on a voluntary rating system. It was modeled after the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings for theatrical movie releases. YouTube's new policies, on the other hand, have been clumsily and indiscriminately implemented at best, with no input or involvement from creators themselves.

Fix it, YouTube.

Design a rating system that's fair and transparent. Allow advertisers to opt out of "sensitive" content in a more granular way. Temporarily remove filters that directly affect LGBTQ creators until you find a permanent solution. But do it now.

Until then, I'm exploring alternatives to YouTube, including REVRY, which bills itself as "the world's first LGBTQ+ digital streaming platform," and Vimeo On Demand, where I can offer exclusive bonus content and other features for my films Chaser and Pink Moon.“222 Words” is a series that gives you 222-word explanations to the questions that would normally get lost in a day’s news cycle.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site on Thursday, North Korean state media reported, as part of steps that have reduced tension on the Korean Peninsula and raised the possibility of a summit with the United States.

North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri site, which consists of tunnels dug beneath Mount Mantap in the northeast of the country.

A small group of international media selected by North Korea witnessed the demolition, which Pyongyang says is proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing.

The destruction of the site began at about 11 a.m. with the blowing up and collapsing of a tunnel and an observation post.

North Korea’s state-run news agency KCNA reported there was no leak of radioactive materials or any adverse impact on the surrounding ecological environment.

“Dismantling the nuclear test ground was done in such a way as to make all the tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion and completely close the tunnel entrances, and at the same time, explode some guard facilities and observation posts on the site,” KCNA reported.

The South Korean government welcomed the test site destruction by calling it “the first meaningful step to realize complete denuclearization which North Korea expressed through including the inter-Korean summit.”

South Korean media described how North Korean authorities called out to media to ask if they were ready to film the first blast. They then counted down.

“With a heavy boom that shook Mount Mantap, dirt and broken rocks spilled out from the entrance,” South Korean media reported.

After some time, another tunnel and other facilities were destroyed, then a third tunnel and another observation post. About five hours after the operation began, two military barracks were demolished, South Korean media said.

The North Korean offer to scrap the test site has been seen as a major concession in months of easing decades of tension with South Korea and the United States.

North Korea announced in April it would suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap the test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace.

Summit Bump

But the progress appears to have suffered a setback this month with North Korea raising doubts about an unprecedented June 12 summit in Singapore between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The North objects to U.S. demands that it unilaterally give up its arsenal of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.

Last week, Trump sought to placate North Korea after it threatened to call off the summit, saying Kim’s security would be guaranteed in any deal and his country would not suffer the fate of Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya. The reference to the case of Libya has angered North Korea.

China’s official Xinhua news agency praised North Korea’s move in a commentary, saying it “demonstrates Pyongyang’s commitment to denuclearization, consolidating the detente needed for a political settlement of the Peninsula issue,” it said.

In a statement released by North Korean media on Thursday, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” for comparing North Korea - a “nuclear weapons state” - to Libya, where Gaddafi gave up his unfinished nuclear development program, only to be later killed by NATO-backed fighters.

“It is to be underlined, however, that in order not to follow in Libya’s footstep, we paid a heavy price to build up our powerful and reliable strength that can defend ourselves and safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the region,” Choe said.

She said the fate of the summit was entirely up to the United States.

“We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us,” Choe said.

She said she could suggest to Kim that North Korea reconsider the summit if the United States offended the North’s goodwill.

China Wants Summit

China, North Korea’s main ally, said it hoped the summit between Kim and Trump could proceed smoothly, after Trump cast further doubt over whether it would go ahead.

Both countries should cherish the opportunity and all parties should ensure that dialogue leads to a positive outcome, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a regular briefing.

Trump said on Wednesday he would know next week whether the summit would take place as scheduled.

White House aides are preparing to travel to Singapore this weekend for a crucial meeting with North Korean officials to discuss the agenda and logistics for the summit, said U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The apparent destruction of what North Korea says is its only nuclear test site has been widely welcomed as a positive, if largely symbolic, step toward resolving tension over its weapons. North Korean leader Kim has declared his nuclear force complete and amid speculation the site was obsolete anyway.

According to recent academic reports, North Korea’s last test, in September, of what it said was a hydrogen bomb, was so large it triggered a collapse inside the mountain, rendering the site geologically unusable for more tests.

Kim has insisted there were undamaged tunnels at the site, and U.S. intelligence officials have said Punggye-ri remains usable, despite what one official called “some minor geological disturbances” that could be natural or triggered by the September test.

AdvertisementKevin McHale raised more than a few eyebrows last month when he declared in a tweet that Ariana Grande’s new single, “No Tears Left to Cry,” was “gayer than me.”

Media outlets were quick to interpret the tweet as his coming out moment. In a new interview, McHale — who starred in “Glee” and “When We Rise” — said the remark did reflect his identity as a gay man but that his friends, family members and many fans already knew.

“If somebody was a big fan and following everything I was doing [on social media], like the people I interact with on Twitter on a daily basis, I think there was zero surprise,” he told entertainment journalist Marc Malkin in a Facebook Live chat Thursday. “People knew. The organizations I’ve been supporting and all that sort of work has been apparent, at least to me.”

A post shared by Kevin McHale (@kevinmchale) on Jan 23, 2018 at 2:31pm PST

McHale said he kept quiet about his sexuality in the media during his years on “Glee” because he was in a relationship at the time.

“The person I was with came from the most accepting family,” McHale said. “But one of the family members, he was terrified of them finding out. So I was trying to be respectful of that.”

These days, he’s in a relationship with his “When We Rise” co-star Austin McKenzie. The two have been dating for a little over a year and haven’t been shy about sharing cozy photos with each other on their Instagram accounts.

Interestingly, McHale said he now worries that his “No Tears Left to Cry” tweet ― which received over 12,000 likes as of Friday afternoon ― was “disrespectful,” given that its lyrics seem to address the terrorist attack at Grande’s Manchester, England, concert in May 2017.

Still, he added, “better out than not. I’m like, great — that takes care of that.”

He also confirmed reports that he’s back in the recording studio, working on tunes of his own.

“It’s a long process,” he said, “but I do think music will be out soon.”

AdvertisementA woman’s disputed claim of being sexually assaulted by comedian Aziz Ansari has generated criticism from some media outlets.

HLN’s Ashleigh Banfield delivered an angry open letter to the unnamed accuser on Monday, saying that the description of events sounded merely like a bad date that the woman could have ended by leaving. Banfield also said that the “reckless” public allegation made by the woman compromised the #MeToo movement to combat sexual misconduct.

“So I have to ask you: What exactly was your beef?” Banfield said. “That you had a bad date with Aziz Ansari? Is that what victimized you to the point of seeking a public conviction and a career-ending sentence against him? Is that what you truly think he deserved for your night out?”

“What you have done, in my opinion, is appalling,” the anchor continued. “You went to the press with a story of a bad date and you have potentially destroyed this man’s career over it.”

Banfield said the woman’s account “chiseled away” at the #MeToo movement’s efforts to combat sexual misconduct.

Other opposing voices joined in through prominent media outlets. Caitlin Flanagan wrote in The Atlantic that the actor did not deserve to be “destroyed” and that the article was “3,000 words of revenge porn” intended “to hurt and humiliate Ansari.”

The headline for a New York Times Op-Ed piece read: “Aziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being A Mind Reader.” The article, written by a Times opinion section editor, Bari Weiss, said, “There is a useful term for what [the woman] experienced on her night with Mr. Ansari. It’s called ‘bad sex.’ It sucks.”

On Sunday, Ansari told HuffPost in a statement that he believed the sexual activity was “completely consensual.”

In an interview with the website babe, the 23-year-old woman described a first date last year with Ansari in which she said he repeatedly tried to initiate sex while ignoring her verbal and non-verbal cues.

“Most of my discomfort was expressed in me pulling away and mumbling,” she said. “I know I was physically giving off cues that I wasn’t interested. I don’t think that was noticed at all, or if it was, it was ignored.”Pennsylvania’s highest court could be on the verge of setting unprecedented limits on how much politicians can redraw electoral districts to their party's advantage, a decision that would have profound legal and political consequences both in the state and the rest of the country.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will hear oral argument on Wednesday in a case alleging the state’s 2011 congressional map, drawn by Republicans, violates protections on freedom of expression and equal protection in the state constitution.

Since 2012, Republicans have consistently been able to win 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats, despite winning only about 50 percent of the statewide vote. The Brennan Center for Justice describes the state’s congressional map as one of the worst partisan gerrymanders in the country, and an analysis by The Associated Press found that the map was responsible for an additional three GOP seats in Congress.

A ruling striking down the map would be deeply significant. Before the end of January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could order state lawmakers to redraw the congressional map ahead of the 2018 elections, giving Democrats a better chance of picking up GOP seats. The state court will have final say in this case, but the ruling comes as the U.S. Supreme Court considers similar federal cases and could also strike down electoral maps as too partisan and implement standards to determine when partisan redistricting goes too far ― something it has never done.

Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center’s democracy program, said the Pennsylvania case “could be one of the biggest blockbuster cases of 2018 - both politically and legally.”

“A win in Pennsylvania would suggest that advocates maybe have been overlooking state constitutions ― many of which, like Pennsylvania’s, have more expansive and robust rights and protections than the federal constitution,” Li wrote in an email. “A win in Pennsylvania could open the door to more state court litigation.”

While a ruling from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would only affect the congressional map in the state, courts in other places will pay attention to Pennsylvania’s ruling, said Lisa Marshall Manheim, a law professor at the University of Washington.

“State courts often look to the decisions reached by other state courts for guidance when determining how to interpret their own constitutions and laws. If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issues a forceful ruling against partisan gerrymandering, that precedent may help to inspire similar rulings in other states,” Manheim said in an email.

“Other courts may be particularly interested in this case given how difficult it has been for courts to develop standards for judging political-gerrymandering claims,” she continued. “If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court can identify and apply a workable legal framework, that will provide an important precedent for other courts and litigants to consider.”

Democratic voters in each of Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional districts are plaintiffs in the case now before the state’s Supreme Court. They claim that Republicans effectively punished them for their past votes for Democratic candidates by drawing the congressional map in a way that disadvantages Democrats. They argue that the map also violates the state constitution’s guarantee of equal protection because it discriminates against Democratic voters. Lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in an opening brief to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the congressional map is “impervious to the will of voters.”

The Republican defendants, led by state House Speaker Michael Turzai and Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati, argue there’s no evidence the Democrats challenging the map have been punished. They say that the congressional map on its own doesn’t prevent the Democrats from getting access to constituent services or voting or expressing support for the candidate they want. Drawing electoral maps, they say, is always going to be intertwined with politics, and courts have never intervened to set a standard for how much politics can factor into redrawing district lines.

Courts have been extremely hesitant to step in and strike down electoral maps drawn by lawmakers, questioning whether controversies over redistricting are even controversies courts can resolve. At the federal level, a three-judge panel ruled in 2016 that the map for Wisconsin’s state legislative districts benefited Republicans enough to violate the U.S. Constitution. In North Carolina, a panel of federal judges issued a similar ruling last week, striking down the state’s congressional map. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in the Wisconsin case in October and it is currently considering whether it will take up the North Carolina case. This term, the Supreme Court will also hear a First Amendment challenge to Maryland’s congressional map, which benefits Democrats.

"While U.S. Supreme Court caselaw has been widely inconsistent in how to approach these claims, state constitutions offer more affirmative and explicit protections for the right to vote than the U.S. Constitution and can serve as a basis for attacking an unfair plan," Franita Tolson, a law professor at the University of Southern California, said in an email. She added that if the U.S. Supreme Court were to stay out of the fray over redistricting, state litigation would become an "even more important vehicle to fight gerrymandering."If the Pennsylvania court were to also stay out of the fray, Tolson said, it would make it even more difficult to fight partisan gerrymandering across the country.

When the plaintiffs in Pennsylvania originally filed their lawsuit, the state’s lower Commonwealth Court put the case on hold, pending the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Wisconsin case. The plaintiffs appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which agreed to hear it on an emergency expedited basis ― a signal that the court, where Democrats have a majority, could be eager to weigh in.

At the request of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Commonwealth Court Judge P. Kevin Brobson presided over the case in December. In his recommendation to the higher court, Brobson agreed that Republicans took partisanship into account during redistricting and said it was possible to use only neutral criteria to draw a map less favorable to the GOP.

However, Brobson also said that those challenging the map failed to give the court a standard by which it could judge partisan gerrymandering.Gary Lee, who served as an assistant staff secretary under former President Barack Obama, has shared how President Donald Trump’s reported comments to a Korean-American intelligence analyst embodied the antithesis of his experience with his one-time boss.

Posting publicly on Twitter Saturday for the first time, Lee gave a moving account of his last day working for the Obama administration, contrasting it with Trump’s conversation with the analyst. During the recent exchange, Trump allegedly inquired why the “pretty Korean lady” isn’t negotiating with North Korea for the U.S. He asked the woman, “Where are you from?” and was described as “unsatisfied” when she said that, like him, she’s from New York.

Lee characterized the “where are you from” question, which is often directed at Asian-Americans and spotlights their perceived “otherness,” as “upsetting.” But the son of immigrants also said the incident “struck a chord” with him. He followed with a series of tweets about how Obama, on Lee’s last day at his White House job in 2011, had greeted him in Korean. The story has since gone viral with thousands of retweets.

2. President Trump made a lot of upsetting remarks this week including this one. “Where are you from?” is a question that many Asian Americans dread. https://t.co/D7ue8db1Vb pic.twitter.com/rwgrx7OQrb — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

3. This struck a chord with me not only bc I’m Korean-American, but also bc I worked at the White House, for President Obama. I left the WH in 2011 for a Fulbright scholarship in Korea. President Obama knew I was leaving to learn more about the culture and language of my parents. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

Lee, who said he’d long dreamed of a career in public service, provided some background on the path that led him to work for the Obama administration. He said that before he graduated from college in 2007, he sent his resume and cover letter to the Obama presidential campaign headquarters in Chicago.

5. For as long as I can remember, I wanted to work in public service. It was a lifelong dream to be in government. But I didn't know anyone in politics. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

6. In early 2007, my senior year of college, I mailed my resume and a cover letter in a manila envelope to the Obama for America headquarters in Chicago. Two weeks before graduation, I received a phone call that a correspondence volunteer had found my letter in a mail pile. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

7. She gave my letter to her boss, who then called and asked if I wanted to move to Chicago to work on the campaign. That's how I got hired on the campaign. That's how I ended up at the White House. That's how I got to work for President Barack Obama. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

Lee also recounted that after Obama surprised him in the Oval Office with the Korean greeting, he ran into actor Kal Penn, who at the time served as the White House associate director of public engagement. Lee said he told him about his interaction with Obama, and that Penn got emotional.

8. After my departure photo with POTUS, I left the Oval Office in a daze and ran into @kalpenn in the West Wing lobby. I recounted the interaction with the president and he started tearing up. "Why are you crying?" I asked. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

9. He replied, "think about what you just said. How incredible that is. On your last day of work at the White House, after your years of service, the first African-American president greeted you in your parents' native language." I started crying too. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

Penn’s reaction and his words, in turn, prompted Lee to begin crying. And in his tweets Lee reflected on his immigrant parents’ own story of sacrifice, and how “they could have never imagined that their eldest son would work in the White House.”

He continued: “In what other country is that even possible? In what other country are you allowed to dream, and despite all odds, pursue and achieve your dreams? ... What a beautiful, incredible nation of immigrants we are.”

10. My parents could never have fathomed such an idea. My mom came to the US when she was 18, my father when he was 26. They worked multiple full-time and part-time jobs, opened a small business, and at one point, had only $20 in their checking account. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

11. They made incalculable sacrifices so their sons could have the opportunities they never had. They sacrificed so we could achieve whatever we wanted to. They could have never imagined that their eldest son would work in the White House. — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

12. In what other country is that even possible? In what other country are you allowed to dream, and despite all odds, pursue and achieve your dreams? In what country could a chubby, 90s Hip Hop and R&B-loving Asian kid from NM end up working for @BarackObama? — Gary Lee (@whoisgarylee) January 13, 2018

Lee appeared on CNN Monday to discuss his tweets, explaining that he felt compelled to share his personal experience. In the Obama White House, he said, “we really celebrated diversity” ― a strong contrast from the message he believes Trump is sending through his stance on immigration.

“We all came together because President Obama inspired this generation of people for this common good and we can celebrate our diversities and that made us so much stronger,” Lee said, tearing up.After stirring perhaps the most-talked-about YouTube controversy in recent years, Logan Paul says that he deserves a second chance after being blacklisted from YouTube as a result of a since-removed vlog that featured a suicide victim in Japan’s “suicide forest.”

“Everyone deserves second chances, bro,” he told TMZ.

Paul has made a reputation for himself on YouTube as one of the site’s top users with over 15 million followers on his channel. After receiving nearly immediate backlash for his vlog in Japan, Paul issued an apology that was criticized as shallow, and announced that he would be taking a break from posting videos.

Since sharing the highly controversial video, Paul has been removed from YouTube’s preferred program, which gives large companies the opportunity to present ads via the top five percent of creators on the platform. He’s also been removed from the YouTube show “Foursome,” as well as other originals that had not yet been released. YouTube’s sentiment towards Paul matched much of the general public’s complaints: “Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.”

When asked about his plans to maintain income, Paul lifted his hoodie, a nod to an apparent venture into Logan Paul merchandise, but here’s hoping for much less of Logan Paul in 2018.Actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold said they would have “done something” to protect castmate Eliza Dushku had they known about her alleged sexual assault during the filming of “True Lies.”

Dushku, who played Schwarzenegger’s young daughter in the 1994 action thriller, posted details of the alleged assault on Facebook over the weekend. The actress said Joel Kramer, a top Hollywood stunt coordinator and a longtime personal stunt double for Schwarzenegger, “sexually molested” her in his Miami hotel room during the filming of the movie:

In a tweet, Arnold expressed his support for Dushku, and said director James Cameron and his fellow co-stars would’ve protected the then-child star had they been aware:

Schwarzenegger later responded to Arnold’s tweet, saying: “You bet your ass all of us would have done something.”

Tom, you bet your ass all of us would have done something. I’m shocked and saddened for Eliza but I am also proud of her - beyond being a great talent and an amazing woman, she is so courageous. https://t.co/EJJbkdior2 — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) January 16, 2018

Actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who played Dushku’s mother in the film, published an essay in HuffPost this week about the incident.

“What allegedly happened to Eliza, away from the safety net of all of us and our purview is a terrible, terrible thing to learn about and have to reconcile,” Curtis wrote. “The truth will set us all free.”

Speaking at the Television Critics Association’s winter press tour on Saturday, Cameron said Dushku was “very brave for speaking up.”

“I think all the women are that are speaking up and calling for a reckoning now,” he said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “I think this has been endemic throughout human systems, not just Hollywood.”

Kramer has denied Dushku’s allegations, calling them “entirely untrue.”

On Monday, two other women ― both of them veteran stuntwomen ― also accused Kramer of sexual misconduct. One told Deadline that the stuntman had forced her to perform oral sex on him in his car; another claimed Kramer “lured” her sister’s 16-year-old friend to his hotel room in 1997 and had sex with her.KatarzynaBialasiewicz via Getty Images

When will the video game world have its own reckoning about harassment of all kinds?

In the gaming community, after all, women, LGBTQ people and gamers of color have taken the brunt of harassment online for years. The names and methods may change, but Gamergate is the internet’s forever war, and we’d like to do a better job of covering its casualties.

If you’re a gamer who has been targeted by a harassment mob — whether you’re a casual gamer, an e-sports legend, a streamer, a developer, a member of a niche community online or anything in between — I want to hear from you.Jason Gould - Dangerous Man Gene Reed

Jason Gould's first full-length CD, Dangerous Man, has the big notes and sweeping vocals of a Josh Groban, but if you scratch beneath the surface, you’ll find his storytelling is more Joni Mitchell.

The 12 songs—a combination of original material and standards—gives you a window into Gould’s journey of love, forgiveness and self-acceptance.

Gould is an appealing, adult contemporary artist with a soothing yet soaring sound. His powerful, mid-range voice can also send a note into a thrilling falsetto.

With his long, curly brown locks and charming smile, he is reserved, modest and some say even shy. Gould is seemingly more concerned about others and the environment than he is about anything else. Except, of course, his dog Eli!

If Gould’s talent seems effortless, it comes naturally. He’s the son of Barbra Streisand and Elliott Gould. Although he grew up in the spotlight, he has always been fiercely private. Now he’s ready to open up about what he's learned through his years in therapy and recovery programs.

"I'm not deceived by the material world. Having grown up around all of that stuff, it gives one a different perception,” Gould says. “I know what matters in life.”

In a rare interview, Gould talks about his new album produced by Quincy Jones, letting go and standing in his own truth with his art.

“I am somebody who cares about being as authentic as possible.” - Jason Gould Gene Reed

When people hear your voice and these songs on “Dangerous Man,” what do you hope they take away?

I have no control over what other people think. As far as I’m concerned it’s an offering. It’s going to touch some people and others may not respond to it, and that’s okay. I don’t claim to know what it’s going to do for anybody. I really think this is a record about intimacy. I didn’t even know that until now that it’s done and it’s out. Every song is really about a different aspect of intimacy—intimacy with others, intimacy with ourselves, intimacy with God or a higher power.

The CD is called “Dangerous Man.” Are you a dangerous man?

I don’t think I’m dangerous. I do think it is provocative, and I do like to be provocative. I don’t think I’m dangerous; unless you consider vulnerable or honest dangerous. For some people that is dangerous.

What is the biggest misconception about you?

I have no idea what anyone thinks about me. When you are in the public eye in some way people do make assumptions about you, and often those are not true. I am somebody who cares about being as authentic as possible. That’s part of what my path in life is about.

You've said that you're a strong proponent of self-awareness. What are you aware of about who you are?

I really value honesty and self-responsibility. These are things that have taken time and commitment to get to in myself, and I’m attracted to those qualities in other people. I’m not drawn to people who are caught up in superficiality and ego. I see through that really quickly. I think only from that place of knowing yourself can you really connect with another person at the deepest level, which is what so many of these songs are about.

"Dangerous Man" has a song called “My Song.” In it you sing: "I tried so hard to please, denying my own needs." Are you a people pleaser?

I think that’s something I’ve grown out of. When I was younger I thought that if I molded myself to the way that I thought you wanted me to be then you would like me or love me. Now I’ve learned that’s not the way.

You promoted the CD on Twitter by saying, "Available for dating, I mean download, or either." It was really cute.

Well, I can be cute. I can have a sense of humor.

I guess that goes along with misconceptions. Some people probably think of you as a serious person.

I think you can be spiritual and silly at the same time.

“I can be cute. I can have a sense of humor.” - Jason Gould Gene Reed

"All's Forgiven” is a song that moves with great intensity and contains the lyrics: "I know you did the best you could, forgiving you has done me good." Who or what are you singing those words to?

There could be many people in my life. For me the song is about the power of forgiveness. What I’m interested in is freedom. I’ve learned that only through forgiveness can you achieve freedom. I’ve experienced anger, hurt and disappointment in many relationships. When I was writing that song I was thinking about kids who grow up where they are not accepted by their own family about being gay or transgender or whatever it is. That was an inspiration, but it’s not limited to that.

We are only in the first few weeks of 2018, but if a genie gave you a lamp and said you can make three wishes for this year, what would they be?

I’m very excited about women claiming and reclaiming their power. I think we’re in the midst of a revolution of female energy. I’d love for more women to step into positions of power in terms of politics. I so care about the state of this planet. Obviously this administration is not terribly concerned about that, but I certainly hope there is a shift there. Do you need one more? Nothing is coming to me right now.

Have you always been this humble and gracious?

I mean, I’ve never been an arrogant prick. As I’ve done more and more work on myself, I know who I am, and that’s a quality [humility] that I like in myself and others.

What do you do for fun?

I’m a pretty laid-back guy. I like hanging out with friends, going to the movies and playing games. I have a dog, which brings me tremendous joy. I’m not somebody who is going to be out at the clubs smoking a cigarette and drinking. The simple things in life fulfill me.

I have one final and important question for you—what is the secret to your great hair?

That hair. That hair takes work! Listen, you should see it in the morning, honey! It’s not pretty.
