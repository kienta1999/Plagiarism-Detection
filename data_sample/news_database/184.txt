SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea vowed on Thursday to strengthen laws against sexual assault and implement measures to reduce harassment as the #MeToo campaign sweeps the country and sparks calls for meaningful action to tackle sexual abuse.

Allegations of sexual assault against a rising star in the ruling Democratic Party, leveled by an aide in a dramatic television interview earlier this week marked a new high for the #MeToo movement in South Korea.

An Hee-jung, who had been seen as a future candidate for the presidency, quit his post as a provincial governor and announced his retirement from politics having taken responsibility in a Facebook post for actions which police are now investigating.

His is the latest and most high profile in a lengthening list of scandals involving politicians and prominent figures from the country’s religious community, and entertainment and literary worlds.

“We all had a big shock, and there’s a higher consciousness now that women cannot experience such terrible things anymore,” Chung Hyun-back, Minister of Gender Equality and Family Chung Hyun-back told a press conference on International Women’s Day.

Chung credited the #MeToo campaign against sexual assault and harassment for bringing the issue to the surface in a South Korea’s male-dominated society.

“The #MeToo movement is an event where boiling rage has finally erupted against gender-biased power relations and gender inequality, which have been a long, deep-rooted evil of our society,” the minister said.

In response to mounting public outrage, the government said it plans to extend the statute of limitations for power-based sexual abuse cases, and the labor ministry would set up a process for victims to anonymously report sexual harassment at their workplaces.

The government was also considering toughening criminal punishment for employers found negligent in addressing sexual misdeeds, the ministry of gender equality said in a statement.

“We are focusing on sexual harassment and violence based on power relations,” Chung said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The wife of an Iranian-Canadian environmental activist who died in prison in Tehran last month was barred from leaving Iran, one of her sons said, in an unexplained move that drew an angry response from Canada.

Raam Emami said in an email to journalists that security forces had not allowed his mother, Maryam Mombeini, to get on a plane to Vancouver with him and his brother on Wednesday night.

Mombeini is the widow of Kavous Seyed-Emami, an environmental activist and sociology professor who was arrested on Jan. 24 and died in prison. Iran’s judiciary said Seyed-Emami, 63, had committed suicide.

The family has called for an independent investigation of his death.

Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chrystia Freeland, said in a message posted on Twitter that she was “outraged” to learn that Mombeini had been barred from leaving Iran.

“We demand that, as a Canadian, she be given the freedom to return home,” she added.

Iranian judiciary officials were not immediately available for comment.

Seyed-Emami was the managing director of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, which seeks to protect Iran’s rare animals. Iran’s judiciary said he had set up the NGO as a cover to collect classified information on Iran’s missile program.

Raam Emami said the family decided to leave Iran after being constantly “harassed”.

“The government raided our home and seized all of our valuables (most importantly deeds to our homes),” he said. “We can no longer stand this state of constant terror.”

Raam Emami has previously said that the family was under pressure from authorities not to publicize the case of Seyed-Emami.

“The authorities told our lawyers to tell the brothers ‘to shut up or we’ll shut them up,’ Emami said, adding government agents had told him they were watching him.

Human rights activists have reported that at least six detainees have died in prison in the last two months in Iran. The judiciary has confirmed three deaths in custody but said all three had committed suicide.

President Hassan Rouhani last month appointed a committee to investigate the incidents in prisons.

Shahindokht Molaverdi, Rouhani’s special assistant on civil rights and a member of the committee, said on Thursday that Rouhani was “serious about investigating” the death of Seyed-Emami and other prisoners.

She said the committee has met families of some deceased prisoners.

Bilateral ties between Iran and Canada worsened in 2003 when an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist, Zahra Kazemi, died in Tehran’s Evin prison while in custody.While the National Rifle Association continues to resist gun reform in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, Samantha Bee figured it was time for a little outreach.

In a mock PSA on “Full Frontal” Wednesday, the host offered an intriguing proposition for members of the gun group: join Scientology instead!

The comedian promised followers that they could blow away enemies with their brain instead of a rifle, but added a word of warning:

“Is Scientology safe?” she asked. “Of course not! It’s bonkers. But it’s like safer for the rest of us.”Snow covers the ground around Cigna Corp. signage displayed at the company's headquarters in Bloomfield, Connecticut, U.S., on Friday, Feb. 6, 2015.

(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp said on Thursday it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co for about $54 billion, the latest deal in the sector aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs.

The move follows the $69 billion merger of insurer Aetna Inc and drugstore chain CVS Health Corp announced last December, and highlights a sector-wide trend toward deals between companies that do not have directly overlapping operations.

The deals seek to lower healthcare costs by bringing under one roof pharmacy and medical claims, and give the combined entities greater leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers.

Cigna’s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts’ Wednesday closing price.

Express Scripts shares were up 18.6 percent at $87.10, while Cigna shares were down 4.25 percent at $186.

The transaction is valued at $67 billion, including about $15 billion in Express Scripts’ debt, the company said.

Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims.

The CVS-Aetna deal was seen pressuring rival insurers, drugmakers, PBMs and retail pharmacies to consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins.

The wave of consolidation in the sector also comes in the backdrop of a shifting landscape, including changes in the U.S. Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from Amazon.com Inc .

Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said the deal may surprise investors given Cigna has said that they are satisfied with their PBM arrangement with UnitedHealth’s Optum unit.

“It is possible that the threat of an Amazon entry into the healthcare and possibly the drug supply chain landscape, with the latest news of the Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan employer coalition has spurred Cigna and Express Scripts to tie the knot.”

Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co said in January they would form a company to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.

DEAL DETAILS

After the deal closes, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest.

Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion after the deal closes.

The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal.

The combined company will be led by current Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani.

The deal comes a year after Cigna’s deal to buy Anthem Inc was blocked by antitrust regulators.

Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was the legal adviser. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing regulatory counsel.

Centerview Partners and Lazard Frères were financial advisers to Express Scripts, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel and Holland & Knight LLP as regulatory counsel.U.S. Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke announced his immediate retirement this week amid reports of a culture of harassment at the agency. U.S. Forest Service

Tony Tooke, the chief of the U.S. Forest Service, has resigned amid reports of widespread sexual misconduct throughout the agency, including recent allegations against Tooke himself.

He announced his immediate retirement in an email to Forest Service employees on Wednesday just days after PBS “NewsHour” published a sweeping investigation about the “boys’ club” culture within the service. “NewsHour” spoke to 34 women who work for the agency in 13 states, many of whom detailed a workplace hostile to female employees who were often retaliated against when they reported harassment.

Some said they were raped and also faced retaliation when they reported the assaults.

“Many of you have seen the news reports which included the stories from women who told of their experiences with sexual harassment in the Forest Service. I admire their courage,” Tooke wrote in his departure email. “We are in a moment at the Forest Service when we have a tremendous opportunity to mold a bright and successful future in delivering our mission. To seize this moment, however, the right leadership must be in place to create an atmosphere in which employees can perform their very best work.”

PBS noted that during its reporting it uncovered claims that Tooke had engaged in relationships with subordinates before his tenure as chief. The Agriculture Department said last week it had hired an independent investigator to conduct a “thorough review” of his behavior.

“We take very seriously the responsibility to promote a safe, respectful and rewarding work environment for all employees,” Babete Anderson, a Forest Service press officer, told PBS at the time.

Tooke, a 38-year veteran of the Forest Service, was appointed chief by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last August. In a statement late Wednesday, Perdue thanked the chief for his service but noted that, “in order to effectively lead any organization, you must have the moral authority to inspire its members.”WASHINGTON ― Advocacy groups with powerful grassroots networks around the country are pressuring senators to vote for unprecedented legislation from Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that would immediately end U.S. support for a controversial Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting in Yemen since 2015.

At noon on Thursday, all Senate offices received a letter organized by the progressive group Win Without War and the conservative organization FreedomWorks and signed by 53 other outfits, including Indivisible, Our Revolution, CODEPINK, MoveOn.Org and CREDO. Activists are organizing a special call-in day on Friday to add to the more than 5,000 calls on the issue that constituents have already made to members. And campaigners plan a flurry of face-to-face meetings with congressional staff in the run up to a vote expected next week.

“This war of attrition has been waged using U.S. weapons, military support, and personnel without consent of Congress for far too long,” reads the letter, which was provided to HuffPost. “Congress has a constitutional and ethical duty to ensure any and all U.S. military operations comply with domestic and international law, and U.S. participation in the civil war in Yemen raises numerous legal and moral questions that must be resolved.”

The Senate bill they support cites the 1973 War Powers Resolution and Arms Export Control Act to say that Congress has the responsibility to expeditiously weigh in on the war and directs a halt to the U.S. role in it.

The Trump administration has responded to the bill by questioning its legal basis. In a letter to Senate leaders obtained by HuffPost last week, the acting general counsel of the Defense Department argued that lawmakers legislation cannot invoke the War Powers Resolution and force an end to the policy because American support to the coalition, dominated by Saudi Arabia and fellow U.S. partner the United Arab Emirates, does not constitute “hostilities” against the Iran-backed rebels the coalition is fighting. Pentagon, State Department and intelligence community officials made their case to Congressional staff Wednesday, and Yemen has now been added to the agenda of a classified briefing for senators themselves next Wednesday that was previously only about Syria, two sources told HuffPost.

But many legal scholars doubt the Defense Department’s logic, noting that the House of Representatives last year acknowledged that U.S. aerial refueling and intelligence is going to Saudi and UAE planes bombing the rebels. Many campaigners on the left and right agree.

“Our view is that Article 1, section 8 [of the Constitution] makes it very clear that Congress has the authority to declare war,” said Jason Pye, the vice president for legislative affairs at FreedomWorks. He noted that the Trump administration is sending Capitol Hill updates on U.S. activity in Yemen obligated under the War Powers legislation ― suggesting that it believes it is relevant in this case.

“This war of attrition has been waged using U.S. weapons, military support, and personnel without consent of Congress for far too long.” - Letter sent to Senate offices by Win Without War and FreedomWorks.

As rights groups have made repeated war crimes allegations against the Saudi-UAE coalition, and starvation and medical crises for millions in Yemen have gotten worse, lawmakers have tried several times to signal their disapproval of the policy initiated by President Barack Obama and continued under President Donald Trump. Despite hearings and proxy votes that have drawn more attention to the war ― in one case last summer almost preventing a key weapons sale to Saudi Arabia ― no legislative attempt to change course in the conflict has gone further than a compromise resolution passed in the House last year that acknowledged the U.S. government is not authorized to fight the rebels.

Activists say they are more confident about the impact of the Senate legislation. The way it was crafted means it must be dealt with on the floor, forcing lawmakers to be on the record rather than negotiate over the issue in backrooms.

Kate Kizer, the policy director for Win Without War, suggested another reason for optimism is how much concern there is now among the public about Trump’s general bellicosity.

“It’s in the context of mission creep under this president… his belief that he does have the constitutional authority that he can just launch strikes and drop bombs over countries,” she said. Trump has bombed Syria, expanded commanders’ authorities to call in strikes against the self-described Islamic State fight and threatened North Korea.

“What is essentially at stake is ... this would mean that Congress would have to vote on all these different military entanglements around the world,” said Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, on the prospective vote. Trump aides “know that this is a game-changing vote,” she added.

Three influential Democrats have already co-sponsored the bill: Democratic Whip Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer seems positively inclined, two sources told HuffPost. Schumer’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

While prominently anti-war Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is not yet on board, citing his opposition to a carve-out in the bill that would allow continued U.S. actions in Yemen against Al-Qaeda’s branch there, advocates say they are working to have him endorse the legislation. They argue that the more narrow consideration of whether America ought to conduct military actions abroad without any official authorization should be separate from the debate about how the U.S. relies on dated congressional resolutions to justify its pursuit of groups like ISIS.Thursday, March 8

WASHINGTON — A political appointee at the Interior Department attended two private events hosted by her longtime former employer, the right wing Heritage Foundation, which appears to be a violation of federal ethics rules.

Lori Mashburn worked as an associate director for the Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit think tank that wields tremendous influence in the Trump administration, from October 2011 to January 2017, according to her financial disclosure form. She was also a paid adviser for President Donald Trump’s campaign, and in May 2017 was hired as the Interior Department’s White House liaison.

On Sept. 29, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke gave a speech at Heritage about the administration’s push for “energy dominance,” where he snapped at a heckler and dismissed the controversy surrounding his use of private planes as “a little BS.” Zinke’s personal calendar shows that Mashburn was among several Interior Department officials in attendance at the event. A detailed schedule the department released as part of a public records request shows that after the public event, Mashburn joined Zinke and other agency officials for a private luncheon with several high-ranking Heritage Foundation employees.

Mashburn also joined Zinke at a private Heritage affair on Oct. 16 at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a government building that primarily houses White House staff. On its website, Heritage described the event — part of the group’s annual President’s Club meeting — as “an exclusive briefing for members who support Heritage with gifts of $10,000+ annually or legacy commitments of $200,000+.”

Trump delivered the meeting’s keynote speech the following day.

As a political appointee, Mashburn signed Trump’s ethics pledge, which bars appointees in the executive branch from participating “in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients.” Prohibited interactions include “any meeting or other communication relating to the performance of one’s official duties with a former employer or former client, unless the communication applies to a particular matter of general applicability and participation in the meeting or other event is open to all interested parties,” according to the pledge.

Attending the private Heritage meetings appears to be a clear violation of the pledge, Brendan Fischer, a staff attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, said via email.

Mashburn may have also broken standard ethics rules that apply to all executive branch employees.

Like other government agencies, the Interior Department requires employees to recuse themselves from matters that present conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts. Specific situations requiring recusal include those that will have an effect on financial interests, when seeking other employment, and “when an employee’s participation in a matter would create an appearance problem.”

Executive branch employees are also generally prohibited from participating in matters involving former employers for one full year, commonly known as a “cooling off” period.

The federal standards of conduct provide more flexibility than the president’s ethics pledge when it comes to government employees meeting with former employers.

Virginia Canter, the executive branch ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, another Washington, D.C.-based government watchdog group, said Mashburn’s attendance at these events raises obvious red flags.

“The fact is, she’s not supposed to be participating in meetings with Heritage under the ethics pledge unless [the meeting] is open to all interested parties,” Canter said. And if Mashburn acted as the White House liaison to arrange for Zinke to address an audience of Heritage staff, members and donors, Canter said, that “seems to not be consistent with what her obligations are under the ethics pledge.”

Canter and Fischer also said Mashburn may have violated the prohibition on using public office for the private gain of her former employees, if she used her office to help Heritage boost fundraising at the Oct. 16 event. Rules also prohibit government workers from accepting gifts, including meals, valued at more than $20, which raises questions about the Sept. 29 luncheon.

Furthermore, the exclusive briefing at a government building raises additional concerns for the White House, as it appears to have played host for an event limited to Heritage’s largest donors, Canter noted.

It’s unclear what role Mashburn played at these events or if Interior Department ethics officials gave Mashburn approval to participate, and on what grounds if so. The White House can and has granted waivers that exempt appointees from certain portions of federal ethics rules.

Mashburn and the Interior Department did not respond to several requests for comment, including specific questions about the events and Mashburn’s participation. The Heritage Foundation and White House also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to a ProPublica database, Mashburn is one of at least 27 Trump administration appointees that came from the Heritage Foundation or its related political nonprofit, Heritage Action. In a January release, Heritage noted that the administration had “embraced” 64 percent of the group’s 334 policy recommendations in its first year.WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed ahead with the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum on Thursday but exempted Canada and Mexico, backtracking from earlier pledges of tariffs on all countries.

Describing the dumping of steel and aluminum in the United States as “an assault on our country,” Trump told a news conference that the best outcome would for companies to move here and insisted that domestic production was needed for national security reasons.

“If you don’t want to pay tax, bring your plant to the USA,” he said.

Details of the plan came from a briefing by administration officials ahead of Trump’s speech. Other countries can apply for exemptions, according to the administration, although details of when they would be granted were thin.

Trump has offered relief from steel and aluminum tariffs to countries that “treat us fairly on trade,” a gesture aimed at putting pressure on Canada and Mexico to give ground in separate talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which appear to have stalled.

Trump has also demanded concessions from the European Union, complaining that it treated American cars unfairly and has threatened to hike tariffs on auto imports from Europe.

U.S. stocks extended gains ahead of the announcement, as the Associated Press reported key details. The benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index was last up 0.3 percent, but the S&P composite 1500 steel index was down 2.7 percent.

U.S. Treasury bonds yields rose slightly, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 2.86 percent. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso gained against the U.S. dollar.

LINK TO NAFTA REJECTED

Mexico rejected any linkage to NAFTA in robust terms on Thursday. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters, “Under no circumstance will we be subject to any type of pressure.”

Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Phillippe Champagne told Reuters his country would not accept any duties or quotas from the United States.

Trump’s unexpected announcement of the tariffs last week roiled stock markets as it raised the prospect of an escalating global trade war. He appeared to have conceded some ground after a campaign by legislators from his own Republican party, industry groups and U.S. allies abroad.

The president said he was pleased with progress in the NAFTA talks, although he repeated that he would be willing to terminate the agreement. The talks were launched after Trump took office last year saying that if the pact was not negotiated to better serve American interests, Washington would leave.

Many observers take a dimmer view of the six-month-old talks, saying little progress has been made and the negotiations are stalled over issues such as autos. Car manufacturing’s contribution to the U.S., Mexican and Canadian economies far outweighs that of steel and aluminum production.

COUNTERSTRIKE

Several major trading partners have said they will respond to the tariffs with direct action.

“If Donald Trump puts in place the measures this evening, we have a whole arsenal at our disposal with which to respond,” European Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.

Countermeasures would include European tariffs on U.S. oranges, tobacco and bourbon, he said. Harley Davidson Inc motorcycles have also been mentioned, targeting House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin.

Even as Trump threatened tariffs and prodded his NAFTA partners, 11 nations gathered in Chile to sign a landmark Asia-Pacific trade pact, one that Trump withdrew from on his first day in office.

Both Guajardo and Champagne were speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Santiago.

Trump, who won the White House after a career in real estate and reality TV, has long touted an economic nationalism, promising to bring back jobs to the United States and save the country from trade deals he views as unfair. That has put him at odds with many in his Republican Party.

Beijing, which until now had kept largely silent on the issue, sharpened its rhetoric significantly. One lever that China has is U.S. agricultural exports and it has said in the past that it could target soybeans.

“Especially given today’s globalization, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription. The outcome will only be harmful,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on the sidelines of an annual meeting of China’s parliament. “China would have to make a justified and necessary response.”

China had a record $375.2 billion goods surplus with the United States last year.

Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies have risen since Trump took office, and although China accounts for only a small fraction of U.S. steel imports, its massive industrial expansion has helped create a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.

Most economists and trade specialists say they doubt the steel and aluminum tariffs alone would trigger a global trade war, but point to the risk of further U.S. measures against China as a major tipping point. Trump has also threatened to impose hefty tariffs on European car exports if the EU does take retaliatory measures.Seth Meyers gleefully entertained the “very real possibility that Donald Trump sent Stormy Daniels a dick pic” on “Late Night” Wednesday.

In a segment that poked fun at turmoil in Trump’s White House, Meyers noted that porn actress Daniels, aka Stephanie Clifford, sued the president because she claimed he didn’t sign a hush agreement to prevent her from blabbing about their alleged affair.

A detail in the suit piqued the late-night host’s interest ― that she came into contact with “confidential information” that included “certain still images and/or text messages” related to Trump.

Meyers put two and two together and guessed that Trump sent an image of his privates.

“It would look like a Flamin’ Hot Cheeto sitting on a Brillo pad,” he said.

And we’re done.

AdvertisementThis is no laughing matter.

On Wednesday, five late-night hosts — James Corden, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel — made essentially the same joke about President Donald Trump neglecting to sign his nondisclosure agreement with porn star Stormy Daniels.

And it isn’t even a particularly good one.

In a nutshell, the joke is that it’s funny Trump didn’t sign the nondisclosure agreement because he generally likes to put his name on everything.

Funny thing about late night comedy tonight. Counted at least four hosts making the variation of same joke (Corden, Meyers, Kimmel, Colbert) re: Stormy Daniels. "This is the thing he wouldn't put his name on?" — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) March 8, 2018

Trevor Noah too. Five hosts. https://t.co/LiZC3CS5N6 — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) March 8, 2018

Sopan Deb of The New York Times tweeted about the played-out quip on Wednesday night. A quick search on YouTube proved him right.

“This is amazing mostly because this is the first time Trump has ever not put his name on something,” Corden cracked.

“He remembers to put his name on everything else, water, vodka, steaks, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,” Kimmel joked.

“So this is the thing Trump thought was too sketchy to put his name on? What about Trump University or Don Jr.?” Colbert used as his punch line.

“The same guy who slaps his name on everything — buildings, vodka, the least sexy ‘Twilight’ vampire,” Noah quipped as a picture of the president’s eldest son popped up on screen.

Meyers’ joke was slightly different, poking fun at Trump’s penchant for signing and then displaying executive orders: “That’s right ― the business-man president didn’t even remember that when you make a deal, you have to sign it. Which is surprising, considering how much he loves showing off his signature.”

Jesse David Fox of Vulture suggested that the problem isn’t a lack of talent in late-night writers’ rooms but rather the source material itself.

As Fox wrote back in December, “If there is one thing that has defined Trump’s presidency, it’s the rate at which he’s been bad at it. While that might sound like a good thing for comedy — there’s something new to joke about every day! — comics actually don’t need more material. They need people to care about their material long enough for them to make their jokes better.”“For the far right, globalism has long had distinct xenophobic, anti-immigrant, and anti-Semitic overtones,” the article states. “It refers to a conspiratorial worldview: a cabal that likes open borders, diversity and weak nation states, and that dislikes white people, Christianity and the traditional culture of their own country.”

The White House confirmed Tuesday that Cohn will resign from his spot as Trump’s chief economic adviser “in the coming weeks.” The former Goldman Sachs executive hit a tough spot in his relationship with the president last summer after Cohn disagreed with Trump’s response to neo-Nazis and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, Reuters reported.

Cohn, in an interview with the Financial Times, had said at the time that he considered resigning over Trump’s delayed condemnation of the protesters and the president’s initial claim that “both sides” deserved blame for the violence that left a woman dead.

Cohn ultimately decided to stay in his position, though asserted that the Trump administration “must do better.”

“As a Jewish-American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting ‘Jews will not replace us’ to cause this Jew to leave his job,” he told the paper at the time. “I feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. We must all unite together against them.”WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s decision to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports drew rare bipartisan criticism from lawmakers, who warned the move could trigger a transatlantic trade war and hurt U.S. companies.

Trump signed proclamations Thursday allowing tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum to take effect later this month.

“The American aluminum and steel industry has been ravaged by aggressive foreign trade practices. It’s really an assault on our country,” Trump said during a hastily arranged event at the White House.

Surrounded by a group of steelworkers, Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Trump approvingly cited President William McKinley, a champion of protectionist economic policy, to support his trade decision.

“Many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade are our allies,” Trump added.

Administration officials said the tariffs would apply to every country in the world except Canada and Mexico, two key U.S. allies. During the event at the White House, however, Trump said that the two countries would be indefinitely exempted while negotiations continue regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In imposing the tariffs, Trump broke with many members of his own party, none of whom joined him for the event at the White House.

A group of seven Republican senators, led by Joni Ernst of Iowa, warned in a letter Thursday that the administration risked “alienating key international partners that contribute to our ability to defend our nation and maintain international stability.” Many others argued this week the tariffs could lead to higher prices for other products, such as cars, planes, boats, soup and beer.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic, said he would introduce legislation to nullify the tariffs.

“Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster,” Flake said in a statement.

“If you’re our allies, trading partners, you’ve got to be pulling your hair out right now,” he later told reporters.

Flake noted that when President Jimmy Carter imposed a tariff on oil imports in the 1970s, Congress voted to nullify them and even overrode a subsequent presidential veto to do so. A veto override, however, would require a two-thirds vote in each chamber ― a tall order for this Congress.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday he disagreed with the decision, but he did not go so far as to suggest action to undo the tariffs.

“I am pleased that the president has listened to those who share my concerns and included an exemption for some American allies, but it should go further,” Ryan said in a statement. “We will continue to urge the administration to narrow this policy so that it is focused only on those countries and practices that violate trade law.”

Most Democrats were equally critical of the tariffs. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), for example, likened the move to “dropping a bomb on a flea.”

Conservatives and free-trade groups also panned the decision.

“Tariffs are a tax increase on American workers and their families. The president’s decision today to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is disappointing, economically regressive and counterproductive,” Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James said in a statement.President Donald Trump has spent his life putting his name on things, but it looks like there’s at least one item he won’t slap the family brand on.Few people would deny that the Russians are meddling in our elections.

“We’ve been told that we need to listen to the children and do what the children ask,” she said during a state House debate. “Are there any children on this floor? Are there any children making laws?”

“Do we allow the children to tell us that we should pass a law that says ’no homework’? Or you finish high school at the age of 12 just because they want it so? No,” she added. “The adults make the laws because we have the age, we has [sic] the wisdom, and we have the experience.”

Meanwhile, college students participated in a “die-in” anti-gun protest at the state’s Capitol Rotunda. Some held signs that said, “No armed teachers.”

The Florida state Senate passed a bill on Monday that would allow school staff, excluding most teachers, to carry firearms. It would also establish a mental health program for schools, raise the legal age for firearm purchases to 21 and introduce a three-day waiting period for such sales.

The Florida state House spent around five hours Tuesday on its version of the bill, debating three dozen amendments that would introduce more restrictions, including one to eliminate the concealed carry program for school employees. All of the proposals were defeated.

A vote is expected to take place this week, but Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has still not said whether he would sign the bill passed by the Senate. Scott has previously spoken out against the idea of permitting teachers to carry guns in schools.KANSAS CITY, Kan. ― A few years ago, the League of Women Voters held a three-week voter registration drive at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Some 400 people stopped by during the drive, but only about 75 followed through and became registered voters.

The low follow-through rate fit into an alarming pattern observed by the League of Women Voters ever since Kansas began requiring people to prove their citizenship when they registered to vote. After that state law was implemented in 2013, registration efforts at high schools and on college campuses became remarkably less effective, according to the league. Students, after all, tend to lack easy access to proof-of-citizenship documents like a birth certificate or a passport.

Margaret Ahrens, the former president of the Kansas League of Women Voters, told a federal court on Wednesday that it was like nothing her group had ever seen before. She called the law a “dead hit” on voter registration drives.

Ahrens was one of three people who testified about the negative impact of the Kansas law during the second day of a federal lawsuit challenging the statute as needlessly restrictive.

On Wednesday, Parker Bednasek, a senior at the University of Kansas, testified that when he went to register at the local election office in Lawrence in 2015, he didn’t have his birth certificate because it was at his parents’ home in Texas. He couldn’t get on the rolls. Steven Wayne Fish testified that he couldn’t register in 2014 at the driver’s licensing office because he also didn’t have his birth certificate. Fish, who was born on a now-closed Air Force base, said he had no idea where his birth certificate was.

Bednasek and Fish are among a group of Kansas residents bringing suit with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union. They’ve taken on Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), whose office enforces the state law and who is himself a vigorous proponent of stricter voting requirements. Kobach is leading his own defense in court, although he has other attorneys to back him up.

Those attorneys questioned how much of a burden the law really was on Bednasek, Fish or anybody who tried to register with the aid of the League of Women Voters. They noted that Fish found his birth certificate in 2016 and said that Kobach’s office had offered to help him complete his voter registration. They said Bednasek could have obtained a copy of his birth certificate from his parents. And they asked Ahrens how she could say the law had hurt the League of Women Voters when membership had risen and voter registration increased between 2010 and 2014.

Kobach’s lawyers argued that anyone who lacked the required proof of citizenship could request a hearing with the state election board to explain their circumstances. But Ahrens said on the stand Wednesday that she didn’t know anyone with the “patience and gumption” to wade through that process.

The lawsuit contends that the Kansas law violates a federal statute, the National Voter Registration Act, that says officials can only ask people for the minimum information necessary to demonstrate that they are eligible to vote. A federal judge blocked the state law in 2016. According to the ACLU, the law has still affected more than 35,000 people. To preserve it, Kobach will have to show that there is substantial evidence of noncitizens getting on the voter rolls in Kansas and nothing short of asking people to prove their citizenship can prevent noncitizens from registering.

Beyond the merits of the Kansas law, procedural disputes took up a big chunk of the trial on Wednesday.

The defense lawyers opened the day by arguing that a video deposition of Kobach should not be played in court, but instead the transcript should be read out loud. Attorney Sue Becker accused Dale Ho, the ACLU’s lead lawyer, of tweeting Tuesday that the video would show what Becker called a “grand conspiracy” to make it harder to vote. She appeared to be referring to a tweet posted by the ACLU account in which Ho said the video deposition would “shine a light on, really, what is a nationwide plan here to make voting harder.”

U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson said she would allow the video to be played in court, but delayed that by a day to give Kobach’s team time to review it. The deposition contains information about discussions with President Donald Trump in which Kobach suggested amending federal law so that states could clearly impose a proof-of-citizenship requirement.

There were also some theatrics in the courtroom.

When Bednasek was on the stand as a witness, Becker accused his lawyer of improperly coaching him as he testified. The accusation prompted that lawyer, Mark Johnson, to stand up and yell “For crying out loud!” and “I take offense to that!” The judge did not agree that coaching had occurred.

For the second day in a row, Robinson spent time admonishing members of Kobach’s defense team on how they brought in evidence during cross-examination. And toward the end of the day, the judge temporarily blocked Kobach from introducing a spreadsheet of 38 noncitizens who had allegedly tried to register in Sedgwick County, Kansas. She said he had not given the ACLU attorneys enough time to review the documents it was based on.Suleiman Abdulfatai is a native of Nigeria, 31 years old, a graphic designer and a clothing designer. He’s also a dead ringer for Chadwick Boseman.

A post shared by Abdulfatai (@fhatoh_s) on May 16, 2018 at 7:21am PDT

Abdulfatai, whose Twitter handle is @fhatoh_s, posted a selfie earlier this week on Twitter, and people were immediately shook about his famous doppelgänger.

For reference, this is “Black Panther” star Boseman:

Abdulfatai, who lives in the Nigerian capital Abuja, told HuffPost that he realized he looked like Boseman when “Black Panther” came out.

“I didn’t watch it early like other guys did,” he told us, but when he started getting calls about the resemblance to the main character, he “decided to go watch it.”

Then this week, Abdulfatai posted his picture on Twitter with the hashtag #FineEbiraTwitter, and the first comment he got was about Boseman. And the comments about the actor and designer’s similarities have not slowed down at all:

Abdulfatai says the responses about his celebrity twin have been “overwhelming.”

“I feel so happy to be finally recognized and be compared to Chadwick,” he told HuffPost. “To my new fans, may God continue to bless every single one you out there.”

As for Boseman’s thoughts on the likeness, his representative declined to provide a comment.As Italy’s far-right Lega and anti-establishment Five Star parties look to form their country’s next government, HuffPost Italia has obtained leaked documents that show the two parties are seeking better ties with Russia and plan to crack down on migration.

In a draft contract that outlines Five Star and Lega’s shared policies, the parties state they want to immediately lift sanctions against the Kremlin that have been in place since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.

The documents also include heavy criticism of the European Union’s response to migration and calls for a tougher line against migrants seeking asylum in Europe. Over 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy in recent years, bringing the issue of immigration to the forefront and contributing to the rise of far-right leaders such as Lega’s Matteo Salvini.

Italy has been in a period of political gridlock since its election in March left no clear winner. But in recent weeks the eurosceptic Five Star and Lega parties have moved closer to agreeing on a governing coalition, a deal that would give Italy one of the most populist governments in all of Europe.

An earlier draft of the contract between the two parties, published by HuffPost Italia this week, caused widespread concern in Europe. The document showed that the parties wanted to take a combative stance toward the EU, and even stated that they would look to find ways that the country could potentially opt-out of the eurozone.

The Milan stock market fell after the news and investors dropped Italian assets amid fears of political and economic instability.

The latest document waters down many of the more extreme policies, however, including mention of asking the European Central Bank to cancel nearly $300 billion in debt and talk of leaving the euro currency.

Even with a more moderate attitude toward the EU, the parties are expected to attempt radical domestic changes after promising to eliminate pension cuts and boost the welfare state. Economists worry that such goals are unrealistic given that Italy is deeply in debt ― making up 132 percent of its GDP.Everyone wants in on International Women’s Day: Michelle Obama imparted some wisdom, Kim Kardashian released themed emojis and Ivanka Trump sent a tone-deaf tweet.

Feminism has become so trendy that major national brands are joining in, celebrating the female consumer’s steady march toward gender equality even if their own corporate histories are marked by practices harmful to women.

Behold these examples:

Barbie

Mattel has announced a new line of Barbie dolls modeled after inspirational women from history, including Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart and Kathleen Johnson, the NASA mathematician featured in the film “Hidden Figures.”

Although the brand announced a line of “realistic” dolls back in 2016, the new ones appear to maintain the same rail-thin measurements that have fueled Barbie criticism for decades. Research has shown that Barbie’s physique can have a negative impact on young girls’ body image.

With 86% of US moms worried about the type of role models their daughters are exposed to, we are committed to shining a light on empowering female role models in an effort to inspire more girls.

Budweiser

AdWeek reports that from Thursday through the end of March, Budweiser will honor contributions made by female employees by posting their photos on the company’s social media pages.

Yet, in 2018, Budweiser still employs “Budweiser Girls,” the young, mostly white women who dress in skimpy clothing to promote the brand.

The brewery also found itself in some hot water back in 2015 for a Bud Light ad campaign that struck many as tone-deaf in light of the emerging national discussion on sexual consent. Titled “Up for Whatever,” the campaign included labels printed with, “The perfect beer for removing ‘no’ from your vocabulary for the night.”

Bud earned some good PR the following year for an ad highlighting equal pay. However, the company still counts just two women among its 13-member North American executive leadership team.

ESPN

A new 30-second spot from ESPN celebrates women’s achievements in sports to promote the upcoming NCAA Women’s Basketball Championship.

Yet a 2017 Boston Globe expose detailed a culture of rampant sexism at the network. Women at ESPN reported feeling pressured to hide their pregnancies and take short maternity leaves in a professional environment where unwanted sexual advances by male colleagues were plentiful. Some men at ESPN openly rated women on their appearance, the Globe reported.

ESPN has faced legal action over its work culture in the past, and just this week, former anchor Adrienne Lawrence filed a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the network.

Let’s also not forget ESPN’s short-lived partnership with Barstool Sports, a website with a well-documented history of publishing content grossly disrespectful toward women.

Google

Thursday’s Google Doodle celebrates 12 female artists and encourages people to share stories about inspiring women in their own lives with the hashtag #HerStoryOurStory. A Google trends page, g.co/womensday, also shows how global interest in gender equality has increased.

The Google Doodle team has a history of shining light on important women and people of color in history, but the tech giant as a whole is another matter. Last summer, Google faced questions over misogyny in its corporate environment after a memo written by a male employee was made public. The memo described how biology made women less successful in the tech industry and was circulated widely on Google’s internal discussion boards for days without action by the company. While the memo’s author was fired, the incident reportedly sparked a heated discussion on gender and discrimination within the company.

Currently, Google faces a lawsuit over its alleged “bro culture” brought by a software engineer, Loretta Lee, who worked for the tech giant from 2008 to 2016.

McDonald’s

The fast-food staple flipped its golden arches across its numerous social media channels on Thursday, turning the iconic “M” into a “W.” (You know, for “women.”) Employees will also be able to wear “special hats and shirts” for the occasion.Sinclair Broadcast Group is reportedly requiring local news anchors at TV stations it owns to recite pre-written promotional spots disavowing the national media’s “fake stories” and “personal bias” ― some of President Donald Trump’s favorite punchlines.

Sinclair, one of the biggest owners of local TV stations in the U.S., with 193 outlets in 89 markets, sent scripts of the promos to news directors, instructing that they be produced “exactly as they are written,” according to CNN.

“I’m [we are] concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country,” the spot begins. “The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, national media outlets are publishing these same fake stories without checking facts first. Unfortunately, some members of the national media are using their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control ‘exactly what people think’ ... This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.”

It concludes that reporting facts ― which are neither “left nor right” ― is their duty as journalists. All Sinclair stations had to run an almost identical segment last year as well, The New York Times reported.

“I felt like a POW recording a message,” one anchor at a Sinclair-owned station told CNN.

Sinclair has a history of advancing a conservative agenda. Another recent iteration of right-wing bias came in the form of a requirement that its stations air pro-Trump segments featuring Boris Epshteyn (a former Trump White House official) nine times per week.

The media giant is trying to expand its reach in major cities with a proposed deal to acquire 42 stations currently owned by Tribune Media.

“You should find out who owns your local station and bear that in mind as you watch,” HBO’s John Oliver warned in a segment devoted to Sinclair that aired last summer.The world will get an intimate look into the final years of Martin Luther King Jr.’s life as the anniversary of his death approaches next month.

HBO on Wednesday unveiled the trailer to its documentary “King in the Wilderness,” set to premiere April 2, two days ahead of the 50th anniversary of the civil rights leader’s assassination. Emmy winner Peter Kundhart directed the film.

“King in the Wilderness,” which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January, reveals the “dark and dangerous period in the long struggle for equality,” HBO’s press statement to USA Today read.

“King himself described it as a time when his dream for America turned into a nightmare,” HBO said.

That “nightmare” includes the 18 months before King was fatally shot in Memphis, according to reviews of the documentary: the tensions between King and the leaders of the Black Power movement, the group’s resistance to his approach of nonviolence, and the backlash from President Lyndon B. Johnson when King condemned the Vietnam War.

HBO's documentary on Martin Luther King Jr. is set to air on April 2, two days before the anniversary of the civil rights leader's assassination. HBO

The Hollywood Reporter’s chief theater critic, David Rooney, called the documentary “a thoughtful examination” and an “engrossing tribute to a complex legacy.”

“The documentary taps into a regrettably still relevant debate as America backslides in the wake of last year’s Charlottesville protest, with white supremacist fringe groups newly emboldened in the Trump era,” Rooney wrote in January.

“As such, the film’s message remains timely, shaped by the voices and vivid recollections of King’s intimate associates in the struggle for equality.”

In an interview with The Root, Trey Ellis, the producer of the documentary, said the film will give viewers a look into a very different civil rights leader who was dealing with a different world.

“Everything you thought you knew about Martin Luther King Jr. is wrong,” Ellis told the black culture and news site.

The agency awarded the contract to Conquest Solutions LLC, a Greenbelt, Maryland-based company that specializes in automation systems. A contract summary available online lists the purchase as “Secretary’s Door.”

Conquest Solutions could not be reached for comment late Thursday. The Interior Department also did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiry.

However, department spokeswoman Heather Swift did confirm the purchase to the AP, saying that Zinke was not aware of the contract and that the purchase is part of a long-running modernization of the historic headquarters building in Washington, D.C.

“The secretary was not aware of this contract but agrees that this is a lot of money for demo, install, materials and labor,” Swift said. “Between regulations that require historic preservation and outdated government procurement rules, the costs for everything from pencils to printing to doors is astronomical. This is a perfect example of why the secretary believes we need to reform procurement processes.”

The work involves replacing three sets of double doors, including two that open from Zinke’s office onto a balcony overlooking the National Mall and another that enters into a hallway on the building’s sixth floor, the AP reported.

Internal agency emails show that the balcony doors were problematic early in Zinke’s tenure. On March 29, Joe Nassar, director of the Interior Department’s Office of Facilities and Administrative Services, wrote to other facilities management staff about water leaking in and the need for new locks.

“We need to come up with a permanent solution for the doors since they are still allowing in rain,” Nassar wrote. He also wrote that replacing the locks would ensure Zinke “doesn’t need a key from the inside and he doesn’t get locked out when he goes outside.”

In a subsequent email, James Grisham, an assistant building manager, informed the others that he was planning to contact a government contractor named Ian — presumably Ian Mulira, the general manager of Conquest Solutions — to replace the historic wood doors with metal ones.

SCREENSHOT/DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

Swift told the AP that the third door leading into the hallway does not lock and requires a security upgrade. It is unclear how much is being spent on each separate door.

Emily Atkin of The New Republic looked into how a door could possibly cost that much and found that state-of-the-art electronic security doors can feature fingerprint or retina scanners. A specialist at a company similar to the one the Interior Department contracted told Atkin that the price tag is not unreasonable for that type of door.

“To be honest with you, $140,000 is not really that far out of the ballpark if it’s a high-security type deal,” the employee told her.

On its website, Conquest Solutions notes that it is working to install a new digital control system at the Interior Department that will reduce energy consumption.

Athan Manuel, director of Sierra Club Lands Protection Program, issued a statement blasting Zinke for the seemingly lavish expense.

“Zinke is a walking scandal who believes he can live the life of luxury on the American taxpayer’s dime, and it’s time Trump puts a stop to it,” Manuel said. “We only hope that this $139,000 door doesn’t hit Zinke on his way out.”

Upon taking over the Interior Department, Zinke — a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL — redecorated his office with a slew of dead creatures and a collection of Navy SEAL knives. Staff members were left scrambling to accommodate the changes, shuffling around a huge grizzly bear, mounting bison and elk heads directly into the office’s carved oak paneling, and making way for a $1,749 leather couch from California that included “white-glove delivery service.” The interior secretary has also been criticized for his use of private planes, which he dismissed as “a little BS.”
