American Airlines is setting some new ground rules on emotional support animals, barring companions like spiders, hedgehogs, goats and snakes from taking flight.

The airline unveiled a list of prohibited animals on Monday after it said a growing number of passengers have taken or attempted to take a range of animals on board planes for emotional support ― including a peacock, pig and hamster on other airlines.

From 2016 to 2017, the airline said it saw a 40 percent rise in service or support animals on its aircraft — similar to increases at other airlines like Delta and United, which made similar changes this year.

“At American, we want to have policies and procedures in place that protect our team members and our customers who have a real need for a trained service or support animal,” American said in a statement.

Michael Krinke via Getty Images Flying on American Airlines with a service animal will now require advance notice, as well as contact information for the passenger’s mental health professional.

The changes, which will go into effect on June 1, include requiring a minimum of 48 hours’ notice that the support animal will be flying and proper documentation to allow the airline to contact the passenger’s mental health professional for confirmation.

The airline said it met with a number of disability groups to get their input before making the changes, including My Blind Spot, an organization that works to make environments more accessible to everyone, regardless of disability.

Albert Rizzi, the organization’s founder, who is legally blind, stressed in an American Airlines employee podcast on Monday that the changes being made by the airline will not affect those who rely on trained service animals.

“This is not going to change the policy for those of us who are dependent on our trained, well-behaved service animals,” he said. “Incidents when people try to pass off their pets as support animals are going to be reined in. This is something that’s very important that we struggle with every day.”

Any emotional support animal that growls, bites, jumps or lunges at people will be considered a pet, and pet fees and requirements will apply, the airline said.

Delta and United also tightened their rules on support animals this year after seeing an increase in animals accompanying passengers. Delta said there was a rise in unruly animals that caused onboard incidents.

Last June, a man said he required 28 stitches to his face after being mauled by an emotional support dog on a Delta Air Lines flight in Atlanta.

Asylum seekers in Australia’s offshore detention camp in the Papua New Guinean province of Manus Island have been given a grim choice: Remain in a Papua New Guinea jail forever or return to their home countries to face arbitrary detention, torture or death.

Australia’s hard-line policy of mandatory detention for unauthorized boat arrivals saw thousands of men, women and children who were seeking asylum shunted to offshore processing facilities on Manus Island and the Pacific island nation of Nauru in recent years. The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the arrangement breached the country’s constitution and ordered the detention center to close. In 2017 the Australian government agreed to pay $70 million in compensation to about 1,900 asylum seekers detained on Manus over the years but simply moved the detainees ― all men ― to new facilities after the old center was shut down.

Although those deemed to be legitimate refugees are allowed to settle in the PNG community as normal residents, those found to not be refugees are held in a separate, newly built facility called Hillside House and have been pressured to return to their home countries, which include Iran, Somalia and Sudan. Most of the men on Manus have been found to be legitimate refugees by agencies including the United Nations, but some have had their claims for refugee status rejected.

Many of the would-be refugees have been deported or returned home already, after being tempted by $20,000 (about $16,000 U.S.) packages from the Australian government.

Last week, a number of Hillside House residents received a grim letter from the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority, saying that the government wants to deport them but that a pre-deportation assessment found these asylum seekers would face mortal danger if they returned to their home countries.

“This included an assessment of whether there is a real risk that you will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the imposition of the death penalty,” the letter obtained by HuffPost stated.

“The assessment found that there is a real risk of one or more of these events and therefore the Government of Papua New Guinea will not remove you to your home country.”

The letter said that, despite this, “you do not have a right to remain in Papua New Guinea and your removal and detention orders remain in effect.”

The letter distributed to asylum seekers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.

“It’s essentially putting people who need protection into limbo or detention forever,” Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “The men detained in Hillside have limited rights to movement. There is no solution. The men who received these letters are at their wits’ end. Where can they go?”

Blucher said many of the men would be persecuted and targeted if they returned home.

“It has been acknowledged they’d face torture and death if they go home. They can’t stay in PNG. They’re not allowed to go to Australia. This has heaped a lot of distress onto people. It’s dangerous when you take already hopeless people and tell them there’s no solution in the foreseeable future,” she said.

“It’s something Australia could have absolutely foreseen yet failed to plan. It’s another example showing this entire system is a disaster.”

The Australian government says it no longer bears any responsibility for the asylum seekers, despite the asylum boats having been on a course for Australia and having been detained in Australian waters. The Department of Home Affairs, which has jurisdiction over immigration, issued a one-line response to HuffPost: “This is a matter for the PNG Government.”

Dr. Maria O’Sullivan, senior lecturer at Monash University’s law school and deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, told HuffPost that, although fear of torture or death was not in itself a basis to claim refugee status, most developed nations offered protection for non-refugees with such fears.

“Many countries are party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which means they can’t return someone to torture. The thorny issue is that Nauru and PNG are developing countries that have only recently relatively signed up to these conventions,” she said.

“PNG can’t send them back, but they don’t have to give them a status that allows them to stay. When you’re recognized as a refugee, you’re allowed certain rights to education, work, social security and more. It’s a big issue in refugee law worldwide, you won’t get sent back but you don’t have any status.”

O’Sullivan claimed the PNG government was attempting to encourage the non-refugees to go back to their home countries, regardless of the potential danger.

“The policy wants them to voluntarily return home. The government is giving them one choice, staying in PNG in this uncertain status,” she said.“When I signed the tax cut, six weeks ago, it set off a tidal wave of good news that continues to grow every single day. Before the ink was dry, companies were announcing thousands and thousands of new jobs and enormous investments to their workers.”President Donald Trump conflated the death of Indianapolis Colts player Edwin Jackson with a need for more stringent measures against illegal immigration.

Authorities determined Monday that the driver responsible for the fatal incident that killed Jackson and his Uber driver, Jeffrey Monroe, as they were pulled over on the side of an interstate early Sunday is Manuel Orrego-Savala, a Guatemalan citizen who was using the alias Alex Cabrera Gonsales. Orrego-Savala is living in the U.S. illegally and has previously been deported twice.

Trump capitalized on this detail Tuesday, arguing that this type of incident can be prevented by keeping undocumented immigrants out of the country:

So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2018

My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2018

Building a wall and enforcing a series of Trump’s other draconian measures is precisely what Jackson wouldn’t have wanted, his roommate Chad Bouchez told CBS News.

“I don’t think Edwin would have judged anyone on where they were from or anything else,” he said.

Unable to overcome the impasse on an immigration deal, lawmakers let the government shut down briefly last month. Although Congress is expected to vote on a short-term spending deal on Tuesday to fund the government through March 23, no updated immigration deal has been proposed.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz apologized to Chinese consumers on Tuesday for an Instagram post showing one of its luxury cars along with a quote from exiled Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, whom Beijing considers a dangerous separatist.

In a statement on its official Weibo, the German car maker said it had deleted the controversial post immediately, and offered its sincerest apology to Chinese people, in a sign that foreign brands are growing more wary of the reputational damage that missteps on touchy political issues can bring.

In a “MondayMotivation” hashtagged post on Instagram, Mercedes showed one of its white cars on a beach along with a quote attributed to the Dalai Lama: “Look at the situations from all angles, and you will become more open.”

The post soon drew criticism from eagled-eyed Chinese netizens. The Dalai Lama fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, though the Nobel Peace Prize winning monk says he simply seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.

“We will promptly take steps to deepen our understanding of Chinese culture and values, our international staff included, to help standardize our actions to ensure this sort of issue doesn’t happen again,” the Daimler-owned company said in the statement.

Foreign brands in China are trying to court Chinese shoppers who have growing purchasing power, but consumers and regulators are increasingly willing to challenge brands over actions that go against what Beijing deems appropriate.

Last month, firms including Delta Air Lines and Spanish apparel maker Zara were reprimanded by authorities for listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on their websites. China claims sovereignty over both areas.

The Los Angeles Times’ owner has sold the newspaper to one of its shareholders, the paper confirmed Wednesday.

Tronc Inc., the paper’s former owner, is expected to announce the sale of the Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune to Nant Capital, the investment firm of billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong, for almost $500 million in cash, the Times reports.

Reporters at the Times said Tronc and Soon-Shiong are “working furiously to complete the transaction,” in a deal that came together in only five days.

News of the sale comes amid intense upheaval at the Times, where staffers have clashed with management installed by Tronc over the paper’s editorial direction. Last month, journalists at the paper voted to unionize, defying pressure from the publication’s leaders to abandon the effort.

Soon-Shiong, founder and chief executive of the California-based health care firm NantHealth, has previously been critical of Tronc’s leadership, accusing the company of “poor corporate governance” last year. Rumors began circulating last spring that Soon-Shiong might attempt to buy Tronc or the Times in early 2018.

Overall, the response among Times staffers to the news of the reported sale was positive, one reporter in the newsroom tweeted on Tuesday.

Cheers, claps, screams going through the @latimes newsroom as word spreads. — Joel Rubin (@joelrubin) February 6, 2018

Soon-Shiong sits on the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century Council and is a contributing editor for The WorldPost, which had a partnership with HuffPost until last year.

The relationship between Tronc and Times staffers grew particularly rocky in recent weeks. Days after the announcement that the union campaign was successful, sources told HuffPost that Tronc was quietly establishing a network of non-union contributors that amounted a shadow newsroom.

Tronc also owns several other papers, including the Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun and the New York Daily News.

The company rolled out its updated digital growth strategy on Wednesday, with the return of Times CEO Ross Levinsohn as the head of its Times Interactive division. Levinsohn had been placed on unpaid leave last month while Tronc investigated claims of sexual harassment, but the company said it found “no wrongdoing.”

You may have seen a tweet, purportedly from President Donald Trump, that refers to the “Dow Joans” and talks about firing people into the sun with a cannon.

Sadly, we must inform you that it is absolutely a fake.

Shaun Usher, the man behind the Letters Of Note website and book, posted a screenshot of what looked like a textbook Trump tweet on Monday. Featuring unnecessary quotation marks, lots of exclamation marks and random capitalized words, it looked like the real deal.

As stock markets crashed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average suffering their biggest percentage drops since 2011, the purported Trump tweet, dated Feb. 25, 2015, seemed especially timely ― particularly as the president has repeatedly trumpeted stock market gains as an indicator of his administration’s success.

Usher quickly admitted the tweet was a fake, but that didn’t stop it from clocking (at time of publication) more than 13,000 retweets.

Sweet mother of god. Not for one second did I think people would believe that to be genuine. — Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) February 5, 2018

Usher posted his clarification just 15 minutes after his original tweet, but it was too late. His fake Trump tweet rocketed around the internet, with thousands of people seemingly believing that, in 2015, Trump actually floated the possibility of firing sitting presidents into the Earth’s sun with a cannon.

Leaving aside the issue of whether the planet, let alone the United States, actually possesses a weapon of such power to literally propel a living human across the solar system and into the sun, lots of people believed the tweet was real.

Usher started getting worried.

omg it's everywhere. What have I done. — Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) February 5, 2018

siri can i be arrested for making a fake tweet — Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) February 5, 2018

But he also seemed perplexed that people believed the tweet was real.

I put "Dow Joans" ffs — Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) February 5, 2018

Usher later tweeted that The Washington Post and the fact-checking website Snopes had contacted him about the tweet, and sure enough, Snopes soon posted an article titled “Did Trump Tweet in 2015 That the President Should Be Shot Out of a Cannon if the ‘Dow Joans’ Tanks?”

“Naively thought it too ridiculous to be believable. Says a lot, really. Was going to delete it but it was everywhere within minutes: feels like I need to leave it up in its place of birth,” Usher told Snopes.

Many people asking why I haven't taken it down. Literally within minutes of me posting it, it had legs. It was everywhere within about 10mins. I had lost control of it in an instant. Deleting mine--its place of birth--felt wrong & maybe more dangerous? — Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) February 5, 2018Quentin Tarantino says Uma Thurman’s violent car crash on the set of his 2003 film “Kill Bill” was “the biggest regret” of his life.

The actress mentioned the wreck, which she says resulted in permanent damage to her neck and knees, in an interview published Saturday in The New York Times. The article largely focused on Thurman’s sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, but she also discussed her experience with Tarantino filming “Kill Bill,” which was produced by Weinstein’s studio.

Thurman accused Tarantino of forcing her to drive a car she didn’t feel comfortable operating in one shot. After eventually agreeing to do it, she accidentally crashed and had to be taken to a hospital.

Tarantino, in an interview with Deadline published Monday, admitted he pressured Thurman to do the scene. He said he believed at the time that it was “safe.”

“It’s the biggest regret of my life, getting her to do that stunt,” Tarantino told Deadline. “As a director, you learn things and sometimes you learn them through horrendous mistakes. That was one of my most horrendous mistakes, that I didn’t take the time to run the road, one more time, just to see what I would see.”

He continued: “Me and Uma had our issues about the crash. She blamed me for the crash and she had a right to blame me for the crash. I didn’t mean to do it. I talked her into getting in the car, I assured her the road was safe. And it wasn’t.”

Thurman accepts Tarantino’s apology, according to a post she published Monday on Instagram. But she’s still going after Weinstein and his fellow “Kill Bill” producers Lawrence Bender and E. Bennett Walsh, saying they covered up the crash.

A post shared by Uma Thurman (@ithurman) on Feb 5, 2018 at 10:15am PST

“They lied, destroyed evidence, and continue to lie about the permanent harm they caused and then chose to suppress,” Thurman wrote. “The cover up did have malicious intent, and shame on these three for all eternity.”

Thurman told the Times that Miramax, owned by Weinstein at the time, refused to show her footage of the wreck two weeks after it happened unless she signed a document “releasing them of any consequences of [her] future pain and suffering.”

“Something else Uma was misunderstood about [in the Times’ article], and I don’t think she realized it until last night while we were talking, was she feels that a whole cover-up happened,” Tarantino told Deadline. “She feels it’s very possible the car was destroyed, at Harvey Weinstein’s insistence, and at Bennett Walsh and Lawrence Bender’s execution.”

A spokesperson for Weinstein denied Thurman’s accusations of a cover-up.

“Harvey has tremendous affection for Uma Thurman nevertheless he denies these allegations,” the spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost. “He did not give instructions to destroy the vehicle or orchestrate a cover-up and this is the first time he has learned that Ms. Thurman had any issues regarding the handling of her accident.

“We understand that members of the production team have stated to individuals in the media that Mr. Weinstein had nothing to do with the aftermath of the crash,” the statement continued. “Mr. Weinstein wishes Ms. Thurman would have spoken to him at the time to express her concerns and would like for her to provide any additional details so that he can assist in closing and repairing this chapter of her life.”

Representatives for Bender and Walsh did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Following the Times’ interview with Thurman, many media outlets emphasized her experiences with Tarantino over her allegations against Weinstein. An excerpt about Tarantino choking Thurman and spitting on her while filming “Kill Bill” scenes sparked outrage on the internet. But Tarantino defended his actions, saying he performed those scenes himself because he knew what he wanted as the director.

“For some reason there is a lot of hay being made out of this. Which I don’t understand, at all,” Tarantino told Deadline. “I can explain why I did exactly what I did, but my question is, what’s the fucking problem?”Critics worry the change will force patients to turn to more expensive providers, travel long distances for cheaper care, endure long waits for medical appointments, or forgo care.

By Michael Ollove

In Washington state, a woman in Spokane named Cynthia Harvey bought health insurance from Coordinated Care, in part because the brochure promised a robust roster of physicians and coverage for an array of services, including, if needed, emergency room services.

According to a federal lawsuit, however, Coordinated Care failed to mention that in all of Spokane in 2017, the year in which Harvey was enrolled, there were exactly zero emergency room in-network doctors. That left Harvey with a $1,544 bill from an out-of-network ER doctor.

That same year, Steven Milman, a periodontist in Austin, Texas, enrolled in Superior Health, a health plan owned by the same parent company as Coordinated Care, the Centene Corporation. Milman chose Superior after reading on its website that the Austin Diagnostic Clinic, with its 140 physicians, was in its provider network.

After he was enrolled, according to the lawsuit against Centene, Milman discovered the Austin Diagnostic Clinic had informed Superior months earlier that it was no longer accepting Superior patients. When, after a lengthy delay and repeated entreaties from Milman, Superior finally assigned him a primary care doctor, he found his new physician was an OB/GYN. The doctor didn’t even treat men.

The class action lawsuit filed last month against Centene concerns the issue known as “network provider adequacy.”

The Affordable Care Act required that health insurance plans sold on the marketplaces in every state maintain a sufficient number of in-network hospitals and physicians, including specialists, in their service area — essentially, that they have an adequate network of providers. Policyholders spend less to see doctors in their network.

But the Trump administration last month weakened that federal oversight, potentially forcing patients to turn to more expensive providers, travel long distances for cheaper care, endure long waits for medical appointments or, critics worry, forgo care altogether.

“You want to be sure that the plan you’ve selected really has a robust network of providers for specialists and primary care, that they are accepting new patients, that you can get appointments in a timely way,” said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of the health access initiative at Families USA, which advocates for affordable health care for all.

The rule, published in April and effective since the beginning of this year, reflects the Trump administration’s overall preference for state versus federal regulation. It shifts to states the responsibility for monitoring and enforcing network adequacy. It also doesn’t require states to use federal measures, such as limiting the time and distance patients should be expected to travel to see their providers, to determine network adequacy.

The change affects 28 states that rely on the federal health insurance exchange and 11 states that operate exchanges in some sort of partnership with the federal government. (Twelve states operating their own insurance exchanges already were responsible for determining network sufficiency.)

Officials in some states using the federal exchange say they are capable of reviewing network adequacy without federal help. “Functionally, what we saw in the prior administration was a lot of duplication,” said J.P. Wieske, the deputy insurance commissioner in Wisconsin, one of the states using the federal exchange.

Jessica Altman, the acting insurance commissioner in Pennsylvania, another state that uses the federal exchange, said her state already vigorously enforces network adequacy, though she didn’t object to federal regulation as well. “For us, the federal oversight was a second check, and that’s good to have there.”

Some critics acknowledge that states are better positioned to regulate network adequacy because officials understand the local insurance markets. Still, they worry some states don’t have regulations in place to protect consumers, or the necessary staff to take on the labor-intensive oversight.

“Our concern is that the Trump administration is rolling back a lot of the assurances consumers should be able to rely upon without keeping a minimum of standards that would protect them,” said Betsy Imholz, a health policy expert at Consumers Union, the research and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.

Variation Among States

Many states, even among those that use the federal exchange, have long regulated network adequacy, but they did so to varying degrees. Some only reviewed HMOs. Some examined network adequacy only at the point an insurer first applied for licensing. Some relied on claims made by insurers without further investigation.

But some states do not regulate network adequacy. In that case, under the Trump rule, insurers can seek accreditation from an independent nonprofit approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Critics argue, however, that there is nothing to guarantee that those accreditation agencies have network adequacy standards themselves or seek information beyond what an insurer provides.

“Accreditation is basically self-regulation,” Imholz said.

In any case, in a subsequent release in November, the Trump administration determined that all states are capable of oversight themselves, although the administration does not specify what makes a state capable.

Tennessee is one of those states that says it will rely on accreditation, said Kevin Walters, communications director for the state’s Department of Commerce and Insurance. Tennessee laws on network adequacy apply only to HMOs and not the preferred-provider plans sold on the exchanges. But, Walters said, the state is comfortable with the accreditation method, since that’s how Tennessee oversaw network adequacy in 2014 and 2015, before the Obama administration established standards.

The Affordable Care Act added national standards, such as the limits on the time and distance patients should have to travel to see their providers and the minimum ratio of doctors and specialists to enrollees in a plan. Some also set maximum times that patients should have to wait for appointments and also require that insurers keep their rosters of providers current. States on the federal exchange were free to adopt their own rules, but health plans in those states had to comply with minimum federal thresholds.

Defining ‘Network Adequacy’

Several states, some that operate their own insurance exchanges and some that use the federal exchange, have adopted similar rules.

But, according to a Commonwealth Fund study, as of 2014, 23 states and the District of Columbia had not. Instead, they relied on HHS to determine network adequacy.

In shifting responsibilities, the Trump administration is getting rid of the requirement that states use quantitative measures to evaluate network sufficiency.

And that is what concerns many health policy experts. “Because not all states regulate network adequacy in a clear-cut way, we think the federal floor was necessary and is still needed,” said Sarah Lueck, a senior health policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.

State Knowledge

Some state officials noted that applying the same federal rules to every state created some problems. The Wisconsin Office of the Insurance Commissioner complained to the Obama administration that in one case, it had required an insurance plan to increase its number of providers in an area that turned out to be in the middle of 8,600-acre Lake Butte des Morts.

In another case, it said, HHS failed to appreciate that the Wisconsin River bisected a certain area, which essentially made it impossible for patients on one side of the river to see providers on the other.

“The point is the problem you run into with federal government is that they don’t know the state like we do,” Wieske said. “When you have a federal system, it’s one size fits all ... but often, one size doesn’t fit all.”

A few states already regulate their own network adequacy — some quite aggressively, such as California and Washington, which have their own exchanges.

In December, Washington state fined Coordinated Care $1.5 million and ordered it to stop issuing individual health insurance policies in the state because of inadequate networks. The company agreed to a consent order detailing how it would address its network deficiencies. The lawsuit, involving plaintiffs in multiple states, was filed the next month.

Mike Kreidler, the Washington state insurance commissioner, doubts that many states on the federal exchange are ready to effectively regulate network adequacy now.We always knew golden retrievers were one of the most gentle dog breeds alive, but in case there was any skepticism, this video proves it.

Twitter user LaurDreyfuss, and her aunt, wanted to prove just how delicate and gentle the breed really is. So, her aunt, who is also a vet tech, tested the “soft mouth” theory on the family’s golden retriever, Sookie, using an egg.

In the video, you can see her open Sookie’s mouth and place the egg inside. Though Sookie looks only slightly confused, she doesn’t fuss or bark ― obedience is another one of the breed’s virtues!

my aunt read online that a golden retriever’s mouth is so gentle they can hold an egg in their mouth without cracking it so she tried it on her dog and well pic.twitter.com/6SDyUI3v4j — elizabeth gillies fan account (@Iaurdreyfuss) February 4, 2018

Tail-wagging, Sookie sits with the egg in her mouth for a full minute without so much as a crack to the egg. The video, which has racked up almost 6 million views since it was posted a day ago, on February 4th, shot Sookie to internet stardom.

She even has a Facebook fan page, titled “Will Work For Treats,” in which her owners document her various tricks ― including balancing items on her head.

Goldens are one of the few breeds, including Labrador retrievers, poodles and cocker spaniels, that have a soft-mouths. Because of this quality, golden retrievers are ideal hunting breeds, able to retrieve game without causing any damage.

They also rank high on American Kennel Club’s list of best pets for families due to their intelligence, gentleness and friendliness.Drake might have started from the bottom, but now he’s taking over Miami schools.

Much to the excitement of many students, the rapper visited Miami Senior High School in Florida and University of Miami on Monday to film the music video for his latest hit, “God’s Plan.”

Drake rolled out an enormous crane and soared above the high school’s baseball field, with the madness captured overhead by a drone. Students shared snapshots and videos of the scene on social media:

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. agency responsible for disaster response hired a contractor that failed to deliver millions of emergency meals in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico last year, U.S. Democratic lawmakers said on Tuesday.

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee cited records that showed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded a nearly $156 million contract to a one-person company that delivered just 50,000 of the expected 30 million meals.

The lawmakers said documents showed the company, Atlanta-based Tribute Contracting, had a history of problems handling smaller government contracts worth less than $100,000 and had been barred from government work until 2019.

Representatives for Tribute and its owner, Tiffany Brown, did not respond to requests for comment.

Puerto Rico is struggling to recover from its worst natural disaster in 90 years and the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with some $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt.

Hurricane Maria killed dozens and left Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million U.S. citizens without power when it struck on Sept. 20, along with reducing access to clean water and other essentials. FEMA last month said it would continue to provide water, meals and other basic needs after earlier reports that it was going to halt aid.

The House committee’s announcement follows an earlier controversy involving contractor Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana firm hired to restore the island’s power despite a lack of experience. Governor Ricardo Rossello later canceled that deal.

After winning the October 2017 FEMA contract, Tribute delivered just 50,000 meals to the U.S. territory and was terminated for cause 20 days later, said Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee’s top Democrat.

“It is unclear why FEMA or any agency would have proceeded with a contract worth $156 million in light of this company’s poor contracting history and these explicit warnings,” he wrote, citing documents obtained by panel Democrats.

Cummings and fellow Democrat Stacey Plaskett called on the panel’s Republican chairman, Trey Gowdy, to subpoena FEMA for documents on the company and its alleged failure to deliver millions of meals.

Gowdy’s spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said that sending a subpoena was premature but that the panel would continue to review hurricane recovery efforts.

FEMA said it could not comment on Tribute, but that at the time the contract was terminated food distribution in Puerto Rico “was not affected.”

Agency spokeswoman Jenny Burke said meals continue to be provided on the island and that “there are sufficient commodities both in Puerto Rico and on the mainland to continue to meet identified needs for current or future disasters.”Christie Brinkley says in a new interview that a married Donald Trump once tried to fly her to Aspen, Colorado, in his private jet back in the 1980s.

In an interview published in the fashion magazine Porter, Brinkley said Trump was “out chasing skirts” when he called her at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Trump at the time was still with his first wife, Ivana, and Brinkley was dating musician Billy Joel.

“My phone rings and this guy goes, ‘Hey, Christie, it’s The Donald.’ I say, ‘Hi, Billy,’ because I was dating Billy [Joel] at the time,” the supermodel told Porter, as reported by the Sunday Times.

“But the voice goes, ‘No, no. It’s The Donald!’ So I say, ‘What’s up?’ And he says, ‘I hear you’re leaving for Aspen tomorrow. I am too. I’d like to give you a ride on my private jet.’”

Brinkley said she turned down the offer.

“So I reply, ‘Thank you, but I have already arranged my flights.’ ‘So cancel them!’ was his response, and I say, ‘No, thank you. I’m going with friends,’” the supermodel said. “I knew he was married, and there he was asking me to go on his plane. He was kind of flirty about it. He was out chasing skirts.”

Brinkley also revealed that she’s had dinner with Trump before.

“I’ve always found him smarmy, as in, ’Watch out, part the waves, the rich people are coming, everything is gold, solid 24-carat gold, the best, the greatest, nobody else has more gold on anything in their house than me,” Brinkley said. ”‘Did you bring a brush? Let’s gold-leaf it!’”

Brinkley revealed the story now because, as she told the magazine, “I’m done being discreet.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted sharp gains in another wild trading session on Tuesday, as indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&P 500 and the Dow in more than six years that stalled the market’s record run.

Stocks swung from negative to positive after indexes started the session 2 percent lower, underscoring a return of volatility to a market that until recently was marked by an absence of major shifts. The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday.

The sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent.

“Despite violent moves in the last couple days in the market, fundamentals in the economy are very strong and it’s not just the U.S., it’s throughout the global economy,” said Alicia Levine, head of global investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 567.02 points, or 2.33 percent, to 24,912.77, the S&P 500 gained 46.2 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,695.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 148.36 points, or 2.13 percent, to 7,115.88.

Technology, materials and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors on Tuesday. Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&P groups to end negative.Actor Alex Winter, left, as Bill in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," had a laugh on Twitter with former White House ethics chief Walter Shaub (right).

As far as Twitter feuds go, this one was most excellent.

Walter Shaub, the former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, tried to draw a real-life parallel between the Trump administration and the film “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.” It didn’t go as expected.

Shaub, who served under President Barack Obama and for six months under President Donald Trump, was replying to a tweet from investor/Kremlin critic Bill Browder about former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus:

Pretty shocking. Former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus tells NBC he “never heard of Majinsky Act” as he goes all in on ‘adoption’ narrative on the Veselnitskaya/Trump Jr meeting. Go to minute 5:23 in video https://t.co/GIp6yrS2Wk — Bill Browder (@Billbrowder) February 4, 2018

Shaub told Browder that the conversation brought another Bill to mind:

When Priebus pronounced Magnitsky as "majinsky" it solidified once and for all my long-held impression that Priebus is like that other famous Bill, the one from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure." And remember, folks, Priebus was the smart one in our clown car of a White House https://t.co/dwkloFJvRd — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) February 4, 2018

Shaub’s tweet drew a response from Alex Winter, the actor and filmmaker best known for his excellent portrayal of “that other famous Bill” in the 1989 film and its 1991 sequel:

Shaub quickly apologized for being bogus, heinous and most non-triumphant:

Omigosh! I am, at the same time, both laughing to the point of tears and feeling horrible. I have never felt more sorry in all of my Twitter adventures. I loved you in that movie. Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry. Soooooooo sorry. A thousand times sorry. — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) February 6, 2018

It's all fun and games until you hurt Bill of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Shaub is going to give himself a stern talking to. https://t.co/ldVn63FKSq — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) February 6, 2018

Winter, for his part, reassured Shaub that all was still excellent between them.

Hah, no offense taken of course. https://t.co/F3HswKQdNT — Alex Winter (@alxwinter) February 6, 2018

Shaub seemed relieved:

Excellent, your most excellent Excellency, sir! — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) February 6, 2018Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio recently teamed up for their most important role of all ― benefactors for a cancer patient who couldn’t afford her treatment.

Gemma Nuttall and her mother appeared Monday on the British show “This Morning,” where they talked about how Winslet learned of Nuttall’s battle and how the actress helped save her.

Nuttall was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer at the same time she found out she was 16 weeks’ pregnant. After a cesarean section at 36 weeks brought baby Penelope into the world, the new mom began six months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, according to her GoFundMe page. Then she learned she had brain and lung cancer as well. The prognosis wasn’t good, and doctors told her to make a will and provisions for her daughter.

“After what seemed like a unbelievably long and exhausting battle we were told by the doctors here in the UK that nothing more could be done for her,” Helen Sproates, Nuttall’s mom, wrote on the GoFundMe page. “She was put on palliative care and we were told she had just a few months to live.”

But after doing some research, Sproates located a clinic in Germany that offered immunotherapy, a treatment method that uses the body’s own immune system to help fight cancer. Unfortunately, each treatment cost nearly $98,000 ― and Nuttall needed six.

Fortunately, Kate Winslet came across Nuttall’s story last year while researching clinics in Germany for her own mother, who was suffering from ovarian cancer.

“My heart sank,” Winslet said when she phoned in to “This Morning” as a surprise for Nuttall. “I saw how much money she needed to raise ... and I just thought I can’t have this happen.”

“My own mother was very, very unwell, and I just thought my mum would be incredibly proud if I could do this for somebody else,” the actress said as her voice broke. Winslet’s mother died in May of last year.

So she teamed up with Nuttall’s mom to raise funds, and eventually she called in DiCaprio, her close friend and former co-star.

“I phoned Leo and I said, ‘Do you think we could do a charity dinner or something?’” Winslet told People magazine. “And he said, ‘Let’s go one better. Come with me to St. Tropez, to my big fundraiser for the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation,’ which is back in July, ‘and we will auction off a dinner with Jack and Rose.’”

The “Titanic” stars auctioned off three dinners with themselves and raised over $1.35 million for treatment, according to People.

Nuttall, who spoke to Winslet directly for the first time on Monday’s show, told the actress that she couldn’t be more grateful for her help.

“I just want to say thank you so much for all your hard work and [helping] me being able to have my treatment that I really did need,” Nuttall said before she began crying. “You saved my life and I just want you to know that.”

Though the initial round of treatment was a success, Nuttall isn’t totally out of the woods yet.

“Gemma needs further urgent specialist cancer treatment in Germany. Without it, she will die,” Winslet said in a statement provided to Us Weekly on Monday. “We are all so thrilled that we were able to send Gemma off to the Hallwang for her first round of treatment. I will continue to assist with her costs, but we do still badly need your donations.”Students in Santa Barbara return to classes at a new campus after their school was closed following mudslides.

California schools ravaged by fire, floods and mud this year have mostly re-opened and are diving in to a new semester, but district leaders say they’ve learned some crucial lessons about handling natural disasters that all schools could benefit from.

“A disaster could happen anywhere at any time in California,” said Steven Herrington, superintendent of the Sonoma County Office of Education, where two public schools were destroyed, nearly a dozen schools were damaged and hundreds of students and staff lost their homes. “We all have emergency plans. For us, overall, things went pretty smoothly. But nothing can really prepare you for a major disaster like what we experienced.”

California suffered a historic wildfire season in 2017, and began 2018 with devastating mudslides in Santa Barbara County. In October, fires ripped through Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties in the Wine Country, killing 44 and destroying thousands of buildings; in early December, a swarm of fires scorched Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties in Southern California (one of the fires, the Thomas Fire, was the largest wildfire in state history). On Jan. 9, mudslides and floods swept through Montecito in Santa Barbara County, killing 21 and destroying 115 homes.

School leaders in those areas say they had very little notice of the impending disasters and had to troubleshoot an enormous, and often shifting, set of variables under highly stressful circumstances — in some cases as their own families and homes were imperiled. Herrington’s wife, for example, was undergoing cancer treatment at a local hospital when the fires erupted.

The immediate priority was the safety of students and staff, but the weeks following the disasters were spent assessing damage to school buildings, finding alternative campuses, arranging repairs, handling claims paperwork, tending to students’ emotional well-being and trying to predict enrollment figures as hundreds of students and staff suddenly became homeless.

Meanwhile, some students missed weeks of instruction due to closed schools — meaning the school year will extend later into the summer, breaks will be canceled and students will need waivers for college applications, advanced placement tests and standardized exams.

“It took Lake County schools two years to recover from their fire (in 2015). We anticipate the same here,” Herrington said. “But I think overall, people here are very optimistic. We’re really trying to keep positive and deal with each challenge as it comes along.”

The California Department of Education allows schools to continue receiving their usual per-pupil funding in cases of natural disasters, and provides extensive resources to help schools cope with the array of challenges. In addition, the federal McKinney-Vento Act provides rights to homeless students — including those who lost their homes in disasters — such as the right to continue attending their original school regardless of where they’re living.

In Ventura County, County Superintendent Stan Mantooth said that even though local schools had done regular emergency drills, nothing could prepare students and staff for the fire that tore through their picturesque, coastal county in early December.

“It was absolutely surreal,” he said. “We thought we were going to be OK but then the wind shifted and we suddenly had a wall of smoke coming at us, like a fog bank. You see things like this on TV but it’s not the same when you’re right there, looking at a whole mountain on fire.”

Ventura County did not lose any schools, but flames came within feet of some campuses, and many schools suffered severe smoke damage. In Ventura Unified, 100 fewer students showed up for school after the fires. In Santa Paula, in the rural central part of the county, a mobile home park across from Briggs Elementary burned to the ground, displacing dozens of mostly immigrant families.

“We’re still in recovery mode,” Mantooth said, noting that he sometimes imagines he smells smoke, long after the fires have extinguished. “I’ll be walking around and suddenly smell a campfire — I don’t think it’s real, but the mental residue is very much still there.”

In Santa Barbara County, the fires and mudslides are among the worst disasters in county history. Nineteen of the county’s 20 school districts were closed in early December due to poor air quality and fire damage, and a month later two schools closed again due to the mudslides.

Emotions have ranged from fear and frustration to relief and exuberance — especially when children, parents and teachers reunited following a school closure, said county Office of Education spokesman David Lawrence.

“There are stories of incredible heroism — what the first responders encountered and what residents experienced was just extraordinary. And to see the excitement of kids when they get back together, that’s an emotional and heart-warming thing,” he said. “But some people are still shaken … Given the gravity of what happened, one thing we’re watching closely is ‘invisible’ injuries — emotional reactions that aren’t immediately obvious.”

Herrington’s office has shared what they learned with their counterparts in Southern California, as well as the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at the University of Southern California.

Researchers there study school disasters nationwide, from hurricanes to mass shootings to terrorist attacks, and have compiled resources for schools and students who might be experiencing grief.

Dr. David Schonfeld, the center’s director, said that during disasters schools can become an important center of the community, especially for immigrant families.

“In this political climate, a lot of immigrant families are extremely reluctant to seek services from government agencies, but they trust their child’s teacher, or principal, so school is the only place they’ll go,” he said.

School might also be the only source of stability in a child’s life for a while, he said.

Here’s a summary of advice from Schonfeld and the superintendents in Sonoma, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties:

Have a communication plan. With phones and the Internet only operating sporadically, Sonoma County leaders did not have a consistent way to reach staff and families. They ended up relying on texts, web postings and email.

Look for signs of trauma among students not just immediately after the disaster, but in the months ahead. Students might appear fine for weeks, then begin showing signs of stress long after the crisis has passed. “You can only live out of a suitcase for so long before you start acting out,” Herrington said.

Students who lost homes won’t be the only ones affected by the disaster. Children whose families are hosting displaced people, or who have parents who lost their jobs or saw their income drop, will also be impacted. Plus, some students will be experiencing crises that aren’t related to the disaster at all. For example, a child who lost a grandparent might get some special attention at school ordinarily, but during a disaster is forgotten. “Teachers should tell their students, ‘We’re here to help you for anything that’s causing you stress,’ ” Schonfeld said.

Help parents find care for their kids when schools are closed. For parents who work, a closed school could mean a day without pay. Some schools arranged family childcare cooperatives, or worked with local recreation centers to offer day care.

When in doubt, err on the side of caution. “If you’re contemplating whether to close schools, always pull that trigger,” Mantooth said. “The decisions are not difficult when you’re putting kids’ safety first.”

Prepare for an influx of donations. Receiving gifts from the public, local businesses, nonprofits and corporations, and deciding the best way to use those gifts is a full-time job.

Have a backup plan for payroll in case computers go down. “In the middle of all this we had to get payroll out and distribute checks,” Herrington said. “Many of the people who needed their checks the most were displaced.”

When schools re-open, take things slow. Those who’ve experienced a disaster will be hesitant to embrace major changes, at least for a while. “This is not the time to introduce new computer software,” Schonfeld said.

School leaders should prepare for some backlash. “It’s very difficult to lead in the aftermath of a disaster,” Schonfeld said. “No matter what you do, you’re not going to make things OK for everyone. People will get upset and they might take it out on you.” He advised school leaders to collaborate and make decisions as a group, be transparent about their decisions and communicate often with families and staff.

Take time to rest, eat and support your colleagues. “You’re so busy doing your job, sometimes you forget to check in with each other,” Herrington said. “That’s important.”jakkapan21 via Getty Images

Say what you will about 2018, but it hasn’t exactly brought a surfeit of slow news days. January alone felt like it delivered a year’s worth of big stories, from a spate of congressional retirements to the debate over “shithole countries” to the brief government shutdown.

Nearly half of the people who try to stay informed about politics find it stressful to stay on top of what’s happening, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, but far fewer say they have difficulty keeping up.

Among Americans who try follow political events ― a group that makes up slightly less than two-thirds of the population, according to the survey ― 49 percent say it’s at least somewhat stressful to keep tabs on what’s going on. An equal share say that it’s not very or not at all stressful.

Just 27 percent, however, say they feel like the political news is changing so quickly that they can’t keep up, while 64 percent say they don’t have any problem staying on top of things. The vast majority, 83 percent, say that it’s at least somewhat easy for them to follow what’s happening in politics.

These results come with a few caveats: For one, the results don’t include those Americans who have opted out of following politics altogether. For another, respondents may think it’s socially desirable to claim that they’re effortlessly well-informed.

But the results also show little consensus that the current news environment poses any sort of unique challenge. Fewer than a quarter say it’s been harder to keep up with the news so far this year than it had been in past years. An additional 28 percent say it’s easier, while the remaining 49 percent say that they haven’t noticed much difference or that they aren’t sure.

There are some divides along political lines, especially on the stressfulness of current events. Most voters who try to keep up with politics say they don’t have any problem doing so, regardless of whether they backed President Donald Trump or Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in 2016’s election. But 72 percent of those Clinton voters say they find following politics to be stressful, while just 3 in 10 Trump voters feel the same.

The overall results of the poll are similar to those of a HuffPost/YouGov survey taken last March, which also found that just 30 percent of respondents who say they generally try to stay informed have difficulty doing so.

The constant flow of news may actually make current events feel more accessible than ever, Ann Crigler, a political science professor at the University of South California, told HuffPost last year.

“While it may seem like it’s overwhelming and confusing, people tend to choose what they rely on,” Crigler said.

Goodbye, dragons. Hello, droids.

David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators of “Game of Thrones,” are going to write and produce a “Star Wars” film series, StarWars.com announced Tuesday.

The series will take place in a galaxy far, far away, but will not be tied to the trilogy being developed by “The Last Jedi” filmmaker Rian Johnson or the episodic Skywalker saga.

“David and Dan are some of the best storytellers working today,” Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said in the announcement. “Their command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology will break new ground and boldly push Star Wars in ways I find incredibly exciting.”

“In the summer of 1977 we traveled to a galaxy far, far away, and we’ve been dreaming of it ever since,” Benioff and Weiss said in a joint statement. “We are honored by the opportunity, a little terrified by the responsibility, and so excited to get started as soon as the final season of Game of Thrones is complete.”

Though some may be excited about the news, people on Twitter were a bit skeptical.

"David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are some of the best storytellers working today,”

Many fans were concerned that tropes from the popular HBO show, such as incest and rape, would seep into the “Star Wars” universe.

In July, HBO also announced that Benioff and Weiss were going to work on its upcoming Civil War drama “Confederate,” a show whose premise immediately sparked criticism. This prompted others on Twitter to question the decision to have them write and produce the new “Star Wars” series.

IGER: Picture this! David Benioff and D.B. Weiss... directing Star Wars.

KATHLEEN: The guys from Game of Thrones? The “sexual assault = character development” guys?

IGER: Yes

KATHLEEN: The guys who thought “Confederate” was a good idea

IGER: YES

OK, look: clearly no one wants a Benioff & Weiss Star Wars, but I'll take it if that's the price for never hearing about Confederate again. — Abigail Nussbaum (@NussbaumAbigail) February 6, 2018

Some Twitter users were disappointed that a woman or a person of color wasn’t chosen for the role, especially since Kennedy has mentioned in the past that she would like to see a woman direct a “Star Wars” movie (though the announcement did not say whether Benioff and Weiss would direct the series they will create).
