But a pre-wedding broadcast is probable, given that Lifetime’s previous TV movie about the love story of Prince William, Harry’s brother, and Kate Middleton aired 11 days before they tied the knot in 2011.Selena Gomez’s mother and former manager, Mandy Teefey, is “not happy” the singer has recently rekindled her romance with Justin Bieber, Teefey told celebrity site Gossip Cop.

Gossip Cop is known for debunking celebrity rumors. The site reached out to Teefey to debunk recent stories about the mother and daughter, it said in a piece published Saturday.

“Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy,” Teefey said of Gomez’s relationship, adding that she hasn’t had any communication with Bieber in years. “She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed.”

Reps for Gomez and Teefey did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment on the Gossip Cop interview.

Gomez and her mother recently made headlines after unfollowing each other on Instagram in December. At the time, the two also reportedly stopped speaking to each other, though a source told People it wasn’t just because of Gomez’s reconciliation with Bieber.

Bieber and Gomez reunited in October, just after the 25-year-old “Wolves” singer ended her relationship with The Weeknd. Previously, Bieber and Gomez had an on-again, off-again relationship from 2011 to 2015.

In a candid interview with Billboard, Gomez explained why she’d gotten back together with the 23-year-old singer.A mother in Fargo, North Dakota, got a rude reception from a Chick-fil-A restaurant when she attempted to breastfeed her daughter.

Macy Hornung said she and her family were at a soft opening of a new franchise on Friday when she had to feed her 7-month-old.

“As is par for the course with breastfed babies, my daughter wanted to nurse. I have nursed her, and previously my son, in several restaurants in the FM area without any issues, so I did my usual turn away to latch her as discreetly as possible,” Hornung told ValleyNewsLive.com. “She had been nursing for a few minutes and was falling asleep when the owner of [the Chick-fil-A franchise], Kimberly Flamm, approached me and asked me to cover.”

Hornung said she tried to explain that her daughter doesn’t like to have her head covered and would flail and scream if she did that.

“It causes even more frustration and a very angry baby, so it isn’t worth it to me,” she said. “The top of my breast was exposed, but no more than what is visible in a bathing suit.”

Flamm reportedly told Hornung she needed to cover herself because children were present. Hornung said she responded by citing North Dakota laws allowing for public breastfeeding.

When that didn’t sway Flamm, Hornung went home with her husband and two kids. She posted about the incident on Facebook on Saturday, and her story has since been shared more than 1,100 times.

Hornung later shared a statement of apology from Flamm:

“My goal is to provide a warm and welcoming environment for all of my guests and I sincerely apologize for the way I handled this situation.”NEW YORK ― Almost a year ago, millions of women donning pink-knitted “pussy hats” made the 2017 Women’s March the largest single-day protest in American history. This weekend, the event returns with the aim of re-energizing the resistance against Donald Trump’s agenda and registering new voters across the country.

“This year we’ve rallied, we’ve marched, we’ve held town halls, we’ve huddled, we’ve written postcards, and we’ve run for office in bigger numbers than before,” Bob Bland, a co-founder of the original march, told HuffPost. “All of it was culminating in this moment, which is the anniversary of the Women’s March, where we convert our collective power that we all felt last year on January 21st into a groundswell of political power.”

The main event for the 2018 Women’s March, themed “Power to the Polls,” will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday, Jan. 21. The organizers chose Nevada because it’s a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm elections, and because the city “was rocked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history” this year, according to the Women’s March website.

The Las Vegas kickoff event, held at Sam Boyd Stadium at 10 a.m., will feature singer Faith Evans and speakers such as Melissa Harris-Perry and actress Marisa Tomei, along with activists from organizations including Planned Parenthood and Black Lives Matter. It will be streamed live on the event website for those who can’t make it.

Elsewhere in the country and in several cities around the world, more than 250 anniversary marches and events are planned for Saturday, Jan. 20. The official Women’s March website has a searchable directory of them by zip code.

The Washington, D.C., and New York City marches are expected to be the largest. The D.C. march begins at 11 a.m. at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial. In New York, a pre-march rally will take place at Central Park West and 61st/62nd Streets at 11:30 a.m., with the march following at 12:30 p.m. from Central Park West and 72nd Street. More information is on the event’s Facebook page.

“We are the leaders we’ve been waiting for. Now’s the time to step up.” - A co-founder of the original Women's March

Following the anniversary events, the founders of the Women’s March will start a national tour of 10 swing states to motivate citizens into political action. They’ll partner with local progressive groups in each place to host town halls, candidate trainings, rallies and voter registration events ahead of the next wave of elections.

The march now has state coordinators across 35 states, as well as 5,500 local groups called “huddles” across all 50 states with the goal of keeping the momentum of resistance going year-round.

“The whole point of the women’s march is for women to take agency over their own lives,” Bland said. “We are the leaders we’ve been waiting for. Now’s the time to step up.”“In September of last year, I met a woman at a party. We exchanged numbers. We texted back and forth and eventually went on a date. We went out to dinner, and afterwards we ended up engaging in sexual activity, which by all indications was completely consensual.

“The next day, I got a text from her saying that although ‘it may have seemed okay,’ upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable. It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned. I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.

WASHINGTON ― Last week, a story by The Hill’s John Solomon set off another firestorm in the conservative media about the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The article, which was linked to by The Drudge Report and aggregated by sites across the right-wing internet before being prominently featured on Sean Hannity’s Fox show, fit nicely into a theory about the FBI that some members of Congress and President Donald Trump have been pushing to undermine Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

Stay with us, because this gets a bit bizarre. The theory Trump and others have been pushing insinuates that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two current FBI employees who were having an affair, were at the heart of an FBI conspiracy against Trump during the 2016 election campaign. Adherents of this theory believe that the couple’s 2016 texts criticizing Trump ― which were recovered from their government cellphones, provided to Congress and shared with some reporters ― prove they were out to get the then-candidate.

This doesn’t make a lot of sense on its face. Most of the information that came out of the bureau during the election was damaging to Hillary Clinton, not Trump. And Page, an FBI lawyer, and Strzok, a top counterintelligence agent who was removed from Mueller’s probe in July, exchanged texts slamming politicians and officials of all ideological stripes, not just Trump.

But the idea that Strzok and Page were secretly working against Trump during the 2016 campaign has spread like a rumor in a middle school anyway. And since early last month, critics of the special counsel investigation have cited the couple’s texts to suggest that the special counsel probe was compromised or should be shut down.

The president tweeted about the agents last month. And in an interview on Thursday, Trump even made an extraordinary (and unfounded) accusation: that Strzok’s texts amounted to treason.

Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE” Now it all starts to make sense! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2017

So when Solomon — a longtime Washington journalist and frequent guest on Hannity’s program — reported last week that Congress was looking into whether Strzok and Page had leaked to the news media, those working to undermine the Mueller probe lapped it up.

Solomon’s Tuesday report appeared to show that Strzok and Page had advance knowledge of an Oct. 24, 2016 Wall Street Journal article. He didn’t identify the Wall Street Journal article in question, and it is not clear whether he knew which piece triggered the couple’s texts. Although Solomon never wrote that Strzok and Page were definitively behind any anti-Trump leaks, the news that Congress was investigating them and that they had advance knowledge of an article was enough for pundits in the conservative media to jump to conclusions.

The Hill report was used as fodder for a narrative that Trump-hating FBI agents had leaked information to hurt the then-Republican candidate. Front Page Mag and One America News used sensational headlines, referencing “Hillary’s FBI allies” and the “deep state’s” efforts to undermine Trump. Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that “Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are two of the deep state sources planting lies and false stories in the Wall Street Journal and other places.”

What HuffPost Found

HuffPost’s investigation found a big problem with all of this: There’s just no evidence that Page and Strzok were leaking information to undermine Trump. It’s clear that neither were fans of the then-candidate, but there’s nothing wrong or illegal about FBI employees privately discussing their political views.

Yes, the couple’s text messages, which HuffPost reviewed, do suggest that Page, at least, may have spoken to reporters. But they offer no information about whether those conversations with reporters were authorized within the bureau, as such conversations can be. And to the extent the messages suggest Page may have been speaking to reporters, they don’t suggest that those conversations damaged, or were intended to damage, Trump.

Three key facts about the agents’ text messages cast serious doubt on the idea that Strzok and Page were anti-Trump leakers:

The Oct. 24, 2016, story that Strzok and Page discussed soon after it posted was damaging to Clinton and the FBI, not Trump. If Strzok and Page had leaked it (and there’s no good evidence they did), that fact would undermine the entire premise of the Republican attacks on them.

They expressed dismay at the fallout from the Oct. 24 Journal article.

They exchanged texts critical of unauthorized leaks from within the FBI and within the Justice Department.

Solomon told HuffPost he was not authorized to speak and does not comment on his reporting. He may simply have been unaware of these three facts when he published his story. But they provide crucial context to an incomplete narrative that has been bouncing around the right-wing echo chamber all week. Taken as a whole, Strzok and Page’s text messages don’t indicate a partisan political effort to undermine Trump — they paint a picture of two people whose chief ideological commitment was to the power and independence of the FBI, not any particular politicians.

The story Strzok and Page knew about in advance hurt Clinton, not Trump

The subject of the article Strzok and Page were discussing in their text messages is important. Both FBI employees had knowledge of federal investigations surrounding both Clinton and Trump. If they really wanted to harm the Trump campaign, they had a readily available option: They could leak facts about the FBI’s investigation into, as Strzok wrote in one text, the “PERVASIVE CONNECTIONS” between the Trump campaign and Russia. At the time, the bureau hadn’t publicly acknowledged an investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia, and stories published around that time cast doubt on whether the FBI would turn up anything significant.

But the Wall Street Journal article Strzok and Page discussed that night wasn’t about Russia, or damaging to Trump. Exactly the opposite: the article raised the suggestion that the FBI was going too easy on Clinton in its investigation of her use of a private email server.

Although The Hill did not specify which Oct. 24 article the congressional investigators were referencing, the timing and content of Strzok and Page’s texts, combined with internal FBI emails released last year, point to one story in particular: “Clinton Ally Aided Campaign of FBI Official’s Wife,” published on the Journal’s website the evening before. Multiple sources familiar with the story and the texts confirmed this is, in fact, the story the couple was discussing.

The article suggested that Strzok and Page’s boss, FBI Deputy director Andrew McCabe, had a conflict of interest in handling the investigation into Clinton’s emails because McCabe’s wife had previously run for a state legislative seat in Virginia as a Democrat and had taken campaign money from groups associated with Virginia’s then-governor, Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally. (FBI documents released last week showed that McCabe followed bureau recusal rules and had no role in the Russia investigation until months after his wife lost her race.)

Strzok and Page started texting soon after the story went up.

“Article is out, but hidden behind paywall so can’t read it,” Page texted that evening.

“Wsj? Boy, that was fast?...” Strzok responded. Here’s the full exchange in question, as reproduced by HuffPost:

HuffPost

How Strzok and Page knew about the story in advance

The mere fact that Strzok and Page seemed to know about the Journal story in advance does not prove they leaked it (or explain why, if they are such liberals, they would leak a story that suggested their boss was mishandling the investigation into Trump’s opponent because he is married to a Democrat). Reporters almost always reach out to the FBI press shop to seek a comment or give a heads up about a story they’re working on or about to publish. Word can spread fast, especially among plugged-in officials in Washington. If a major newspaper is about to publish a damaging report about your boss, it’s reasonable to assume you might have heard something.

In this case, we know for a fact that a large number of officials within the FBI knew the WSJ story was coming before it appeared online and that they had been working to shape the story. Internal FBI emails disclosed late last year in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request showed that hours before the story published, the head of the FBI’s press shop told McCabe he’d talk with the reporter on background. “If [the reporter] is actually pushing to get this out today (which may be bs) we need you to contact him asap,” McCabe wrote earlier in the day on Sunday, before the story was published.

When the story was posted, one unnamed FBI official wrote that they were “appalled” by a piece they contended left out key facts. “Sucks pretty much. Buckle in,” McCabe wrote at 8:33 p.m. that evening, after reading the piece. “It’s going to get rough.” FBI officials quickly organized a set of talking points to respond to future inquires on the story.

In the texts, Strzok says he wants to send the story to “the team” that night instead of waiting until the next morning ― he doesn’t want to “sit” on it and “let them hear from someone else.” Page, who worked closely with McCabe, wants him to hold off. They fight. “WHAT THE F DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO ANYONE ON THE TEAM?” Page writes. “Is there some investigative stop to take? Some mitigation measure?”

Early the next morning, McCabe himself sent the story to several officials, writing that he wanted them to “see it from me first” and apologizing for any stress it may cause them. The officials in the bureau appeared to have his back. “Hang in there, we are all behind you!” one person wrote in response.

How Strzok and Page reacted to the story — and what really leaked

There’s an even better reason to believe Strzok and Page didn’t leak the McCabe article: They were mad about its fallout. A few days after the Oct. 24 texts, Strzok messaged Page again — to complain about a very similar article in another newspaper.

“Hit piece on Andy from VA GOP in Hampton newspaper,” Strzok wrote to Page on Oct. 26, a probable reference to a Virginian-Pilot follow-up to the Journal story. “That sucks,” Page replied minutes later.

There’s more context to consider, too. The world was a different place when Strzok and Page exchanged their texts. The bureau was in a defense posture, absorbing criticism about its handling of the Clinton probe from both Democrats and Republicans. At the time, most people — including people at the top levels of the FBI — believed that Clinton would win the 2016 election, but anticipated that Republicans in Congress would be scrutinizing the Clinton probe for years. A few months earlier, then-FBI director James Comey — in a speech Strzok helped edit — had taken the unusual step of announcing the outcome of a FBI investigation into Clinton. And the Wall Street Journal story on McCabe came out several days before Comey informed Congress that the FBI had discovered emails that may be pertinent to that Clinton investigation, which set off another political firestorm Clinton has since partially blamed for her loss.

Both Strzok and Page were clearly frustrated by articles critical of Comey that were most likely originating from disgruntled agents in the FBI’s New York field office. Strzok said in one message that he got “really angry” reading an Oct. 6 New York Post report alleging that FBI agents were “ready to revolt over the cozy Clinton probe,” which he said illustrated there “are a bunch of really ignorant people out there blinded by their politics.” In a separate exchange in November, Strzok said one former FBI official who was criticizing Comey was getting “incorrect information” from “agents who don’t know about things.”

There’s some evidence in the texts that suggests that Page, at least, might’ve talked to a reporter. But they don’t tell us whether those interactions were sanctioned with the FBI or whether any information was improperly disclosed. In one exchange just before the election, she recounts talking to the FBI’s chief of staff about a Washington Post story on the Clinton investigation. “Time line article in the post [sic] is super specific and not good,” she wrote. “Doesn’t make sense because I didn’t have specific information to give.”

Another exchange may indicate she participated in an article that reflected poorly on Democrats, not Trump. On Oct. 29, 2016, not long before the election, the two FBI employees exchanged a series of texts about a Washington Post article they considered anti-FBI. The Washington Post article, “Justice officials warned FBI that Comey’s decision to update Congress was not consistent with department policy,” suggested that Comey went rogue when he told Congress that investigators were looking into emails found on former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop in the course of a separate investigation. The Post story “was all” one person (whom HuffPost has identified as a now-former senior official in the Justice Department), Strzok speculated in a text to Page. “The whole tone is anti-Bu,” he added, in a reference to the FBI. “Just a tiny bit from us.”

The reply to that text is where we see the most evidence that either of them interacted with a reporter: “Makes me feel WAY less bad about throwing him under the bus in the forthcoming CF article,” Page replied, referring to that same Justice Department official.

The next day, The Wall Street Journal ran an explosive story about what FBI officials saw as attempts by senior political appointees in the Justice Department to rein in the FBI’s investigation into one particularly prominent “CF”: the Clinton Foundation.

That story and follow-up coverage in other outlets added to the perception that Clinton allies in the Justice Department had tried, perhaps unethically, to stop the FBI’s probe in order to help Clinton. Specifically, The Wall Street Journal reported that an unnamed senior Justice Department official had called the FBI in August 2016 to ask why it was still investigating the foundation during election season. The senior Justice Department official, one source “close to McCabe” told the Journal, had been “very pissed off.”Michael Buckner/BMA2015 via Getty Images Kylie Jenner, the selfie queen.

Have you ever wondered why your face looks just a little different in photos than it does reflected in the mirror?

Whether you’re examining selfies or photos taken by others, there’s always something a bit off about your appearance in pictures.

The mystery hit me when I was at home one day overanalyzing my face in the mirror and deciding that I looked good enough for a selfie. I probably took about 25 photos and I hated almost every single one. All of a sudden, my nose seemed to be 10 times more crooked than normal, and it was all I could focus on. But I still looked fine in the mirror, which left me wondering why my face didn’t quite translate into my phone.

As it happens, there are a few explanations for this.

A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Aug 18, 2015 at 12:32pm PDT

We Expect The Mirror Image

One major factor is that photos generally show us the reverse of what we see in the mirror. When you take a photo of yourself using some (but not all) apps or the front-facing camera on an iPhone, the resulting image captures your face as others see it. The same is true for non-phone cameras.

As Nolan Feeney explained in a 2014 Atlantic article, seeing ourselves in reverse can be a little weird, partly because our faces aren’t perfectly symmetrical. Certain features or distinctive marks don’t line up in photos the same way they do in the mirror, and that can throw us off. To return to my anecdote, I rarely notice the slant in my nose when I look in the mirror, but in photos, the slant goes the opposite direction, so it’s always the first thing I see.

“People have grown up [looking] in the mirror and that’s what they believe everybody sees, when it’s the reverse of that, which is really weird,” said Jay Perry, a Canadian photographer based in Hamilton, Ontario. “Mirrors are kind of lies.”

We Like Our Familiar Faces

We’re most familiar with our faces as we see them in the mirror and thus come to prefer that mirror image, according to the mere exposure theory, which states that repeatedly encountering something makes us like it more.

“Looking at yourself in the mirror becomes a firm impression. You have that familiarity. Familiarity breeds liking. You’ve established a preference for that look of your face,” Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, told The Atlantic back in 2014.

New York-based photographer Michael Levy expanded on Rutledge’s point for HuffPost, noting that when we gaze in the mirror, we tend to gaze at what we consider our good side ― that is, the angle that seems most attractive to us.

“When you’re looking in the mirror, you are subconsciously turning your face, usually, to a certain angle that to you is most optimal,” said Levy. “It attracts you to yourself.”

Of course, when we see our faces in the mirror, we’re also looking at ourselves in motion as opposed to completely still, as Perry pointed out.

“You can pick so much more detail out in a still photo,” Perry said. In real life, “you’re moving constantly, you’re blurred, you’re not focusing on every single pore because you can’t.”

You also can’t zoom in to your face in the mirror the same way you can in a digital photo. (Magnifying mirrors are pretty good at putting your self-perceived imperfections on full display, but they’re not quite the same.)

Ji Sub Jeong/HuffPost

It Can Be Technical, Too

Different camera lenses can change the way people look in photos. For example, Perry said that if someone wanted to look slimmer, he would choose a longer lens because “the shorter the lens, the wider it’s going to make your face.”

A person’s proximity to the camera also comes into play. Features that are closest to the lens are going to be emphasized in the photo ― like noses. And when we take selfies, we’re generally closer to the camera than we would be if someone else were taking our photo.

At the end of the day, though, the way we appear in photos is the way we look to the rest of the world. And that’s not a bad thing. In fact, studies have shown that other people generally like the version of you they see, as opposed to the image of yourself you see.

If you took a look at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night, you might think it was a real shithole.

An artist with a video projector gave the Trump family’s D.C. hotel a makeover using President Donald Trump’s very own and very racist words.

“This place is a shithole” was projected onto the front steps of the hotel, in an apparent nod to reports that Trump called Haiti and African nations “shithole countries.”

The projection also displayed the word “shithole” and a stream of poop smiley-face emojis (💩).

As seen in a Periscope livestream, a longer message mocked Trump and his supporters and called for others to stand against white supremacy.

“This is not normal,” a segment of the display read, along with messages to “stay vigilant” and “#resist.”

“The president distracts us from politics that are harming us,” the projection read later in the video.

The display was the work of artist Robin Bell, the founder of video projection company Bell Visuals.

Bell has made news headlines in the past for projecting various messages on buildings with political ties. In May, Bell projected on the same D.C. hotel “emoluments welcome” and “pay Trump bribes here.” (Both of those messages also appear in the most recent projection.) That same month, Bell projected “#SessionsMustGo” and “I thought the KKK was OK until I learned that they smoked pot” on the Department of Justice building, in reference to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Trump incited outrage this week over his reported remark, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” ― which he asked after lawmakers suggested granting visas to individuals from Haiti, El Salvador and multiple African nations during a meeting about immigration reform.

Democrats and some Republican lawmakers criticized the president’s choice of words and called for him to apologize.

Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement that Trump’s alleged remarks were another “confirmation of his racially insensitive and ignorant views.”

“It also reinforces the concerns that we hear every day, that the President’s slogan Make America Great Again is really code for Make America White Again,” Richmond added.

It sucks to write this. Aziz Ansari was praised for his feminism. And yet, here we are — reading an account of Aziz allegedly taking advantage of a woman. Given how pervasive and normalized sexual assault is, I’m not surprised at where we find ourselves. What’s also not shocking is the buzz that this encounter was just an average date. This is NOT normal. This is sexual assault and it feels normal because we’ve all experienced this exact scenario without realizing its true nature. As this account spreads, differentiating between what’s healthy sexual behavior and what isn’t is crucial to helping women and young girls unlearn the messages they’ve received about how they should be treated.

So, people are being garbage bags in my mentions about the Aziz Ansari thing. Though they’re acting like it’s new garbage about “ambiguous consent” or whatever, it is in fact the same garbage we’ve always spilled around rape. To sum up: — Sady Doyle (@sadydoyle) January 14, 2018

2) “She could have said no.” She said “not tonight” and “I don’t want to feel forced” and many other synonyms for “no.” Most of us understand, by age 5, that if your mom says “maybe later” you won’t get what you’re asking for. Any socially competent adult understands those cues. — Sady Doyle (@sadydoyle) January 14, 2018

This news about Ansari highlights an important part of #MeToo and #TimesUp: ensuring we hold all men — especially men deemed as “feminists” — accountable for their words. In 2018, it can be attractive and profitable to wear a pin on your suit, rock some black, or be seen at a rally. However, feminism and the fight to be treated equally is not a trend you can wear on the red carpet and take off at home. You can’t be crying feminist by day and be snuggling up with the patriarchy at night. Equality is not a PR or marketing campaign. It’s not empty words. It’s a lifestyle or nothing. And in 2018, you won’t get away with the knock-off brand of feminism.

If you’re a man and you’re not prepared to embed equality into your life, both on small and large levels, then you’re not helping. Stay home and do some inner work. What good is your feminism trending on Twitter if you’re treating women IRL, on an everyday basis, as objects? What good are your social media posts about how to treat women if you treat one woman like a queen and another one like crap?

I’ve witnessed many men self-proclaim themselves as feminists without realizing that you become an ally by invitation. Act. Show up. Prove it. Then, let us call you a feminist. In my personal experience, the men who self-proclaim that they are “feminist” are often blind to the times in which they undermine women because they feel they are immune. Owning your privilege means recognizing that you don’t own the space in which the fight against privilege is fought on. That also means recognizing we shouldn’t be expected to make you feel comfortable on this turf — it will challenge every message you’ve ever been told as a male. Be prepared to sit down and be humble (as Kendrick Lamar would say). Your ground here is earned.

If you’re showing up for the Women’s March but you’re not showing up for Black Lives Matter, that’s not feminism. If you’re speaking out against sexual assault but you miss the point about mansplaining or the wage gap then please, get your ears checked. If you’re not outraged about immigrants and transgender individuals being stripped of their rights then take a seat. Selective feminism has no place here. Being a feminist means you hustle and speak out for the rights of all women and not just a few of your choosing.I’ve said often that the Common Core failed in its creators’ central goal ― to establish a set of national standards followed “with fidelity” by every school from Maine to Alaska. Every school would follow the exact same set of learning goals so that a child who left Iowa to attend school in Florida could make the switch without missing a step. The standards would be set in cement (remember the rule that a state could only add 15 percent additional Stuff) and we would all march together in lockstep into a fully-standardized perfect education future.

But the Core was revealed as both political kryptonite and amateur-hour educational junk. It entered the Bad Policy Witness Protection Program and took up residence in many states under an assumed name. Also, states took about five minutes to realize they could go ahead and rewrite, alter and add anything they damn well felt like.

David Coleman’s dream of fifty states all yoked to his vision was dead.

But something else was not dead, and is, in regrettable fact, very much alive.

Once upon a time, school districts would plan curriculum, the whole scope and sequence and pedagogical approach as well as the actual content― they would do all of that by consulting the experts that they had already hired. Maybe a curriculum director if they had one, or some other administrator if they didn’t. Certainly an assortment of their actual classroom teachers. Those folks might consult some other reliable sources as well as using their own professional judgment to develop the district’s educational plan.

But that was once upon a time.

Now the goal is standards-based curriculum.

Instead of curriculum conversations that begin with “What do we believe a graduate of our school district should know?” we now get conversations that begin with “Let’s take a look at the standards.” And then schools use them as a checklist. Let’s work our way down the list of standards and make sure that we have something written into the curriculum that allows us to check off each one so that we can say it’s “covered.” And let’s be double-certain when it comes to the tested standards.

Here are the questions that are not answered (and sometimes not asked) in attempts to build standards-based curriculum:

Where did these standards come from? Who wrote them, and is there some reason to believe that they know better than our own trained professionals what students in our district should learn? Are the standards based on any sort of research, and is that research valid and trustworthy?

What is not covered by the standards? Are the standards strictly focused on skills while ignoring content (spoiler alert: probably)? Are there areas of our course of study that we, in our considered professional judgment, consider vital, but which the standards do not address? And if there are are, given a finite school year, can we discuss setting aside some of the standards in order to make room for content and material that we consider important?

When the Common Core wave passed, it had swept away the notion that actual teachers and administrators are experts in education. Teaching, it turns out, is somehow too hard for mere teachers. Instead, the standards-based school district now assumes that nobody in the school system actually knows what should be taught, and that the most they can be trusted with is to “unpack” the standards and create a checklist-certified list of education activities that will meet the standards’ demands. That’s the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, the district doesn’t believe that trained education professionals can be trusted with even that much, and should just be handed materials that dictate the teacher’s every move, throwing aside their professional judgment and replacing it with the judgment of some bureaucrat or textbook publisher.

Worst of all for the long run, this approach has infected schools of education who prepare their few remaining future teachers to accept this, to envision for themselves a diminished role as content delivery specialists or instructional facilitators or classroom coaches.

Common Core was pitched against a definite enemy― the teachers who insisted in teaching things in their own classroom just because they thought those things were worth teaching, the teacher who insisted on using her own professional judgment, the teacher who wanted to function as an autonomous individual. Ironically, even though the Common Core did not conquer the nation’s school districts as it had hoped, it did manage to deliver a serious defeat to its chosen enemy. We now understand in (too many) districts that we must adhere to the Standards, which have descended manna-like from some mysterious, magical higher power. They are not to be argued with or contradicted, nor will there be any discussion of the educational wisdom (or lack thereof) behind them. They are to be treated as our compass, our grail, our North Star. Teachers should sit down, shut up, and start aligning.

And that defeat of professional educators, that clampdown on teacher autonomy― that’s the one victory that Common Core State (sic) Standards can claim.A group of right-wing protesters wheeled a homemade gallows outside a hall where London’s Muslim mayor was about to speak and tried to arrest him for disrespecting U.S. President Donald Trump, The Washington Post reported.

Mayor Sadiq Khan laughed it off, calling the protesters “very stable geniuses.” The crack was a dig at Trump, who said earlier this month in a tweet amid concerns about his mental fitness that he is a “very stable genius.”

The half-dozen protesters calling themselves the White Pendragons managed to delay Khan’s planned speech on gender equality before members of the liberal Fabian Society for several minutes, The Guardian reported. They accused the mayor of “treachery” and “treason,” though it wasn’t entirely clear why. The gallows was decorated with a white dragon and the words: “Take Back Control.” The men waved an American flag and shouted pro-Brexit slogans.

One of the protesters, David Russell, was identified by the British press as a member of the far-right English Defense League and the host of an anti-Islam radio program.

The group failed to make a citizen’s arrest of the mayor and was escorted from the venue by security guards.

As for disrespecting Trump, Khan has long butted heads with the president and declared himself “no fan.”

Trump in turn has mocked Khan on Twitter because of terror attacks in his city.

After Trump announced Thursday he was canceling his trip to Britain, Khan said that the president “got the message” that Londoners don’t agree with his policies and that he would have been met with “mass protests.”

Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda. It seems he’s finally got that message. pic.twitter.com/YD0ZHuWtr3 — Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) January 12, 2018

Trump claimed he was canceling his trip because he could not support an Obama administration deal to sell the U.S. Embassy there. The decision to sell the real estate was actually made by George W. Bush administration officials.A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck off the coast of southern Peru early Sunday morning, leaving at least one dead and injuring dozens of others, authorities said.

The large quake occurred about 25 miles offshore from Acari, a town in Peru’s southern Arequipa region, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Shaking could be felt throughout the region and even as far north as the capital city of Lima, about 350 miles away, according to local media reports.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the offshore quake did not present a tsunami threat.

The quake has killed at least one person, Arequipa Gov. Yamila Osorio said. The victim, 55-year-old Justo Palomino Yucra, died after being by crushed by a rock in the town of Yauca. While some news outlets have reported a second death, Osorio said the official count remains at just one.

Another 65 people were injured in the quake, Peru’s Civil Defense Institute chief Jorge Chavez told local radio station RPP.

While assessing the damage in Chala and Acari, two of the hardest-hit towns, Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told reporters that about 100 homes have collapsed. The quake also triggered power outages and damaged roads in affected towns.

However, Interior Minister Vicente Romero said the disaster would not affect Pope Francis’ scheduled visit for this coming Thursday through next Sunday.

Earthquakes are a major risk in Peru, where highly active fault lines are responsible for the uplift of the massive Andes mountain range. In 2007, a magnitude 8.0 quake that also struck southern Peru claimed nearly 600 lives.

Sunday’s quake is a glimpse at how bad a bigger earthquake in a more populated part of Peru would be. The country’s lawmakers have warned in recent years that a large earthquake in Lima could cause some 30,000 deaths and destroy 200,000 homes.“Let us be those creative dissenters who will call our beloved nation to a higher destiny. To a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humanness.” ― Martin Luther King Jr.

At Dr. King’s last staff meeting, he talked against building walls and for building bridges in Germany. Dr. King believed that we must choose bridges over war and reconnection over rejection. He wanted to choose love over hate induced by fear and ignorance. As Christians, we believe that when people come together in forgiveness and reconciliation, we can be sure that it is the work of the Holy Spirit. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall that united people of Germany is one of the greatest manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the 20th century.

Today, every Korean has thoughts of reunification. Korea has gone through over 60 years of military posturing, and this has not made us better, but bitter. A shift from a movement of nuclear violation, to peace and reunification is our goal. We pray for people of North and South Korea to come together in peace and reconciliation.

On the day that we celebrate the life and achievements of Martin Luther King Jr. and his outreach to Asians and Asian Americans, we are reminded that Dr. King was a reconciler and peacemaker. Dr. King reached out beyond African American communities to people struggling everywhere: from people facing starvation in India to victims of war in Vietnam. His anti-war conviction led him to advocate for peace in Vietnam. This means that as we seek peace, reconciliation, and reunification in Korea, we resolve to focus on:

· A Korean national reconciliation

· A halt to bellicose language on both sides

· A cessation to joint provocative military drills by the US and South Korea and an end to North Korea’s missile and nuclear tests.

To promote peace and reconciliation in the Korean peninsula, we vividly remember Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr’s courageous and prophetic statement as he connected the Civil Rights Movement to the war in Vietnam:

Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor in America who are paying double the price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as an American to the leaders of my own nation. The great initiative is ours. The initiative to stop must be ours.

It is time for the U.S. to end the Korean War by replacing the obsolete Armistice with the Permanent Peace Treaty with DPRK and let both sides of Korea restart the process of healing and reconciliation according to the previous Summit Joint Declarations of 1972, 2000 and 2007.LONDON (Reuters) - Gus Kenworthy was terrified about the consequences of coming out as gay in 2015 but the American skier says that his decision prompted a huge outpouring of unexpected support and has allowed him to compete without the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Kenworthy, an Olympic silver medal winner in the ski slopestyle at Sochi, came out in a cover story for ESPN The Magazine to become the first openly gay action sports athlete.

“I had set myself up for the worst case scenario,” he told Reuters by telephone from his winter base in Colorado. “I thought I was going to be turned against and become this pariah.”

Kenworthy had already told his close family and friends, who were all very supportive. Their support, along with a desire to be an inspiration for other young men and women scared to come out as homosexual, drove Kenworthy to make the decision.

“I knew I would feel so much better because I was being authentic and maybe it would help kids going through the same transition as me,” said Kenworthy.

“I thought it would maybe help other people, either in professional sports or amateur sports or even just in communities where they felt isolated and scared to be themselves.”

Within minutes of the news breaking, Kenworthy’s telephone was blowing up.

“I had so much support coming in and so my phone just couldn’t handle it and I couldn’t handle it either,” he said.

“I was crying and it is quite a weird sensation to set yourself up for one outcome and then get the total opposite.”

Kenworthy says his decision has led to a change in what he calls his “headspace” going into competitions. Instead of compartmentalizing his life he is able to be himself and this has contributed to a greater sense of freedom and confidence.

The change means Kenworthy is more confident than ever heading into the Pyeongchang Winter Games next month.

“I am more open with everyone in my life and I think it just translates into me being able to ski a little bit more freely and not have so much to focus on and worry about,” he added.

LGBT ICON

Despite his achievements on the slopes, Kenworthy is known by many as the ‘gay skier.’ Instead of shying away from the tag, Kenworthy has embraced it and hopes to serve as an inspiration for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people (LGBT) around the world.

If, as Kenworthy says, he can be a gay man at the top of the world, an Olympic gold medallist, then it would prove a lot of people wrong.

“Nothing would make me happier,” he said.

”The Olympics is a cool opportunity to represent our country, which is amazing, but I have another community I am competing for and that is the LGBT community.

”There are all these stereotypes and stigmas that people have associated in their mind over time but nothing breaks barriers down more than visibility or representation.

”Having someone at the Olympics, the pinnacle event in sports, competing against the best in the world and being out and proud and gay and getting a medal, it would be amazing.

“There is pressure that comes with this responsibility and I feel I have a responsibility to the LGBT community now. I want to lead by example and I want to be a positive example and an inspiration for any kids that I can.”

After Kenworthy’s silver medal in Sochi, he went to the White House with the rest of the U.S. Olympic team to meet then President Barack Obama, as per tradition. It was an experience Kenworthy describes as “thrilling.”

However, if he is invited to the White House this time around, Kenworthy said he would politely decline.

“I am very proud to represent the U.S. but I don’t stand by (U.S. President Donald) Trump and his cabinet and their policies,” said Kenworthy.

”I do not want to feign approval for policies that are in place and things that are being pushed at the moment, by going. If I was invited I would decline my spot.”Critics are blasting President Donald Trump for continuing to golf Saturday while frantic Hawaii residents rushed for cover after a false cell phone alarm about an incoming ballistic missile.

The president was on the course at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, after the alert was issued at 1:09 p.m. EST, according to press pool reports. His motorcade didn’t leave the club for Mar-a-Lago until 1:38 p.m.

Although Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency quickly tweeted that the initial warning was an error, it took 38 minutes before a second mobile alert declared the first a false alarm. Officials said the wrong button had been pushed.

Pool report had Trump leaving golf course at 138 PM ET and arriving at Mar-a-Lago at 149 PM. Alert was posted at 109 ET and declared false by Gabbard at 119 & by Hawaii at 120 ET. https://t.co/KOi9mLu0ny — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) January 13, 2018

As of Saturday evening, Trump had not issued any personal statement — or tweet — about the scare. He did tweet about “fake news” and again called journalist Michael Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, a “fake book.” He described Wolff as “mentally deranged.”

So much Fake News is being reported. They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2018

It’s not clear exactly when Trump learned of the alert, although presumably the president would be informed of any potential threat immediately.

White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement that the president had been “briefed on the state of Hawaii’s emergency management exercise.”

“This was purely a state exercise,” she added.

A White House official told CNN that the president was briefed in person by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, deputy national security adviser Ricky Waddell and White House chief of staff John Kelly.

A senior administrative official told Politico that there was no military response around the president during the incident because there was no actual threat detected by the military. The source also said that Trump’s Cabinet hasn’t yet tested plans for how they would respond in such an attack

Former Pentagon official Col. Morris Davis criticized the president in a tweet for continuing his round of golf on his “taxpayer funded vacation” as Hawaiians “braced for a ballistic missile strike.”

Former Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) tweeted that Trump was “somewhere on the back nine” while “1.5 million American citizens” were told to seek shelter.

As 1.5 million American citizens were told a ballistic missile was headed their way and to seek shelter immediately, @realDonaldTrump was somewhere on the back nine of his Florida golf course.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was quickly informed of the alert error and assured Hawaiians in a tweet that there was “no incoming missile,” even before the second alert went out.

She didn’t criticize Trump for golfing. But she did complain that the president was neither taking the nuclear threat from North Korea seriously enough nor dealing with it wisely.

Donald Trump is taking too long. Now is not the time for posturing. He must take this threat seriously and begin direct talks with North Korea, without preconditions, to de-escalate and denuclearize the Korean peninsula. There is no time to waste. — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) January 13, 2018

The people of Hawaiʻi should never have had to go through this. The people of America should not be faced with this threat right now. We need peace - not political bickering. We have to talk to North Korea and find a peaceful path to get rid of this nuclear threat. — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) January 13, 2018

A former Pentagon communications director during the Obama administration quipped that “thank God” Trump was playing golf during the false alarm.

The picture of a young black boy modeling an H&M sweatshirt emblazoned with the words “Coolest Monkey In The Jungle” sparked outrage on social media last week after New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow drew attention to the ad on Twitter.

On Saturday, demonstrators from the Economic Freedom Fighters, a South African socialist political party, gathered at six H&M locations in and around Johannesburg, according to Reuters. A video of one of the EFF demonstrations showed protesters knocking over clothing racks and mannequins.

Other videos depicted people chanting while marching around H&M stores and shopping complexes. Officials said that police officers fired rubber bullets to disperse the protesters in one location, Reuters reported.

“Out of concern for the safety of our employees and customers, we have temporarily closed all stores in the area,” H&M tweeted Saturday, adding that store staff had nothing to do with the company’s “poor judgement” in producing the hoodie ad.

EFF leader Julius Malema defended the protests and warned there would be more to come in a speech on Saturday.

“No one should make jokes about the dignity of black people and be left unattended to,” Malema said. “We make no apology about what the fighters did today against H&M. All over South Africa, H&M stores are closed because they called our children baboons.”

The party tweeted Sunday that “not a single item” was stolen from H&M stores by protesters during the previous day’s demonstrations.

The hoodie image has also prompted at least two celebrities, The Weeknd and G-Eazy, to end partnerships with H&M. The company issued a lengthy apology last Wednesday, noting that the picture had been removed and the garment was no longer for sale.

“Our position is simple and unequivocal — we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry,” the statement said. “This incident is accidental in nature, but this doesn’t mean we don’t take it extremely seriously or understand the upset and discomfort it has caused.”

H&M did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Meanwhile, the young model’s mother, Terry Mango, dismissed the backlash as an “unnecessary issue.”VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Mutual fears between immigrants and their new communities are understandable, but must not prevent new arrivals from being welcomed and integrated, Pope Francis said on Sunday in a special Mass to mark the World Day of Migrants and Refugees.

Francis, a keen defender of the rights of migrants, was addressing a congregation including migrants and refugees from some 50 countries, whose flags festooned the area around the altar in St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican.

“Local communities are sometimes afraid that the newly arrived will disturb the established order, will ‘steal’ something they have long labored to build up,” he said, while “the newly arrived ... are afraid of confrontation, judgement, discrimination, failure.”

“Having doubts and fears is not a sin. The sin is to allow these fears to determine our responses, to limit our choices, to compromise respect and generosity, to feed hostility and rejection.”

As politicians and civil society grapple with the mass movement of people around the world, with flashpoints including in the Mediterranean, and between Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope has repeatedly urged support for those who migrate.

Argentina-born Francis, who was the first non-European elected to the post in nearly 1,300 years, has criticized President Donald Trump’s stated intention to build a wall to stop illegal migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico.

The leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics also met Muslim refugees in Myanmar and Bangladesh last year and called for decisive action to solve political problems that cause many to flee.

On Sunday, he said newcomers must “know and respect the laws, the culture and the traditions of the countries that take them in.”

Communities, meanwhile, have “to open themselves without prejudices to [newcomers’] rich diversity, to understand the hopes and potential of the newly arrived as well as their fears and vulnerabilities.”Mark Hamill had fans praising him to the heavens after his guest stint on “The Big Bang Theory” season finale Thursday. (Spoilers ahead.)

Playing himself, the “Star Wars” actor showed off his comic chops while officiating the wedding of Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Amy (Mayim Bialik).

But he also may have changed the pet-naming galaxy forever. Howard (Simon Helberg) finds a lost dog and calls the owner. Hamill himself shows up at Howard’s door to reclaim his pooch, gobsmacking Howard, who learns that the dog’s name is Bark, as in Bark Hamill. (Yeah, we loved that, too.)

Howard strikes a deal with Hamill to hitch Sheldon and Amy instead of giving him a reward ― and keeps it a secret from the pair. Of course Hamill commands the big day. He fields questions from wedding guests during a delay ...

and gives all Luke Skywalker fans some moments to love and to cherish.
