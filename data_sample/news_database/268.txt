Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) stands by her decision to call for former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to give up his office after accusations that he groped and forcibly kissed nearly 10 women surfaced late last year.

Gillibrand faced criticisms for her stance on Franken from some other members of their party, who argued his transgressions didn’t warrant his resignation.

But in a lengthy interview with Glamour magazine published Monday, she said the only thing she would change about urging Franken to quit is that “I might have done it sooner.”

She and several of her fellow female Democratic senators spoke out only after eight women had come forward with stories of sexual misconduct by Franken, who ultimately resigned on Jan. 2.

Gillibrand, a leading advocate for victims of sexual misconduct, also defended her recent comment that former President Bill Clinton should have resigned over his affair with Monica Lewinsky and the history of sexual misconduct lodged against him. Similar to the way the #MeToo movement has catalyzed a national conversation about sexual harassment and assault, Gillibrand said that her own legislative work on sexual violence helped shift her views on such matters.

Some of Franken’s defenders said that he faced unfair scrutiny, arguing that his alleged sexual misconduct was less severe than that of Republicans, particularly failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and President Donald Trump. The latter won the White House despite facing accusations of sexual misconduct from nearly 20 women and bragging about sexual assault.

While Gillibrand said that she agrees there is a distinction, particularly from a legal standpoint, no sexual misconduct is “entitled to my silence.”

“I was asked, ‘Should Al Franken resign?’ And with the eighth allegation becoming public, enough was enough,” she said. “I was not going to have the conversation of, ‘Well, his behavior’s not as bad as Roy Moore’s behavior or President Trump’s behavior,’ at a moment that demands leadership. I was asked what my view was. And I gave my view. It doesn’t mean Sen. Franken wasn’t entitled to any bit of due process or ethics investigation that he wanted. He just wasn’t entitled to my silence any longer.”

Gillibrand also recalled a conversation she had with her teenage son as the furor grew around Franken.

I wasn’t going to tell him, “It’s OK to squeeze someone on their ass, it’s OK to squeeze somebody on their boob, but it’s not OK to squeeze somebody somewhere else, where President Trump did.” That is not a conversation I want to have with my son, because it’s not OK. And I don’t think I should be protecting someone who has behaved that way. And I’m the leader of this debate about sexual assault, sexual harassment in the military, on college campuses, in Congress. And I couldn’t stay silent any longer. It was literally that simple.

Gillibrand, frequently mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2020, conceded that the decision to speak out her Democratic colleague “was exceedingly painful.” But she said she had to do it, given the “multiple credible allegations” against Franken and her legislative efforts to combat sexual misconduct in the military and on college campuses.

She said she couldn’t take the position that “I’ll be a leader on this issue, as long as it’s not about my friends.”

“That’s not moral clarity,” she said. “That’s not leadership.”

As for her view that Clinton should have stepped down in that wake of the Lewinsky scandal 20 years ago, Gillibrand acknowledged that “we’re in a very different place today,” alluding to the #MeToo movement.

She recalled that it was through her own work with survivors of sexual assault in recent years that she reconsidered her views.A conservative activist in Minnesota introduced a resolution last week to “minimize and eliminate the influence of Islam” in the state’s Republican Party.

Jeff Baumann, a notorious anti-Muslim activist in Minnesota’s Senate District 36, also urged in the resolution that “no Islamic leader, religious or otherwise, shall ever be allowed to deliver the invocation at any Republican convention or event.”

The resolution further called for “legislation, policies, and educational programs [to] be implemented... so as to evermore minimize and eliminate the influence of Islam within Minnesota, including Minnesota schools.”

Baumann presented the resolution at a caucus meeting in Coon Rapids, a suburb of Minneapolis. He later told HuffPost that the resolution has passed in at least four precincts in Minnesota, something HuffPost was unable to independently verify.

Speaking to HuffPost on Monday, Baumann argued that “there is a natural tension” between Islam and the U.S. Constitution, calling the religion a “collective” where there is “very little room for Muslims to have independent thought.” He also said Muslim-Americans currently involved in politics are “dishonest.”

“I believe that what I am saying is correct. I believe what I’m saying is not hateful, not ignorant and not bigoted,” Baumann said. “It is my job to help persuade you to come over to my way of thinking.”

Baumann also claimed that Muslims have a “fundamentally different vision for how society and governments should be organized,” and that the future of Muslim-Americans in leadership positions would be one of “civil war, genocide, concentration camps and other horrible, horrible things.”

The Council on American-Islamic Relations called on Minnesota officials to condemn Baumann and his resolution.

“We believe this is the resurgence to the hoodless KKK,” Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the local Minnesota chapter of CAIR, told HuffPost. “This is not acceptable behavior. Him and others really are a threat to our democracy. If unchecked, these individuals can sway individual members of [the] party.”

In the past, Baumann has spoken against building mosques in Minnesota, describing it as “treason” and “aiding the enemy.”

His resolution comes at a moment of acute prejudice against Muslims in the North Star State. Recently, two Republican state lawmakers and a local GOP official in Minnesota came under fire for reportedly sharing a Facebook post that accused Muslims of preparing to “infiltrate” the party’s caucuses, after a group of Muslims had attended a caucus training session held at a local mosque.

Jeff Johnson, a leading Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, defended the GOP lawmakers in a conservative podcast earlier this month. “There are some here who are trying to change what America is,” he said. “And we can’t allow that.”

Phillip Parrish, another Republican candidate for governor in Minnesota, claimed earlier this year that the Islamic State militant group was “the true representation of Islam,” and that the religion of more than 1.6 billion people is “ultimately not a faith” and “fundamentally incompatible with U.S. law.”

Anti-Muslim activists often depict Sharia, or Islamic law, as a brutal judicial system that Muslims want to institute in place of the U.S. Constitution. In reality, though, no national Muslim organization has ever called for Sharia to supercede American courts, nor have American Muslims demanded such a change.

As it happens, one of the two Muslims currently serving in Congress, Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison, is from Minnesota. (The other, Democratic Rep. Andre Carson, is from Indiana.)

As of Monday afternoon, there had been no reports of civil war, genocide or concentration camps in Ellison’s district.

UPDATE: Feb. 14 ― Jennifer Carnahan, chair of the Minnesota Republican Party, said on Wednesday that Baumann “is one person, and he does not speak on behalf of the party.”

“He doesn’t represent or embody the values of what the Republican Party in Minnesota stands for, and that resolution does not either,” Carnahan told HuffPost.

Carnahan, the first Asian-American woman to serve as chair of the Minnesota GOP, said the kind of rhetoric used in Baumann’s resolution is “simply untrue.” She cited Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), the first Somali-American Muslim legislator elected to office in the United States.

“The whole thing that you can’t be Muslim and run [for office] is incorrect,” Carnahan said. “I think it’s very dangerous on either side, to classify an entire group of people one way. People that are Muslim does not equate to being a terrorist or anything like that. To try to group one people into one small box, it’s just wrong, and I think that’s where our country gets into trouble, when people make that mistake.”

She also noted that at least one part of Baumann’s resolution ― “Be it resolved that no Islamic leader, religious or otherwise, shall ever be allowed to deliver the invocation at any Republican convention or event” ― would impinge on her own authority.

“It’s at the discretion of the chair, who is me, to decide if there’s an invocation given at Republican events and conventions. And if so, I get to decide who that is,” she said. “So that portion of his resolution is completely out of order.”Bernadette Moriau's healing was recognized as a miracle by a Roman Catholic bishop on Feb. 11. Diocese de Beauvais Noyon et Senlis / YouTube

Nearly 10 years ago, a French nun named Bernadette Moriau visited the Catholic shrine in Lourdes in a wheelchair. After she returned to her convent near Beauvais, she said, she was miraculously healed and able to walk for the first time in decades.

The Roman Catholic Church in Lourdes investigated her claim, and on Sunday a French bishop placed a stamp of approval on it, formally declaring Moriau’s recovery to be a miracle.

Bishop Jacques Benoit-Gonin of Beauvais announced the 79-year-old nun’s story of healing to be the 70th recognized miracle associated with Lourdes, a popular pilgrimage site. He called her recovery a “sudden, instantaneous, complete and durable change,” according to The Associated Press.

The Sanctuary of Lourdes in southern France marks the spot where in 1858, a 14-year-old girl named Bernadette Soubirous claims to have seen apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Millions visit the site every year, believing that water from a spring in the sanctuary’s grotto has healing powers.

Moriau visited Lourdes on a pilgrimage in 2008. According to La Stampa, the nun had cauda equina syndrome, a rare condition that affects the spinal nerve roots and can lead to paralysis of the legs. She’d had four operations on her spinal column and had been unable to walk since 1987.

Moriau said that when she visited the grotto, she “never asked for a miracle,” per AP. She just “asked for the conversion of my heart and the strength to continue my path as a sick person,” La Stampa reports.

She returned to her home convent and visited the chapel to pray.

“I felt a [surge of] well-being throughout my body, a relaxation, warmth. ... I returned to my room and, there, a voice told me to ‘take off your braces,’” Moriau said in a diocesan video about the event. “Surprise. I could move.”

Below, Bernadette Moriau discusses her experiences in French.

The nun’s claims were evaluated by the International Medical Committee of Lourdes, a team of medical professionals brought together by the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes in order to assess whether stories of healing that emerge from Lourdes can be explained on the basis of current medical knowledge.

The committee reportedly found that Moriau’s case could not be explained scientifically. The bishop of Beauvais, who has the last word on cases involving people living in his diocese, agreed that her healing appeared to be miraculous.

“She immediately started to walk without any help, in a totally autonomous way,” Benoit-Gonin said.

The last officially recognized miracle at Lourdes was announced in 2013. In that case, an Italian woman who had visited the shrine in 1989 said she was miraculously healed of severe high blood pressure and other problems.

The Catholic Church requires extensive documentation to verify the claim of a miracle. The process, which can take years, includes fact-finding, psychological examinations and theological evaluations.Bloomberg via Getty Images

As alternatives to live television ― such as Sling TV, YouTube TV and Hulu Live ― improve and other streaming services ― like Netflix and Amazon Prime ― add better original programming, it’s become increasingly tempting to cut the cord.

But cord-cutting isn’t quite the obvious choice just yet. There must be a reason nearly 200 million U.S. adults still have cable.

HuffPost did a call-out to our readers to find out a few of the unexpected problems consumers have faced after cord-cutting. The majority of the responses expressed satisfaction in their decision, thanks to money saved, monopolistic cable providers avoided and the huge library of content offered by streaming services.

So if you’re thinking of making the cut and want to know what to expect ― read on.

Streamline makes recommendations for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline highlights the best shows to watch online, with a focus on Netflix.

1. The new live services have buffering issues.

Readers identified this as the most widespread problem with making the change from cable.

“I’ve subscribed to DIRECTV Now. But it kept freezing during the Super Bowl, sometimes for minutes at a time.” ― Sarah Cummings

“We liked Hulu live until it froze that last 45 seconds of the Super Bowl ” ― Darcy Leal DeShazer

“We cut out cable and tried to replace it with just streaming options, then with those plus PlayStation Vue (because they were the only option for live sports). That was a bust because the internet streaming couldn’t keep up with the speed of most sports, plus the DVR options were abysmal [which made missing live game broadcasts not an option]. So we went back! We are the proud payers of a DIRECTV bill and I’m not even sad about it.” ― Stephanie Bowen Earley

2. It’s impossible to get every channel you had before.

The different streaming options don’t offer the exact same packages as the cable companies, meaning you’ll almost definitely be missing out on something. If you’re one of those people who actually does watch tons of different channels, the live streaming services might offer less that what you’re looking for.

“I realized that I missed my Live TV. I bought an HDTV antenna, however the only channel I could get was NBC because I’m not close to the towers. I researched all of the live streaming options including Hulu Live ($40/month), Sling TV ($20, $25 or $40) and DIRECTV NOW ($35). I got free trials for all three. I liked Hulu Live, however the live user interface took me awhile to get used to. Plus it was the most expensive at $40, still for a bunch of channels I don’t watch. Also it did not have Animal Planet or TLC, channels that I watch. Next I was excited about Sling because of the price, however even with Sling’s $40 option, you don’t get all of the major broadcast networks. So my final selection for live streaming TV is DIRECTV NOW (Live a little package). It has the best value at $35/month with all of the major broadcast networks plus TLC and Animal Planet. Plus I like the user interface for browsing live TV. It has a nice channel guide similar to cable. The only channel that I don’t have live and would like is the OWN network, but I’m not going to pay an extra $15 a month for the next higher package that includes it.” ― Angela L. Lee

“Many apps require cable subscription.” ― Mike Legg

“I tried Aereo before they lost their court case. Then I was a SlingTV user for a couple of years and really enjoyed it. Just switched to YouTubeTV in the last week. Mostly so we could get local channels. It’s okay but I am already missing A & E, HGTV and History Channel. We are going to give it a try for a while but may check out DIRECTV now because it has most of the channels we like as well as local options.” ― Sean Cook

3. Streaming live sports can be particularly tricky.

Companies such as ESPN have spent a ton of money acquiring the rights to live events. They’re not going to let you stream every major sports event easily. Even ESPN’s upcoming streaming service won’t have all the games that the cable channels are going to air.

In many of these cases, you might have to buy the sport’s individual streaming service ― such as NBA League Pass or MLB.TV, but even those don’t have everything that’s shown on cable.

“We have Netflix, Amazon, Vudu and the T1 from Xfinity (with their best package) plus internet and sports packages. We would definitely cut cable as there is enough with Netflix, Amazon and Vudu ... BUT my husband HAS to have the football and baseball packages and local channels. That’s the only thing keeping us from cutting completely as we only pay about $30 a month combined for streaming compared to almost $300 a month for cable.” ― Anna Day

“Watching the Super Bowl, Golden Globes, Oscars, Emmys are all more work without cable. We have an antenna but the consistency of the channels is lacking.” ― Erin Mcnally-Goward

“Paid for an extra Hulu package to watch sports games and some live TV, but it only works on my iPad, not my smart TV or Apple TV. I was watching the Super Bowl on the networks app, and it cut off in the fourth quarter due to ‘streaming rights’... on the networks app?? How? What am I paying for? Pretty crappy time to cut me off! I had to scramble with guests at my house to find it on YouTube. I am frustrated with paying extra but then the options are still so limited.” ― Ashley Ryan Larrabee

4. Internet problems can mess with streaming.

The U.S. doesn’t rank very well with the rest of the world in terms of internet speed. Depending on where you live, you might have a better shot having reliable cable than internet.

And then if you do cord-cut, you may have to pay more for your internet to make sure the streamed shows and movies don’t overload your internet connection. As one reader pointed out, certain areas of the country with sub-par internet could have no good way of avoiding this problem.

“My internet slowed down to a crawl and no amount of resetting the box helped. Turned out it was something wrong with the box and it was replaced. However, it was still occasionally cutting out. When we moved from Los Feliz to Boyle Heights [in Los Angeles], connection with these services greatly improved. I think it’s due to it being adjacent to downtown so that connections are underground and stronger.” ― Ruby McNeil

5. You might have to fight your cable company.

Your cable company doesn’t want to lose that sweet, sweet monthly payment. So that company might try to make it really difficult to cord-cut.

This often entails pushing you to pay more for internet or hiding large overage fees. Expect some resistance.

(We should note in passing that Verizon — which owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath — is one of the largest cable and internet providers in the U.S.)

“We did it! Finally cut the cable cord. It was an oddly empowering moment. However within a few weeks of basking in our joy and anticipation of the savings we were going to experience we started getting some rather concerning emails from our former cable company about data overages! We could stream to our hearts content while we paid exorbitant rates for cable that supplied us with an endless supply of channels we never used. The minute we took charge that old pesky cable company somehow infiltrated our lives again with the promise of extra fees. We started getting a daily deluge of emails letting us know for a few more drops of blood ... I mean dollars ... we could keep our overages in check and be safe and complacent again. We were floored. But alas we caved but in our small protest we vowed to neva-eva-eva-eva go hungry again... I mean pay for cable again!” ― Lucy Fellows

“My cable company tried to tell me that if I cancelled the digital service and just got internet and phone service it would cost me more... ” ― Janna Olson

“I cut dish and only use open TV, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime video and HBOnow, but now Comcast limited my monthly data to 1,000 gig and if I go over they charge me 10 dollars for every 50 gig above.” ― Manuel Briceño

Bonus: The shows and movies you thought were on streaming might not be there anymore or might be leaving soon.

This can be fixed with a little research. But since streaming companies like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are constantly changing their content libraries, you might not be getting all the shows and movies you expected.

These companies also seem to be pivoting to more original content rather than maintaining huge libraries of quality shows and movies by other creators. So you might have to subscribe to quite a few streaming companies to get an extensive library.

“I’m really disappointed in the slow deterioration of popular film offerings from the Big 3 (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon). I remember when they started up, Netflix had an amazing selection. But now it seems like they never have any of the films I’m looking for. I have Amazon Prime, but any of the movies I really want to see inevitably require that I pay extra to rent them. The number of B and C-grade movies that are on these services is quite remarkable. That’s a lot of chaff to pad their offerings.” ― Susan HoustonMarco Rubio and Ivanka Trump have a plan. It has some issues. The Washington Post via Getty Images

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and first daughter Ivanka Trump are pushing for a paid parental leave plan that is actually worse than the current federal policy ― which is no policy at all. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that offers no paid time off to new mothers.

Under the Rubio-Trump scheme, which is based on a proposal from the conservative Independent Women’s Forum, new parents would fund their parental leave by tapping into their Social Security benefits early.

Parents would get 12 weeks of benefits ― estimated to be about 40 percent of average worker pay ― in exchange for what the Independent Women’s Forum claims would only be six weeks of Social Security retirement benefits down the line.

The plan does not account for anyone who needs to take time off to care for a sick relative or deal with a personal illness.

Valid points by @ebruenig But remember my goal isn’t the “perfect” plan,it’s 60 votes for law better than status quo https://t.co/fiWnTsdqfs — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 9, 2018

In a Tweet last week, Rubio admitted that the plan isn’t “perfect,” but it’s better than the status quo.

He’s wrong.

Paid leave is generally understood to be a policy that would help women, who typically bear the burden of childbearing and rearing. Mothers who get paid leave are more likely to stay in the labor force and are less likely to rely on social programs like food stamps to get by.

But the Rubanka plan would have parents pay for children with their retirement funds ― essentially stealing from their own future well-being. That’s a particularly painful proposition for women. Though they live longer than men, women have less money saved for retirement. Indeed, women on average get $1,154 a month in retirement from Social Security, according to the agency’s data. Men get $1,466.

This is partly because women are more likely to take time out of the labor force to care for children and other family members, working just 75 percent of the years men work.

It’s also thanks to the gender pay gap. Overall, women make 80 cents for every dollar on average a man makes. Mothers face a wider pay gap of 71 cents. If you’re a woman of color, the numbers look even worse.

The plan does not account for a mother (or father) who has several children. The more kids, the bigger the penalty, with each leave period funded by another chunk of retirement benefits. This could effectively discourage people from having kids ― maybe not a great idea in a country with an increasingly aging population and declining birthrate that’s also trying to cut back on immigration.

“With the changes in the labor force and potentially in immigration, we need to be encouraging people to have kids,” said Jeff Hayes, program director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “They’re the workforce of tomorrow.”

“This could effectively discourage people from having kids -- maybe not a great idea in a country with an increasingly aging population and declining birthrate that’s also trying to cut back on immigration.”

Rubio and Trump haven’t floated a written policy. What we know about the workings of the scheme comes from the Independent Women’s Forum paper, which was published last month.

The Independent Women’s Forum was founded in 1991 by women who defended the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexually harassing Anita Hill. These days, the group is busy backing President Donald Trump, decrying the #MeToo movement, promoting the idea that raising the minimum wage would harm women and downplaying the role that discrimination plays in the gender pay gap.

The group touts the plan as a “short deferral” of benefits. In practice, that’s not how it would work, says Kathleen Romig, who worked for years as an analyst at the Social Security Administration.

The plan’s backers suggest that a person applying for Social Security benefits would just have to wait six more weeks to collect, Romig explained. In reality, the recipient would receive a lower benefit, she said.

“It’s cutting your benefit for the rest of your life,” said Romig, who is now a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Until the policy can be thoroughly analyzed, it’s not totally clear how much that reduction would actually be, she said. However, she expressed disbelief that it would only be the equivalent of six weeks’ pay. “We can’t know how much it’ll cost until we get an official cost from the scorekeepers,” Romig said, noting the actuarial complexity of such an undertaking.

Perhaps most alarming: The very idea of using Social Security funds as a private piggy bank threatens to destabilize the very notion of a social insurance program.

“If we start treating Social Security, really the bedrock of financial security for elderly people, as just another asset to tap, we are imperiling people’s financial security,” Romig said.

That may be an intentional part of the Independent Women’s Forum plan. In a piece written for the conservative publication The Federalist, the group’s managing director, Carrie Lukas, writes that a policy like this could have the added “benefit” of changing Americans’ thinking about Social Security as a bedrock benefit that cannot be changed.

“Indeed, encouraging people to think about Social Security’s assets as if those benefits are their property for use now or at retirement could even encourage people to want to move more in that direction and transform the current pay-as-you-go system into one that pre-funds future benefits and with assets that belong to individuals,” Lukas writes. She says that many Americans don’t want that much money when they’re older ― since they need it now ― and are happy to work longer into old age.

But a key part of Social Security is keeping those retirement benefits untapped ― even when young Americans desperately do need money ― thus staving off terrifying poverty for the nation’s elderly.

The proposal comes at a time of enormous bipartisan support for paid leave, traditionally a more liberal policy darling. Eighty-two percent of Americans support giving mothers paid leave following the arrival of a child, according to a Pew survey last year. Conservative groups are increasingly in favor of doing something for parents.

“It’s cutting your benefit for the rest of your life.” - Kathleen Romig, former Social Security Administration analyst

Yet even the president isn’t buying the Rubanka plan. He has put a paid family leave proposal in his budget plan, released Monday. However, it’s structured differently from his daughter’s. Under his plan, the U.S. would offer six weeks of family leave, paid for with unemployment insurance.

But don’t get too excited: It’s a dubious policy he’s suggested before, without taking any action to move it forward.

“It’s understandable that people have seen how popular family leave is and want to get out in front of it,” said Ellen Bravo, co-director of the paid family leave advocacy group Family Values @ Work. “But [Rubio’s plan] is a step in the wrong direction.”

Advocates like Bravo have been fighting for paid leave since the 1993 passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks unpaid leave for some employees at large companies. It’s beneficial to wait a little longer for the right solution, she said.

Bravo and others support a different proposal on family leave: The Family Act, sponsored by Democrats in the House and Senate, which would pay for leave through a small payroll tax levied on employers and employees.Finally, proof that no one is looking at your Instagram anyway.

Similar to Snapchat snaps, Instagram stories have always had a shelf life ― if you miss them, you’re out of luck. But unlike Snapchat, which notifies people when followers take screenshots, Instagram has allowed you to freely screenshot stories without any notifications. Until now.

In a statement to TechCrunch, Instagram confirmed it’s testing a feature that notifies users when a follower screenshots their story.

Good bye freedom to screenshot IG stories. 💔 Thank you, Instagram for the warning. pic.twitter.com/y0pEaVR0Jq — mulan (@__cajb) February 8, 2018

Instagram already notifies people if someone screenshots a DM conversation they’re involved in; but let’s be honest, screenshotting a DM seems shady.

But if we’re not screenshotting Instagram stories as often, how will we show our kids the early days of skulking about social media, or gather blackmail evidence of our friends’ bad behavior?PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) ― Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizers confirmed on Sunday that the Games had fallen victim to a cyber attack during Friday’s opening ceremony, but they refused to reveal the source.

The Games’ systems, including the internet and television services, were affected by the hack two days ago but organizers said it had not compromised any critical part of their operations.

“Maintaining secure operations is our purpose,” said International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman Mark Adams.

“We are not going to comment on the issue. It is one we are dealing with. We are making sure our systems are secure and they are secure.”

Asked if organizers knew who was behind the attack, Adams said: “I certainly don’t know. But best international practice says that you don’t talk about an attack.”

The Winter Games are being staged only 80km (50 miles) from the border with North Korea, which is technically still at war with the South since their 1950-1953 war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.

The two teams marched together at an Olympics opening ceremony for the first time since 2006.

South Korea has been using the Pyeongchang Games to break the ice with the reclusive North, which has been trading nuclear threats with the United States recently.

“All issues were resolved and recovered yesterday morning,” Pyeongchang organizing committee spokesman Sung Baik-you told reporters.

“We know the cause of the problem but that kind of issues occurs frequently during the Games. We decided with the IOC we are not going to reveal the source [of the attack],” he told reporters.

Russia, which has been banned from the Games for doping, said days before the opening ceremony that any allegations linking Russian hackers to attacks on the infrastructure connected to the Pyeongchang Olympic Games were unfounded.

“We know that Western media are planning pseudo-investigations on the theme of ‘Russian fingerprints’ in hacking attacks on information resources related to the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games in the Republic of Korea,” Russia’s foreign ministry said.

“Of course, no evidence will be presented to the world.”

Cyber security researchers said in January they had found early indications that Russia-based hackers may be planning attacks against anti-doping and Olympic organizations in retaliation for Russia’s exclusion from the Pyeongchang Games.

Stakeholders of the Olympics have been wary of the threat from hacking and some sponsors have taken out insurance to protect themselves from a cyber attack.PYEONGCHANG, Feb 11 (Reuters) - U.S. broadcaster NBC apologized to South Korea’s winter Games organizing committee on Sunday after a commentator offended locals during coverage of the opening ceremony by straying into the sensitive issue of Japan-South Korean relations.

Former journalist Joshua Cooper Ramo, working as an analyst for NBC, said on-air during the Pyeongchang Games opening ceremony that all Koreans recognized that Japan had served as an important example in South Korea’s own economic transformation.

Koreans around the world criticized his remarks on social media and a petition soon circulated online. Japan, which colonized the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, has left a deep legacy of mistrust and ill-feeling in South Korea.

Ramo, who has written books on China and is a director of Starbucks Corp and FedEx Corp, said as athletes paraded into the Games stadium that “every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural, technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.”

On Sunday, an NBC spokesman said: “We apologized quickly both in writing and on television for a remark made by one of our presenters during Friday night’s opening ceremony.

“We’re very gratified that Pyeongchang’s organizing committee has accepted that apology.”

The organizing committee could not immediately be reached for comment.

Ramo, who was also an on-air contributor for NBC during the Beijing Olympics, is co-CEO of Kissinger Associates, an advisory firm of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.The Saratov Airlines airplane crashed in the Moscow region on Sunday. Flickr / Papas Dos

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A plane operated by Russia’s Saratov Airlines crashed in the Moscow region on Sunday, killing all 71 people on board, Russian news agencies said, citing sources in the emergency services.

There were 65 passengers and six crew members onboard the plane which went missing from radars less than 10 minutes after taking off from Moscow’s Domodedovo airport, TASS reported.

The plane was bound for the Russian city of Orsk in the Orenburg region that borders Kazakhstan. “Debris has been found, there are no survivors,” TASS quoted a source as saying.

It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. The Russian Transport Ministry was considering various possible reasons, including weather conditions and a pilot error, Interfax said.Finnish snowboard coach Antti Koskinen is up to his old tricks at the 2018 Winter Olympics.

If Koskinen knitting on the slopes seems a familiar sight, that’s because it is. He attempted to keep himself and his athletes calm in a similar fashion during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, per BuzzFeed. He also became a meme.Actor Topher Grace was excited to find out he was playing former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in Spike Lee’s new movie “BlacKkKlansman,” but getting ready for filming after snagging the role was a different story.

“It was just the worst month of my life,” Grace told Vulture at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday, in reference to studying Duke.

“I listened to a lot of his radio show, I watched ‘Donahue’ — because he was on that a lot — and I read My Awakening, his autobiography, which is horrible,” he siad. “It’s like Mein Kampf.”

Grace’s wife, actress Ashley Hinshaw, apparently wasn’t thrilled about the deep dive into the mind and life of the white supremacist, either.

“Right before I started, we had a baby,” Grace said. “I was walking around the house doing my lines, and she was like, ‘Hey, can you tone it down on the hate speech?’”

“BlacKkKlansman” is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth (played by John David Washington, the son of Denzel Washington), a black cop who infiltrated the KKK in the 1970s. Adam Driver and Laura Harrier also star in the film, which is slated to come out in August.

The Republican Party stands with women said a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, despite a whole host of positions taken by the GOP in recent months that seem to contradict the statement.

“My heart goes out to any victim of domestic violence. It’s unacceptable, it’s inexcusable and it’s important to stand with women,” RNC spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said during a Saturday interview with MSNBC where she was asked whether she believed the woman who accused former top White House aide Rob Porter of violence.

Jennifer Willoughby said last week Porter, her ex-husband, emotionally, mentally and physically abused her.

Porter resigned Wednesday as White House staff secretary following reports alleging that he physically abused Willoughby and Colbie Holderness, his first wife. Holderness said that Porter punched her in 2005 and provided photos showing a black eye she said she had sustained during the incident. Porter has denied the allegations.

“All of these claims have to be vetted,” McEnany added. “Of course, Rob Porter’s denying them. So at this point, it’s a dispute better handled for a court of law. But my heart goes out to any victim of that, and we stand with women, our party does.”

McEnany’s statements come after many Republican officials have attempted to downplay accusations of sexual misconduct in the party or have openly supported those accused of misconduct.

The RNC has refused to return donations from its former finance chair and Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn, even after he resigned as CEO from Wynn Resorts in response to sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades ― including allegedly forcing his employees into having sex with him. The RNC’s defense ― that Wynn deserves due process ― is not one the party afforded to former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) when they called on Democrats to return his donations in light of allegations that he groped and kissed a woman without her consent.

The RNC also stood by and helped fund former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was accused of preying on children while he was a 32-year-old prosecutor. Republicans also continue to ignore the more than 20 allegations of sexual harassment and abuse made against President Donald Trump.

Asked about the allegations during a press conference last year, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made clear the administration’s official stance is that the women are lying.Kacey Bellamy, right, of the United States collides with Finland's Minnamari Tuominen.

The U.S. women’s hockey team has had four years to live down an overtime loss to archrival Canada in the gold-medal game at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

On Sunday, the squad took to the ice again in its opening match against Finland at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The top-seeded Americans got off to a rocky start, falling behind in the first period. But they rebounded for a 3-1 victory.

Monique Lamoureux-Morando tied the game at 1-1 in the second period.

Dani Cameranesi scored an empty-net goal with 13 seconds to play.

On the negative side, the Americans’ struggling offense required 42 shots to reach their tally.

“You would like to come out and score a whole bunch more, but as Finland does, they play very tough,” U.S. Coach Robb Stauber told Reuters. “We expected it and weren’t surprised by it at all.”

But they’ll take it.

“We’ve been focused on Feb. 11, our first game of this tournament, for the last four years,” team captain Meghan Duggan had told the Los Angeles Times.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit on Sunday against former media mogul Harvey Weinstein, his brother Robert Weinstein, and The Weinstein Company for civil rights, human rights and business law violations.

More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault in incidents that go back decades. The New York Times and The New Yorker published groundbreaking articles in October detailing vivid accounts and allegations from actresses, including Rose McGowan, Daryl Hannah, Mira Sorvino, Ashley Judd and Asia Argento.

The Weinstein Company is headquartered in New York City, and many of Weinstein’s accusers have said the alleged assaults occurred in the city.

Schneiderman’s lawsuit includes Weinstein’s business partner and brother, Robert, as well as The Weinstein Company, claiming each party had widespread knowledge of the persistent misconduct by its co-founder.

“As alleged in our complaint, The Weinstein Company repeatedly broke New York law by failing to protect its employees from pervasive sexual harassment, intimidation, and discrimination,” Schneiderman stated in a press release on Sunday.

The attorney general’s office conducted a months-long investigation against Weinstein and the company, compiling evidence of a culture of harassment and abuse that was “shrouded in secrecy.” Weinstein allegedly kept groups of predominantly female employees to facilitate his exploitation of women, directing them to meet with potential “conquests” to convey promises of employment.

“Female Weinstein employees are essentially used to facilitate his sexual conquests of vulnerable women who hope he will get them work,” one woman said in a complaint to human resources, according to the press release.

Schneiderman’s office also insists that The Weinstein Company has not properly redressed the wrongs. The attorney general’s office press release cited concerns that the imminent sale of The Weinstein Company would leave victims without justice.

″[The New York State Attorney General] also believes that the proposed terms of the sale would allow the perpetrators or enablers of the misconduct to see a windfall, and allow top officials at TWC who share responsibility for the misconduct to serve in executive positions of the new entity – where they would again oversee the adjudication of HR complaints, including those of sexual harassment, intimidation, and assault,” the release stated.

Ben Brafman, Weinstein’s attorney, said in a statement to HuffPost that the Hollywood producer will embrace the office’s investigation if the purpose is truly to “encourage reform throughout the film industry.” Brafman went on to say that if the intent is to scapegoat Weinstein, he will “vigorously defend himself.”

“We believe that a fair investigation by Mr. Schneiderman will demonstrate that many of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein are without merit,” Brafman said in a statement. “While Mr. Weinstein’s behavior was not without fault, there certainly was no criminality, and at the end of the inquiry it will be clear that Harvey Weinstein promoted more women to key executive positions than any other industry leader and there was zero discrimination at either Miramax or TWC.”

The lawsuit filing can be read in full on the New York attorney general’s website.Long-time CBS anchor Dan Rather called President Donald Trump’s defense of Rob Porter, a former White House staff secretary accused of domestic abuse, a “heat-seeking missile” aimed at some of the president’s “biggest vulnerabilities.”

After Porter left his job Wednesday in the wake of media reports of domestic abuse accusations by both of his ex-wives, Trump praised his work in the White House and wished him a “wonderful career.” Trump emphasized that Porter insists he is innocent and indicated in a tweet Porter may have been “falsely accused.”

Rather wrote in a Facebook post that Trump’s support of Porter “reminds everyone” that Trump, too, has been “credibly accused of assault (by multiple women).” Twenty-one women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.

Rather also pointed out that, like Porter, there are several people in the White House still lacking security clearance — including Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Trump’s “incredible cocoon of privilege and ego ... blinds him to the sheer horror of his statements in defense of Mr. Porter,” Rather said.

“Debating whether credibly accused wife beaters should be allowed the honor ... to serve in the White House isn’t democracy. It’s madness — and a moment of sadness for the country,” Rather concluded.

Both of Porter’s ex-wives told media they divorced Porter because of his violence. Both also said they were contacted in 2016 by a woman — reportedly working in the Trump administration — who said she was a girlfriend of Porter and was being abused by him, CNN reported.

Porter’s first wife, Colbie Holderness, told The Intercept that Porter punched her in the face in 2005. She provided photos of herself with a black eye.

Senior White House aide Rob Porter physically assaulted two ex-wives, they tell @theintercept. Full story to come in the morning.

Porter’s second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, told The Daily Mail her ex-husband emotionally, mentally and physically abused her. She said Porter once visited her in her home, violating a restraining order, and broke a window with his fist.

On Friday, Trump defended Porter, saying: “As you probably know, he says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that.”

He also tweeted on Saturday, without mentioning Porter’s name: “People’s lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation ... There is no recovery for someone falsely accused — life and career are gone.”

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018Dreamers, or young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, continue to face an uncertain future after Congress approved a budget compromise deal Friday but offered no legislative solution for the rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA.

Among those could be facing deportation after nearly a lifetime in the U.S. is Mo, who originally hails from Mexico and identifies as LGBTQ. In the Human Rights Campaign video above, Mo said he is “terrified” of having the future he planned reversed at any moment.

“The United States is my home. I live here; my entire life is here. I have a future planned out in my head,” the University of Chicago student said in the clip. “I don’t know anyone in Mexico. Going back would really mean just me arriving without any kind of plan. So it’s terrifying.”

When President Donald Trump ended DACA in September, he gave Congress until March 5 to extend protections for the nearly 800,000 Dreamers residing in the U.S. The president and others lawmakers continue to use March 5 as a target deadline ― with no resolution in sight.

Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2018

HRC’s Director of Outreach and Engagement Alejandro Avilés told HuffPost his organization aims to “change hearts and minds of anyone willing to listen” with the release of the Feb. 6 video.

“As a gay man and the son of immigrants, I understand how difficult it can be to listen to public servants dehumanizing the type of people who raised me. This is unacceptable,” he said. “Their stories compel voters and elected officials to recognize their humanity and acknowledge they are just as American as I am.”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A classified memo by congressional Democrats related to investigations of Russian influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is “very political and long” and must be “heavily redacted” before it could be released, President Donald Trump said on Twitter on Saturday.

The release of the memo was blocked by Trump on Friday, kicking off a new skirmish between Democrats and the White House. Written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, is was intended to rebut a Republican document made public last week with Trump’s consent.

The memo by committee Republicans claimed bias against Trump by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department in the federal investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election.

The Intelligence Committee had voted unanimously on Monday to release the document drafted by the panel’s Democrats, contingent on the Republican president agreeing.

“The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency,” Trump tweeted. “Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!”

Trump’s decision to block the release of the memo infuriated Democrats, who said it showed a double standard on transparency on the part of the Republican president.

Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Saturday that he will review redactions recommended by the FBI and Justice Department.

“We hope this matter can be quickly resolved so the committee can return to its charge - fully investigating the Russian interference in our election and the role of the Trump campaign, and what steps need to be taken to protect against foreign interference in the next election, now only months away,” Schiff said.

He was referring to November’s U.S. elections in which all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 34 of 100 Senate seats are in play. Currently, Republicans hold majorities in both chambers. Democrats hope Trump’s low popularity in public opinion polls will help them win majorities, and some analysts give them a good chance.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, in a statement posted on Twitter, called on Democrats to accept the Justice Department’s recommendations and “make the appropriate technical changes and redactions” so that the memo can be declassified as soon as possible.

Trump on Feb. 2 allowed the release of the Republican document with no redactions, even though the Justice Department and FBI argued against making it public. The FBI expressed “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the Republic memo.

Democrats said it mischaracterized highly sensitive classified information and was intended to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.

Trump repeatedly has denied any such collusion.

Late on Friday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Trump of “hypocrisy at its worst” in blocking, at least for now, release of the House Democrats’ memo.

“Any minor redactions should be made as quickly as possible and the memo should be released,” she said.Top White House officials defended the administration’s handling of allegations against Rob Porter, the staff secretary who resigned this week amid accusations that he had physically abused his two ex-wives. But in television appearances on Sunday, the officials struggled to offer a clear timeline for when senior staff knew about the allegations.

Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House counsel Donald McGahn have come under increasing scrutiny after the Washington Post reported last week that they knew about the allegations against Porter at least a year ago. Meanwhile, Porter remained in his high-level position in the White House despite not having a completed security clearance.

The White House has maintained that top officials did not know about the extent of the allegations until this Tuesday, and that Porter was out by Wednesday. But there were also varying claims about whether Porter resigned or was terminated, and when exactly he would be leaving his White House job. McGahn and Kelly have taken the brunt of that criticism for how the White House handled the Porter situation, as the two most-senior people dealing with personnel issues.

In an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said there was “no way for me to know what those two men knew, because I’m not in that line, and nor should I be.”

Conway also responded to reports that Kelly had offered to resign over the matter and told host Jake Tapper that Trump is not seeking to replace him.

“I spoke to the president last night. I told him I would be with you today. And he said, ‘Please tell Jake that I have full faith in Chief of Staff John Kelly and that I’m not actively searching for replacements,’” she said.

She added that Trump says Kelly “is doing a great job and that he has full faith in him.”

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump aide Marc Short acknowledged the situation could indicate “a lack of communication between different elements in the White House.” But he prefaced that comment by noting the affection many in the White House have for Porter.

“I think that Rob is a friend to many of us in the administration. Rob is somebody who is a Rhodes Scholar, is a Harvard-educated guy. He did a great job as staff secretary,” said Short, the legislative affairs director. “But there can be no tolerance for domestic abuse, and there can be no tolerance for violence against women. We have to be absolutely clear about that.”

Short said he could not weigh in on the timeline of when senior officials knew about the allegations against Porter.

“It’s a fair question. I don’t know to be honest. I don’t know who knew what, when at this point,” said Short. “I do know what Gen. Kelly has told me, which is he learned the full information Tuesday and by Wednesday morning Rob Porter was out.”

On CBS’ “Face The Nation,” Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the handling of the Porter situation was “completely reasonable and normal.”

Trump and top officials gave Porter the “benefit the doubt,” Mulvaney said, “up until the time that it became obvious when the photographs came out that the person was not being honest with the president.” He referred to photos that showed Porter’s first wife with a black eye after he allegedly hit her.Semen Elistratov of Russia reacts after clinching the bronze medal in the men’s 1500m short track speed skating competition at the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Speed skater Semen Elistratov, the first athlete from Russia to win a medal at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is reportedly under investigation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after he dedicated his accomplishment to compatriots he said had been banned from the Winter Games in a “such a hard and unfair way.”

“I have difficulties to hold back my tears,” Elistratov said at a press conference following his third-place finish in the men’s 1500m short track speed skating event on Saturday, according to The Guardian. “I am incredibly happy that I did it, in spite of all the circumstances around Russian sport. I dedicate this medal to all guys that have been excluded from these Games in such a hard and unfair way. This medal is for you.”

The BBC reported that the IOC ― which banned Russia from competing at the Winter Olympics over its state-backed doping program ― was investigating Elistratov’s comments because of their apparently political nature. As one of the athletes competing at Pyeongchang under the banner of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team, Elistatrov must follow strict IOC guidelines, including not wearing his country’s colors and refraining from “any public form of publicity, activity and communication associated with the national flag, anthem, emblem and symbol.”

“We have a surveillance program looking at the action and behavior of the OAR team and they will report back at the end of the Games to the executive board to see if not just the letter but the spirit of the law has been breached,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told the BBC. “It’s for that expert team to look at it.”CNN is facing a backlash over an article about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, which critics claim paints her family’s repressive regime in a positive light.

The piece, published on Saturday, is headlined: “Kim Jong Un’s sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics.”

The article does note that Kim Jong Un “has ruled with an iron fist since coming to power” and operates “Nazi-style prison camps.”

It says Kim Yo Jong, whose attendance at the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, has attracted wide attention, is “seen by some as her brother’s answer to American first daughter Ivanka Trump.” Kim Yo Jong, the article says, “is not only a powerful member of Kim Jong Un’s kitchen cabinet but also a foil to the perception of North Korea as antiquated and militaristic.”

She “made headlines across the globe,” according to CNN, when on Saturday she invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to visit the North.

Critics including Russian chess legend and political activist Garry Kasparov have claimed the article is “propaganda.”

CNN did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Canada’s Mark McMorris left everything out on the course during Sunday’s slopestyle final, securing a second Olympic bronze medal and completing a heroic comeback from injury.

Riding in the back country with his brother Craig in March, the then-23-year-old caught an edge as he took off for a jump and spiralled into a tree.

McMorris broke his jaw and left arm, ruptured his spleen, suffered a pelvic fracture, rib fractures and a collapsed lung.

The injuries were so severe that McMorris feared he might lose his life.

Now though he is back on an Olympic podium and the 24-year-old believes this medal means more to him than the bronze from Sochi four years ago.

“It feels pretty special to stand on this podium again after everything,” said McMorris after his final run.

“Not getting to participate much over the past couple of years has been pretty tough but really pumped to land a run that was definitely gold medal worthy if there were a little less sketches but I am stoked to put it down.”

“I need to pinch myself because I should have some permanent damage from what my accident entailed.”

Speaking to Reuters before the Olympics, McMorris had said the injuries had given him a new outlook on life.

These thoughts were still present after Sunday’s final, won by American Redmond Gerard, as McMorris said he was just pleased to be healthy and riding once again.

“I think it doesn’t really matter (what medal you get) as long as you are out here riding and boarding as good as you can,” enthused McMorris.

“There is nothing to worry about. The judging is out of your hands and so you just have to try your best and that is what I did and I was rewarded.”
