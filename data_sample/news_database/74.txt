The massive teacher walkout in Oklahoma is coinciding with candidate filing days for state office, and so far a record number of Oklahomans are throwing their hats into the ring to challenge the status quo.

The Oklahoma State Election Board says 458 people filed as candidates on Wednesday ― the first day they could do so ― which is the highest number on record going back to 2000, the first year for which the agency has data. The next biggest year was 2014, when 419 filed on day one.

Bryan Dean, a spokesman for the agency, said it does not break down the filers by occupation, though anecdotally many of the candidates appear to be teachers.

“The enthusiasm surrounding the ongoing demonstrations is likely at least partially responsible for the numbers we’ve seen,” Dean explained.

Dean said candidates were on pace to set a record for day two filings on Thursday as well. The third and final day to file is Friday.

Teachers around the state walked off the job on April 2 to demand more money for schools, and thousands have since descended upon the state capitol in Oklahoma City each day to pressure lawmakers. The walkout is part of a wave of teacher strikes taking place in red states that have passed tax cuts while slashing education funding in recent years.

The candidate filing numbers are just the latest indication that the ongoing teacher rebellions could have lasting political implications. In West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona ― all states where strikes have occurred or are currently in the works ― teachers have been prodding one another to run for office or campaign on behalf of candidates, mostly Democrats, who will prioritize education.

As HuffPost reported last week, teachers in Kentucky are now jumping into state races, just as they battle lawmakers over cuts to teacher pensions and school funding.

“The civic engagement has been amplified quite a bit.” - Beth Wallis, Oklahoma teacher

Peggy DeFrange, a retired teacher who filed Wednesday to run for an Oklahoma House seat as a Democrat, has had her campaign up and running since August, with education being her top issue. She was part of the last teacher walkout to hit the state, back in 1990.

“We’ve had such major tax cuts in Oklahoma ... Oklahoma has just not been an education-friendly state,” she said. “I know what it’s like to walk into a classroom and not have enough textbooks and not have the resources you need.

“I’ve been accused of playing the teacher card [as a candidate],” she added. “Yes, I’m a teacher. If that’s what it means, then I’ll play the teacher card.”

Republicans control both chambers of the statehouse as well as the governor’s mansion in Oklahoma. The majority of those who’d filed to run for office as of Thursday did so as Republicans.

Over the past decade, Oklahoma has led the nation in cuts to its education formula funding, the primary way that state money gets steered to local schools. The state ranks 49th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay. The budget squeeze created by years of tax cuts has led to overcrowded classrooms, dilapidated schools and a shortage of qualified teachers.

The teacher walkout stretched into its ninth day Thursday. Although lawmakers had passed a pair of revenue-raising measures, it still had not met the funding demands laid out by teachers at the outset.

Beth Wallis, who teaches in the Tulsa suburbs and has been protesting at the capitol, said she hasn’t seen her fellow teachers so politically active before.Trevor Noah criticized President Donald Trump’s tweeted threats to fire missiles at Syria in retaliation for its domestic chemical attack.

But not for reasons you might think.

“The Daily Show” host on Wednesday had a problem with the president’s choice of words. Trump seemed to be acting more like a matchmaker than world leader when he responded to Russia’s warning that it would shoot down any U.S. missiles by tweeting: “Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and ‘smart.’ ”

“It sounds like he’s trying to fix them up with the missiles,” Noah said. “It’s like he’s saying to the Russians, ’I know you don’t like blind dates but these missiles they’re really nice, really smart. Just come, no pressure. It’s just a launch.”We still don't get to see who went to visit President Donald Trump himself. Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images

The Trump administration has released some White House visitor logs as part of a settlement with a watchdog group that sued to see the records.

Public Citizen had accused the Trump administration of violating the Freedom of Information Act in its August 2017 lawsuit. The group announced Wednesday that it was “pleased” the White House was finally releasing some visitor logs, although it expressed skepticism at the administration’s reasons for redacting parts of the disclosed records.

The logs released late Tuesday detailed visitors during February of this year to three agencies within the White House complex: the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Council on Environmental Quality. Visitor records for the Office of National Drug Control Policy will be released soon, according to Public Citizen.

“The public now can see who is visiting these four agencies, as they should have been able to see all along,” said Robert Weissman, the group’s president, in a statement. “Now we’ll at least have a window into the corporate and ideological lobbyists who are driving Trump administration policy.”

As Public Citizen noted, the logs revealed the names of several lobbyists and industry advocates who had visited the OMB, including known climate change deniers Myron Bell and Marlo Lewis, anti-regulation advocate Jim Tozzi, and Laurie Holmes, a representative for the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association.

The watchdog group expressed concern, however, at how many names remained hidden in the OMB’s visitor log: More than 530 of its 2,000 entries were redacted. The Office of Science and Technology Policy’s log had 75 redacted entries and the Council on Environmental Quality’s log had six.

“Public Citizen is skeptical that all of the redactions are proper under FOIA and intends to raise the issue with the agencies,” the group said.

Under the Public Citizen settlement, reached in February, the Trump administration agreed to release all visitor records for the four agencies dating back to the beginning of President Donald Trump’s tenure. As The Hill notes, however, other areas of the White House complex ― including the Executive Office of the President, which is not subject to public records laws ― will not be making their visitor records public.

The Secret Service will have to send the four agency logs to the White House for review every month. The records will then be sent back to those offices, which will have a month to look them over and publish. Records from the past year will be released over the next few months, said Public Citizen.

The Trump administration came under fire last year when it announced its decision to shield White House visitor logs from the eyes of the public, citing “grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.” Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the administration to obtain those records.

In the past, Trump had accused then-President Barack Obama of a lack of transparency over Obama’s treatment of White House visitor logs.

Obama began releasing visitor records early in his presidential tenure but was widely censured for incomplete and poorly maintained logs. For instance, only the names of visitors and not the purposes of their meetings were listed in those records, which made it challenging to figure out exactly who was visiting federal officials and why.Top Republican lawmakers will be allowed to review classified information pertaining to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, the White House said, after wrangling to get a hold of documents related to an FBI informant who reportedly spoke to Trump campaign officials.

Law enforcement and intelligence officials met with President Donald Trump on Monday and agreed to convene another meeting for the review.

“White House Chief of Staff Kelly will immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.

Monday’s meeting, which included Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, focused on congressional requests for documents pertaining specifically to the FBI source.

Trump demanded Sunday that the Department of Justice look into whether someone had infiltrated his campaign for political purposes ― and whether someone within the Obama administration had requested the spying. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that the Justice Department would expand its inquiry to look into the matter.

GOP congressional leaders have been fighting for months to get their hands on documents related to the Russia probe to no avail, making it unclear as to why the Justice Department appeared to cave in this latest instance.

Rudy Giuliani, who leads Trump’s legal team, told HuffPost on Monday that the president wouldn’t agree to an interview with Mueller’s team without first learning more about the informant.

“We can’t let our guy go in and be questioned without knowing this,” Giuliani said. The decision to set up the meeting, Giuliani added, was made by Trump and his White House lawyers.President Donald Trump likes things clean. Really clean.

The president has called himself a “clean hands freak” and considers handshaking “one of the curses of American society.”

In addition to an obsession with cleanliness, Trump is in love with the word, as the below mashup by Vice News helpfully demonstrates.

It shows the president saying “clean” over and over ― making the word almost seem a hypnotic mantra.President Donald Trump’s deputy national security adviser is leaving the White House, officials confirmed Thursday.

Ricky Waddell “plans to step down from his position,” a spokeswoman for the White House confirmed in a statement to HuffPost.

“He will stay on board for the immediate future to help ensure a smooth and orderly transition,” according to the statement. “Dr. Waddell is highly respected and very well liked within the White House, and the United States Army. We thank him for his continued service.”

Waddell’s departure, first reported by Axios, comes about three weeks after Trump announced that H.R. McMaster was leaving his role as national security adviser.

Trump appointed John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to replace McMaster. Bolton started his new position on Tuesday and is expected to make personnel changes, Axios reported. At least two other senior National Security Council officials have resigned since Bolton’s appointment.

Waddell, a major general for the U.S. Army Reserve, assumed his role in May 2017. His departure date has yet to be confirmed, a White House spokesperson told Axios.

Waddell is the latest Trump administration official to leave in recent months. Homeland security adviser Tom Bossert resigned Tuesday, and David Shulkin was fired as the secretary of veteran affairs on March 28.The Texas State Board of Education decides that teaching Mexican-American studies to a majority-Hispanic school population makes sense. Mike Stone / Reuters

AUSTIN, Texas ― The Texas State Board of Education voted Wednesday to create statewide standards for classes on Mexican-American studies, handing a major victory to educators and activists who have pressed for wider adoption of such courses for the past five years.

The vote makes Texas the latest state to embrace ethnic studies, which some education researchers credit with boosting student achievement in minority-majority schools by engaging cultures often ignored in traditional curricula and emphasizing critical thinking skills. On Wednesday, the Board of Education’s conference room was packed with teachers, students and researchers, clamoring for the state to set the standards needed to make the classes more widely available in Texas.

“I wouldn’t even begin to do it just to tell you how historic this moment is in Texas,” board member Ruben Cortez told HuffPost.

Wednesday’s vote is technically preliminary but is expected to be finalized at a meeting on Friday.

Educators first began pressing for a statewide course in 2013. More than half of the Texas public school population is Hispanic. But instead of creating a state standard, the Republican-dominated Board of Education opted to let local school districts create their own classes.

Dozens of districts took them up on the offer, and educators pooled resources to improvise the new classes.

But while roughly 35 schools in Texas now have courses in Mexican-American studies, the lack of statewide standards left teachers spending more time creating redundant curricula than engaging students with it, according to testimony offered Wednesday. And without a state standard to follow, some courses were out of sync with similar U.S. history classes, one teacher said.

An existing Mexican-American studies course in Houston public schools will be used as a model to develop the state standard. At the request of conservative Board of Education member David Bradley, the course will be named “Ethnic Studies: An Overview of Americans of Mexican Descent.” Bradley contended that hyphenated terms like “Mexican-American” are divisive, according to the Austin American-Statesman.

The movement to bring ethnic studies to public schools gained national attention in 2010 when Arizona Republicans passed a law banning a Mexican-American studies program in Tucson. They argued that it bred discrimination against white people and politicized the classroom. A federal judge struck down that law after a two-week bench trial last year.

But while the Arizona case wound its way through the courts, California took the opposite approach, mandating the creation of an ethnic studies model to serve public schools in 2016. Even before that, several school districts ― including the state’s largest ones in Los Angeles and San Francisco ― had begun offering such classes.Tom Williams via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― Just 24 hours after announcing he won’t run for re-election, Speaker Paul Ryan threw House Republicans another curveball Thursday by telling reporters he believes Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) supports Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to be the next speaker.

Ryan said he was “encouraged” when Scalise said Thursday morning that McCarthy ought to be the person to replace the speaker.

Sources told HuffPost that Ryan and Scalise had a private conversation Thursday morning, and Scalise reiterated to Ryan his public position that he is not challenging McCarthy for speaker. But Scalise may not have known that Ryan intended to broadcast that statement to the Washington press corps.

Scalise also said Thursday morning on Fox News that he’s “never run against Kevin, and wouldn’t run against Kevin.” But that statement may be more semantics than truth, as both Scalise and McCarthy have been jockeying behind the scenes to secure votes, and Scalise may believe his path to the speakership is viable if McCarthy finds he doesn’t have the votes.

Either way, it’s clear that Ryan intends to set up McCarthy for the position should Republicans retain the House. While Ryan has avoided endorsing a successor, the move to back Scalise into a corner should be interpreted as a signal of preference. And while Scalise has said in the past that he wouldn’t challenge McCarthy for the GOP’s top spot, members were under the impression that Scalise may be reconsidering that stance now that Ryan’s departure is assured.

Ryan set off this leadership scramble Wednesday when he announced his retirement from Congress, and he reiterated Thursday that he intends to remain speaker through the rest of the year, despite a small group of lawmakers already pushing to hold leadership elections sooner.

The current plan that Ryan laid out Wednesday is for him to serve as speaker through the end of the year, and hold leadership elections ― as planned ― at the end of November. At that time, Republicans would know exactly what position lawmakers are running for as the GOP’s hold over the House is in question with the upcoming midterm elections.Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said a requirement that some food stamp recipients take drug tests could end up in a bill his panel will soon debate. Aaron Bernstein / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― The U.S. government runs just one large-scale program that supplements poor people’s incomes and Republicans want to make that support more difficult for some to obtain.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, gives more than 40 million Americans a monthly food allowance averaging about $125 per recipient ― less than a typical person needs for a month’s worth of food.

Republicans on Capitol Hill want more SNAP recipients to enroll in government training programs or take available jobs that are likely to pay little. Republicans in the Trump administration are considering a plan promoted by several GOP governors to have some SNAP recipients urinate in cups to prove they’re not on drugs.

The Department of Agriculture may allow states to drug test SNAP recipients, according to emails obtained and published this week by the Associated Press. The tests would be required mostly for able-bodied people who have no dependents, according to the AP.

Republican governors such as Scott Walker of Wisconsin have long wanted to drug test some food stamp beneficiaries, but had been blocked from doing so by the Obama administration.

An Agriculture Department spokeswoman said requiring drug testing for food stamp eligibility is illegal under federal law, but that some states are interested in tests for those recipients receiving additional benefits, such as work training.

“It is USDA’s responsibility to ensure that states are properly administering SNAP programs and we are reviewing guidance on this topic for states expressing interest,” the spokeswoman said.

On Thursday, Republican lawmakers formally unveiled a proposal that would reduce food stamp enrollment by requiring more beneficiaries to work or enroll in the training programs.

The bill doesn’t include a drug testing requirement, but House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas), the bill’s lead author, said such a provision could wind up in a later version of the legislation. The committee will consider the bill next week.

“We have some members on the committee who have a keen interest in that,” Conaway told HuffPost. “We’ll have a fulsome conversation; does that work, does that not work.”

Both the drug testing scheme and Conaway’s training proposals face significant obstacles. Administratively greenlighting drug tests would likely result in a swift legal challenge. The Agriculture Department during the Obama administration contended that federal law doesn’t allow it, and a federal court tossed a lawsuit by Walker challenging that position.

On Capitol Hill, Conaway’s legislation faces a narrow path through the House ― with Democrats and some conservative Republicans opposed to it ― and an even tougher road in the Senate. The food stamp provisions are part of a larger-scale farm bill that include an array of agriculture welfare programs that technically expire at the end of September.

The drug testing and training proposals are premised on complaints from businesses that they can’t find enough workers for available jobs, though another explanation could be that the unfilled jobs don’t pay enough to attract workers. Wage growth for all but the wealthiest Americans has been sluggish-to-nonexistent for the past decade.

The bill would expand the pool of unemployed able-bodied adults required to engage in “work activities” in order to receive SNAP benefits. Such people made up about 8.8 percent of food stamp recipients in 2016, down from 10.5 percent in 2013.

Agriculture Committee member Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) emphasized that the bill isn’t designed to save money by kicking people off food stamps. The legislation would use the savings from lower enrollment to pay for guaranteed slots in training programs for SNAP recipients subject to the requirements. Currently, most states don’t guarantee SNAP recipients spots in training programs.

“We’re not taking anything away,” Thompson said.

The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said Republicans are being unrealistic about how much it would cost to set the training programs.“I take two things from these hearings. First, this was the Big Bang of Silicon Valley politics, with a host of important issues coming to light that will be debated and worked through for years. Already the consequences are rolling through. To take one example, Facebook rolled out a new data targeting policy to advertisers as Zuckerberg was testifying. To take another, Federal Trade Commission nominee Rebecca Kelly Slaughter had a nominating hearing at the very same time as Zuckerberg’s appearance before the House. She will soon be one of five new nominees at the commission that regulates Facebook. She took multiple questions from Republican and Democratic senators on the Facebook data and monopoly problem, which is a signal that the Senate expects action from the FTC.

“Second, the problem with Facebook is its market power. The problem in a nutshell is that [it’s as if] Facebook owns the phone network, but listens to what everyone says and manipulates them based on what it hears to serve Facebook’s interest. Facebook has locked in two billion users into its essential communications services, along with millions of content producers. It uses this position to engage in surveillance and manipulation of the flow of information among these people and institutions. It then sells the ability to manipulate these people to advertisers and has built a host of tools to allow those advertisers to engage in discrimination on who sees their ads. Fundamentally, most of the harmful symptoms that emerge from Facebook ― from its rampant privacy violations to fomenting ethnic hatred and genocide to content discrimination ― are a function of its misuse of its market power over an essential communications service.

“There are a number of ways to make Facebook safe for democracy. But fundamentally, we must break the company’s power by splitting off its various social networks (Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook), ending its ability to discriminate and spy on its users, and forcing competition into the market. U.S. Representative Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) summed up the two days of testimony best with her statement on the problem with Facebook. She said, ‘In the end, Americans do not like to be manipulated.’”WASHINGTON ― Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, who is President Donald Trump’s pick to be the nation’s next secretary of state, says that he still opposes gay marriage.

“I continue to hold that view,” Pompeo said Thursday during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

But Pompeo, a former three-term congressman from Kansas, maintained that his views on gay marriage do not obstruct him from being able to treat all people with respect.

“I believe it’s the case we have married gay couples at the CIA. You should know I treated them with the exact same set of rights,” he said, adding later: “My respect for every individual, regardless of the sexual orientation, is the same.”

Pompeo’s comments came during an exchange with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who grilled the CIA director about comments in which the former congressman once suggested that gay sex was a “perversion.” Pompeo declined to answer the question head-on and reiterated that he’d treat everyone equally.

Booker also questioned Pompeo about his ties to prominent anti-Muslim figure Frank Gaffney, whose radio show he appeared on multiple times, and Pompeo’s view that Muslims in America who do not speak out against terror are complicit in extremism.

“Each and every human, not just Americans, each and every human being has an obligation to push back against this extremist use of violence, from whatever faith,” Pompeo responded.

But Pompeo’s comments didn’t seem to assuage Booker.

“You’re going to be representing this country and their values abroad in nations where gay individuals are under untold persecution, untold violence. Your views do matter,” the senator said.WASHINGTON — The lead spokesperson for the Interior Department labeled a CNN reporter with a vulgar insult after being pressed to answer questions about Secretary Ryan Zinke’s travel, emails released as part of a public records request show.

“Rene is a fucking idiot,” agency spokeswoman Heather Swift wrote to one of her colleagues, referring to CNN correspondent René Marsh.

“She sounds like one,” responded deputy director of communications Russell Newell.

SCREENSHOT/DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

The insult stemmed from an Oct. 3 inquiry in which Marsh asked the agency’s press team several follow-up questions about Zinke’s trip in June to Las Vegas, where he met with the Vegas Golden Knights hockey team, and other taxpayer-funded flights. Swift promptly replied to say that she was “checking into this.”

The following day, Marsh emailed again to ask when she could expect a response. Swift didn’t answer, prompting Marsh to follow up again on Oct. 5. Swift told her that she was “working on it” but that “the person who handles the Secretary’s travel is currently out of the office so it’s taking a little longer than usual.”

On Oct. 6, Marsh sent two more emails to the agency’s press team. In the second she wrote: “We have repeatedly asked the press office for answers to the below questions and for 4 days now we have been told you are working on it and today we’ve received no response at all. We are asking questions that the public has every right to know as these are their tax dollars and for Interior not answer any of the below questions is really hard to understand. Is the DOI issuing a no comment on all of the below questions?”

Interior finally sent a response that evening but failed to answer several of Marsh’s specific questions. Emails show that Marsh again insisted that the Department of the Interior provide answers.

Later that evening, Newell emailed his colleague Swift a draft of an email he was considering sending to Marsh in which he planned to question the reporter about whether she’d asked previous interior secretaries such questions.

“I was about to send this to Rene but I’ll send to you instead and maybe it will make me feel better,” Newell wrote to Swift. “Just had to get it off my chest. The double standard is nauseating.”

On Oct. 12, Marsh co-authored an article for CNN headlined “Zinke’s Travel Continues to Raise Ethical Questions.”

The Department of the Interior and Marsh did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

The Vegas trip is among those that have come under scrutiny. On June 26, Zinke and several staffers chartered an oil company plane for a flight from Las Vegas to Montana, costing taxpayers $12,375, as Politico first reported.

Zinke’s use of private planes at taxpayers’ expense — a controversy he’s shrugged off as “a little BS” — is being investigated by the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General. The watchdog office is expected to release its final report next week, according to CNN.The season 10 cast of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Santiago Felipe via Getty Images

On season 9 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” New York queen Peppermint revealed to her fellow competitors and fans that she identified as a trans woman, and began a dialogue on gender often missing from primetime television.

The coming-out moment spotlighted that, aside from the camp, wit and glamour we expect from the now-10-season strong VH1 series, RuPaul’s show achieves something incredible for mainstream entertainment. Using wigs and gowns and makeup, it is slowly undoing rigid concepts inherent to the gender binary, and bringing complicated conversations about gender theory and performance to mainstream audiences.

What was once reserved for the annals of academic journals is now taking place on our personal screens.

And perhaps the most nuanced way gender has been explored on “RPDR” is through the voices of trans drag queens themselves. In being both trans and drag performers, these queens exist at the intersection of performed and lived gender identities. They are the driving force behind discussions of what it means to rewrite gender expression on and offstage.

Put in “Drag Race” terms, “we’re all born naked and the rest is drag.” And there are trans and gender non-conforming queens who, in their unique drag styles, rewrite what it means to express one’s gender.

In a phone interview with HuffPost, Peppermint spoke about the balance trans queens strike between their on- and off-stage identities. For many, she said, drag can function as a bridge to a more authentic, self-realized gender expression in their daily lives.

Today, “Peppermint the drag queen and Peppermint the everyday woman are definitely the same personality,” she said. But this wasn’t always the case. When she began drag at 18, she was preoccupied with projecting a sense of “realness,” or conventional femininity. But the longer she spent on stage crafting a persona, the more she realized how much room she had to explore her gender identity in less constrained ways.

“It was the only expression of this femininity I could indulge in without any pushback,” she said. “As I was able to come into my trans-ness I realized that I didn’t necessarily have to take my drag as seriously. My womanhood suddenly wasn’t at stake.”

Coined in 1990 by Judith Butler, the phrase “gender performance” purports that gender is rooted in societal construction and is thus made real only in an individual’s chosen actions or “performance.” According to Butler, gender is not tied to the physical body. Instead it’s acted out each day through clothing choices, personality and other expressions of personality; gender is ultimately up to the individual and how they feel.

“Drag has been a way for me to have these concentrated sessions almost of self-exploration in front of people,” trans queen Daphne Always told HuffPost. “And I think the more I’ve done that, the more I’ve started breaking down this line between my drag self and my personal self to where what I do onstage is becoming closer and closer to just who I am.”

Daphne started performing in 2011 when she arrived at New York University and immediately realized that drag offered her an outlet for the gender expression she was denied in her daily life. Like Peppermint, she embraced gender as fluid performance.

For many “RPDR” fans, who prior to watching the show lacked the context to explore gender as a changing expression of self, queens like Daphne and Peppermint are revolutionary. After appearing on “Drag Race,” Peppermint quickly understood the impact she had on viewers.

“I would meet people at, say, DragCon, and sometimes it would be a parent saying, ‘We’re so happy our young queer child, gender non-conforming, or even trans child has come out to us,’” she said. “And they’ve been able to kind of bond and connect not only around how my story resonated but then also how Drag Race has kind of opened the doors for them in general.”

Peppermint holds these moments close to heart because she knows she is one of the few representatives for trans women on screen.

It’s difficult to find images of trans and gender-nonconforming experiences represented in mainstream pop culture. Recently, Netflix’s “One Day at a Time” gained attention for its queer and gender-nonconforming teen characters, but the show is one of very few.

In 2012, GLAAD consolidated 10 years of research into a study called “Victims or Villains: Examining Ten Years of Transgender Images on Television.” In the examination of trans portrayal on television, the study found that of the “102 episodes and non-recurring storylines of scripted television that contained transgender characters,” 54 percent were described as perpetuating “negative representations.” Only 12 percent were considered thoughtful and non-stereotypical portrayals.

“Drag Race” itself hasn’t always had a rosy relationship with trans representation. During an interview with “The Guardian” in March, RuPaul made comments many read as transphobic, spurring backlash from both fans and queens who had appeared on the show. Beyond insinuating that trans girls gain their womanhood through surgery, he also stated that he would not allow transitioning trans girls on the show.

“It’s just really a shame that [Ru] decided to share these ideas that really boil down to saying trans women are men until they have surgeries,” Daphne told HuffPost. “A huge majority of America sees ‘Drag Race’ as maybe their only source of information about non-cis binary gender. These people are looking to RuPaul and what they hear is this information that’s just really flawed about the experience of trans people, non-binary people and women.”

Ru later apologized on Twitter, but the incident reflected a larger issue within the queer community — the resistance to fully accept non-cis queer people. For both Peppermint and Daphne, the answer is allyship and uplifting the voices not often heard.

“Allyship is something that a member of the community grants to you or ascribes to you. I don’t think allyship is something that you can claim for yourself,” Daphne said. “[It] has to involve placing the voices of the community front and center and making sure they’re the ones directing the conversation happening in media.”

Controversy aside, “RuPaul’s Drag Race” remains one of the few mainstream outlets for marginalized queerness. In making academic theories of gender accessible, it paves the way for better trans representation. And that, for Peppermint, is something she’ll never stop fighting for.

“I choose to use my voice quite literally to speak out on behalf of our community. I view it as contributing to the future of trans folk and gender non-conforming people,” she said. “We’ll get there and it’ll be a beautiful place. And I don’t know how long it’ll take but it’s necessary. Someone has to take these steps so I’ll take them.”“I don’t expect a lot of people who love drag to also be like, ‘I love ‘Drag Race,’ and then I got to hear my Chris Stapleton album.’ Not necessarily an obvious crossover,” laughs Trixie Mattel, sitting at Yahoo Entertainment in flawless June Carter Cash drag. But the “RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars 3” winner-turned-country artist is making real inroads in the music world with her two autoharp-laden Americana/folk albums, “Two Birds” and “One Stone.” The latter album recently hit No. 1 on iTunes’ Singer-Songwriter chart and Billboard’s Heatseekers chart; she’s received glowing coverage in “NME,” NPR, and “Rolling Stone Country”; and she even has an endorsement deal with Fender for her upcoming “Moving Parts” tour. She’s realistic about her long-shot potential to infiltrate the mainstream Nashville scene, but so far, she’s happily finding her country niche.

“I think the perception of audiences that love folk and country is they’re perceived to be more closed-minded than they really are,” Trixie asserts. “It’s one of those things where the most extreme voices represent the masses, do you know what I mean? It’s like, not everybody goes to church hates gay people. Not everybody who listens to folk and country would object to drag. I mean, look around — is Dolly [Parton] not in drag? She’s in probably a bigger wig than I am right now! I’ve always found a way to win people over, especially with comedy. … I operate more like the crying-clown territory, where I love to tell jokes, I love sappy folk music, and I love to marry the two together.”

Trixie (real name: Brian Firkus), who started playing guitar at age 13, grew up “deep in the country” of small-town Wisconsin (which inspired her new song “Little Sister”). However, she was more into “acoustic-guitar-driven pop music” like Avril Lavigne, Sheryl Crow, Oasis, and Michelle Branch as a kid. “But in my bones, the way I grew up, it was the fabric of folk music,” Trixie says. It was her late grandfather, a musician, who inspired her latent appreciation of country: “I think some of the happiest memories of my life were learning to play guitar at the kitchen table, learning Roy Orbison or George Jones or Conway Twitty — music I didn’t necessarily love [at first], but that’s what I knew from home.”

Trixie’s grandpa also influenced her colorful, Hee Haw-on-steroids drag aesthetic, in a way: “He always said, ‘Being a musician is 40 percent how good you are, and 60 percent how good you look doing it.’ And I think with drag, I took that a little far,” Trixie laughs.

That being said, Trixie has toned down her nuclear-pink Malibu Barbie look for a more “Joanne”-esque vibe for her second album. “The visual inspirations accompany usually musically whatever is inspiring me,” she says. “So when ‘Two Birds’ came out last year, the look was a lot more like square-dancing dresses, big cowboy boots, and big hair. This year, I got a lot more into Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, so the look sort of turned more like late-’60s, a little more lived-in. I don’t just wear pink now. I also experiment with mustard and brown!”

Along with Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, June Carter Cash, Jason Isbell, and Chris Stapleton, Trixie finds major musical inspiration from two fringe-country kindred spirits, Miley Cyrus (Dolly Parton’s goddaughter) and Kacey Musgraves — both of whom have, incredibly, expressed interest in collaborating with Trixie.

“The night I won [‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars 3’], Miley Instagram-messaged me and was like, ‘We gotta do a song!’ And I was like, ‘I would literally throw myself under a truck for you,’” says Trixie. “She is one of my favorites. One of my dreams is to quit drag, go live in the woods somewhere, just write her music for her, and twice a year send her a mixtape and be like, ‘These are your songs. They’re great for you!’ She has such a real, human, storyteller voice. It’s also anti-songbird in a way. There’s a wisdom to it … it has a Stevie Nicks quality to it. It has a depth and such color to it. I love her voice!” Trixie similarly gushes about Musgraves: “The fact that she even knows I’m alive, I’m like, ‘I’ll polish your boots, lady. I’ll quit music and drag today.’”

On the subject of quitting drag, Trixie, age 28, doesn’t think she’ll be a drag queen for the rest of her life (“I don’t think I can make this look good at 45, so I need to evolve somewhere a little more realistic”), and plans to create other comedic characters in the future. But for now, she’s proud to occupy her own country music lane. While other musical “Drag Race” alumni have opted to go the clubby EDM route, Trixie reasons, “That’s how you succeed: You’ve just got to pick something no one has done, no one wants to do, and that way you can say you’re the best at it. … I mean, for a cross-dresser with a guitar to be able to do that stuff, it’s crazy. I saw RuPaul recently, and she was like, ‘You’re doing things that nobody’s ever done. I’m really proud of you.’”

And as for whether Trixie Mattel could ever become a mainstream country star, playing Stagecoach and winning at the ACMs, she says, “I think it could happen. To be honest, it doesn’t occur to me that it can’t. Trixie Mattel has always opened doors for me. It’s closed very few.”

But on Monday’s broadcast of “The Late Late Show,” the host also revealed one of the worst aspects of the ceremony. For himself, at least.

“There were flowers everywhere, the most beautiful flowers you’ve ever seen, and I get quite bad allergies if I’m in such close proximity to flowers,” said Corden. “So for a lot of the ceremony I just needed to sneeze.”

It almost led to an embarrassing moment ― which would have surely reverberated around the world ― when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, asked the congregation if they knew of a reason why the couple should not lawfully marry.

“It is with great sadness and very heavy hearts that we report the passing of Mitzi Shore, the legendary Godmother of the world famous Comedy Store,” the statement said.

“Mitzi was an extraordinary businesswoman and decades ahead of her time who cultivated and celebrated the artistry of stand-up comedy. She was also a loving mother, not only to her own four children, but to the myriad of comedians who adored her. She leaves behind an indelible mark and legacy and has helped change the face of comedy. We will all miss her dearly.”

The Comedy Store will be closed Wednesday.

Mitzi Shore, the mother of comedian Pauly Shore, founded the legendary Los Angeles comedy club, the Comedy Store, in 1972 and became owner two years later. During her tenure, she influenced careers of up-and-coming comedians such as Robin Williams, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Chevy Chase, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, and Richard Pryor.

Mitzi Shore is credited for naming the club, which co-founded by her husband at the time, Sammy Shore and fellow comedian Rudy DeLuca. When Sammy and Mitzi divorced in 1974, Mitzi gained ownership of the club.

At the Comedy Club, Shore famously did not pay her comics, instead, insisting the club provided training to hone their craft, along with exposure to industry insiders. Eventually, comedians went on strike in 1979, demanding to be paid for their work. The strike eventually ended with Shore agreeing to pay comics per set.

Shore was born in Michigan and grew up in Wisconsin. She studied at the University of Wisconsin before leaving to marry Sammy. The two moved to Los Angeles in 1964. The couple had four children, Peter, Scott, Pauly and Sandy.

Comedians and fans took to Twitter to share their tributes to Shore:

“Avengers: Infinity War” is gearing up to be the highest-grossing Marvel movie in history.

According to ticket service Fandago, “Infinity War” is selling over double the number of tickets that “Black Panther” had sold at this point before its release. “Black Panther” is currently the highest-grossing Marvel movie ever and the third highest-grossing film domestically of all time, not adjusting for inflation.

“Moviegoers are rushing to guarantee their seats in advance for what is sure to be one of the most talked-about movies of the decade,” Fandango managing editor Erik Davis told Variety.

However, it’s not just outdoing “Black Panther.” The third Avengers film is selling faster than the last seven Marvel movies combined. That includes some box-office juggernauts like “Thor: Ragnarok,” “Captain America: Civil War” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”

“Infinity War” is estimated to bring in $150 million to $200 million in its opening weekend. This movie is going to break records; it’s simply a question of how many.Skyler Branch pays homage to influential black women on her senior prom dress. Photo: Courtesy of Dayna Branch

Most 17-year-old girls going to senior prom have a simple process for finding the perfect dress, typically determined by a standout cut or their favorite color. But for Skyler Branch of White Station High School in Memphis, Tenn., it was actually a loved one who inspired the teen’s incredible prom dress, which depicts a number of iconic black women.

After the passing of her father’s grandmother, with whom Skyler was particularly close, the teen decided that she wanted to honor her relative on the big night. And as Skyler began to brainstorm, she came up with an homage to multiple inspirational figures.

“She said, ‘Mom, there’s been so many extraordinary African-American women who have done so much for me. I want to show them some respect so that they know that not just the older adults but the younger adults appreciate who paved the way,’” Skyler’s mother Dayna tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “And she found different pictures of all of the people who she wanted on the dress.”

From Michelle Obama and Maya Angelou to Oprah and Taraji P. Henson, Skyler had a clear vision of who she wanted to include. A seamstress named Shannon Pierce made it all happen.

“I called Shannon up and told her what concepts Skyler wanted, and what we wanted the dress to look like,” Dayna says. “We sat down with her, we went over the print and where we wanted everyone to be. She has her great-great grandmothers on there, she has her great grandmothers on there, as well as her grandmothers. She has all of her aunts from Memphis to Houston. Everybody’s on there.”

With the material picked out, Skyler and Dayna went to a print shop to have the photos printed on the dress. Then the dress was cut and jeweled to perfection by Pierce to become a one-of-a-kind piece that blew everyone at prom, and outside of it, away.

Before the dance, Skyler and Dayna went to see Skyler’s other great grandmother, who’s 87, to show her the dress with her face on it. Pictured right on the front, Dayna says that her grandmother was amazed, while other family members cried.

“We didn’t see anything like this before,” Dayna explains of Skyler’s particular design, while making mention of another unique prom dress that made headlines last year: a tribute to Trayvon Martin. The dress worn by Florida teen Milan Bolden-Morris featured photos of Martin, the 17-year-old who was shot to death in 2012, in addition to a number of other individuals killed during police interactions. While Bolden-Morris’s design made a powerful statement about the Black Lives Matter movement, Skyler’s takes a different approach by recognizing black women who beat the odds.

But as the Tennessee teen approaches her start date at college, there’s one person in particular on her dress that serves as a major inspiration.

“Skyler is actually going to school for pre-vet studies,” Dayna says. “One of the women on the dress is Dr. Alfreda J. Webb, the first African-American female veterinarian in the U.S.”

Although Skyler is striving to follow in the footsteps of these stellar female leaders, it’s pretty clear that this teen is already a strong leader in her own right.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on March 06, 2018.

WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan’s announcement Wednesday that he would not seek re-election has already set off a GOP leadership scramble for a position that may not belong to Republicans next year anyway.

Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) are the two clear favorites for the speakership, should Republicans keep the majority (in no way a given). While Scalise said recently he wouldn’t challenge McCarthy for the gavel, the possibility that he now passes on a run seems unlikely. He’ll presumably be engaging in the same jockeying McCarthy will be doing for the next seven months: striking a careful balance between publicly saying you’re focused on keeping the majority while privately maneuvering to secure as many votes as possible.

Ryan’s decision to remain speaker for the rest of the year practically ensures a messy battle. And again, there’s no guarantee the shadow race for speaker ever results in a contested vote. It’s completely conceivable for Republicans to lose the majority and have Scalise decide it’s not worth challenging McCarthy to be minority leader.

Scalise could very well have the inside track for the speakership, while McCarthy remains the favorite to be minority leader.

But there are dozens of other outcomes as well. For one, Ryan could decide his situation as a lame-duck speaker is untenable and decide to resign before his term is up. Or Republicans could force the issue by pushing to move up the leadership elections now.

According to a senior GOP aide who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation, Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) was already working the House floor Wednesday pushing to hold leadership elections sooner rather than later ― a move Scalise might favor if he thinks he has the votes now, or McCarthy could get behind if he wants to force Scalise’s hand in either challenging him for the position or supporting McCarthy to be speaker.

As always, there are also all sorts of different wrenches the House Freedom Caucus could throw into the mix.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) was quick to tell reporters Wednesday that everyone was going to start jockeying for positions now, making it seem like such a situation would be bad for Republicans. But later in the afternoon, after conservatives had thought about the race a little more, Freedom Caucus members seemed happy to see how the midterm elections shake out before choosing a new Republican leadership team.

“The criteria for what makes a good minority leader might be a little different than what makes a good speaker,” Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), the Freedom Caucus member who replaced former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), told HuffPost on Wednesday.

Conservatives may think that one of their own ― like Meadows or former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) ― has a chance at taking the minority leader spot if Republicans lose the House.

Although the vote threshold for such a move is much lower than the 218 votes required on the House floor for a speaker ― the minority leader simply needs the support of a majority of Republicans behind closed doors ― it’s still unlikely a conservative could muster the roughly 100 votes needed for the top spot in the GOP conference. But it’s not impossible, and it’s much more likely than one of them taking the speakership.

In fact, the idea is just plausible enough that it may hold together the fragile situation for Ryan. If the Freedom Caucus refuses to advocate for moving up the leadership elections or pushing Ryan out before the year is up, it’s difficult to see another group of Republicans becoming the instigators in the GOP conference.

And so Ryan’s original vision, where he stays atop the GOP conference through Election Day, might actually come to pass, meaning McCarthy and Scalise and whoever else may want the job will have to campaign delicately for months to come. And even then, the Election Day results could stymie their plans. If GOP losses are really bad, enough Republicans could decide they need a whole new slate of candidates.

“Ryan’s original vision, where he stays atop the GOP conference through Election Day, might actually come to pass, meaning McCarthy and Scalise and whoever else may want the job will have to campaign delicately for months to come.”

Some Republicans have already floated the idea of a “caretaker” speaker, a Republican who would serve for a limited time, like Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) ― whom Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) floated to HuffPost on Wednesday ― or Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) or Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), whom other Republicans have mentioned in the past.

Or the race between McCarthy and Scalise could get so bad that both men end up excluding themselves. They could effectively spoil the conference on either person and a tactician like Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) ends up being speaker. Coupled with a sex scandal, that’s pretty much how now-disgraced former Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) ascended from the chief deputy whip position to the speakership in 1999.

McCarthy, who’s already made his closeness with President Donald Trump a centerpiece of his run for the speakership, could also decide to move on from Congress after the elections, potentially taking a job as White House chief of staff or as a Cabinet secretary. Or maybe he could just decide that he, like Ryan, has had enough of Congress and finally wants to move on.

And Scalise, whose life was already turned upside down less than a year ago when he was shot during a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game, could also decide the continued headaches of leadership just aren’t worth it ― though that seems much more unlikely than McCarthy passing on a job that he already passed on once.

The point is, there are so many outcomes and moving parts to these races that it’s impossible to predict how leadership elections will turn out in seven long months. There’s no telling what Trump might do in the next week, and Ryan’s retirement announcement might embolden the speaker to actually stand up to the president (though don’t hold your breath).Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt directed staff to book travel that allowed him to personally accrue more frequent flier miles, insisting on flying first class on an airline not on the government’s approved list and staying in pricey hotels, according to a bombshell new letter released Thursday by congressional investigators.

The allegations come from Kevin Chmielewski, a lifelong Republican and former Trump aide who served as the EPA’s deputy chief of staff until he was removed for raising alarm over Pruitt’s spending, and are detailed in a six-page letter signed by two senators and three House members, all Democrats. The lawmakers ―Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (MD), Gerald Connolly (Va.), Donald Beyer (Va.) and Sens. Tom Carper (Del.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (RI) ― sent the letter to Pruitt and President Donald Trump.

“He said that when he refused to approve your inappropriate and unethical spending, he claimed he was marginalized, removed from his senior position and placed on administrative leave,” the letter to Pruitt reads.

It adds: “The new information provided by Mr. Chmielewski, if accurate, leaves us certain that your leadership at EPA has been fraught with numerous and repeated unethical and potentially illegal actions on a wide range of consequential matters that you and some members of your staff directed.”

Pruitt allegedly told staff to “find me something to do” in locations around the country to justify spending taxpayer money, according to the letters. Pruitt “frequently stayed in” hotels that exceeded the allowable government per diem by as much as 300 times the cap permitted in exceptional circumstances. On trips to Australia and Italy, the administrator “refused” to stay in the hotels recommended by the U.S. embassy staff there, instead booking more expensive hotels with less on-site security, bringing his personal bodyguards in tow.

Pruitt was reimbursed for these travel expenses when he personally laid out the money for them, though some of his security detail were not fully compensated for their luxury travel, Chmielewski alleged.

Chmielewski told investigators he overheard Pruitt speaking to his landlord, the energy lobbyist who gave him a sweetheart $50-a-night deal on a room in a Capitol Hill condominium. The lobbyist, J. Steven Hart, whose wife co-owns the building, complained that the administrator had failed to pay rent, and that his adult daughter, McKenna Pruitt, damaged the hardwood floors by repeatedly rolling her luggage though the residence while she stayed there during a White House internship.

“We acknowledge the receipt of this letter from Democrats on Capitol Hill and look forward to responding,” EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement to HuffPost.

The letters put more pressure on Pruitt to resign as a ballooning scandal over accusations of rampant corruption and runaway spending continues into a third consecutive week. In a testament to just how quickly the disparate controversies have mounted, The Washington Post reported earlier on Thursday that Pruitt used four different email addresses, prompting concerns that he has avoided releasing documents requested in public records disclosures.

The allegations come as the Senate is poised to vote to confirm Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist and Republican congressional staffer, as the EPA’s deputy administrator, putting him next in line to take over the agency should Pruitt exit.
