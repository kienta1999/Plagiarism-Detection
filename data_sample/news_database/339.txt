Aziz Ansari did not attend the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards, but his presence was definitely felt Sunday night during the announcement of the nominees for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.

When Ansari’s name was called, there was a notable lack of applause. No time was allotted for applause, either.

Ansari won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series, Musical or Comedy just two weeks ago.

Earlier this month in an article published on Babe.net, an unnamed woman described a coercive sexual encounter she had with the 34-year-old comedian and actor that left her feeling violated. Ansari responded to the claims made in the piece by stating that he believed the interaction to be “completely consensual” and that he has taken the accuser’s “words to heart and responded privately.”

Ansari was nominated for his role on the Netflix series “Master of None” and was the sole nominee — of a category that included fellow nominees Anthony Anderson, Larry David, Sean Hayes, William H. Macy and Marc Maron — to not receive applause.

The award ultimately went to William H. Macy for his role in “Shameless,” but many on Twitter were quick to note the lack of applause, and the actor’s notable absence.

With “Black Panther” and “Avengers: Infinity War,” Marvel has dominated theaters around the world this year. Now Marvel is branching out their comics division on a global scale.

Marvel teamed up with NetEase Comics, one of China’s largest online comic platforms, and this week rolled out their first official Chinese superheroes created specifically for Chinese audiences.

Until now Marvel has nearly always featured Chinese characters in a supporting capacity or as villains. Two of the newest heroes are Aero, a woman able to control air currents (pictured above), and Lin Lie, a boy who obtains a powerful ancient sword to battle evil (pictured below).

Marvel / NetEase

In the 1970s, after Marvel acquired the rights to Sax Rohmer’s “Fu Manchu” pulp series, they introduced a character named Shang-Chi, a Chinese master of kung fu and Fu Manchu’s previously unknown son. He had his own series that ran from the mid ’70s to the early ’80s, but certainly “Fu Manchu” was not the most culturally sensitive source material.

Marvel’s collaboration with NetEase leaned heavily on artists and writers from China with the intention that these new stories would be “based on Chinese culture and mythology but set in the modern world,” according to Marvel Editor-In-Chief CB Cebulski.

For now, these new graphic novels are only in Chinese, but the joint venture potentially means a dramatically expanded Marvel Universe for comic fans in both the U.S. and China.

NetEase hosts a few Marvel comics already, including Spider-Man, Iron Man and The Avengers.

In 2016, DC Comics made the effort to diversify their heroes by introducing New Super-Man, a China-based superhero with Kryptonian powers like those of Superman.

Marvel films have certainly outdone DC films in theaters. Could they be set to do the same in the comic book world?Suzanne Somers praised President Donald Trump on the one-year anniversary of his inauguration.

Somers, 71, told TMZ over the weekend that she was satisfied with the way the president had done his job.

“I’m happy that the economy’s doing so much better,” she said, as seen in the video above. “And now my career is over,” she joked, acknowledging that conservative viewpoints are “very rare” in Hollywood.

The “Three’s Company” star told HuffPost in 2012 that her politics were a “very personal” issue.

“I am an independent and vote the candidate, never the party,” she said at the time. “I am also an entrepreneur, and entrepreneurs made America the most exceptional and wealthiest country in the world, excelling in technology, science, medicine, physics, literature and, most of all, self-reliance and unbridled imagination.”

Two years later, she criticized then-President Barack Obama’s administration.Chicago-based journalist Ana Belaval had a major fangirl moment after a live satellite interview with Ricky Martin ― and she didn’t realize the superstar was still listening.

Martin spoke to WGN Morning News last week about his role in FX’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.” Belaval joined the interview to ask the actor and singer about his hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.

The Puerto Rican reporter thanked the artist for helping the island, said goodbye and proceeded to jump around and freak out on camera. Martin could not see her, but unbeknownst to her, he could still hear her.

“I seriously went very berserk on Dean Richards because you have to understand, when you’re part of a minority and you don’t have a lot of role models in media, and you have a Ricky Martin that wherever you go in the world, it’s a good name to mention as a Puerto Rican ― oh my goodness you feel related to him,” she said.

As Belaval continued to enthusiastically discuss the interview, Martin chimed in, “That’s beautiful. I love what I’m hearing.”

The reporter responded, shocked, “Oh he’s still there?!” She then addressed the WGN anchors, saying, “I’m going to kill you!”

“Please, I don’t want to be involved in another ‘American Crime Story,’” Martin joked.

The video went viral over the weekend, and Belaval spoke with NPR about the moment in an interview published Sunday. The reporter revealed she’s been a Ricky Martin fan since his time with the boy band Menudo and just wanted to thank him for helping Puerto Ricans after the storm.

“I have had so many missed opportunities to meet him,” she told NPR host Lulu Garcia-Navarro. “And honestly, after Hurricane Maria, when the local government was running around like headless chickens, these performers just went to work ― right? ― put boots on the ground. And he was ― I will never forget. No one could get to Aguadilla. And he got a FedEx plane to Aguadilla, which is on the west coast of the island, to go help people who really needed it. And so that just elevated him in my eyes.”WASHINGTON ― Young undocumented immigrants watched on Monday as Senate Democrats did something many of them had promised not to: cast votes for government spending without securing protections for so-called Dreamers at risk of deportation.

Dreamer activists felt betrayed. Sitting in the gallery above the Senate floor, 33-year-old Karina Ruiz started to cry when she watched the first vote to end the government shutdown.

“I really [had] hopes and expectations that Democrats would hold the line for us, that they would hold their vote,” Ruiz, executive director of Arizona Dream Act Coalition and a mother of three, said afterwards. “We would send a message that this is urgent.”

For months, undocumented immigrants have urged Democrats to oppose government funding bills unless they did something to help Dreamers, about 700,000 of whom will lose deportation relief because President Donald Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Senate Democrats stood with Dreamers on Friday and voted against a four-week spending bill, but just days later on Monday they agreed to a three-week measure, insisting it wasn’t a cave because they had received a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would hold a vote on a DACA protection bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8.

The deal wasn’t nothing. But it wasn’t what Dreamers asked for, or what Democrats promised. So on Monday, these undocumented immigrants were left in search of a way forward in a battle that has extended far longer than many had hoped, keeping them in Washington and away from family, school and work.

After Monday’s vote, more than 50 Dreamers gathered in a park across from the Capitol in a circle, some of them holding back tears and putting their arms around each another. Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for the Dreamer-led group United We Dream, asked them to raise a hand if they felt disappointed. Everyone did.

She then asked them to take a step forward for a series of prompts. They stepped toward the center when she asked if they believed in their hearts that they would win the fight for protections, and again when she said they would not allow politicians to lie to them, and again when she said they are worthy and loved. She asked them to send love to Republicans who oppose their cause and forgiveness to Democrats who lost their spine.

“We’re not done,” Martinez Rosas said before leading the group in a battle cry.

It was an especially difficult day for Antonio Jauregui, a 20-year-old college student who came to the U.S. when he was five, because it is the one-year anniversary of his grandfather’s death. He said he’d like to be at home with family in California to remember and honor his grandfather, but instead has been in Washington for weeks pleading with lawmakers to fight for him.

Jauregui had DACA protections but they expired in September and his renewal application was caught in postal delays. His application is now pending, but in the meantime, he is at risk, just like an estimated 122 other DACA recipients across the country who lose protections each day.

He was disappointed by Monday’s events and the fact that Democrats agreed to move forward on a short-term government funding bill based only on a promise for a future immigration vote.

“Promises aren’t going to protect our community,” Jauregui said. “Promises aren’t going to grant us a permanent solution. Promises aren’t going to do anything for the DACA recipients like myself who have already lost status. We were really counting on their actions.”

Isaias Guerrero, a 33-year-old who works with the Fair Immigration Reform Movement advocacy group, still has DACA protection for another 602 days. He knows because he has a countdown on his computer and has been watching the days tick down since Trump rescinded the program.

Guerrero was surprised at what happened on Monday.Pope Francis partially apologized for last week’s brusque attack on victims of sex abuse by the clergy ― but he continued supporting a controversial Chilean bishop accused of protecting an abusive priest.

On board a papal flight from Peru to Rome late Sunday, the pontiff acknowledged to journalists that his demand to see “proof” that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had been complicit in the abuse of minors could have hit victims like a “slap in the face.” He said he realized that his words on Thursday implied that victims’ accusations of sexual abuse are only credible with concrete evidence.

“To hear that the pope says to their face, ‘Bring me a letter with proof,’ is a slap in the face” that he didn’t intend, Francis said, according to The Associated Press.

Although he apologized for asking for “proof,” he suggested the testimony of victims against Barros is still not enough.

“I can’t condemn [Barros] because I don’t have evidence. But I’m also convinced that he’s innocent,” the pope said, according to AP.

Francis said that “covering up abuse is an abuse in itself,” according to Catholic News Service. But if he punished Barros without moral certainty, “I would be committing the crime of a bad judge.”

Advocates for victims of clergy sex abuse were stunned and angered last week by Francis’ impassioned defense of Barros. Some victims say Barros was aware of and even observed abuse carried out by his former mentor, the Rev. Fernando Karadima. In 2011, the Vatican found Karadima guilty of sexually abusing boys and removed him from active ministry.

When asked about the controversy by a reporter in Iquique, Chile, on Jan. 18, Francis said, “The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk. But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander. Is that clear?”

Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima’s most vocal victims, was angered by Francis’ demand for “proof.”

“As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching everything,” Cruz wrote on Twitter, according to a BBC translation.

Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston and the chairman of the Vatican’s commission on sexual abuse, also was critical of the pope’s comments, saying in a statement that he understands how Francis’ words were a “source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.”

“Words that convey the message ‘if you cannot prove your claims then you will not be believed’ abandon those who have suffered reprehensible criminal violations of their human dignity and relegate survivors to discredited exile,” O’Malley said.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, the pope said he regretted using the word “proof,” since it was “not the best word to use to approach a wounded heart,” Catholic News Service reported. He said “evidence” was a better description of what he was looking for.

“Of course, I know that there are many abused people who cannot bring proof [or] they don’t have it,” he said. “Or at times they have it but they are ashamed and cover it up and suffer in silence. The tragedy of the abused is tremendous.”

The pope also revealed that Barros had offered his resignation twice. But Francis refused to accept the offer both times, Crux reported.

“I said no. You don’t play like that, because this is admitting previous guilt,” Francis told reporters.

The pope said that the Vatican had investigated the matter and that no one had yet provided him with convincing evidence against the bishop. He said that he hasn’t personally heard from any victim of Barros, although he has an “open heart to receive” that evidence.

“I haven’t heard from a victim of Barros. They didn’t come [to meet me]. They gave no evidence,” Francis said.

In the meantime, the pope is doubling down on his insistence that those who make accusations without providing evidence are guilty of slander.

“To insist, without evidence on one thing or the other, is a calumny,” he said, per Crux.

Many advocates for abuse victims told HuffPost last week that they feared Francis’ words would discourage survivors from coming forward because of a lack of evidence. In cases of child sexual abuse, there is often little evidence beyond the testimony of the victim.

Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online database BishopAccountability.org, told HuffPost that in his latest remarks, Francis once again seems to be blaming the victims ― this time, for not trying to meet with him.

Doyle said church investigators have already extensively studied the claims made by Karadima’s victims, in order to deliver the 2011 ruling against the priest. She doesn’t understand how it’s possible for Francis to claim the Barros case was “studied and studied again” if that investigation didn’t also include gathering testimony from victims and other witnesses.

“Few Catholic abuse cases in the world have involved as much testimony and investigation as the Karadima case. Between the church, criminal and civil cases, the victims surely have attested repeatedly about the role of Barros and the other Karadima protégés,” Doyle told HuffPost in an email. “By blaming the victims for not giving evidence, the Pope either is being deceptive or revealing his ignorance of this crucial case.”

The story has been updated with more details of the pope’s Sunday press conference and with comment from Anne Barret Doyle.MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines raised the alert level at its Mayon volcano on Monday after a loud explosion in the wake of increased activity made a hazardous eruption likelier, prompting authorities to close all schools and urge residents to stay indoors.

Mayon, the country’s most active volcano, has been spewing ash, lava, and pyroclastic material since Jan. 13, displacing close to 40,000 residents in the central province of Albay.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) raised its alert on Mayon to level 4, signifying a hazardous eruption is imminent, from level 3, which warns that such an eruption could be “weeks or even days” away.

“We strongly advise all people, both residents and tourists, to avoid the danger zone, and airlines to avoid flying near the volcano summit,” agency chief Renato Solidum told a news conference.

The danger zone around the 2,462-meter (8,077-foot) volcano has been expanded to a radius of 8 km (5 miles), he added.

Solidum said the agency had recorded increased seismic activity and “lava fountaining and a summit explosion” from Sunday night, indicating more explosions ahead, including a hazardous eruption.

A level 5 alert signifies a hazardous eruption is underway.

Albay province has run out of emergency funds and more people would be evacuated once government financial help arrived, said provincial governor Al Francis Bichara.

He ordered schools to suspend classes, amid ash fall warnings following the explosion at the volcano.

“In some areas...it’s already zero visibility, especially along the foot of the volcano,” he told CNN Philippines, adding that strong winds could carry ash to distant towns.Syrian men sit next to an unexploded missile after an Assad regime air attack on the opposition in the besieged town of Douma, November 19, 2015.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Rescue workers in a Syrian rebel-held enclave east of Damascus accused government forces of using chlorine gas during bombardment of the area on Monday, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 13 people had suffered suffocation.

The Syrian army and government have consistently denied using chlorine or other chemical weapons during Syria’s conflict, now in its seventh year.

The White Helmets civil defense rescue force, which operates in rebel-held parts of Syria, said 13 civilians including women and children had been “injured after (the) Assad regime used Chlorine gas in Douma city in Eastern Ghouta”.

Douma is in the eastern Ghouta, a suburb east of Damascus where almost 400,000 people have been under siege by the Syrian government and allied militia since 2013. Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel position close to the capital.

The health directorate for opposition-held areas in the Damascus region said patient symptoms “suggest they have been exposed to chlorine gas inhalation”.

It said patients said the smell around the attack site resembled chlorine.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, quoting local medical and other sources, said “gasses” released during a dawn rocket attack on Douma city caused “cases of suffocation”.

The Observatory said a gas was also used during a rocket attack last week on the enclave.

A witness in the area said people had fled the area of the attack and were receiving treatment for breathing problems at medical centers.

In the past two years, a joint U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon.Thanks again to Ariel Edwards-Levy for filling in ― back to the regular scheduled programming!

WHAT’S BREWINGThe world’s richest 1 percent raked in 82 percent of the wealth created last year, according to a new report by poverty-fighting nonprofit Oxfam. Just 42 people now hold as much wealth as the poorest 3.7 billion, the organization said.

In the U.S., the country’s three richest people have the same wealth as the poorest half of the American population. The report called out President Donald Trump for policies that contribute to wealth inequality.

The world saw the biggest increase in billionaires in history in the year prior to March 2017, with a new one added every two days, according to Oxfam’s figures. The world now has 2,043 billionaires, and nine of every 10 are men.

Billionaire wealth has risen by an annual average of 13 percent since 2010 — while the average worker’s wage has risen an average of 2 percent. While billionaire income was booming last year, the poorest half of the world saw no increase in wealth, according to the report, “Reward Work, Not Wealth.”

Oxfam issued the annual report on Monday, a day before the start of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, which Trump plans to attend.

The Oxfam report specifically criticizes Trump for creating “a cabinet of billionaires” and for “pushing for huge tax cuts for the richest 1 percent” in the new tax law.

The Oxfam report, which is based on data from Forbes and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth datebook, blamed the wealth gap on tax evasion, corporations’ increasing influence on policy, erosion of workers’ rights, and cost cutting.

“The billionaire boom is not a sign of a thriving economy but a symptom of a failing economic system,” Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam executive dirctor, said in a statement. “The people who make our clothes, assemble our phones and grow our food are being exploited to ensure a steady supply of cheap goods, and swell the profits of corporations and billionaire investors.”Rosanna Arquette and Marisa Tomei shared a touching and overdue moment onstage at the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards.

“We are honored to be part of this supportive and creative community and we are inspired that so many powerful voices are no longer silenced by the fear of retaliation,” she said Sunday night before introducing the award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries.

Arquette is one of many women who came forward last fall with a story of Harvey Weinstein’s predatory behavior. The actress told The New Yorker she met the film producer in the early ’90s at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he allegedly grabbed her hand and put it on his penis.

Arquette claims Weinstein later retaliated by never putting her in one of his films again ― she only starred in “Pulp Fiction” ― and never publicly accused him for the sake of her career.

“Rosanna, you are one of the voices,” Tomei said Sunday night. “You are one of the silence breakers and we all owe you a debt of gratitude.”

Arquette was named as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year as part of group of “silence breakers” who sparked a national conversation about sexual harassment and assault.

The actress went on to share that she was at the ceremony supporting the men and women who’ve spoken out about their abusers, including Asia Argento, Annabella Sciorra, Ashley Judd, Daryl Hannah, Mira Sorvino and Anthony Rapp.

Many of Weinstein’s accusers, including Arquette, claimed they were not invited to the Golden Globes earlier this month, where actors and actresses blacked out the red carpet in solidarity with the Time’s Up movement.From pesticide regulations to land use policy, Democratic leaders in states across the country spent 2017 fighting President Trump on the environment, a conflict that shows no sign of letting up this year.

By Sophie Quinton

This is Part One of the State of the States 2018 series.

Democratic governors, attorneys general and state legislators spent 2017 fighting President Donald Trump’s environmental agenda, and the conflict shows no sign of letting up this year.

Trump’s environmental and energy priorities are diametrically opposed to those of many left-leaning state officials. While the president has pushed to reduce regulations on businesses and open up new areas to oil, gas and coal extraction, Democrats generally want to crack down on polluters and reduce fossil fuel emissions that contribute to climate change

Add partisan outrage, and you get a recipe for a knock-down, drag-out fight. On issues from public lands to clean energy, Democratic attorneys general are suing the federal government, and Democratic state lawmakers are dreaming up ways to block or limit federal action. And from Washington state to Virginia, state leaders are getting behind policies — such as a tax on carbon emissions — that go against the president’s priorities.

To be sure, Democrat-led states are in the minority. While Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governor’s office in seven states, Republicans control 25 state governments. These GOP leaders have cheered on the Trump administration as it moves to eliminate Obama-era regulations such as the Clean Power Plan, an approach Republicans say will help the economy.

The Trump administration set the tone for the year when, Jan. 4, the Interior Department announced it was planning to open up almost all federally controlled land beneath the ocean to oil and gas drilling. The move incensed state leaders from coast to coast, even some Republicans who typically agree with Trump.

Leaders in deep-blue California responded swiftly. Gov. Jerry Brown, Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the California Coastal Commission, a regulatory agency, all vowed to fight the plan. “We are evaluating all of our options to protect our state’s pristine natural resources,” Becerra said in a statement.

“We’ve fought similar efforts before, and we will fight them again,” Coastal Commission Chairwoman Dayna Bochco said in a statement. Her agency has the authority to deny offshore drilling proposals, although denials can be overruled by the federal government.

State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, a Democrat who represents the Santa Barbara area, reintroduced a bill that would prohibit the State Lands Commission — another regulatory agency — from approving new leases for drilling-related infrastructure along the California shoreline.

Jackson said she’s optimistic that the bill will pass this time. “We’re seeing a great deal of interest, a great deal of indignation, at such a shortsighted — frankly stupid — policy,” she said of the Interior Department plan.

Jackson wants to prevent another oil spill like the 1969 Santa Barbara disaster, when more than 4 million gallons of oil, or 100,000 barrels, filled the harbor, some of it washing up on local beaches. She also said the plan to increase offshore drilling is “appalling” given the damage that fossil fuels-driven climate change is already inflicting.

Her district just endured the biggest wildfire in state history, followed by devastating mudslides. “We need to do everything we can to protect the planet,” she said.

Expect More Lawsuits

States’ first line of defense against unwanted federal policy is litigation. And since Trump took office a year ago, attorneys general haven’t held back.

State attorneys general filed 36 coordinated lawsuits in 2017, almost all brought by Democratic attorneys general against the Trump administration, according to Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University who studies state lawsuits against the federal government.

That’s almost triple the number of lawsuits filed by two or more states during the most litigious year of Obama’s tenure, and far above the handful of multistate lawsuits that were typically filed in a given year against the Reagan, H.W. Bush or Clinton administrations, he said. Lawsuits started to rise under George W. Bush.

Twelve of last year’s lawsuits filed by multiple Democratic attorneys general involved environmental policy, according to Nolette’s count. Two other lawsuits on the issue were filed by a single state.

“Historically, environmental policy has been the biggest area of contention between states and the federal government,” Nolette said. Since the 1960s, the federal government has generally set environmental standards and required states to implement them — a structure that creates plenty of opportunities for litigation, he said.

Most of the lawsuits filed so far were intended to stop rollbacks of Obama-era rules such as air pollution standards and energy-efficiency standards for appliances. The cases are guaranteed to at least slow down the regulatory process as they wend their way through the courts.

Republican attorneys general, meanwhile, have praised the federal government for scrapping regulations they oppose. “I applaud President Donald J. Trump for making deregulation an immediate and continued focus of his Administration,” Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, the chairwoman of the Republican Attorney Generals Association, said in a statement in December.

This year could bring two blockbuster legal challenges from Democrats, as Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency is planning to repeal Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce power plant emissions, and is reconsidering fuel-efficiency and tailpipe-emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks.

Democratic attorneys general have made clear their willingness to sue to protect those regulations. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman already has formed a coalition of 23 state attorneys general and city chief legal officers in order to defend the Clean Power Plan.

Scrapping the car emission standards could lead to an avalanche of litigation, legal experts say, because the Trump administration would likely also rescind a federal waiver that allows California and a dozen other states to set their own, stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

“There would be a huge lawsuit battle. There’s no question that this would be litigated,” said Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law and co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Lowering the federal standards and requiring California to follow them would make it very difficult for California to reach its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2030, legal experts say. Transportation is the state’s largest source of greenhouse gases.

Emissions in the power sector are already declining nationwide, as utilities switch to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. But transportation emissions are going up, Carlson said. “You really need government intervention on the transportation side.”

Going Their Own Way

Leaders in blue states also are advancing policies that counter federal action. For instance, after Trump’s EPA decided not to ban a pesticide called chlorpyrifos that studies say can harm fetal development, California placed the substance on its list of most dangerous chemicals.

Many state efforts this year will focus on fighting climate change, in defiance of a federal government that has wiped references to the phenomenon from agency websites and a president who has dismissed it as a hoax “created by and for the Chinese.”

“We must recognize an existential threat to the health of our state, a threat to the health of our children, and a threat to the health of our businesses that demands action,” Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee said in his annual address to the Legislature earlier this month. “That threat is climate change.”

Inslee has proposed taxing carbon emissions in order to push industry to switch to cleaner fuels. A carbon tax bill also is pending in Vermont, and bills were floated on the issue in New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut last year.

Washington state Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, a Democrat, said he expects to introduce a version of Inslee’s proposal in the House. Fitzgibbon proposed two carbon tax bills last year, but neither went anywhere. Voters defeated a ballot initiative that also would have imposed such a tax. He’s hoping this year will be different.

He pointed to the fact that Democrats now control both chambers of the state Legislature and that some businesses have stepped forward to support the carbon tax idea, including Microsoft and Puget Sound Energy, a major utility provider. “There are some factors in play that were not in play last year,” he said. “So we’ll see.”

Passing a controversial tax during the state’s 60-day session won’t be easy. Republican leaders say Inslee’s plan would hurt the economy and consumers by jacking up energy prices. “The energy tax that the governor proposes would drive up the cost of motor fuel and electricity, imposing a huge burden on struggling families,” Republican Senate Minority Deputy Leader Sharon Brown told The Seattle Times.

But Fitzgibbon said it’s important to do it now. “We’re seeing the impacts of climate change really severely in Washington state,” he said. “Every summer, we have the worst wildfires we’ve ever had.” The changing climate is one factor that has increased the number and severity of western wildfires.

Other states are embracing cap-and-trade programs, which involve setting a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and selling tradeable pollution permits to businesses. Oregon lawmakers are considering creating such a system, and New Jersey and Virginia are moving to join a regional program that caps power plant emissions.

Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe pushed for his state to enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative after the U.S. Supreme Court put the Clean Power Plan on hold in 2015. “As the federal government abdicates its role on this important issue, it is critical for states to fill the void,” he said in a statement last year.

The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality has developed draft regulations that are open for public comment. McAuliffe’s Democratic successor, Gov. Ralph Northam, also backs joining the regional initiative.

The current regulations were designed to let Virginia set up a cap-and-trade scheme without the Legislature’s consent. This means Virginia won’t be able to keep the proceeds from pollution allowances as state revenue, as the other nine states in the program do. The draft regulations send that money to utilities instead, to be passed on to ratepayers, said Michael Dowd, director of air division for the department of environmental quality.“The Big Bang Theory” had a touching season finale tribute to late physicist Stephen Hawking, but sadly it was cut for time.

Luckily for fans, the hit CBS sitcom has now released the unaired clip online. But be warned, it’s a real tear-jerker. (Spoilers ahead.)

Check out the clip here:

In this exclusive, unaired clip from last night’s season finale, the happy couple gets one last gift from #StephenHawking. 💕 #BigBangTheory pic.twitter.com/xgpU7G7Wpw — The Big Bang Theory (@bigbangtheory) May 11, 2018

Thursday night’s episode saw “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill officiating the much-hyped wedding ceremony between Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Amy (Mayim Bialik).

The deleted scene takes place after the couple’s nuptials. Emotions run high as the newlyweds unwrap a gift from Hawking, an engraved pocket watch that the scientist ― who guest-starred on the show ― sent them before he died at age 76 in March.

Hamill described the scene as a “lovely, touching (& funny) tribute” to the iconic scientist:

So sorry they weren't able to include this lovely, touching (& funny) tribute to the great #StephenHawking. Thanks for posting it @bigbangtheory #ShouldaBeenAnHourEpisode https://t.co/JY7LVCmMmh — Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) May 11, 2018

Showrunner Steve Holland told The Hollywood Reporter it was hard for the sitcom “to be super timely” in honoring Hawking, “because we shoot ahead of our airdates.”

“The wedding was a big episode and it seemed like a good chance to pay some tribute to him,” Holland said.

The unaired scene stirred many emotions on Twitter:

Congress wasn’t able to come up with a deal to reopen the government Sunday, meaning the shutdown will extend to the third day on Monday ― the start of the work week.

Tourist spots like the National Zoo and the Smithsonian museums remained open over the weekend, but they will be closed on Tuesday, if the shutdown continues. Sightseers who haven’t been following the news will be left locked out and disappointed.

Thousands of federal workers will also be forced to go without pay. Some ― those who are deemed “non-essential” ― may have to show up for work Monday morning and then be told to go home. Others will have to work without getting paid.

“While I’m not exactly thrilled about not being paid, at this point I want a real resolution. I don’t want even the small amount of anxiety this is causing me personally to be for naught.” - a Census Bureau employee

Congress has to pass legislation authorizing pay for employees who work during the shutdown, which it normally does. Still, some people are worried it might not happen this time.

“The biggest concern for most government workers is that we will not receive back pay once everything is resolved,” said one U.S. Department of Agriculture employee. “The president has to sign on for back pay. No guarantee with the current president.”

In 2013, the last time the government shut down, about 800,000 workers were furloughed. A similar number is expected to be affected this time.

Many federal workers who spoke with HuffPost say they have come to expect shutdowns at this point. Congress has been lurching from short-term spending bill to short-term spending bill, with the prospect of a shutdown constantly in the background. It is, unfortunately, the new normal ― even when one party controls the White House and has majorities in Congress.

“I have to say, while I’m not exactly thrilled about not being paid, at this point I want a real resolution. No more continuing resolutions,” said a Census Bureau employee. “No more waiting until later to do something for the Dreamers. No more delays in funding [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. I don’t want even the small amount of anxiety this is causing me personally to be for naught.”

The shutdown is also affecting offices on Capitol Hill. One staffer said he and some others in his office were told they would be furloughed, which was frustrating considering other offices declared their entire staff to be “essential” and therefore able to work. The application of the furlough rules was similarly spotty in 2013. Some offices argue it’s important that they be able to respond to constituents during the shutdown, while others have said they should be following the same rules as federal agencies.

“I just want to come to work and serve our constituents in whatever limited way I can during a shutdown. I don’t care if my pay is delayed,” said the Hill staffer. “You would think a congressional office would want that attitude. Now I get why people hate the government.”

Federal workers have also expressed frustration at how little guidance they’ve received about the shutdown and how it will affect them ― a marked contrast to what happened in 2013, under President Barack Obama’s administration.

On Friday morning, for example ― just hours before the government shut down ― an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said her agency was working on its contingency plans. However, she also said the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget had ordered FEMA not to communicate those plans to other employees.

The administration didn’t want to look like it didn’t have faith in Congress to get the job done.

The Senate adjourned Sunday with no resolution, although a group of moderate senators in both parties has been working on a potential compromise: fund the government until Feb. 8 and promise to vote on immigration legislation before then. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated Sunday that he backed such an agreement, giving hope to some lawmakers that the end could be near.

Many Democrats, however, are skeptical of once again delaying assistance for Dreamers ― the young undocumented immigrants whose protections were taken away by President Donald Trump ― and it’s not clear whether such an arrangement could get through the House.WASHINGTON ― Government agencies will feel the worst effects of the ongoing shutdown Monday morning, as senators were unable to find an agreement over the weekend that would fund government operations and potentially provide a path forward for a larger immigration deal.

Late Sunday night, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) delayed a vote that was scheduled to take place at 1 a.m. Monday ― one that was likely to fail ― and set a vote to end debate on a continuing resolution for noon on Monday instead.

McConnell added a new promise that is likely to flip some senators who voted against the last short-term spending bill, although Republicans still don’t appear to have the 60 votes they need.

McConnell said it was his intention for the Senate to finish, “as quickly as possible,” a large appropriations deal that would address spending and disaster relief, as well as continue negotiations on border security and protections for young undocumented immigrants at risk of losing deportation protections after President Donald Trump rescinded the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

“However,” McConnell said, “should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on February 8, 2018 ― assuming that the government remains open ― it would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA, border security, and related issues.”

That statement, almost certainly negotiated between McConnell and other senators, could be key to shifting the positions of lawmakers who voted against the four-week spending bill on Friday. In fact, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), two of the four Republicans who opposed the deal, said they would support the three-week bill after McConnell’s announcement.

Flake said McConnell made a “significant” concession that Democrats shouldn’t ignore. And the Arizona Republican argued that Democrats have another opportunity to force an immigration vote during negotiations over yearly spending limits Congress set for defense and non-defense programs in 2011.

“That’s a lot of leverage,” Flake said.

“There’s been a lot of promises made to different senators that have not been followed through on by the majority leader, so I would be very leery of anything that wasn’t extremely, extremely clear and detailed.” - Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.)

But McConnell will need seven Democrats to flip as well. That’s a tall order, considering many of them have stated publicly that they won’t support a deal without a vote to immediately help so-called Dreamers, or young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and are now at risk of losing deportation relief. Many Democrats are concerned that McConnell won’t follow through on holding an immigration vote or that, even if he does, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) won’t do the same.

“There’s been a lot of promises made to different senators that have not been followed through on by the majority leader, so I would be very leery of anything that wasn’t extremely, extremely clear and detailed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told reporters before McConnell’s speech.

House conservatives were also watching McConnell’s speech closely. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) was hanging around the Senate on Sunday night, intercepting McConnell and talking with reporters.

After McConnell’s speech on the Senate floor announcing his intention to bring up DACA legislation, Meadows noted that McConnell had not specified exactly what kind of DACA bill he’d bring up.

“He didn’t make a commitment to one bill or another, which is a good sign,” Meadows told HuffPost.

House Republicans are working on a DACA bill that appears to be a non-starter with Democrats. It would supply funding for Trump’s border wall. It would limit family reunification immigration, which Republicans call “chain migration,” and end the diversity visa lottery program ― both things Trump has demanded ― along with a host of other immigration enforcement measures. In exchange, it would legislatively codify DACA, allowing recipients to stay but not have a path to permanent legal status or citizenship. That’s the bill conservatives want.

McConnell said he would have an amendment process on a DACA bill that would be “fair to all sides.” But Democrats still seem to have doubts about the majority leader not putting his thumb on the scale during the immigration debate, particularly if it’s going to be all for naught in the House.

McConnell appears to be hoping his statement might sway some more Democrats to vote for the three-week funding bill. But it’s clear the Senate is still short of the votes if its vote has been delated by several hours. Barring some breakthrough on Monday morning, the three-week continuing resolution will still fail and senators will be back to the drawing board.

The government technically shut down at 12 a.m. Jan. 20 after senators ― most of the Democratic caucus and four Republicans ― blocked a four-week continuing resolution. Many of the senators said they would not support a bill unless it included protections for Dreamers. Others voted “no” because they said a string of CRs wasn’t a responsible way to run the government, and emphasized the need for a full-year funding bill.

Lawmakers stayed in Washington for the weekend to find a deal, but it has proven difficult given the massive gulf between what Democrats and Republicans want ― and differences in what Republicans in the House, Senate and White House want.

Democrats want action on a Dreamer bill, or at least a firm commitment that both chambers will hold a vote on one, before they will support reopening the government. Republican leaders in Congress haven’t been willing to go that far, and the White House has said it won’t negotiate on immigration in any way until the government shutdown ends.

Trump has been seemingly absent from the weekend negotiations. The president stayed in Washington over the weekend, despite having a celebration scheduled at his Mar-a-Lago resort to mark the one-year anniversary of his inauguration, but he hasn’t been talking with Democrats. Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were close to a deal Friday before staff vetoed the agreement and Democrats decided they wouldn’t take anything more than a funding extension for a few days. The government shut down.

House Republicans seemed to dig in on their positions Saturday, insisting that no immigration negotiations take place until Democrats voted to reopen government. But there was some hope in the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats meeting Sunday and showing some signs of progress.

Lawmakers do seem closer to ending the shutdown, but it’s clear there is still distance between the two sides. And until one side gives in or lawmakers actually reach some middle-ground proposal, hundreds of thousands of government workers will be furloughed and many national parks will close.Pope Francis compared gossiping nuns with terrorists during his South American tour stop in Lima on Sunday.

The pope took a moderate tone, and the nuns he was addressing laughed as he spoke. But the pontiff was serious about his message, and has referred to gossip as terrorism a number of times in the past. It appeared to be the first time, however, that he has called people who gossip terrorists.

“Do you know what a nun who gossips is?” the pope asked as he spoke to 500 cloistered nuns at the historic Church of the Nazarenas.

“A terrorist,” he answered. “Because gossip is like a bomb. One throws it, it causes destruction and one calmly walks away.”

He added: “No terrorist sisters! The best remedy is to bite your tongue. Don’t gossip in the convent because that will inspire the devil.”

Francis also said that gossiping nuns were worse than the “terrorists of Ayacucho,” again drawing laughter. The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas centered at Ayacucho in the 1980s and 1990s were linked to the killing and disappearance of tens of thousands of Peruvians.

The comments drew criticism from a newspaper editor, who said sex abuse by Catholic priests seemed more akin to terrorism than gossip, Reuters reported.

The cloistered nuns were a strange group to receive such a warning. They rarely speak to one another and usually spend their days in prayer as part of their religious devotion. They were granted special permission to leave their various convents to attend the event.

At the beginning of his address, Francis joked: “Seeing you all here, an unkind thought comes to my mind — that you took advantage [of me] to get out of the convent a bit to take a stroll.”

The pope has often compared gossip to terrorism and urged those who were tempted to gossip to “bite your tongue,” as he did last month during a visit to Bangladesh.

Later in the day, Francis said Mass for some 1.3 million people in a tented airfield in Lima. He condemned “the grave sin” of corruption, The Associated Press reported, and urged Peruvians to have compassion. He also told them they lived in a “sainted” land and hailed young people for keeping their faith, per The New York Times.

He didn’t mention victims of clergy sex abuse.

The pope’s South American tour did not get off to a good beginning in Chile. There he apologized for the pain suffered by victims of clergy sex abuse. But he later accused victims of notorious pedophile priest Fernando Karadima of slander for accusing Bishop Juan Barros of protecting Karadima.

The Vatican has long defended and embraced Barros. While in Chile, the pope said there was no proof that Barras had any culpability in Karadima’s crimes.Dan Rather at the 2017 IFP Gotham Awards in New York City. Roy Rochlin via Getty Images

Dan Rather is launching a weekly show on the progressive The Young Turks Network, the veteran news anchor announced Sunday.

“The Young Turks? Really? Who would have thought it?” Rather, 86, joked while introducing the program, “The News With Dan Rather.” The gig is significantly different from his 24-year career hosting the “CBS Evening News.”

“At this age and stage in my life, my attitude is, ‘What the hell,’” he said Sunday in an interview with CNN. The show ― a 30-minute program set to air on the network’s YouTube channel at 5:30 p.m. on Mondays ― will be broadcast from Rather’s office and will focus on the biggest news of the day, original reporting and stories he thinks need more attention.

The move is partially motivated by President Donald Trump’s hostile attitude toward the media, Rather told CNN.

“I feel strongly that when you have a president who is continually, relentlessly damning the press, individuals by name, individual institutions and calling the press the enemy of the people ― listen, this has to be resisted,” he said. “These efforts to convince the public that people in the news are dealing in fake news is, quite frankly, bullshit.”

This isn’t Rather’s first foray into working with somewhat under-the-radar networks. After leaving the “CBS Evening News” in 2005, he hosted a weekly news show called “Dan Rather Reports” on the cable network AXS TV until 2013.

The newsman said he was cautiously optimistic that his show with The Young Turks could reach conservative news consumers.

“I don’t kid myself that we are going to have much effect on someone who is a follower of Breitbart or Fox News,” he said. “But even if we can have a little effect ― I think some of the authenticity can get through to some of these people.”Wall Street Journal White House reporter Eli Stokols has a possible theory about why Donald Trump reportedly accepted a border wall offering from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — then reneged. Trump may want to use the missing wall against Democrats in his re-election campaign.

The New York Times reported Friday that Schumer tentatively agreed to consider fully funding Trump’s $20 billion Mexican border wall. In exchange, the GOP would agree to protect the so-called Dreamers who came to the U.S. with their parents as children, according to the Times. Then both sides could agree to a spending package to keep the government running.

But Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, called Schumer later to say the Dreamers deal was too liberal. The deal was off.

Schumer complained later that dealing with the president was like “negotiating with jello.”

The possible $20 billion for a border wall is “a lot of money,” Stokols told Kasie Hunt on MSNBC Sunday. “So, why doesn’t he [Trump] want that?”

“You have to step back and look at the inaction from the White House and conclude ... If Schumer put $20 billion on the table and they said no, does this president really want to build the wall? Or do they want to retain that issue and run, and say [that] Democrats wouldn’t let us build this wall?”Better stock up on body oil, Pyeongchang.

Pita Taufatofua, the swooned-over shirtless Tongan flag-bearer from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, qualified for the Winter Olympics in cross-country skiing over the weekend.

“A miracle happened,” he wrote on his Instagram.

After failed bids in Poland and Armenia in the last few weeks, he barely beat Sunday’s deadline for qualifying, the Wall Street Journal reported. Taufatofua earned his Olympic berth at an event in Isafjordur, Iceland.

“I gave it absolutely everything,” he told the Journal. “I died at the end.”

A post shared by Pita Taufatofua (Pita T) (@pita_tofua) on Jan 21, 2018 at 2:52pm PST

Taufatofua was able to meet a five-race standard with the help of four roller-skiing events on dry land prior to his successful snow trial, the Journal noted.

Taufatofua was a bigger hit in the opening and closing ceremonies in Rio than he was in his sport, taekwondo. He lost in the first round.

Given that his first skiing lesson was in January of last year, according to CNN, his presence will likely give the games more of a PR jolt than anything.

He told the Journal he is planning his games entrance, if he can round up the funding to get there. A parka won’t make quite the splash his coconut-oil-slathered torso did during the last go-round, so it’ll be interesting to see what he comes up with.A half-baked SAG Awards graphic on Sunday showed that Judi Dench of “Victoria & Abdul” was among the nominees for outstanding female actor in a “leading roll.”

Sesame, poppy or Plain? — Angela (@AngelaQueensNY1) January 22, 2018WASHINGTON ― Democrats provided votes to fund the government on Monday in exchange for an assurance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would put an immigration bill on the floor in the coming weeks.

Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether Republicans will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called Dreamers, angrily slammed Democrats ― and in particular Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ― for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President Donald Trump’s desk.

“It’s official: Chuck Schumer is the worst negotiator in Washington ― even worse than Trump. Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan or Donald Trump is doomed to fail,” CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement.

CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.

MoveOn.org, one of the most influential progressive organizations in Washington, similarly panned the agreement that 33 Senate Democrats voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.

“This is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and Republicans in Congress stood with their anti-immigrant nativist base, and too many Democrats backed down, abandoned Dreamers, and failed to fight for their values,” MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement.

McConnell said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some Senate Democrats encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution ― even if they have no guarantee from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the House.

“I believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,” independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters on Monday. “I think he’s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.”

Other Democrats, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), remained unconvinced that McConnell and the House Republicans would follow through on immigration.

“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” Harris said.

While Senate Democrats did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get the Children’s Health Insurance Program funded for six years. And if McConnell doesn’t follow through on immigration, Democrats will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on Republicans.

For now, though, Democrats who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.
