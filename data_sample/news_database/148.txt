Marking a heartbreaking milestone in the story of the northern white rhino, Sudan — the very last male of the subspecies — died on Monday at the age of 45.

The “gentle giant,” who loved lounging in mud and getting scratched behind the ears, had been battling a severe leg infection for several weeks. His condition worsened significantly over the weekend and he was suffering a “great deal,” according to his caretakers at Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy. His veterinary team made the decision to euthanize him on Monday.

Sudan is named after his native South Sudan, where he was captured at a game reserve in 1975 at the age of 2. According to Ol Pejeta, Sudan was the last northern white rhino to have been born in the wild.

After his capture, Sudan was taken to the Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic, where he lived for several decades and fathered three offspring. His daughter Najin and granddaughter Fatu are now the last two remaining northern white rhinos on Earth.

It is with great sadness that Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Dvůr Králové Zoo announce that Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino, age 45, died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on March 19th, 2018 (yesterday). #SudanForever #TheLoneBachelorGone #Only2Left pic.twitter.com/1ncvmjZTy1 — Ol Pejeta (@OlPejeta) March 20, 2018

In 2009, Sudan was relocated to Ol Pejeta, where he lived with Najin and Fatu until his death. Though conservationists had hoped the rhinos would be able to breed naturally at the conservancy, efforts to encourage the animals to mate ultimately proved futile.

When Angalifu, a male northern white rhino living at the San Diego Zoo, died in 2014, Sudan became the last living male of the subspecies — and a beloved symbol for rhino conservation. He received 24/7 protection by armed guards and was visited by celebrities.

Sudan even got a Tinder profile of his own when Ol Pejeta partnered with the dating app last year in an effort to raise awareness about the subspecies’ struggle for survival.

“I perform well under pressure. I like to eat grass and chill in the mud,” read Sudan’s Tinder listing. “6 ft tall and 5,000lbs if it matters.”

Despite Sudan’s size, the animal was described as an affectionate “gentle giant” by his caretakers.

“Whenever he hears people talking, he loves to come close, because he knows he’s gonna be scratched,” Joseph Thaida, who has cared for the rhino since 2012, told NPR last year.

Despite Sudan’s passing, conservationists say they’re still hoping to save his subspecies from extinction by pursuing the costly and controversial option of in vitro fertilization.

Najin and Fatu both suffer from conditions making them physically unable to bear progeny, but scientists hope to harvest sex cells from the two female rhinos before fertilizing the eggs in vitro with stored sperm cells taken from Sudan and long-dead northern white males. If all goes well, the embryos would be implanted into southern white rhino surrogates.

As a last resort, conservationists said they could also attempt to impregnate a southern white rhino with sperm from a northern white. Southern white rhinos, which number about 17,000 in the wild, are a distinct subspecies. But conservationists have argued that crossing the two subspecies would be better than complete extinction.

Ol Pejeta said last year that it hopes to start the IVF process in 2018, though it promises to be a challenging feat. IVF in rhinos has never been successfully performed ― and even if it does succeed, the entire effort could cost up to $9 million.

Sudan’s veterinarian, Dr. Steve Ngulu, told NPR this week that the rhino’s passing is a “testament to human failure.”

The northern white rhinos had numbered over 2,000 as recently as 1960; poaching, fueled by demand for rhino horn, drove the subspecies to the brink of extinction ― reducing its population to just 15 animals by the mid-1980s.

On Tuesday, as news of Sudan’s death was made public, conservationists and others took to social media to express their grief ― and called for action to save the world’s remaining rhinos while there’s still time.

All five rhino species are considered threatened, according to the conservation group Save the Rhino. Three of the five species are critically endangered.

Today was heartbreaking for us all as the world says goodbye to Sudan, the last male Northern White Rhino on Earth. We are sending all our love to the team at @OlPejeta who have lost part of their family today. Now, more than ever, we must stand together and protect our rhinos. pic.twitter.com/uTX2kmUjEL — Bindi Irwin (@BindiIrwin) March 20, 2018

As Democrats topple Republicans in deep-red districts from Alabama to Pennsylvania, progressives are seizing on the party’s momentum to move it a bit to the left.

Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), an anti-abortion Democrat who refused to endorse President Barack Obama in 2012, could be a casualty of the anti-Trump resistance movement on Tuesday night. Lipinski faces off in a primary race on Tuesday against challenger Marie Newman, a progressive businesswoman who supports a $15 per hour minimum wage and has hit Lipinski on his votes against reproductive rights, the DREAM Act, LGBTQ rights, and the Affordable Care Act.

“He likes to say he’s a centrist, he’s not. He is a Republican,” Newman told Vox. “There is not a division in the Democratic Party — he just is a dinosaur.”

Lipinski, co-chair of policy for the Blue Dog Democrats in Congress, touts the importance of bipartisan compromise and has characterized Newman as being part of a “Tea Party of the left.”

“What we need to do is sit down and work out some compromise,” he said in a February debate. “Compromise has become a dirty word in Washington.”

The primary race has divided the Democratic Party. Several progressive members of Congress, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with women’s rights groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund, EMILY’s List and NARAL, have endorsed Newman. Anti-abortion groups and establishment Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, are backing Lipinski. Pelosi said last year that the Democratic Party should not have a litmus test on issues like abortion. “This is not a rubber-stamp party,” she said.

Newman and Lipinski are running neck and neck. The race to represent the southwest Chicago district turned ugly over the weekend as Lipinski backers sent out controversial text messages to some of the representative’s constituents. Some Newman supporters say they received texts suggesting Newman is a “Holocaust denier.” Other Chicagoans received texts on St. Patrick’s Day claiming Newman is “crazy anti-Catholic” and “supports laws that would jail nuns.”

The No Labels group, a centrist political organization that backs Lipinski, said it had recruited volunteers to send the texts and that one volunteer mistakenly conflated Newman with the Republican in the race, neo-Nazi Art Jones. “This is the only instance where we are aware of this happening,” the group told HuffPost. “We have since ended this program.”

No Labels said it had nothing to do with the nun text, which is likely a reference to Little Sisters of the Poor, the group that challenged Obama’s health care law because it required them to cover birth control in their health insurance plans.

Newman’s campaign decried the false texts, and the candidate says she believes her views on abortion are more closely aligned with the district’s than those of Lipinski, who was one of five Democrats to vote for the GOP’s 20-week abortion ban.British officials asked Facebook on Monday to pull auditors it hired to investigate Cambridge Analytica, the political research firm that was involved in a massive data breach during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In a statement, Facebook said forensic auditors from cybersecurity company Stroz Friedberg were on site at Cambridge Analytica’s London office on Monday evening until they were asked to leave.

“At the request of the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down,” Facebook said.

Facebook’s auditors had reportedly entered Cambridge Analytica’s office before British and European Union investigators could investigate.

British Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said Monday that she was requesting a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica’s servers after the firm didn’t cooperate with an investigation into whether it illegally acquired and used Facebook users’ data.

Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament, also said the European Union would investigate whether European citizens’ privacy rights had been violated.

Damian Collins, member of Parliament for the Conservative Party, said in a tweet on Monday: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.”

Facebook announced earlier Monday that it had hired Stroz Friedberg ― the same digital forensics firm Uber hired to investigate a dispute over intellectual property ― to audit Cambridge Analytica.

The tech company suspended Cambridge Analytica’s account Friday, saying it had obtained personal information from users three years ago in violation of Facebook policy. Strategic Communication Laboratories, the company that owns Cambridge Analytica, was revealed to have harvested data on 50 million Facebook users, according to investigations by The New York Times and The Observer.

That data reportedly helped fuel Donald Trump’s presidential campaign by building “psychographic profiles” about voters without their knowledge.

Trump’s presidential campaign paid millions of dollars to Cambridge Analytica, funded by billionaire donor Robert Mercer. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon once served on the firm’s board.

In a statement issued Saturday, Cambridge denied any wrongdoing.

Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge but left the company in 2014, told The Observer that the company “built models to exploit what we knew” about Facebook users to “target their inner demons.”Leah Millis / Reuters

WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Donald Trump, Jr., the U.S. president’s eldest son, met in August 2016 with an envoy representing the crown princes of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

The meeting was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday and confirmed by an attorney representing Trump Jr.

The meeting was a chance for the envoy to offer help to the Trump presidential campaign, according to The New York Times.

The newspaper said the meeting, held on Aug. 3, 2016, was arranged by Erik Prince, the founder and former head of private military contractor Blackwater, who attended the meeting. Joel Zamel, a co-founder of an Israeli consulting firm, was also in attendance.

Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.’s attorney, said on Saturday that nothing came of the meeting.

“Prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel,” Futerfas said in an emailed statement. “They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.”

A company connected to Zamel also worked on a proposal for a “covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign” to help Trump, utilizing thousands of fake social media accounts, the New York Times report said.

The envoy, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, told Trump, Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the 2016 presidential election, the paper said.

Since 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to political campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The campaign financing laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate.

The Saudi and UAE embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Wall Street Journal last month reported that investigators working for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had met with Zamel, and that Mueller’s team was looking into his firm’s work and his relationship with Nader.

Mueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the presidential election and if Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign, as well as whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the U.S. Department of Justice probe.

Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.”

The New York Times report said the meetings are an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump’s presidential campaign. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere regarding possible foreign help to the campaign, the report said.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s team, declined to comment on the report.

Zamel’s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said in a statement to Reuters that his client “offered nothing to the Trump campaign, received nothing from the Trump campaign, delivered nothing to the Trump campaign and was not solicited by, or asked to do anything for, the Trump campaign.”

“Media reports about Mr. Zamel’s engaging in ‘social media manipulation’ are uninformed,” Mukasey added. “Mr. Zamel’s companies harvest publicly available information for lawful use.”

Kathryn Ruemmler, Nader’s lawyer, told the paper that her client “has fully cooperated with the U.S. special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.”

Erik Prince, who is also the brother of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, could not be immediately reached for comment.Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) has demanded a review of why Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance never prosecuted Harvey Weinstein despite possessing evidence that he sexually assaulted model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez in 2015.

“It is of great concern that sexual assault cases have not been pursued with full vigor by our criminal justice system,” Cuomo said Monday in a statement.

While Vance’s office is set to complete its own investigation of the Weinstein case within 45 days, Cuomo said he requested a separate probe to answer any lingering questions.

“It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases,” he said.

Cuomo’s announcement came on the heels of an open letter from the Time’s Up organization demanding that he launch an independent investigation of the DA over Weinstein.

“We are concerned that what appears to be the negative relationship between the sex crimes unit of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and the Special Victims Unit of the NYPD makes it even less likely that victims who have been assaulted by rich or powerful men will be willing to come forward and that their assailants will be prosecuted and convicted,” according to the letter, published Sunday in New York Magazine.

Vance and the DA’s office released a statement rebuffing the claim, stating its “strong partnership” with the New York Police Department and an “unparalleled track record of holding sexual predators from all backgrounds accountable in thousands of sex crimes cases.”

Gutierrez detailed her allegations in a New Yorker interview last October, saying Weinstein groped her breasts and tried to put a hand up her skirt during a meeting at his office in 2015. She reported the assault to the NYPD, who had her wear a wire and meet with him in an attempt to get him to confess.Seattle resident Marita Graube plays peek-a-boo with her daughter, Ayame, as the girl sits in her crib and atop an organic mattress without fire retardant chemicals.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission voted last fall to rid toys and furniture of a dangerous flame retardant that scientists say can cause lasting health problems in both children and firefighters. But advocates on the issue fear an internal political squabble will delay the agency from moving ahead with the ban.

Sixteen states aren’t waiting around. They have bills in the works this year to ban or tightly restrict certain fire retardants from use in toys, child car seats, strollers and other children’s and household products.

For many, the states’ legislation has taken on new urgency due to questions about what the CPSC might do if President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the commission is confirmed. Late last year, the commission voted to initiate a rule-making process that might eventually lead to a ban on the chemicals known as organohalogens, and warned the public about the dangers in the fire retardants in children’s products and household goods. But instituting a total federal ban on the products could take years.

The state bills vary in scope, but their intent is clear — to get rid of chemicals that have been found by scientists to pose more risks than rewards. States have been on track to ban certain flame retardants for some time, but some existing statutes already have become outdated, forcing the states to enact new laws to keep up. Indeed some state lawmakers, who predict that companies will evolve their chemical formulas, say they want to implement broader bans on potentially dangerous flame retardants that might not even yet be developed.

“If the federal government isn’t going to do it, we need to be the ones to do it, and we are,” said Democratic state Sen. Virginia Lyons, the lead sponsor on a piece of toxic chemicals legislation in Vermont.

“The state bills vary in scope, but their intent is clear — to get rid of chemicals that have been found by scientists to pose more risks than rewards.”

Lyons’ proposal would go beyond individual chemicals and set up a mechanism to ban flame retardants from children’s products if they are deemed unhealthy by the state Department of Health following a scientific assessment.

“It’s an important and comprehensive bill for children’s products so we don’t have to pass individual laws on individual chemicals,” Lyons said. “The comprehensive program enables the Department of Health to take a lead in identifying toxic chemicals, regulating, labeling or banning.”

The issue for states is what to do about organohalogens, a group of chemicals used as flame retardants in upholstery, mattresses, electronic enclosures and some children’s products. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says the chemicals cause adverse effects such as cancer, endocrine issues and reproductive problems.

The chemical industry opposes most of the broad-based bills, saying that the chemicals should be evaluated individually, not as part of a class. “This broad class has different characteristics and profiles and different uses,” said Rob Simon, vice president for chemical products and technology for the American Chemistry Council, a trade group. “Just lumping them all together and saying they are bad isn’t accurate.”

In addition, the group testified to the CPSC that “the fire hazard of products is a real issue. … In the last few years, there have been hundreds of recalls of consumer products based on fire hazards. The reality is that the nature of today’s consumer products presents serious fire risks.”

But some scientists and firefighter groups think the chemical risk is worse. A 2010 study by the Marine Environmental Research Institute, in Blue Hill, Maine, concluded that: “Flame retardant chemicals can pose a potentially greater hazard than the risk from the fires they are supposed to prevent. Reducing the use of toxic and untested halogenated flame retardants will protect human and animal health and the global environment.” The study concluded that regulators should take this into account.

While the chemicals are designed to slow down fires in homes and other places, which would seem like a good thing for firefighters, firefighters’ associations want them banned too. In testimony to the CPSC late last year the International Association of Firefighters called for getting rid of the substances because of studies that show firefighters’ exposure contributes to increased cancer risk.

“The IAFF supports banning the use of organohalogen flame retardants because when burned they are all carcinogens that contribute to cancer and have additional negative effects on the health of our members,” said Racquel Segall, an occupational health specialist for the firefighters, in her testimony. “Given the increasing body of evidence that indicates the persistence, bio-accumulation and potential health concerns of these fire retardants, we believe the health risks associated with the use of these chemicals is greater than the fire risk without using these chemicals.”

The IAFF has delivered similar testimony in states such as Vermont, Minnesota, Washington, Maryland and Virginia, according to spokesman Tim Burn.

Some states already have begun to address the issue. California, in the wake of a prize-winning Chicago Tribune series that exposed the toxicity of the chemicals, enacted a 2013 law that requires manufacturers to attach a warning label to any furniture that has organohalogens.

Minnesota and Washington, D.C., also have approved anti-fire-retardant chemical laws. More states are looking to join them this year.

In Maryland, state Del. Angela Angel, a Democrat, is pushing a bill to add new organohalogens (an alphabet soup of chemicals known as decaBDE, HBCD, TBBPA, TCEP, or TDCPP by mass) to the list of banned fire retardants, including banning them from children’s toys, car seats and strollers. The bill would require manufacturers to get rid of the chemicals by January 2019, if they want to sell the products in the state.

In Massachusetts, a bill that would have banned 11 different flame retardants from highchairs, car seats, nursing pads, furniture, carpet pads and toys was approved last year 39-0 by the Senate, but not the House. This year, the Democratic state senator who sponsored last year’s bill, Cynthia Creem, said she has a House sponsor and is more optimistic that the bill will pass. It helps that Creem is now Senate majority leader, giving her more clout.

“This is a public health bill,” Creem said. “The truth is that we have been misled and our homes are now host to products that unnecessarily contain toxic flame retardants.”

In 2017, the Maine Legislature overrode Republican Gov. Paul LePage’s veto and enacted a law banning all flame retardants in upholstered furniture.

It’s unclear how quickly the Consumer Product Safety Commission might act on its ban.

In an op-ed for The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, outgoing Democratic CPSC member Marietta Robinson said acting chairwoman Ann Marie Buerkle, who has been appointed by the president to be permanent chairwoman, has “aligned herself with the positions of regulated industries at the expense of the safety of consumers.”

Buerkle voted against proceeding to the rule-making on the flame retardant chemicals. Robinson voted for it.

That’s cause for concern for consumer groups. While they are pleased that the process to ban the chemicals has begun, the way forward is unclear.

“We know acting chair Buerkle opposed moving forward with this rule,” said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. “We definitely have concerns about how this will continue to be a priority at the CPSC.”

The federation is hopeful that the guidance against the chemicals will go forward, she added. “The fact that states are taking action and building on what has happened at the federal level is significant.”

Buerkle requires Senate confirmation for a permanent appointment.

“The safety commission granted the petition, but that doesn’t automatically result in a ban. That’s a multiyear process, and at this point in time, who knows what’s going to happen,” said Eve Gartner, an attorney for Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law firm headquartered in San Francisco.

“Many states in the legislative session we’re currently in are looking to actually put into law the policy that the CPSC has said would be the right policy but has not yet codified into law,” Gartner said.President Donald Trump on Tuesday congratulated his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who secured a landslide re-election victory on Sunday in a vote that surprised no one.

“We had a very good call,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, according to The New York Times. “We will probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race, which is getting out of control.”

A White House statement said the leaders discussed “the state of bilateral relations and resolved to continue dialogue about mutual national security priorities and challenges.”

“President Trump congratulated President Putin on his March 18 re-election, and emphasized the importance of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula,” the White House said. “The two leaders confirmed the need for the United States and Russia to continue our shared efforts on strategic stability.”

The presidential call came just days after the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on 19 Russian individuals and five groups, including Moscow’s intelligence services, for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and for malicious cyberattacks. Last week, Trump also publicly backed U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May in criticizing Russia for its apparent role in the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England.

Meanwhile, a nearly yearlong investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and Trump’s campaign team stretches on. The president has fiercely denied suggestions that Moscow played a role in his 2016 election, tweeting on Sunday, “There is NO COLLUSION!”

Then-FBI Director James Comey launched the agency’s investigation into alleged Russian interference last March. Trump fired him in early May. The Justice Department then appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, to lead the explosive probe.

Trump has repeatedly attempted to discredit Mueller’s team and to suggest the probe should really be focused on his onetime election rival Hillary Clinton. He hurled one of his favorite attacks again on Saturday, calling the investigation a “WITCH HUNT!”

Putin has similarly denied any collusion, saying in December that such accusations showed a “lack of respect” for the voters who supported Trump.

In a statement on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted Trump. “An American president does not lead the Free World,” he said, “by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.”

The New York Times noted, however, that President Barack Obama also congratulated Putin after the Russian president’s election victory in 2012.

During Tuesday’s briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to a question about McCain’s critique by saying, “The president has maintained that it is important for us to have a dialogue with Russia. At the same time, we will continue to be tough with them.”“They want to fight a culture war in America,” Wylie told the Times, referring to Cambridge Analytica’s leadership.

Trump’s campaign paid millions of dollars to Cambridge Analytica, which was founded by Trump donor Robert Mercer and once included Steve Bannon on its board. In a new Channel 4 report published Tuesday, executives told an undercover reporter that they “ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy” for Trump.

The company has also been linked to the Brexit vote in support of the “Leave” campaign.Cynthia Nixon ended months of speculation Monday when she announced her bid to run for governor of New York.

The actress, who is a lifelong New Yorker, is now set to challenge two-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this September.

If elected, she would make history as both the first female and the first openly LGBTQ governor of New York. Those facts did not go unnoticed by the award-winning actress’s sizable fanbase, many of whom continue to associate her with her iconic character, Miranda Hobbes, on HBO’s “Sex and the City.”

However, the campaign announcement received a less-than-enthusiastic response from former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. The openly gay Quinn, who has campaigned for Cuomo, blasted Nixon as “an unqualified lesbian” in a New York Post interview. “This is a time to move away from celebrity and toward progressive leadership,” she said.

In fact, Nixon, who is bisexual, and her wife, Christine Marinoni, have been advocates for public education, women’s rights and LGBTQ rights for some time. Mayor Bill de Blasio named Nixon to the advisory board for the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City in 2014, and Marinoni has served as an adviser to the New York City Department of Education in the de Blasio administration.Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, the 98-year-old nun and team chaplain of NCAA Tournament upstart Loyola University Chicago, has become the darling of March Madness.

But WKGN-AM radio host Cody McClure in Knoxville, Tennessee, figured some irreverence was called for after No. 11 seed Loyola upset No. 3 University of Tennessee on Saturday to reach the Sweet 16.

“Fuck Sister Jean -everyone,” he wrote in a now-deleted tweet captured in a screenshot.

Twitter

On Monday, McClure wasn’t backing down. “I don’t regret the joke, no I don’t, because of the fact it was a joke,’’ McClure told the Chicago Tribune. “For me, I’m wondering when are we as a society going to learn how to take a joke again?”

However, McClure did suggest a “sorry” could be possible.

“I would issue an apology to Sister Jean,’’ he said to the paper. “If this were to ever get back to Sister Jean, I would hope that she understood that it was meant to be nothing more than a joke. I’m not some kind of monster. I mean, who would in their heart hate an elderly nun?”

McClure said his boss had told him that he would not be fired.

But if the radio host thinks he’s going to win the public relations war, he likely doesn’t have a prayer.

The talk show host brought the gold medal-winning duo on her show on Monday and had absolutely no chill in asking if they’re dating.

“A lot of people are saying that there is more than just chemistry there, that you’re a couple ... So, I mean ... Are you a couple?” asked DeGeneres, flashing a saucy photo of the skaters during one of their sexy routines.

People have been speculating for years ― decades even ― whether Virtue and Moir are an item. Both have repeatedly denied any romantic attachments. But they’ve been dancing as a pair for 20 years, and look incredibly hot together on the ice ― which makes their denials seem a little thin.

Virtue responded to DeGeneres’ question like she has to similar queries in the past, saying that fans’ hopes for a romance are “a compliment … that people feel invested in our partnership is truly remarkable.”

The couple then shared a well-worn story about how they once dated when they were preteens, but Moir ended the budding romance.

The Olympians then went on to play the “The Definitely Not Dating Game” with DeGeneres, guessing each other’s answers to silly questions like, “What is Scott’s favorite TV show?” and, “What is Tessa’s guilty pleasure?” and “Does Scott like to wear boxers or briefs?”

They weren’t that good at guessing each other’s answers, so maybe they’re telling the truth after all. You be the judge.(Reuters) - A defamation lawsuit filed against U.S. President Donald Trump by a contestant on his former reality show “The Apprentice” who accused him of sexual harassment can proceed, a New York state judge ruled on Tuesday, raising the possibility of Trump being forced to answer questions about his behavior toward women.

Justice Jennifer Schecter in the Manhattan Supreme Court said there was “absolutely no authority” to dismiss or stay a civil lawsuit by Summer Zervos related “purely to unofficial conduct” because Trump was U.S. president.

The ruling could force Trump to submit to questioning by lawyers for Zervos and lead to further public scrutiny of other claims of sexual misconduct that have been made against the president.Oh, the irony.

Tony Award-winning actress Cynthia Nixon was on her way to her first event as a New York gubernatorial candidate on Tuesday — to speak about fixing New York City’s dysfunctional subway system, among other things — when her train went out of service.

Rebecca Katz, a political operative who worked on Bill de Blasio’s 2013 campaign for mayor of New York, was traveling with Nixon and shared a photo of her getting off the stopped train.

“That thing when you’re headed to talk about fixing the subways and your train goes out of service #CuomosMTA,” Katz wrote.

When she reached the event at Bethesda Healing Center in Brooklyn, she told the audience she had made it “just in the nick of time,” due to delays on “Cuomo’s MTA.”

Nixon criticized Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, calling it an “exercise in living with disappointment, dysfunction and dishonesty,” according to the Associated Press.

Nixon accused Cuomo of creating inequality via tax cuts that favor corporations and wealthy New Yorkers, and said the state should focus on issues like fully funding public schools, reforming campaign finance rules and — with the topic fresh on her mind — getting the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the subway, to fix the system.

Nixon, best known for her role as Miranda Hobbes on the HBO series “Sex and the City,” announced her campaign in an ad released Monday.

In the video, Nixon accuses Cuomo of failing to fix “our broken subway,” a hot-button issue for many New Yorkers, especially after 2017’s “summer of hell,” when extensive delays regularly caused crowding on the subways and platforms.

Nixon’s candidacy has already drawn opposition from former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who told the New York Post Tuesday, that “[Nixon]’s an accomplished actress, a supporter of political causes and that’s a good thing ... But she’s never run an organization. This is a time to move away from celebrity and toward progressive leadership.”

That celebrity did prompt a number of “Sex and the City”-themed responses on Twitter:

The FBI told The Associated Press and CBS News that it believes the detonation at the facility outside San Antonio is likely connected to the string of bombings that have rocked Austin in the past month.

“We suspect it is related to our investigation,” FBI San Antonio spokeswoman Michelle Lee told CNN.

The package wasn’t destined for the Schertz area, Schertz Police Chief Michael Hansen said during a news conference Tuesday. He added that one person standing nearby to the explosion later complained of ringing in the ears but was treated on site and then released.

Hansen refused to comment on any possible link to the Austin bombings and refrained from releasing any information pertaining to the package’s ultimate destination.

“We are working closely with law enforcement in their investigation,” said a FedEx spokesperson, who confirmed that one of its staff members had suffered a minor injury.

Tuesday’s incident comes on the heels of four other package explosions across Austin in recent weeks ― most recently on Sunday night ― which have left two people dead and four others injured.

“We are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,” Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said Monday. “We have seen similarities in the devices that exploded here last night and the other three devices.”

Authorities are offering a $115,000 award to anyone with information that could help in the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible.

President Donald Trump called the spate of bombings “terrible” on Tuesday, referring to whomever is responsible as “obviously a very, very sick individual ― or maybe individuals.”

Donald Trump was so excited to welcome the first lady home from the hospital that he misspelled his own wife’s name in a tweet Saturday.

And Twitter couldn’t be happier.

Trump referred to his wife as “Melanie” instead of Melania, as in “Melanie is doing and feeling really well” after treatment for a kidney condition. It was quickly corrected to Melania, but Twitterdom roared. (The first lady’s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Melania was resting comfortably back home and in high spirits.)

“Melanie” quickly trended on Twitter. Most of the responses were on the order of “please tell us about this ’Melanie,‘” with others wondering if “she” had contacted Stormy Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti.

Melanie is home in the White House. Donald, Jr. is heading to the Big House. https://t.co/aGCCb5z1q7 — The Daily Edge (@TheDailyEdge) May 19, 2018A federal judge has temporarily blocked a new law in Mississippi that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, the strictest limit in the nation.

U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves on Tuesday granted a request for a temporary restraining order by the state’s sole abortion clinic. On Monday, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510, codifying the ban into law.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Mississippi’s only abortion clinic, and The Center for Reproductive Rights quickly sued for a restraining order to block the law.

Rob McDuff, the clinic’s attorney, said in a court hearing on Tuesday that a woman who is at least 15 weeks pregnant was scheduled for an abortion that day, according to The Associated Press.

Special assistant attorney general Paul Barnes countered that the state should prioritize protecting maternal health and “unborn life.”

The bill passed in both chambers of the Mississippi legislature on March 8, which was also International Women’s Day. The law has no exceptions for rape and incest victims, but does exempt women whose lives are endangered by the pregnancy or whose fetuses would not survive the pregnancy.

Abortion is already extremely difficult to access in Mississippi. The state is one of 17 in the country that bans abortions at 20 weeks. Arkansas tried to ban the procedure at 12 weeks, but a federal appeals court ruled the law unconstitutional and blocked it in 2015.

Reproductive rights advocates have argued that even the 20-week ban is unconstitutional on the basis of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, which said a state cannot impose an undue burden on a woman’s ability to have an abortion until the fetus would be able to survive outside the womb. Doctors set viability at roughly 22-24 weeks.

In a statement on Tuesday, The Center for Reproductive Rights argued that Mississippi was violating that Supreme Court precedent in passing the 15-week ban.Lawmakers in Washington worked feverishly into the night on Monday to finalize a sweeping spending bill to fund the government through September and avert yet another government shutdown

Reports suggest lawmakers may scrap several controversial riders in an effort to get the bill passed before midnight on Friday, when funding for the government is set to dry up. Progress on the bill, which provides over a trillion dollars in funding, has been stymied by disagreements over President Donald Trump’s border wall and other several hot-button issues.

The White House has struggled to reach an agreement with Democrats on a plan to fund the wall in exchange for relief for beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The program, which Trump last year decided to end, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to temporarily remain in the U.S.

A bipartisan health care package will likely also be excluded from the spending bill, lawmakers told CNN. The measure would have included federal subsidies aimed at driving down insurance premiums in the Obamacare marketplace. Negotiations over the measure reached an impasse, however, after GOP lawmakers insisted on new abortion restrictions on those insurance plans.

Federal funding to support the Gateway Program, a construction project to expand a rail line between Newark, New Jersey and New York City, will likely also be scrapped from the omnibus bill. President Trump had previously threatened to veto the legislation if it included federal payments for the program.

Other contested measures that will likely also fall to the wayside include gun control and a reform of how sexual harassment claims are handled on Capitol Hill.

This is the third time in as many months that the federal government is facing a potential shutdown. It may also be the last battle over spending before the November midterm elections.Actress Rose McGowan recorded a birthday message to movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who she has previously accused of rape.

“Happy birthday, Harvey Weinstein,” the “Charmed” star said in a video she shared on Twitter early Tuesday morning. “I told you we’d be coming. I told you 20 years ago, if I heard of you doing this to another girl or woman, we would come for you, I would come for you.”

“Happy fucking birthday,” McGowan continued. “From all of us. We win.”

She ended the video with a wink.

McGowan alleged that Weinstein, who turned 66 on Monday, raped her in 1997. In recent years, she’s become a leading voice among the dozens of women who have accused the producer of various forms of sexual misconduct.A proposal designed to “stabilize Obamacare” and reduce health insurance premiums for some Americans seems unlikely to become law anytime soon.

Negotiations to include the proposal as part of the big spending bill moving through Congress have broken down, as Peter Sullivan of The Hill first reported Monday. The primary reason is a dispute over federal funding of abortions: Republican leaders are insisting the proposal include restrictions that most Democrats will not support.

But it is not just differences over reproductive rights that are standing in the way of passage.

Many Republicans still aren’t willing to vote for any proposal that might appear to prop up Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, which they and many of their supporters would rather just repeal.

Meanwhile, Democrats have begun to wonder, with good reason, whether the specific reforms under discussion could hurt more insurance buyers than they would help.

Circumstances could always change. But for now, it looks like those reservations have left the proposal without the support it needs to get through Congress ― as part of this new spending bill and, perhaps, as part of any other legislation this year.

As a result, some middle- and upper-income Americans are likely to see pretty big premium spikes this fall, above and beyond the usual increases, right before the midterm elections. And they may be looking for somebody to blame.

What The Proposal Would Do

The proposal under discussion now comes from two Republican senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine. Its focus is insurance for people who buy coverage on their own, either through HealthCare.gov, state exchanges like Covered California, or directly from insurers.

Those people are the ones the Affordable Care Act affected most directly. Today, they can get comprehensive coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and a majority of them are eligible for federal tax credits that generally keep coverage affordable.

Those changes are one reason the number of Americans without health insurance is so much lower than it was before the Affordable Care Act became law.

But a minority of consumers must pay full premiums, because their household incomes are more than four times the poverty line. (That’s about $100,000 for a family of four.) And in some parts of the country, like Iowa and Tennessee, premiums have skyrocketed ― partly because of design flaws in the 2010 health care law, and partly because of Republican efforts to undermine its implementation.

Some struggle to pay premiums, while others decide not to get insurance altogether. Those problems are likely to get even worse next year, because the 2017 Republican tax bill eliminated the penalty for people who don’t get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get insurance, causing premiums to rise.

The proposal from Alexander and Collins seeks to mitigate those kinds of increases, primarily through two new spending initiatives. One would allocate $30.5 billion over three years for “reinsurance” and “invisible high-risk pools,” each of which would reimburse insurers for the beneficiaries with the biggest medical bills ― thereby allowing insurers to reduce premiums.

The Affordable Care Act originally had a reinsurance program that expired after three years. The Alexander-Collins proposal would start it up again, for another three years, reducing premiums by 10 percent on average in 2019 and by 20 percent on average in the two years after that, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

The other big initiative in the Alexander-Collins proposal would resume “cost-sharing reduction” subsidies, which are a separate set of federal payments to insurers that President Donald Trump stopped in October.

The benefits of restoring the CSRs, as they’ve come to be known, are more ambiguous than the benefits of funding reinsurance.

The original impetus for guaranteeing CSR payments was to avoid disruption, since insurers had been counting upon those payments and Trump was loudly threatening to stop them (as he eventually did). Last fall, Alexander, who is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, worked closely with his Democratic counterpart, ranking minority member Patty Murray of Washington state, on a bill that would have funded CSRs. It was a rare show of genuine bipartisanship.

But once Trump made his decision and the CSR money stopped flowing, insurers in most states reacted quickly, jacking up premiums exclusively on customers who were eligible for tax credits. By design, those tax credits rise in tandem with premiums, which means those consumers didn’t end up paying more out of their own pockets. They simply got bigger tax credits, which meant greater spending by the federal government.

Many ended up buying more generous plans, while others kept their plans and just pocketed the savings. Restoring CSR funding now would reverse that process ― reducing premiums on the subsidized plans, but reducing tax credits too. The federal government would end up spending less money subsidizing insurance, but lower-income consumers would actually have to pay a lot more to keep the same plans.

Some would end up not getting coverage at all, which is why, according to the CBO, the number of people without insurance would actually rise if the Alexander-Collins proposal became law, although the increase would be small.

Why Talks Broke Down

Whether the upsides of the Alexander-Collins package justify its downsides has been the subject of increasingly intense debate among Democrats and progressive analysts in the last few weeks. Families USA, a liberal organization and prominent advocate for coverage expansions, actually came out in opposition to the bill.

But the whole conversation appears to have become moot because of additional conditions Republican leaders have attached to any Affordable Care Act stabilization proposal. And by far the most important among these is the language around abortion.

Under the Alexander-Collins bill, no insurer that accepts either reinsurance or CSR funds could pay for abortion services. If that were to become law, then it’s almost certain no insurer offering coverage to individuals would include abortion coverage, because no insurer would want to give up those lucrative payments.

That’s not the case today. Today, insurers can cover abortion services in states that allow such benefits, just as long as the insurers don’t use federal dollars of any kind. In other words, insurers can’t use money they’ve received in the form of premium tax credits. Back when CSR money was coming in, they couldn’t use that money either.

To accomplish this, insurers that cover abortion pay for those services with separate spending accounts, filled only with premiums they have received directly from individuals. In theory, the same workaround would (or could be made to) apply to the money insurers get from Alexander-Collins.

But conservative Republicans have never recognized that distinction as meaningful. They say the Affordable Care Act violates the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion. The Alexander-Collins proposal would essentially outlaw the existing arrangement, leaving potentially millions of women without a way to get insurance that covers abortion.

Insistence upon these abortion restrictions undoubtedly reflects genuine policy preferences from conservatives. It also reflects a political calculation ― namely, that Republicans can’t afford to alienate supporters who are strongly opposed to abortion, Obamacare, or both.

But a lack of action on health care could have its own political consequences. If the polls are right, voters will hold Republicans, not Democrats, responsible for problems with the Affordable Care Act ― and for problems with health care more generally.

Casey Moreland, a former local judge in Nashville, Tennessee, awaits trial after federal prosecutors released a 25-page indictment last week charging that he erased court and traffic fines in exchange for sex with two women.

Moreland allegedly went to great lengths to cover up his sexual misconduct and now faces the charges against him include obstruction of justice, witness tampering, theft from a federally funded program, embezzlement and destruction of evidence. He was previously indicted in April 2017 on five obstruction charges. With the new charges pending against him, he was arrested earlier this month and is being held without bail in a Kentucky jail.

Moreland initially stepped down from his post as presiding judge in February 2017 after Nashville station WSMV-TV interviewed Natalie Amos, who said Moreland made her court and traffic fees go away and then pursued a sexual relationship with her.

Fees she owed totaling $1,200 were “just gone,” Amos told WSMV, referring to the first time she encountered Moreland in July 2015. “I just really thought I was gonna get an extension and [the fine] just went away.”

After Moreland waived her fees he reportedly texted her: “Your fees; fines and court cost are taken care of! You now officially owe me !! Haha.”

Their relationship didn’t turn sexual, Amos said, until a year later when she needed help paying over $1,000 in traffic fines in order to get her driver’s license back. Moreland reportedly helped dismiss Amos’ fees and then propositioned her for sex. When Amos accepted and the two discussed details of where to meet, Moreland texted her: “Just be horny and naked!!”

Moreland later used his standing as a judge to call off a police officer who had pulled Amos over during a routine traffic stop, according to the indictment.

Amos reportedly thanked Moreland by text, to which he responded: “Just used my superpowers!!” and later, referring to a sexual encounter, texted, “My desk still has butt marks on it!!”

Amos said she was introduced to Moreland through her friend Leigh Terry, who claimed she had a similar relationship with the ex-judge. Terry committed suicide in May 2016 and it was the investigation into her death that led authorities to look into Moreland’s behavior. In January 2017, The Nashville Scene reported that people close to Terry claimed she had slept with Moreland in exchange for favorable treatment of a DUI case.

Moreland denied having sexual relationships with the women in a statement at that time to the new outlet

He also said that “at no time did I intervene on their behalf during or after judgments were rendered by the appropriate courts” in their cases.

Prosecutors charge that before Moreland resigned from the bench in March 2017, he attempted to cover up his sexual misconduct. A month after he found out the FBI was investigating him, Moreland allegedly met with a person identified in court documents as “J.P.” and said he would pay Amos $6,000 as hush money.

Moreland reportedly enlisted J.P. to get Amos to sign an affidavit saying she fabricated their entire relationship. According to the most recent indictment, Moreland told J.P. to get Amos “liquored up real good” before bringing up the signing of the affidavit.

The affidavit said that Amos was “tricked” into giving the February 2017 interview with WSMV and the reporter paid her $2,500 to lie.

(Although Amos is not named in the indictment, local news outlets reported that she is the unnamed “Person 1” referred to throughout the document. The quotes used in the indictment also align with what Amos said in the original WSMV news reports.)

The $6,000 Moreland was going to give Amos to keep her quiet allegedly came from other illegal activity.

According to prosecutors, Moreland and another staffer had been skimming money from the Davidson County Drug Treatment Court program, which is designed to provide an alternative to jail for defendants with substance abuse problems. Moreland, who presided over the program, allegedly pocketed money from defendants who had to pay between $500 and $750 to join the program.

Both J.P. and the staffer who helped Moreland skim money ended up cooperating with the FBI in its investigation of Moreland.“Acrimony” director Tyler Perry told Jimmy Kimmel Monday what went down in his weekend bidding war against Blue Ivy at a charity art auction.

The 6-year-old daughter of Jay-Z and Beyoncé charmed the internet in footage that showed her bidding $19,000 for a painting of Sidney Poitier at LA’s Wearable Art Gala on Saturday.

Perry victoriously countered with a $20,000 offer, joking to Kimmel that he was glad to teach the pint-sized painting collector a lesson.

“You’re not gonna get everything you want!” Perry said.

Watch the “Jimmy Kimmel Live” segment above.

Here’s a clip from the auction:After reports surfaced earlier this month that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson spent $31,000 of taxpayer funds on a dining set for his government office, the former Republican presidential candidate said he was “as surprised as anyone to find out” about the lavish purchase.

That’s because Carson’s wife was responsible for the decision, the secretary said at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.

After staffers gave Carson a few options for tables, the secretary said he “left it with [his] wife” and asked her to “help choose something.”

“The next thing that I, quite frankly, heard about it was that this $31,000 table had been bought,” he told a House Appropriations subcommittee. “I said, ‘What the heck is that all about?’ I investigated, I immediately had it canceled. Not that we don’t need the furniture, but I thought that that was excessive.”

A request to cancel the purchase was issued only after multiple news outlets reported about it. The steep cost raised ethics concerns for exceeding the $5,000 federal limit on office decor, especially in light of the agency’s proposed budget cuts. Carson said at the hearing that all funds had been returned to the U.S. Treasury.

Additionally, when The New York Times first reported on the extravagant purchase, HUD spokesman Raffi Williams told the paper that Carson did not think the purchase was over-the-top and did not intend to return the furniture set.

Carson has also said that he was not involved with the final decision, arguing again on Tuesday that he was busy doing other things and “really wasn’t concerned about furniture.” A HUD spokesperson first told CNN that neither Carson or his wife, Candy, were involved in the decision to purchase the $31,000 dining set.

But emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, show that Carson and his wife, Candy, were both involved in selecting the furniture.

At Tuesday’s hearing, Carson described his wife as “the most frugal person in the world.” When asked if his wife had any other involvement with taxpayer money, he replied, “None whatsoever.”John Oliver’s queer-themed, Mike Pence-trolling children’s book, A Day In the Life of Marlon Bundo, is a certified smash. If the host of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” had his way, however, America wouldn’t need its levity so badly.

The book, released Sunday, takes aim at the vice president’s anti-LGBTQ platform by depicting the Pence family rabbit, Marlon Bundo, as gay and in love with another male rabbit. By the conclusion, the bunnies even tie the knot in a same-sex wedding.

Oliver dropped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Tuesday, and explained his incentive for the book, which was written by one of his show’s writers, Jill Twiss, and is currently sold out on Amazon. His 2-year-old son, Hudson, was also an inspiration.

“Part of the reason for writing this book was so that I could read something to him which paints the world in the light that you want it to be rather than the way that it’s currently being painted,” Oliver told DeGeneres. Hudson, he added, “doesn’t really understand what’s happening in the world ― long may that continue.”

The success of A Day In the Life of Marlon Bundo came as a surprise to Oliver, and plans for a second printing are already underway. Still, the HBO host said he wishes the Trump administration would make his job as a comedian more difficult.

“It would be really nice, on a human level and a comedic level, if there was less happening,” he said. “We’d all sleep better.”
