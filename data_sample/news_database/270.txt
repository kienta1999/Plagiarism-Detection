Iranian and Iran-backed Shi’ite forces, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, have deployed widely in support of Assad. Iran’s military chief warned Israel last October against breaching Syrian airspace and territory.

Israel’s air force has targeted Syrian military and Hezbollah targets in Syria on an almost regular basis, but its attacks on Saturday appeared to be the most intense yet.

Referring to the downed Israeli F-16, an official in the pro-Assad alliance said a “message” had been delivered to Israel. “I do not believe matters will develop to a regional war,” the official said.

U.S. HAWKISH ON IRAN

In Washington, President Donald Trump’s administration has backed Israel’s hawkish stance on Iran, and declared containing Tehran’s influence an objective of its Syria policy. On a visit to Israellast month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called Iran the world’s “leading state sponsor of terror.”

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also expected to visit the region in the coming week to discuss the crisis in Syria and other issues, and is scheduled to visit Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and other countries.

Hezbollah and Israel last fought a major conflict in 2006.

Tensions have also spiked across the frontier between Israel and Lebanon over Israeli plans for border wall, and Lebanese plans to exploit an offshore energy block which is partly located in disputed waters.

The Israeli military said 12 targets, including three aerial defense batteries and four Iranian targets that are part of Iran’s military establishment in Syria were attacked.

“During the attack, anti-aircraft missiles were fired towards Israel, triggering alarms that were heard in Northern Israel,” the military said.

Syrian state media reported two separate Israeli attacks.

In the first one, a military source said Syrian air defenses had opened fire in response to an Israeli act of “aggression” against a military base, hitting “more than one plane”.

Later, state media said air defenses were responding to a new Israeli assault and air defenses had thwarted attacks on military positions in southern Syria.

Israel said one of its attack helicopters shot down an Iranian drone at around 4.30am (9.30 p.m. ET/0230 GMT) that had come from Syria into Israel. “In response, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) targeted Iranian targets in Syria,” the military said.

“MASSIVE” ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE

Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said a “substantial” number of Israeli warplanes on the mission had come under “massive Syrian anti-air fire”, and only one Israeli jet was harmed.

The F-16 came down in a field near the northern Israeli village of Harduf, television footage showed, and one of the pilots was injured as they ejected, the military said.

David Ivry, a former Israeli Air Force chief, told Reuters he believed it was the first time an Israeli F-16 was brought down since Israel began using the jets in the 1980s.

“We don’t know if the pilots ejected because of the (Syrian)fire,” Conricus said. It was also unclear at what stage of the mission they ejected, he said, “but it is of extreme concern to us if they were shot down.”

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israel had targeted areas in the countryside southwest of Damascus, near the Syrian-Lebanon border west of Damascus and in the eastern countryside of Homs province for several hours since dawn.

It said another set of raids hit southwest of Damascus, and another struck around the Damascus-Beirut highway near the border with Lebanon.

In Israel, uniformed military personnel could be seen gathered around the burned and tangled metal in Harduf by mid-morning, with what appeared to be white foam on the surrounding grass. Others knelt in the grass, inspecting pieces of the jet.

Rocket alert sirens sounded in the Israeli-held Golan Heights and in northern Israel. There were no reports of casualties.

Flights in to Israel’s main airport near Tel Aviv were suspended for about 15 minutes and take-offs were held for about 20 minutes on Saturday morning. “Ben Gurion Airport is now operating as usual,” Israeli Airport Authority spokesman Ofer Lefler said.

The airport’s online live flight schedule showed flights were departing and landing.

Police said at least 18 people, including 15 men, had been confirmed dead on the scene. Dozens more were hurt, some sitting hunched on the highway with blood streaming from their injuries.

One elderly man interviewed on television said the driver had been going extremely fast at the time of the accident, even taking bends at high speed.PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - Pyeongchang Olympics organizers were looking into a disruption of non-critical systems on the day of the opening ceremony but could not yet confirm if it was a cyberattack, Games spokesman Sung Baik-you said on Saturday.

The Winter Olympics opened with a spectacular ceremony on Friday, attended by several heads of state who witnessed the joint march of North and South Korean athletes, as Games systems played up.

The ceremony was also attended by North Korean ceremonial leader Kim Yong Nam and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, as well as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.

Some local media reported system problems, including the Games website and some television sets, were due to a cyberattack but Sung said it was still too early to determine whether hackers had attempted to damage them.

“There were some issues that affected some of our non-critical systems last night for a few hours,” Sung told reporters, without detailing what the issues specifically were.

“We apologize for the inconvenience caused. It has not disrupted any event or had any effect on safety and security for athletes or spectators.”

Sung said security experts were currently investigating the incident.

“Experts are watching to ensure and maintain any systems at expected service levels. We are currently investigating the cause of the issue. At this time we cannot confirm (a cyberattack),” he added.

“We are investigating the cause and we will share more information. All competitions are running as planned.”

It was also not clear whether failure to deploy drones as part of the programme during the two-hour opening ceremony was in any way related to the system problems.

The International Olympic Committee said pre-recorded footage of the drones was used instead. “Due to impromptu logistical changes it (drone deployment) did not proceed,” the IOC spokesman said with elaborating further.

The Winter Games, staged only 80km (50 miles) from the North Korean border, saw the two Koreas, who are technically still at war since a 1953 armistice, march together at the opening ceremony for the first time since 2006.

South Korea has been using the Pyeongchang Games to break the ice with the reclusive North, which has been trading nuclear threats with the United States recently.Jimmy Fallon is here to get Team USA psyched up for the Winter Olympics.

The comedian delivered a passionate pep talk to American athletes competing at the 2018 games, in Pyeonchang, South Korea, on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show.”

“Hey Team USA, do it, just do it,” Fallon shouted into the camera, while dressed in the national team’s kit.

Fallon’s rallying call came at the end of a segment in which he read viewers’ funny explanations as to why they were still single, including this post from American Olympic ski champion Lindsey Vonn:

I’m single because I only have eyes for the Olympics❤️ #whyimsingle #onetrackmind ...also, where’s my pep talk coach? https://t.co/b3rblzLNKT — lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 7, 2018

Check out the full clip above, and see Fallon’s take on Friday’s Olympic opening ceremony below:Both memos included classified information that the president had to agree could be released. Trump approved release of the GOP memo despite the objections of the FBI and his Justice Department. But now he claims the rebuttal memo written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee “contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages,” according to a letter written by White House counsel Don McGahn.

McGahn said Trump has directed the Justice Department to offer assistance to the House committee to revise the Democrats’ memo.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Trump’s action “stunningly brazen” and “part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up.” She added: “Clearly, the president has something to hide.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, lashed Trump for ignoring pleas from the FBI and his own Justice Department not to release the GOP memo, authored by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), because it omitted “material facts.” The president now “expresses concerns over sharing precisely those facts with [the] public.”

After ignoring urging of FBI & DOJ not to release misleading Nunes memo because it omits material facts, @POTUS now expresses concerns over sharing precisely those facts with public and seeks to send it back to the same Majority that produced the flawed Nunes memo to begin with: pic.twitter.com/qNVyS99eXs — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 10, 2018

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called the move “obstruction of justice by Donald Trump happening in real time.” He said the call “makes a mockery of national security and common sense.”

Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) called for the release of the Democrats’ memo. He tweeted that he has read both memos and that neither one endangers national security. “The American people deserve the opportunity to read both memos,” he added.

Both the Republican and Democratic #FISA memos should be released. I’ve read both memos. Neither one endangers national security. The American people deserve the opportunity to read both memos. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) February 10, 2018

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) wondered if the Trump administration takes “the whole world for fools?”

What's comical about this letter is not so much its stratospheric hypocrisy as the laughable pretense that the White House is just responding to an independent legislative initiative. Do they really take the whole world for fools? — Rep. Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) February 10, 2018

Time for all the Fox News-injected government transparency advocates and diehard Russian Trolls to recycle their "Release the Memo" propaganda! — Rep. Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) February 10, 2018

Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) added: “Release the real memo.”

Trump’s move could increase pressure to release the entire application for the warrant to electronically monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page that was submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Page, an investor with a history of Kremlin contacts before he joined Trump’s campaign team, was a target of the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election.

The court approved the warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2016 to track Page and renewed it three more times, indicating that the investigation may have found productive information.

The New York Times applied to the court earlier this week to release the full application for the warrant, arguing that Trump had already breached the secrecy barrier shielding the information when he allowed release of the GOP memo. “Publication would contribute to an informed debate about the propriety of the government’s FISA application,” the Times argued.

House Intelligence Committee members Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) also called for the application to be released as long as it could be redacted in such a way that it wouldn’t threaten national security, both men said on CNN’s “State of the Union” earlier this month.Kansas lawmakers are considering putting an age minimum on the state’s governorship as six teenagers campaign to lead the state in the November election.

Kansas now has no limits whatsoever on the age of its governor. A bill introduced by Republican state Rep. Blake Carpenter would require gubernatorial hopefuls to be at least 18 ― voting age ― and state residents for at least four years. It passed a House committee on Monday, the Kansas City Star reported.

The legislation, even if it becomes law, wouldn’t take effect until after the election to replace outgoing Gov. Sam Brownback (R). All six teen candidates were younger than 18 when they announced their runs.

“We have age requirements on voters, and I really think that anybody who’s running should be able to vote for themselves,” state Rep. Keith Esau (R) told the Topeka Capital-Journal.

Detractors say voters already can decide for themselves whether age matters.

Jack Bergeson in August became the first of the youths to announce a run for governor. He was 16 at the time.

“Oh, I could do that.” Bergeson, a Democrat, told the Kansas City Star. He said he supports a higher minimum wage, a high-speed rail system, and open-carry gun laws.

Three more teens, all Republicans, later announced their runs. The four young candidates held an open forum at a high school gym in October to answer questions. The Wichita Eagle noted that they agreed “to some extent” on the need to decriminalize marijuana.

After two more teens ― an independent and another Republican ― added their names to an increasingly crowded list of gubernatorial candidates, lawmakers took action. The field includes just one woman.Maame Biney took second in her heat to move on. Jamie Squire via Getty Images

She stayed cool under pressure.

Maame Biney, the first black woman on the U.S. Olympic speedskating team, advanced Saturday in the 500-meter short-track event with a veteran-like performance in the first round at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Biney finished second in her heat (43.665 seconds), behind Fan Kexin (43.350), but it was her late maneuvering to hold off third-place finisher Kim Alang that sealed her advancement.

Fellow American Lana Gehring failed to qualify.

Biney made the U.S. Olympic short-track team shortly before Erin Jackson, who is also black, earned a spot on the long-track team.

Biney, who will also compete in the 1,500 meters, told HuffPost before the games that she was looking forward to the food in South Korea ― but now she has a 500-meter quarterfinal on Tuesday to look forward to as well.

“I don’t really feel pressure to be the first to get a medal or anything like that,” Binley said earlier. “I just want to go out there, do my best and have fun, and experience the Olympics. That’s what I’m here for. I’m here to win, obviously, but also have fun.”Actress Rose McGowan addressed the death of former manager Jill Messick in a brief Instagram caption Saturday, three days after Messick’s suicide.

“For Jill: May your family find some measure of solace during this pain,” McGowan began.

“That one man could cause so much damage is astounding, but tragically true. The bad man did this to us both. May you find peace on the astral plane. May you find serenity with the stars.”

McGowan’s comments followed a scathing statement from Messick’s family to The Hollywood Reporter, calling Messick’s death “collateral damage” in the Harvey Weinstein scandal that shook Hollywood and sparked a global movement against sexual abuse. The family specifically blamed McGowan, Weinstein and journalists for contributing to stress in Messick’s life.

A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Feb 10, 2018 at 11:22am PST

“Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person’s attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey’s desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her,” Messick’s family said.

Messick, 50, was McGowan’s manager in 1997, the year McGowan told The New York Times in an article published in October that Weinstein raped her. McGowan told the Times she informed her manager about the attack shortly after it occurred.

“She put her arms around me,” McGowan told the paper. But in the months that followed, McGowan said she did not feel Messick supported her legal fight against the now-disgraced studio mogul.

Messick later took a job at Miramax, helmed by Weinstein at the time. She went on to produce hit films, including “She’s All That” and “Mean Girls.”

Messick’s family rejected the suggestion that she was not supportive to McGowan, saying she was “the first person who stood up on Rose’s behalf.”

Weinstein has called McGowan’s rape accusation “a bold lie” through his lawyer, claiming the actress told Messick soon afterward that the encounter was consensual. Weinstein in late January provided news outlets with emails from Messick detailing what she remembered of the day McGowan told her about the alleged rape.

A representative for Weinstein has not replied to HuffPost emails seeking comment.

Messick is survived by her two children, along with her father, brother, and partner.North Korean athletes “are not really participating in the Olympics,” said the father of American student Otto Warmbier, who died last year after his release from imprisonment in North Korea.

Fred Warmbier, attending the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as a guest of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, said during excerpts of an interview posted Saturday that he doubts the symbolic significance of North Korean involvement in the games.

“We have to put this in context, in the spirit of the Olympics, and why we’re here,” Warmbier said in a preview clip of an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. “And so when you put it that way they’re not really participating in the Olympics. Their athletes are not exchanging ideas with other athletes in the Olympic Village or really participating, so that’s a political statement.”

Warmbier and Pence sat inside a VIP box with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong for Friday’s opening ceremony at the Pyeongchang Stadium.

Warmbier said it wasn’t tough to watch Kim Yo Jong savoring the event from just a few feet away. “She’s in the Kim family,” he said.

TONIGHT: Otto Warmbier's father speaks out.



Fred Warmbier sat down for an exclusive interview with @LesterHoltNBC at the PyeongChang Olympics. More tonight on @NBCNightlyNews. https://t.co/lVfu7U4LoB pic.twitter.com/drIwu0m5np — NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt (@NBCNightlyNews) February 10, 2018

Earlier Friday, Warmbier and Pence met with a group of North Korean defectors, and Pence warned about a possible North Korean “charm offensive” during the games.

But Warmbier insisted his attendance in South Korea was “not political.” North Korea’s treatment of his son, he said, “is their standard ― that’s the way they do business.”

Much has been made of Olympics rapprochement between North Korea and South Korea, which are still split by war. Athletes from both nations entered Pyeongchang Stadium as a unified team sharing a flag for Friday’s opening ceremony. The Korean women’s hockey team is also the first in Olympic history to feature players from both countries.Photographers try really hard to create interpretations of a wide variety of subjects so they can easily sell their work on various stock photo agency sites. But there should probably be a rule that if you’re making a photo about a specific job, you should have at least an entry-level understanding of how it works. Because, lordy, these stock photos are something else.Diversity is as good as gold, according to a member of the Jamaican Bobsled Team.

Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian told a Winter Olympics press conference in Pyeonchang, South Korea, on Saturday how important it was for children to see reflections of themselves in sport.

It’s critical that “little girls and little boys see someone that looks like them, talks like them, has the same culture as them, has crazy, curly hair and wears a natural, has brown skin, included in different things in this world,” Fenlator-Victorian said, fighting tears. “When you grow up and you don’t see that, you feel that you can’t do it. And that is not right.”

Fenlator-Victorian, a native of New Jersey, finished 11th for the United States with Lolo Jones at the Sochi Olympics in 2014. She switched her team affiliation to Jamaica, the country of her father, Cosman, for the 2018 Olympics in an effort to boost representation in the event there. Jamaica, which sent the men’s bobsled team of “Cool Runnings” movie fame to the 1988 Olympics, is fielding a women’s bobsled team for the first time.

“So, coming back home to Jamaica, I wanted my Jamaican people to see that they could do it,” Fenlator-Victorian, 33, continued. “And there’s not just one path that way or one path this way to get out of poverty, to make money or to make a name for themselves. If they want to be a Winter Olympian and do alpine skiing, now they see their fellow Jamaicans in the Winter Olympics”He just didn’t want to risk it.

Defending Olympic halfpipe gold medalist Iouri Podladtchikov announced he was dropping out of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, so he can heal from a head injury he sustained last month.

“My brain needs time to recover from the bruises and I will not be able to compete,” he wrote in a tweet posted Saturday.

Podladtchikov, nicknamed I-Pod, did practice Friday at Phoenix Snow Park, as seen here:

But the Swiss athlete felt something was amiss.

“After all the tests that I have had on the way to the present day in the last two weeks ― including my first practice this Friday ― I can say for sure that starting and participating in the Olympic Games is in no way safe or responsible,” he said in a statement.

The men’s halfpipe begins on Tuesday.White House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned Friday after being accused of physical and emotional abuse by his ex-wife.

“Before we were contacted by the media, we learned last night that there were allegations. We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today,” said White House spokesman Raj Shah in a statement Friday.

Sorensen is the second White House official to resign this week over domestic abuse allegations. On Thursday, White House staff secretary Rob Porter stepped down after reports emerged that he was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives.

Sorensen’s former wife, Jessica Corbett, told The Washington Post about several violent episodes she said occurred during their marriage. She accused him of running over her foot with a car and burning her hand with a cigarette, as well as sending her abusive emails and text messages. The couple divorced in September.

Sorensen has denied the allegations, saying he stepped down to relieve the White House of a potential “distraction.”

“In fact, I was the victim of repeated physical violence during our marriage, not her,” he said in a statement to the Post. He detailed some of these incidents to the newspaper and provided photographs of bruises and scrapes he said he received from her during their arguments.

Sorensen, who worked on the Council on Environmental Quality, joined the Trump administration last year after working as a top adviser to Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R). At the time of his White House appointment, the Portland Press Herald wrote that “he has a reputation as an aggressive and sometimes combative political operative.”

According to Politico, officials had not yet completed a background check on Sorensen. Corbett told the Post she told the FBI about his behavior last year.

Porter’s background check had also never been completed.

Earlier Friday, President Donald Trump made his first public comments on Porter’s departure, pointing to his ex-staffer’s denials and calling the situation “very sad.”

“As you probably know, he says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “He said very strongly yesterday that he’s innocent, so you’ll have to talk to him about that.”

According to CNN, White House chief of staff John Kelly and others in the administration knew about the allegations against Porter for months before they became public.Bill Maher questions whether Vice President Mike Pence is actually having fun at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

On Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time,” the comedian joked about the games being a “great thing” where “all nations can come together.” “Even the shithole countries,” he added.

But Maher wondered whether Pence, who is representing President Donald Trump’s administration at the games, was really enjoying himself.

“He’s there now, doesn’t like it,” said Maher. “Foreigners playing in the snow, it’s you know. He doesn’t want to see Mexicans on ice, he wants to see ICE on Mexicans.”President Donald Trump, a man notorious for throwing around patently false accusations, has suddenly appealed for “due process” as top White House aides have been cast out over domestic violence allegations.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted that people’s lives “are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.”

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018

“Some are true and some are false,” he tweeted. “Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused.”

The president was likely referring to the recent departure of White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned earlier this week after allegations from his two ex-wives surfaced detailing that he was abusive to them. Colbie Holderness, Porter’s first wife, alleged that he punched her in 2005 and provided photos of bruises she says he inflicted on her.

Senior White House aide Rob Porter physically assaulted two ex-wives, they tell @theintercept. Full story to come in the morning.

And on Friday, White House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned after his ex-wife accused him of physically abusing her.

Trump himself, a man who once bragged about being able to grab women “by the pussy,” has been accused by more than 20 women of sexual misconduct and abuse. It might not come as a surprise, then, that Trump would be eager to protect those accused of misconduct and abuse rather than those who say they’ve been victimized by it.

“Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?” the president asked in a tweet. It’s a fair question, for sure. It’s also something Trump has previously not seemed to care about. Here are just a few times that “due process” didn’t matter to Trump.

The Central Park Five

In 1989, a group of black and Hispanic men were convicted but later exonerated in the rape of a female jogger in New York City’s Central Park.

As police coercion and false allegations ruined these men’s lives, Trump spent $85,000 to place ads in four daily New York City newspapers to demand the innocent men be killed.

“Muggers and murderers should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes,” Trump wrote in the ad at the time.

Despite their names eventually being cleared, Trump still wouldn’t stop saying they were guilty.

“The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty,” Trump told CNN in 2016. “The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.”

President Barack Obama

For years, Trump has also promoted the conspiracy that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim who was actually born in Kenya and is lying about his identity. None of that is true.

Via @BreitbartFeed--why doesn't @BarackObama release his original book proposal which says he was born in Kenya?http://t.co/pDDHJcjH — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2012

Trump later retracted his false statement during his bid to become president. But the damage was done.

“I say nothing,” Trump said during a 2016 debate with candidate Hillary Clinton regarding Obama’s long-form birth certificate. “I say nothing because I was able to get him to produce it.”

Last year, Trump falsely accused Obama of having ”wires tapped” in Trump Tower. The Department of Justice flatly denied the claim.

Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

Hillary Clinton

Even after winning the election, Trump has been unable to stop focusing on Clinton. Trump has repeatedly said Clinton lied to the FBI regarding her private email server. Meanwhile, former Trump administration official Flynn pleaded guilty last December to misleading the FBI about talks he had with Russian officials.

“Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her,” Trump said last December. “Flynn lied and they’ve destroyed his life. I think it’s a shame.”

Former head of the FBI James Comey, who Trump eventually fired, told Congress in a July 2017 testimony there was “no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.”

‘Treasonous’ Democrats

Just this month, Trump made the bold and outrageous accusation that Democrats who did not clap and praise the president during his recent State of the Union address are “treasonous.”

“Can we call that treason?” Trump said of Democrats last week during a campaign-style rally in Cincinnati. “Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”

Committing treason is a deeply serious accusation for a president to make. U.S. law states that whoever “owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason.”

To be clear: Not clapping for the president does not qualify as treason.

‘Mexican’ Judge

In June of 2016, Trump accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of not being able to make a fair ruling regarding lawsuits against Trump University. The president alleged that because he has made it clear he wants to build a wall to separate Mexico and the U.S., the judge’s heritage would be a “conflict.”

Curiel had “an absolute conflict” because of his “Mexican heritage,” Trump claimed.

He then doubled down on the claim in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper that same month.

“Look, he’s proud of his heritage, OK? I’m building a wall,” Trump told Tapper. Curiel is an American who was born in Indiana. That same judge will now preside over a case to determine whether or not Trump will get his border wall.The Republican National Committee is catching heat on Twitter after it encouraged people to support Team USA at the Winter Olympics by buying this old beanie from President Donald Trump’s website:

Many respondents accused the RNC of attempting to cash in on the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. They also asked how purchasing a “Thank You Tour 2016” hat would help them “gear up for Team USA.”

Others questioned whether any of the money raised would benefit American athletes competing in South Korea. Here’s a sampling of the responses:

Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla got her tactics exactly right in Saturday’s Olympic women’s skiathlon as she made her break for gold, but coach Johan Granath was left on tenterhooks to see if her timing would pay off.

Kalla, who was runner-up to Norway’s Marit Bjoergen in Sochi in 2014, made her break at the start of the final lap, opening up a lead that saw her cross the finish line 7.8 seconds ahead of her Norwegian rival to take the first gold of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

“The tactic was to take it easy on the freestyle part and try to be at the front of the field, and then go for it, either here in the stadium or where she did it,” Granath told Reuters.

“You never know how a race will develop ― she could have easily had Marit or Krista (Parmakoski, who finished third) with her, and then she would have had to go in the next hill, or the next hill,” he explained.

Granath had no need to worry as Kalla was never in danger of being reeled in by Bjoergen, whose silver made her the first woman to win 11 medals at the Olympic Winter Games.Kenneth Davis who lives near a Chevron refinery in North Richmond, California, speaks during a protest outside the annual meeting at Chevron headquarters in San Ramon, California.

“You know, I was 10 years old. I thought it was hella cool,” Soto says. “But now I know that’s flaring and that it was being done to burn off an imbalance of gases to prevent an explosion.”

The Chevron refinery looms large in Richmond — physically, but also in the affairs of its residents and government. On Jan. 22, the city filed a lawsuit against the multinational and 28 other oil, gas and coal companies ― including BP, Exxon and Shell ― for knowingly contributing to climate change.

A climate change adaptation study commissioned by the city revealed challenges it will face by 2100. It found that the city’s current levees will not protect it against rising sea levels and its water supply, sourced from runoff from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, is vulnerable to drought.

“We have two rail lines, 3,000 acres of public waterfront parks, vulnerable neighborhoods, two wastewater treatment plants, and a refinery, all subject to inundation,” said Richmond Mayor Tom Butt in a press statement.

Richmond is the ninth U.S. community in less than a year to take major fossil fuel companies to court, alleging that the industry has known for 50 years that its products significantly impact the Earth’s climate yet concealed these dangers from the public. It joins New York City and seven California communities, including San Francisco, Oakland, Santa Cruz and San Mateo County, in seeking damages to help pay for infrastructure projects related to sea level rise.

Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall called the lawsuits counterproductive in an email, saying they will do nothing to address “the serious issue of climate change.” He added, “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement.”

But residents in the communities that have sued are cautiously optimistic. Soto, now a community organizer in Richmond with Communities For a Better Environment, says he’s delighted to see the city file the latest lawsuit. The effects of climate change are on the community’s mind, he said, from California’s droughts to recent devastating wildfires.

“I have never seen that kind of air quality in my entire life living in the Bay Area and I’m 62 years old,” Soto said of the wine country fires in October and the smoke they generated, which affected the entire region. “It was dense. It was dark. It was blocking out the sun. Everything was red,” he added. “To us, these are all evidence of climate change. And the fact that the petrochemicals industry knew they were doing this to the planet and covered it up is why Richmond and these other cities are saying, ‘Enough’s enough.’”

Surrounded by water on three sides, Richmond, with a population of 107,500, is home to some of the poorest communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Chevron is the city’s largest employer.

“They just don’t care. They just care about the profit, how much they can make money,” lifelong Richmond resident Torm Nompraseurt, who is an organizer with the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, said of Chevron’s attitude to climate change.

Kate Sears is a county supervisor from Marin County across the bay from Richmond, which filed a similar lawsuit in July against 37 fossil fuel companies. Sears likened the lawsuits to ones filed against the tobacco industry, which hinged on whether those companies lied to the public about the health dangers of their products.

“Instead of warning consumers about the dangers of their unabated consumption of fossil fuel products or adjusting their products to limit greenhouse gas emissions, or at least communicating, they launched a public campaign to create confusion and doubts and discredit the science of consensus about climate change,” she said.

It’s possible now to attribute amounts of greenhouse gas emissions to particular companies, she said. The level of scientific knowledge “gave me a lot of encouragement about the strength of this lawsuit because of the strength of the science.”

Rising sea levels could compromise nearly 20 miles of public and private roadways, in addition to many buildings, according to a 2015 assessment released by Marin County.

Kevin Conger, who has lived in the county for 15 years, said he’s noticed increased flooding in the past five to six years. “On a clear day when the road is flooded out and it’s not raining or hasn’t rained for a week, it’s pretty clear that sea level is the issue,” he said.

Conger is a landscape architect and participant in Resilient by Design, which brings together residents, experts and public officials in the San Francisco Bay Area to develop solutions to sea level rise and severe weather — such as horizontal levees that use vegetation and floating islands. No matter the result of the lawsuits, residents need to start thinking about climate change to voice their priorities to policymakers, he said.

“We either are going to flood slowly and abandon areas around the bay that can’t protect themselves or we’re going to adapt and protect the areas,” he said. “The good news is we have some time to do that — not forever, a decade maybe, before things become really urgent. But planning at this scale is really, really slow. So we need to start on it right now.”

Local communities are clearly feeling this urgency. In Imperial Beach, a working class city of 27,000 mostly Latino residents located south of San Diego, citizens have packed public meetings about the impact of sea level rise. Four hundred people appeared at one meeting, according to Mayor Serge Dedina. “It was the most widely attended meeting we had in our city’s history,” he said.

The real wake-up call for the city happened during the last El Niño in 2015, when the ocean was 12 inches higher than normal, said Dedina. “We really saw the future coming out at us. We saw some of the worst coastal flooding — without very big surf conditions — that we’d ever seen. In fact, in our bay front we had the worst flooding ever. ”

Imperial Beach also sued fossil fuel companies in July. Paloma Aguirre, a town resident and avid surfer, is also the coastal and marine director of Wilcoast, an environmental nonprofit that Dedina co-founded. Sea level rise brings raw sewage and solid waste into the city from Tijuana, Mexico, which shares the border and an estuary with Imperial Beach, she said. Rising temperatures in Southern California means more mosquitoes, she pointed out. Some of them carry deadly viruses like West Nile or Zika.

“To the community here, it is absolutely an issue of environmental justice,” she said of the lawsuit, noting that rising sea levels will force families out of their homes.

“And that is an injustice because many residents here have grown up here and love this community,” she added. “I certainly do. I wouldn’t want to be pushed out because of an issue that could have been prevented or resolved by some of these corporations.”A teenager who had been set to testify against a Michigan man she said raped her has been found dead in what police are investigating as a homicide.

The body of Mujey Dumbuya, 16, of Grand Rapids, was discovered on Jan. 28 by two people walking in a wooded area about 50 miles from Dumbuya’s home, according to the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety.

Police said they are investigating Dumbuya’s death as a homicide, and hope that her missing shoe ― a pink Nike sneaker ― could aid in the investigation. The department has released few other details.

Dumbuya had been set to testify in the April trial of a man accused of raping her in a parked car. Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker told NBC affiliate WOOD-TV that Quinn Anthony James, 42, is charged with four counts of third-degree criminal sexual assault. He was arrested on Feb. 1 near Grand Rapids on an unrelated criminal sexual assault charge, but authorities released him for lack of evidence.

Police say James is a person of interest in Dumbuya’s death, according to local media reports.

Dumbuya was last seen alive the morning of Jan. 24 as she left for East Kentwood High School, according to WOOD. She never made it to school. Police said she was reported as a runaway three days before her body was discovered.

James was a maintenance worker at the high school. The school district denied he’s alleged to have committed any crimes on school grounds.

A GoFundMe campaign set up Dumbuya’s family to help cover funeral costs has raised $13,000 ― $3,000 above its goal. Services were Friday.

“Mujey was a generous, energetic young woman with a radiant smile and an adventurous spirit,” the family said in a statement this week.Actor Reg E. Cathey, who played Freddy Hayes on “House of Cards,” has died. He was 59.

Cathey also appeared in the gritty hit series “The Wire,” as Norman Wilson, and played warden Martin Querns in “Oz.” He appeared in several other series, as well, including “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and “Grimm.”

The man with the riveting baritone won an Emmy in 2015 for his “House of Cards” role, playing the owner of a rib joint who ends up working in the White House. He was nominated for three consecutive years for the role.

His death was reported Friday by David Simon, the creator of “The Wire.” TMZ reported that Cathey had been battling lung cancer and that he died at home surrounded by family.

Simon called Cathey a “masterful actor” and a “most delightful” human being. “Reg, your memory is a great blessing,” he said in a tweet.

“House of Cards” creator Beau Willimon called Cathey “one of a kind” and “brimming with life force, generosity and humor.”

In Simon’s ground-breaking Baltimore series, Cathey mixed careers, as he did in “House of Cards.” In “The Wire,” which he joined in its fourth season, he played a newspaperman who became a political operative.

He had plenty of attitude about politics off-screen as well.

In an interview with The Guardian in 2016, he slammed the religious right.

“A bunch of douchebags have taken over and what they are preaching, it’s not really religion,” Cathey said. “If Jesus was to come to America today, talk about throwing the merchants out of the temple, he’d be throwing all these douchebags out of Christianity. If he met anyone from the Tea Party, he’d be furious: ‘Get the fuck out of people’s bedrooms and bathrooms.’”

Cathey was born in Alabama and spent time as a child with his family in Germany. He studied theater at the University of Michigan and the Yale School of Drama.

He quipped to the Guardian that his career took off after Barack Obama was elected president because people could begin to accept the idea of a well-spoken black man.

“What I did notice is that Barack Obama becomes president and suddenly black people who are well-spoken are working more,” he said. “This new market for the well-spoken black actor is all due to Obama. He got inaugurated, and I started working like a fiend — hired by the same people who would previously ask: ‘Have you always spoken like that?’ It’s like, you know what, motherfuckers, yes, I have.”

But he actually had a very long career, starting well before the Obama administration.

He worked on “The Corner,” Simon’s predecessor to “The Wire,” “The Fantastic Four,” “Se7en” and the documentary “The People Speak.” He played Don King in the boxing drama “Hands of Stone.”"On behalf of the 45th President of the US, we welcome you officially, and for the first time, to the Embassy of the US, here in Jerusalem.” Ivanka Trump

Several students walked out of an anthropology course at Princeton University on Tuesday after a professor repeatedly used a racial slur in his class about hate speech.

The professor, Lawrence Rosen, is an award-winning legal anthropologist who has taught at Princeton University for 40 years. He received emeritus status last year.

Rosen’s course, titled “Cultural Freedoms: Hate Speech, Blasphemy and Pornography,” explores the legal and cultural limits of free speech. This week, he led a discussion on verbal symbols and what types of speech should be protected. The heated debate that followed was first reported on by The Daily Princetonian.

Destiny Salter, a 19-year-old Princeton student who identifies as black, told HuffPost that about 10 minutes into the class, Rosen gave this example: “Which is more provocative: A white man walks up to a black man and punches him in the nose, or a white man walks up to a black man and calls him a n****r?”″

He repeated the example once more, leaving students “shocked and visibly uncomfortable,” Salter said.

A few minutes later, students began to point out their discomfort with a white professor using the word in its entirety.

When one student asked if Rosen planned to keep repeating the word in future classes, the professor reportedly responded that he would if he deemed it necessary for the discussion.

Rosen then said, “I purposely did that, because I wanted everyone to feel the power of that word,” Salter told HuffPost.

“As if black people haven’t been feeling the full power of the N-word for the past 400 years,” she said.

At that point, Salter said she and another student decided to walk out of the class.

When other students expressed that the word troubled them, Rosen reportedly continued to defend his use of the slur and refused to apologize.

“The professor didn’t seem to consider the fact that obviously repeatedly saying the N-word, while it makes everyone uncomfortable, would affect the black people in the class on a far deeper level,” Salter said.

In the end, at least three students walked out of the class as a result of the disagreement, she estimated.

Salter said that she has “absolutely no problem” discussing the politics of the slur ― she expected that to be part of the course when she signed up for it. However, she thinks discussing the ramifications of hate speech and slurs does not give one the right to use them. The ends do not justify the means, she said.

She was also alarmed that the professor appeared to be happy about the fact that he had elicited such a strong negative reaction from the class, and that he steadfastly refused to apologize.

The incident left her “furious and disgusted,” Salter said.

“He very easily could have stated the same question and just said ‘the N-word’ rather than saying the actual word. That would have sparked discussion, which is what he supposedly wanted,” she said. “Saying the actual word simply offended the class and derailed the entire conversation.”

HuffPost sent Rosen a request for comment, but has not heard back.

“The professor didn’t seem to consider the fact that obviously repeatedly saying the N-word, while it makes everyone uncomfortable, would affect the black people in the class on a far deeper level.” - Princeton student Destiny Salter

In a statement, Princeton’s acting university spokesman Michael Hotchkiss told HuffPost that the conversations and disagreements that took place in the seminar are “part of the vigorous engagement and robust debate that are central to what we do.” The university is in the process of setting up a meeting with the students, he said.

“We will continue to look for ways to encourage discussions about free speech and inclusivity with the students in Professor Rosen’s class and the campus community more broadly,” Hotchkiss wrote.

In a letter posted to the school newspaper, the chair of Princeton’s anthropology department, Carolyn Rouse, defended Rosen’s decision to use the racial slur. The purpose of the course, Rouse said, was to give students the ability to clearly state why hate speech should or should not be protected, using an argument other than “because it made me feel bad.”

She pointed out that Rosen had also mentioned anti-American or anti-Semitic examples in the class. Rosen has reportedly been using the word “n****r” as an example “year after year.” This is the first year he’s gotten such a critical response from the class, she said.

Rouse said she believes the students’ reactions were probably reflective of heightened racial tensions in America.

“This is diagnostic of the level of overt anti-black racism in the country today,” she wrote. “Anti-American and anti-Semitic examples did not upset the students, but an example of racism did. This did not happen when Obama was president, when the example seemed less real and seemed to have less power.”

Rouse added that she felt “bad” for the students who left the class without trusting the “process.”

“Rosen was fighting battles for women, Native Americans, and African-Americans before these students were born,” Rouse said. “He grew up a Jew in anti-Semitic America, and recognizes how law has afforded him rights he would not otherwise have.”

Salter said she feels that students have certainly become more sensitive to offensive words because of the rise of the far right and the election of President Donald Trump.

After her experiences on Tuesday, she said she’s decided to drop the class.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump blocked the release of a memo written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as a rebuttal to allegations from their Republican counterparts that the FBI abused surveillance laws to improperly spy on the Trump campaign.

In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday, White House counsel Don McGahn said that while the president is “inclined” to declassify the memo, he will not “at this time” due to it containing “numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages.”

McGahn said Trump has directed the Justice Department to offer assistance to the House committee to revise the memo.

“The Executive Branch stands ready to review any subsequent draft ... for declassification at the earliest opportunity,” McGahn said.

WH letter to Nunes on POTUS decision not to declassify the Dem memo: pic.twitter.com/1ejQtzCgK3 — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) February 10, 2018

The White House also shared a letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray expressing concern about the release of certain parts of the memo. The letter came in response to McGahn’s request for the FBI and DOJ to review the Democratic memo, and argued that certain passages sparked concern about the protection of intelligence sources and methods, ongoing investigations and other sensitive information.

Rosenstein and Wray had expressed similar concern about a GOP-drafted memo that Trump did agree to release last week.

The House Intelligence Committee voted to release the Democrats’ memo on Monday, days after the Republicans’ version became public. The Republicans on the committee blocked the Democrats’ memo from being released simultaneously.

The GOP memo — which alleges liberal bias among mostly Republican law enforcement officials at the Justice Department and FBI — was part of a long-standing effort by the president’s allies to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump, who has characterized Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt,” tweeted on Saturday that the memo “totally vindicates” him.

The Republicans’ memo, drafted by staffers in the office of committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a member of Trump’s transition team, accuses law enforcement officials of misleading a secretive court that approves surveillance warrants when they applied for permission to spy on former Trump campaign official Carter Page.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed the Republican memo as misleading and factually incorrect. He said in a statement last week that his party’s response would provide missing context that would refute Republicans’ claims.

Several of the allegations in the Nunes memo are already falling apart. One of the key complaints in the memo is that the FBI failed to disclose that a dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele was funded by Democratic operatives looking for information on Trump during the campaign. But three days after the memo was released, Nunes conceded that the FBI had disclosed the political origins of the Steele dossier in a footnote on its application to spy on Page.

Nunes’ memo also claimed that Andrew McCabe, then deputy director of the FBI, told the House Intelligence Committee last December that the agency wouldn’t have sought a surveillance warrant without the Steele dossier. Nunes’ staff “purposefully mischaracterizes” McCabe’s testimony in the memo, a senior Democratic committee official told HuffPost.

“The minority’s memo lays out the full facts,” the source said.Idris Elba appears to be off the market.

Neither Elba nor Dhowre have publicly confirmed the engagement, and reps for Elba didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. But screening attendee David Marsden-Sainou posted a clip of the sweet moment on Twitter Saturday.

Rio Cinema, where the screening took place, also posted about the proposal.

“Still 5 days to Valentines Day but @idriselba went down on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend live on stage this morning,” read a tweet from the theater.

The theater also noted that that Dhowre, a model and former Miss Vancouver, said yes and there was “much clapping and cheering.”

The British actor met Dhowre in Canada while he was filming 2017′s “The Mountain Between Us.”

Namely, that the fringed, suede garments were strikingly similar to those donned by Jim Carrey’s character Lloyd Christmas in the hit 1994 movie “Dumb and Dumber.”

Polo Ralph Lauren is the official outfit designer for the U.S. Olympic squad in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The gloves are retailing for $995 online, but are currently listed as out of stock.

David Lauren, chief innovation officer at the clothing company, previously hailed the team’s look for celebrating “the American spirit, with iconic pieces updated with modern details and technical fabrications.”

But for many people online, it was just a delightful reminder of Lloyd Christmas:

Athletes from both countries entered the arena under a flag depicting a unified Korea as American Vice President Mike Pence and Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, watched on from a VIP box.

Weir, a figure skating analyst for NBC at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earned plenty of attention for his criticism of the athletes during the first night of the team event on Thursday.

“I’m a commentator, not a ‘complimentator,’ ” he wrote on Twitter Saturday.

On Thursday, he dubbed the performance of U.S. star Nathan Chen as “the worst short program I’ve ever seen” from him and added “disaster” to boot. He also said of the top contenders as a whole, “Nobody skated up to their names.”

Weir, a two-time Olympian who teams with the also-blunt former gold medalist Tara Lipinski on the air, warned viewers that he isn’t about to let up.

I’m a commentator, not a “complimentator.” Explaining falls and rough skates is hard because I have been that skater, and truth can hurt.
