Harvey Weinstein appeared in court Friday on three charges related to a monthslong sex crime investigation led by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Weinstein surrendered himself to the New York Police Department that morning.

Prosecutors charged the disgraced Hollywood producer with two rape charges, one first-degree and one third-degree, and one criminal sexual act in the first degree. The alleged incidents occurred against two women in 2013 and 2004, respectively.

Weinstein’s bail was set at $1 million, with a $10 million bond alternative.

Prosecutors said he will be fitted with a tracking device and must seek the court’s approval if he wishes to leave New York or Connecticut. He has surrendered his passport.

“Today’s charges reflect significant progress in this active, ongoing investigation,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement. “I thank the brave survivors who have come forward, and my Office’s prosecutors who have worked tirelessly on this investigation.”

Weinstein is expected to plead not guilty.

A lawyer for the former producer told reporters his team believes “that at the end of the process,” his client “will be exonerated.”

Reporters for the Times and The New Yorker ― Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey and Ronan Farrow ― received the Pulitzer Prize for public service earlier this year for their work. They, along with the women who shared their stories, are credited with sparking the Me Too and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct that have affected innumerable other, less high-profile industries.

After surrendering, Weinstein was taken to court in handcuffs Friday morning to face the charges, The Associated Press reported.

The investigation is still ongoing. Weinstein’s next court appearance is scheduled for July 30.

The NYPD said in a statement that Weinstein was charged with “rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse, and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women.”

One of the women is reportedly Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker the disgraced Hollywood producer invited her to a meeting about work opportunities in 2004. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex.

“I said, over and over, ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t,’” Evans told the outlet. “I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hard enough. I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.”

Eventually, she said, “He’s a big guy. He overpowered me.”

An unnamed law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the other woman has not spoken publicly.

Prosecutors say Weinstein kept her “physically against her will” in a Manhattan DoubleTree hotel room, where he raped her in March 2013. She will reportedly remain anonymous throughout the proceedings.

A culture of abuse in Hollywood enabled Weinstein’s alleged abuse to become an open secret in the industry, where the producer himself enjoyed all the perks of stardom.

He was said to hold the power to make or break a career.

One woman, a Netflix producer, said in a recent lawsuit against him that she could recall 11 separate incidents in which he sexually abused her.

Robert Boyce, now-retired chief of detectives for New York City, said in March that his department had gathered “quite a bit of evidence” against Weinstein, The Guardian reported.

As part of its investigation, the NYPD also examined the alleged 2010 sexual assault of “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, The Wall Street Journal reported.

De la Huerta told Vanity Fair that Weinstein sexually assaulted her twice. Both incidents allegedly occurred at her Manhattan apartment. The second time, the actress said she had been drinking and recalled feeling afraid of the producer, who had been repeatedly calling her since the first rape.

“I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig,” she told Vanity Fair.

Weinstein, meanwhile, has continually denied engaging in any nonconsensual sex acts.

In 2015, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. let Weinstein off the hook for an alleged sexual assault by an Italian model, deciding there was insufficient evidence to charge Weinstein for allegedly groping her. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered the state attorney general to review the decision, which Vance has defended.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also reportedly investigating Weinstein, as are authorities in Los Angeles and London. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York had opened a sex crime investigation to examine whether the producer lured any women across state lines to commit a sex crime.

Weinstein reportedly tried to silence many of his accusers by hiring private investigators to dig up information on the women and journalists aware of his alleged misconduct.

As ugly stories about his behavior continued stacking up last year, he checked into a rehabilitation facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, late last year.

The District Attorney’s office urges additional survivors with relevant information about Weinstein to contact the city’s Sex Crimes Hotline at 212-335-9373.“I still go to Taco Bell / drive through, raw as Hell / I don’t care, I’m still real,” Fergie, perhaps the most overlooked lyricist of our time, sings in her song “Glamorous.”

Well, we should have believed her then, because the former Black Eyed Peas singer pretty much flew the opposite of first class when she rode the New York City subway on Tuesday night.

For most people, a subway commute is spent mindlessly staring at a phone. But for Fergie, it was an Instagram-worthy adventure. She hilariously documented her descent surrounded, of course, by a team of bodyguards, as she made her way to the Paley Honors gala.

An Armageddon-like thunderstorm sent New Yorkers scrambling underground to escape the weather (and the insane traffic). As a woman of the people, Fergie did the same, except she was clad in an all-white suit.

“So we’re taking the subway because a tropical storm hit New York,” she explained on social media. “And then we had to get from Columbus Circle to Cipriani Wall Street in a full white suit, check it out, August Getty. And uh, yeah, through the rain! And we’re gonna go to the Paley Honors, and I’m the first presenter, so here we go!”

Commuters slowly began to catch on that the Duchess herself was riding along with them, prompting one to play her song “Glamorous” on a phone. Fergie, predictably, started singing along.

Unlike pretty much everybody else in the city, she did make it to her destination on time, posing for pictures on the red carpet later in the evening.

A flight from Dubai to Amsterdam had to make an emergency landing in Vienna after a fight broke out because one of the passengers wouldn’t stop breaking wind.

The fart-induced fracas happened Feb. 11 aboard Transavia Airlines Flight HV6902 when two men sitting next to an apparently very flatulent man raised a stink about his repeated gas attacks, according to Fox News.

When the alleged perpetrator didn’t stop, his disgusted seatmates reportedly complained to the airline crew, who apparently did nothing.

Instead, the captain issued a warning to the two complainants, accusing them of noisy and aggressive behavior and making threats, according to the NL Times.

When the freedom-from-flatulence fighters wouldn’t stop griping about their fellow passenger, a fight broke out on the plane, according to the Dutch language newspaper De Telegraaf.

The pilots then made an emergency stop in Vienna and removed the complainants, but apparently not the farting man. Two women sitting in the same row as the angry men were also forced off the plane as well.

All four people reportedly shared Dutch and Moroccan ancestry, but the two women claim they were simply sitting in the same row as the men involved with the incident.

The women are now taking the Dutch budget airline to court, according to the Metro.

“We had nothing to do with the whole disturbance. We distance ourselves from that. Do they sometimes think that all Moroccans cause problems? That’s why we do not let it sit,” one of the women said, according to De Telegraaf. ”We had no idea who these boys were, we just had the bad luck to be in the same row and we didn’t do anything.”

“All I will say is that the crew were really provocative and stirred things up,” she added.

None of the passengers kicked off the plane were arrested because they had not broken any Austrian laws. However, they have been banned from flying Transavia Airlines in the future.

HuffPost reached out to Transavia Airlines, which did not immediately respond. The airline did offer this statement to De Telegraaf that was translated by the NL Times:

Our crew must ensure a safe flight. If passengers pose a risk, they immediately intervene. Our people are trained for that. They know very well where the boundaries are. Transavia therefore stands squarely behind the cabin crew and the pilots.UPDATE ― Adam Rippon said Sunday night that he would not be joining NBC as a correspondent after learning he’d have to leave Team USA and the Olympic Village for the new role.

PREVIOUSLY — Adam Rippon will continue to shine under the Winter Olympic spotlight.

NBC has recruited the 28-year-old figure skater as a correspondent for the rest of the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, reports USA TODAY.

Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics, helped Team USA to bronze in the team event and placed 10th in the men’s single skating.

He tongue-in-cheek described some of his skating as “witchcraft.”

Prior to the games, he hit the headlines for calling out Vice President Mike Pence over his intolerance toward the LGBTQ community.

It’s not currently clear how NBC will deploy its new star its coverage, with spokesman Greg Hughes only saying that Rippon would work on its television, digital and social media offerings.

Will it look something like the video below?

“Black Panther” has grossed an estimated $192 million at movie box offices, including Thursday night early showings, surpassing the opening weekend numbers of all other Marvel films except for the first “Avengers.” The figure also gives “Black Panther” the fifth highest opening weekend gross of all time.

The film’s total take over the President’s Day weekend is expected to be around $218 million, eclipsing the film’s $200 million budget.”

As 3-day weekend totals go for Marvel films, “The Avengers” made $207.44 million in 2012, “Avengers: Age of Ultron” followed that with $191.27 million in 2015, and “Captain America: Civil War” grossed $179.14 million in 2016.

“Black Panther” is a big-budget superhero film helmed by an African American director ― Ryan Coogler, who also co-wrote the script. It also features a nearly all black cast, including Lupita Nyong’o, Michael B. Jordan, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya and Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa, aka Black Panther.Following Wednesday’s shooting massacre at a Florida high school, a top Republican political donor has taken a stand for gun control ― by tightening his purse strings.

Businessman Al Hoffman Jr. told the New York Times that he “will not write another check” for candidates and political groups that don’t support a ban on assault weapons. The Florida-based former ambassador to Portugal has donated millions to GOP candidates and political groups over the years, reported the paper.

“For how many years now have we been doing this — having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings — and how many years has it been that nothing’s been done?” said the 83-year-old, who announced his decision in an email to several Republican leaders, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Jeb Bush. “It’s the end of the road for me.”

Gun violence survivors, activists and others have been calling for stricter gun control laws this week in the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 people dead. The alleged gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle in the attack.

In 2013, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced a bill that sought to ban military-style assault weapons including guns like the AR-15. The bill, which failed to pass in the Senate, was similar to the 1994 ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004.

Republican lawmakers have mostly expressed little interest this week in pursuing new gun control legislation. In a Saturday tweet, President Donald Trump blamed Democrats for the lack of gun control reform.

In his interview with the Times, Hoffman said that Republican lawmakers, who receive millions each year from the National Rifle Association, were unlikely to push for greater gun control.

The NRA spent $30 million supporting Trump’s campaign in the 2016 presidential election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The group spent millions more that year supporting other Republican candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).

When asked by Vox this week if Congress should act to tighten gun laws in the wake of the Florida shooting, Blunt said that he didn’t know enough about the attack to “know if there’s a proper response or not.”

Rubio said on Thursday that he didn’t believe stricter gun laws would be effective in stopping would-be shooters from committing crimes.

In a tweet on Saturday night, Trump questioned why Democratic lawmakers had not passed “gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate” during Barack Obama’s presidential tenure. They “didn’t want to,” Trump claimed, “and now they just talk!”

Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018

Trump’s tweet was posted hours after hundreds of gun violence survivors and activists attended a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed Wednesday in a shooting rampage, were also in attendance.

Protesters chanted “shame on you,” in reference to lawmakers and Trump, who they said have done little to help reduce gun violence in the U.S.

In a powerful speech, Emma Gonzalez, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, excoriated Trump for accepting millions from the National Rifle Association.

“If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and ... how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,” the 18-year-old said. “It doesn’t matter because I already know. Thirty million dollars. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the one and a half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to $5,800. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?”

“To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you,” Gonzalez continued.

The NRA reportedly spent $11.4 million supporting Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign and almost $20 million to undermine Hillary Clinton.

Trump told NRA members at a convention last year that they had a “true friend in the White House.”

“To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down,” he said, vowing to “never, ever infringe” on the right of people to own guns.

AdvertisementFormer Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been accused of bank fraud that wasn’t part of the original indictment against him, according to court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The alleged fraud came to light in an attempt by Manafort to swap out real estate securing his $10 million bail, said the redacted documents, which were released Friday.

Manafort was indicted in October on charges of money laundering, conspiracy and failing to register as a foreign agent in Mueller’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty.

HIs “proposed new bail package is insufficient to assure reasonably his appearance as required by law,” said prosecutors. In part, the package was “deficient in the government’s view in light of additional criminal conduct,” they wrote in the court filing, which was submitted on Tuesday. “That criminal conduct includes a series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies.”

Manafort allegedly submitted “doctored profit and loss statements” to Federal Savings Bank — overstating “by millions of dollars” income for his consulting company — in order to obtain a $9 million mortgage on a property in Virginia that Manafort had hoped to pledge as security for his bail, according to the court filing.

It wasn’t immediately clear if Manfort could now face new charges, or if the alleged criminal conduct only scuttled Manafort’s bail request.

“At the next bail hearing,” prosecutors warned in the documents, “we can proffer to the Court additional evidence related to this and the other bank frauds and conspiracies, which the Court may find relevant to the bail risk posed by Manafort.”When it comes to clinching gold at the Winter Olympics, sometimes every millimeter counts.

French biathlete Martin Fourcade captured the gold medal ― the fourth in his career ― in the men’s 15km mass start competition on Sunday in a dramatic neck-and-neck finish at the games in Peongchang, South Korea.

The 29-year-old crossed the end line just barely ahead of Simon Schempp of Germany. Both men, in a last-ditch dive, stretched toward the line but it was Fourcade who managed to cross it first, passing Schempp by just a few millimeters, the BBC reported. That’s less than an inch.

Both recorded the same time of 35 minutes, 47.3 seconds. Biathlon combines skiing and shooting, with the men’s 15km event featuring five laps around a 3km course and four shooting rounds

Bronze went to Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway.

The race’s victor took more than a minute to declare, as judges reviewed replays that ultimately showed Fourcade’s left boot crossing the line before Schempp.

Fourcade, who placed second in the event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, initially thought he lost to Schempp. He was seen angrily hitting one of his ski poles on the ground.

“Four years ago in Sochi I lost by only three centimeters, so I thought the story was repeating again. Tonight it’s incredible,” he later told reporters.

AdvertisementRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called out both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama for not speaking out sooner about the investigation into hacking during the 2016 presidential election.

“At the time, we could get the Obama administration to acknowledge the Russian interference,” Schiff said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” noting that the response was not “sufficient.”

“They were very wary to be seen as putting their hand on the scale of the election,” he added.

But he also said that doesn’t justify President Trump’s refusal to enact new sanctions against Russia last month.

“None of that is an excuse for this president to sit on his hands,” he said. “It is inexplicable for the president of the United States to sit on sanctions that Congress passed.”

“They can’t point the finger back when they’re sitting on sanctions that Congress on a very bipartisan basis imposed,” he added.

The CNN appearance aired two hours after Trump posted a series of morning tweets attacking Schiff and highlighting the congressman’s criticism of the previous president, which he first stated two days ago. In a signature taunt, he suggested that Schiff was casting blame on the Obama administration “as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election.”

Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something.

Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

The president’s tirade came two days after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities, outlining evidence that foreign actors meddled in the 2016 election and bolstered the campaigns of Trump’s and Bernie Sanders. The indictments could open the door to more charges.

Trump has previously made conflicting statements surrounding the charges of Russian interference, saying that Russia did interfere in the election, while also saying that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin when he denied interfering. Yet the president has maintained that his campaign did not collude with Russia and called Mueller’s probe “witch hunt” and a “hoax.”

He reiterated that claim on Sunday morning.

AdvertisementCBS’ acknowledgment of a “workplace concern” involving Pauley Perrette of the crime drama “NCIS” prompted a response from the actress on Tuesday.

Perrette earlier posted a series of cryptic tweets saying she had endured “multiple physical assaults” and suggested that may have contributed to her departure from the show. “It’s horrifying,” she wrote. “I left.”

CBS Television Studios issued a statement late Tuesday confirming that “over a year ago” Perrette ― who played forensic scientist Abby Sciuto on “NCIS” for 15 seasons before her final episode aired last week ― “came to us with a workplace concern. We took the matter seriously and worked with her to find a resolution. We are committed to a safe work environment on all our shows.”

Perrette responded on Twitter by saying the network “always had my back.”

And here is CBS Television Studios’ full statement:

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump has criticized the FBI for missing “all of the many signals” about the suspected gunman behind Wednesday’s deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

In a tweet late Saturday, Trump said the agency’s failure was “very sad” and “not acceptable.” He also suggested the agency was “spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.”

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

“There is no collusion,” Trump claimed. “Get back to the basics and make us all proud!” he added.

The FBI acknowledged Friday that it had failed to act on a tip about 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who has since been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Trump’s post followed Friday’s indictment of 13 Russians and three Russian entities by a federal grand jury empaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller. The Russians are accused of meddling with the 2016 presidential election and looking to boost Trump’s campaign.

In a series of tweets on Sunday morning, Trump sought to shift blame regarding Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election on Democrats.

Kenworthy, 26, came out in 2015 and is one of two openly gay men competing for Team USA at the games. He scooped silver in the same event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and had planned to kiss his then-boyfriend in similar style. He ultimately decided against doing so.

In Pyeongchang, Kenworthy placed 12th in the final. Norway’s Oystein Braaten won gold and Team USA’s Nick Goepper nabbed silver.

After competing, Kenworthy said he hadn’t realized his smooch was being aired.

“But I think that’s amazing, that’s something that I wanted at the last Olympics was to share a kiss with my boyfriend at the bottom but I was too scared to do it for myself,” he said, per Reuters. “So to be able to do that to give him a kiss, to have that affection broadcast for the world is incredible.”

Kenworthy said “the only way to change perceptions, break down homophobia, break down barriers is through representation and that’s definitely not something I had as a kid.”

“I definitely didn’t see a gay athlete at the Olympics kissing their boyfriend and I think if I had it would have made it a lot easier for me,” he said.

Wilkas, meanwhile, described the smooch as “such a little kiss.”

“If I’d have known it was a big deal, I’d have made out with him,” he joked to the Associated Press.

After breaking his thumb in practice Wednesday, Kenworthy joked the “silver lining” was he wouldn’t have to shake the hand of Pence, who has been forthright with his resistance to LGBTQ rights.When all is said and done, ties are really just the unappealing result of an absence of certitude, which is why they’re such tough pills to swallow for fans and athletes alike, particularly in individual sports. However, while it may seem counterintuitive to the spirit of an athletic competition that awards medals for first, second and third place, ties actually do occur at the Olympics.

In fact, ties at the Olympics aren’t as rare as you might think. There have been nine ties for Winter Olympic medals since the 1998 Nagano Games, and while that may be a complicated experience for the athletes and nations involved, the protocol is actual quite simple.

If a pair of athletes or two teams tie for first-place, they each receive a gold medal, no one is awarded silver and the bronze is awarded to the runner-up. This was the case during the women’s downhill final at Sochi in 2014 when Slovenia’s Tina Maze and Switzerland’s Dominique Gisin both crossed the finish line with a time of 1:41.57. They were both awarded gold medals and the runner-up, Switzerland’s Lara Gut, took home bronze with her time of 1:41.67.

If a pair of athletes tie for second place, they are each awarded a silver medal and there is no bronze given out. This occurred most recently at the 2010 Vancouver Games in the men’s individual biathlon. Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway finished with the best time to win gold. Both Sergey Novikov of Belarus and Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway finished with exactly the same second-place time, so they each won a silver medal and no bronze was awarded.

If a pair of athletes tie for third-place, they are each awarded a bronze medal and gold and silver are awarded as per usual to the first and second-place finishers. This situation played out in PyeongChang on Saturday when Norway’s Marit Bjørgen and Finland’s Krista Pärmäkoski both crossed the finish line with a third-place time of 25:32.4 in the women’s cross-country 10km freestyle. They each won bronze, Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla won the silver medal with a time of 25:20.8 and Nowary’s Ragnhild Haga won gold with a time of 25:00.5.

Read more from Yahoo Sports:Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has once again called for a ban on the sale of assault weapons in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that left 17 dead last Wednesday.

During a Sunday appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the former Democratic presidential candidate said that, for three decades, he has “believed we should not be selling assault weapons” like the accused gunman’s AR-15.

“These weapons are not for hunting,” he said. “They’re for killing human beings.”

He also said Congress should close the so-called gun show loophole ― the lack of federal rules mandating background checks on the sale of firearms between privates sellers.

Sanders’ voting record on gun control became a focal point during the 2016 primary campaign as Hillary Clinton supporters sought to discredit his progressive credentials on the issue.

Politico described Sanders as being a ”liberal standard-bearer on nearly every single policy issue ... [with] one notable exception – guns.”

In Congress, he voted against a bill in the 1990s to require a five-day waiting periods to allow for criminal background checks before a gun could be purchased, voted to allow firearms on Amtrak, and came out against a lawsuit to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. But he has also voted for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. NBC

Hunting is popular in Sanders’ home state of Vermont. Its gun laws are so permissive that an editor at the Burlington-based alt-weekly Seven Days detailed how he “bought an AR-15 in a Five Guys parking lot” in 2016. On Thursday, one day after the Florida shooting, Gov. Phil Scott (R) said the state would not consider new gun restrictions.

Sanders grew visibly frustrated by host Chuck Todd’s questions on his record on gun issues. He stressed that the National Rifle Association has given him a D-minus rating on its ranking of federal lawmakers. He also reiterated his long-argued claim that the NRA’s support for his opponent cost him a statewide election in 1988, though The Washington Post cast doubt over how big a role the gun lobby’s endorsement played in Sanders’ defeat.

“We’ve got to take on the NRA,” Sanders said. “The tragedy we saw in Parkland is unspeakable, and all over this country parents are scared to death of what might happen when they send their kids to school.”

Earlier on “Meet the Press,” Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), called for restricting people with criminal records or histories of mental illness from purchasing assault weapons. But he said it shouldn’t be made harder for others to do so.

“Some actually do hunt with an AR-15,” said Lankford, who received $5,000 in political contributions from the NRA in the 2016 campaign cycle.DUBAI (Reuters) ― All 65 passengers and crew were feared dead in a plane crash in central Iran on Sunday after the domestic flight came down in bad weather in a mountainous region.

A spokesman for Iranian carrier Aseman Airlines had told state television everyone was killed, but the airline then issued a statement saying it could not reach the crash site and could not “accurately and definitely confirm” everyone died.

The airline had also initially said 60 passengers and six crew were on board the twin-engined turboprop ATR 72 that was flying to the southwestern city of Yasuj. But it later said there were a total of 65 people on board, as one passenger had missed the flight.

The Aseman-operated plane crashed near the town of Semirom after taking off from Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, emergency services spokesman Mojtaba Khaledi told ISNA news agency.

As night approached, bad weather prevented helicopters searching the probable crash site but emergency workers were scouring the mountainous area by land, the television said.

“It is getting colder and darker and still no sign of the plane,” said a television reporter accompanying rescue teams searching snow-covered areas in Mount Dena which has more than 40 peaks higher than 4,000 meters (13,000 feet).

Media reports said the plane disappeared from radar screens 50 minutes after taking off from Mehrabad airport in the southwest of the capital. It mainly handles domestic flights.

Worried relatives of passengers gathered at Yasuj airport.

“I kept telephoning all morning but they (the relative) wouldn’t answer. So I called my brother and he said they will get here, it (the plane) is not behind schedule yet,” a young woman told a reporter for state television.

“I told him it is raining here. He said no (meaning, don’t worry). He called later and said the plane had crashed.”

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani issued messages of condolences. The president asked the transport minister to lead an investigation into the crash.

Iran has suffered several plane crashes in the past few decades. Tehran says U.S. sanctions have long prevented it from buying new aircraft or spare parts from the West. The crashed ATR was 25 years old, officials said.

A deal with world powers on Iran’s nuclear program has lifted some of those sanctions, opening the way for Iranian airlines to update their creaking fleets.

Aseman signed a deal last year to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets. National carrier IranAir has ordered 80 planes from Boeing and 100 from Airbus.

Based in the southern French city of Toulouse, ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo

Earlier air disasters include the crash of a Boeing 727 passenger plane in 2011 which killed 78 people in the northwest of Iran, and the 2009 crash of a Caspian Airlines Tupolev aircraft bound for Armenia which killed all 168 people on board.

One of Iran’s worst air accidents happened in February 2003 when an Iranian Ilyushin-76 troop carrier crashed in southeast Iran, killing all 276 Revolutionary Guard soldiers and crew.The Jokhang temple in Lhasa is one of Tibetan Buddhism's most hallowed sites. JOHANNES EISELE via Getty Images

The Jokhang temple, one of Tibet’s most sacred sites, reportedly caught on fire on Saturday in the city of Lhasa. Dramatic videos shared on social media show the seventh-century temple, dubbed the “heart of Tibetan Buddhism,” engulfed in flames and smoke.

Chinese state news media reported that the fire had been “quickly extinguished” after it broke out at the UNESCO heritage site on Saturday evening. No injuries or damage to relics has been reported.

Some observers, however, have expressed concern that China may be suppressing information about the blaze, which occurred a day after Losar, the traditional Tibetan New Year.

“This has increased the fear of people that something really serious has happened,” said Barnett. “People are hugely concerned, rightly or wrongly, that the damage might be much more severe than the media is letting on.”

According to the New York Times, photos and videos of the fire were scrubbed from Chinese social media platforms on Saturday, prompting further concerns about the temple’s status.

“I pray that the fire isn’t serious and that the old buildings haven’t suffered too much damage,” Tsering Woeser, a Beijing-based Tibetan writer, told the Times. “For Tibetans, the Jokhang is the holiest of holy sites.”MOSCOW (Reuters) - A man in Russia’s southern province of Dagestan shot into a crowd of people leaving a church on Sunday, killing five and injuring at least five others, Russian news agencies reported, citing the local health ministry.

The attack occurred in the village of Kizlyar in the Muslim-majority republic of Dagestan, agencies said.

The small republic in the Caucasus mountains borders Chechnya, where Moscow has led two wars against separatists and radical religious groups since the 1991 Soviet collapse and which has seen a large number of people join Islamic State.

Russian news agencies said the attack occurred as churchgoers celebrated Maslenitsa, a Christian holiday marking the last day before Lent according to the eastern Orthodox calendar.

The assailant was identified as a 22-year-old man local to the region, the TASS news agency said, citing the investigative committee.

He was shot and killed by security services who were on duty nearby, TASS said, adding that a hunting rifle, bullets and a knife were discovered on his person.

Initial reports suggested all five victims were women, TASS said, citing the local branch of the interior ministry.

The injured include two members of local security services and two civilians, also women, the Interfax news agency said.PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Freestyle silver medallist Nick Goepper plans to savor his second taste of Olympic success after a struggle to cope with media attention following the Sochi Games four years ago plunged him into a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and depression.

“It is important to have a plan. Failure to plan is planning to fail,” the American told reporters after taking second place in Sunday’s ski slopestyle final.

After winning bronze as part of a United States clean sweep in 2014, the then 19-year-old from the American Midwest was thrown into the media spotlight and found the attention hard to deal with.

“I had no real plan after Sochi, I was just partying a lot with my friends and just flying into this void,” he told reporters. “Three weeks after the Olympics I was like ‘what am I doing?’”

In the build-up to the Pyeongchang Olympics, Goepper admitted he had considered committing suicide as his drinking got out of hand after Sochi.

“(Alcohol) was a symptom of this problem, for sure. That symptom got pretty bad at one point but I was able to go to a treatment center for a couple of months and figure myself out, getting the important help that I needed,” said Goepper, who went into rehabilitation in late 2015.

Now, older and wiser, Goepper says he has not had a drink in two-and-a-half years and this medal means more to him than the bronze from Sochi.

“I loved having the experience over the last four years,” said Goepper. “I love having traveled a bit more and I appreciate this a bit more because I am a little bit older and I can reflect and reminisce on the last 10 years of my career and look forward to the next 10.”

This time around, once he has ridden the wave of media obligations, Goepper has a plan. “I just want to stay humble, stay focussed. I just love skiing and I love competing and I want to get back to it as soon as I can,” he said..@hogangidley45: “There are two groups that have created chaos more than the Russians and that’s the Democrats and the mainstream media.” pic.twitter.com/HBmruoSUn3 — Fox News (@FoxNews) February 17, 2018

Just a day after the the special counsel leading the investigation indicted 13 Russians and three Russian organizations, the White House deputy press secretary said it’s the media and Democrats who have “created chaos more than the Russians” for their coverage of the probe into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“There are two groups that have created chaos more than the Russians, and that’s the Democrats and the mainstream media,” said Hogan Gidley in a Saturday “Fox & Friends” interview.

The indicted are accused of manipulating American social media and political rallies to sway the 2016 presidential election toward then-candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, and against the eventual Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.

Despite this announcement it was the Democrats and the media that “continued to push this lie on the American people for more than a year, and frankly Americans should be outraged by that,” Gidley continued.

It wasn’t clear what “lie” he was referring to, though the deputy press secretary did emphasize that Russian interference had no effect on the election whatsoever — an issue not addressed in the indictment. Gidley also said that the indictment “proves” there was no Russian collusion with the Trump campaign — even though special counsel Robert Mueller is continuing the investigation.

Journalists slammed the assertion as false.

Zeke Miller, White House reporter for The Associated Press, said Gidley’s comments were either an “embarrassing misstatement by a White House official or a stunningly unsupported charge against fellow citizens,” while reminding his followers that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Russia was engaged in “information warfare” against the U.S.

This is either an embarrassing misstatement by a White House official or a stunningly unsupported charge against fellow citizens. https://t.co/Ncgpj97aAt — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 17, 2018

CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski said, in an apparent sarcastic response, he was going to “go out on a limb” and refute Gidley’s comment.

Politico’s chief economic correspondent called the comment not only false, but “repulsive.”

A former Clinton aide indicated that Gidley’s comments amounted to a White House defense of a foreign power whose operatives have been indicted by the Department of Justice.

I wonder where they got it. — Todd (@ToddColorado) February 17, 2018WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump called on the Department of Justice to prosecute a political opponent and called immigrants “animals” during a roundtable with California leaders on Wednesday.

“We’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are,” he said. “These aren’t people. These are animals.”

The livestreamed roundtable at the White House centered on so-called sanctuary policies, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal deportation efforts. His dehumanizing comments about immigrants weren’t new, nor was his attack on a Democratic politician. The most remarkable thing about both of them was that in the Trump era, reducing a group of people to subhuman and threatening to incarcerate another politician were scarcely notable.

The president referenced “animals” after a sheriff asked him about MS-13, a gang that started in the U.S. made up largely of Salvadoran immigrants and that has become a frequent target of Trump and top officials. The president was “very clearly” referring to the gang, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Thursday in a press briefing.

But Trump did not name the gang in his answer, instead referencing people in general who are being stopped and taken out of the country. He quickly pivoted to talking about the need to change laws to more easily deport people or keep them out in the first place ― policies that would affect millions of immigrants who by and large have nothing to do with MS-13.

The full exchange is below:

Fresno County, California, Sheriff Sheriff Margaret Mims: There could be an MS-13 member I know about ― if they don’t reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about it. Trump: We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in ― and we’re stopping a lot of them ― but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It’s crazy. The dumbest laws ― as I said before, the dumbest laws on immigration in the world. So we’re going to take care of it.

Trump singled out Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, a Democrat who was not among the officials in attendance. She made national headlines in February when she warned residents on television before a targeted operation that she heard there would be arrests in the area by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE acting Director Thomas Homan, who previously called for the government to prosecute local officials over sanctuary policies, said she had helped as many as 800 people get away. (The San Francisco ICE spokesman resigned afterward, criticizing the agency for making what he called a misleading claim, since no operation nets all its targets.) The White House said at the time that the Department of Justice was reviewing her actions, but nothing has come of it.

Trump said Wednesday that he still wants the Department of Justice to prosecute Schaaf.

Addressing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and alluding to speculation about obstruction of justice charges against himself, Trump said, “You talk about obstruction of justice, I would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of Oakland, California, Jeff.”

Sessions did not react, according to a report from the room.

Trump is leading a crackdown on unauthorized immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border that will refer adults apprehended after illegal entry for criminal prosecution, even if that means splitting up families and jailing asylum seekers. He is seeking legal changes that would make it easier to turn away or indefinitely detain asylum seekers and children.

“You talk about obstruction of justice, I would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of Oakland, California.” - President Donald Trump

Meanwhile, he is continuing to push for more deportations from the country, including through increased local law enforcement involvement with ICE, even though local officials say that would be counterproductive to other policing efforts.

Trump framed the deportation issue around criminals, as he often does, although ICE arrests increasingly affect people who have not been convicted of crimes.

For him to call immigrants animals is nothing new. In 2015, he used the word twice in an interview with The Washington Post, referring to an undocumented immigrant who had been arrested for fatally shooting a woman in San Francisco. (The man’s attorneys said the shooting was unintentional, and he was acquitted.)

Last July in Ohio, Trump said “criminal aliens” were “animals” and then made a gruesome claim that they are murdering “young, beautiful” girls. Later that month, he said in New York that MS-13 “thugs” had “transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields” and “they are animals.”

He referred to a New York City terrorism suspect, a legal permanent resident who came to the U.S. on a diversity visa, as an “animal” in November.

In February, Trump referred to certain immigrants as “animals” who want people to suffer, and he accused Democrats of wanting to protect murderers. “I can’t get the Democrats ― and nobody has been able to for years ― to approve common-sense measures that, when we catch these animal killers, we can lock them up and throw away the keys.”

Referring to subgroups as animals has been used to justify violence, including by Nazis during the Holocaust and by Hutu perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide. Black people have been compared to animals throughout history and were treated like them through slavery and violence. Animal metaphors have similarly been used by conquerors and colonialists to dehumanize indigenous populations. This story has been updated to include comment from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as well as Trump’s full remarks.

AdvertisementU.S. alpine skier Ted Ligety may have had a tough time on the slopes at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Sunday.

But after a disappointing performance in the men’s giant slalom event, the athlete’s 8-month-old son Jax was on hand to put everything into context.

“He is the bright spot on the day,” Ligety captioned a photograph of the pair, which he shared to Instagram:

A post shared by Ted Ligety (@ted_ligety) on Feb 17, 2018 at 11:23pm PST

“Jax could give two s___s that daddy sucked at work today,” he added.

Ligety, a two-time Olympic champion who scooped golds at both Sochi 2014 in Russia and Turin 2006 in Italy, placed joint 15th in the giant slalom. It followed his earlier fifth place in the alpine combined and a failure to finish the super-G.

The 33-year-old still has the men’s slalom event to come, but suggested Sunday that he may now call it quits in Pyeongchang. “This is probably it for me (at) these games,” he said, per Reuters.

“I was thinking about doing the slalom but we tried to figure out where I’d start and it would be in the 70s or 80s, which is really far out to have a chance to have a good run at it,” he added. “I’ll probably just head back to Europe now and get ready for the rest of the World Cups.”President Donald Trump went on a “fake news” Twitter attack over the Russian indictments Saturday, citing a Facebook ad executive who said the Russians’ “main goal” was not to sway the presidential election.

Rob Goldman, Facebook vice president of ad sales, tweeted Friday that he believed the primary goal of the Russian operation named in special counsel Robert Mueller’s indictments was to divide Americans, not to influence the election. Goldman said 56 percent of the Facebook ads purchased by the indicted Russians ran after the election, but the press hasn’t covered that because it doesn’t “align with the main media narrative of Trump and the election.”

Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election. I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal. — Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018

The main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us. It has stoked fear and hatred amongst Americans. It is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation. — Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018

The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn’t align with the main media narrative of Tump and the election. https://t.co/2dL8Kh0hof — Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018

Trump latched onto Goldman’s tweets, saying, “The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore the fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman!”

The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018

Goldman later clarified he was referring to Russian behavior on Facebook only. He was also apparently only addressing ad purchases. Facebook has testified before Congress that while 3,000 suspect ads reached 10 million people, some 80,000 unpaid posts reached 126 million users.

Fair point. I am only speaking here about the Russian behavior on Facebook. That is the only aspect that I observed directly. — Rob Goldman (@robjective) February 17, 2018

Mueller’s indictment, announced Friday, against 13 Russians and three Russian organizations, stated the intention of the Russian trolls on social media was “to interfere with the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” It also said the aim was to sway the election for Trump and Bernie Sanders — and against Hillary Clinton.

The indictment points to manipulation of both political posts and ads on social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, by Russians allegedly pretending to be Americans. By September before the election, they were operating on a monthly budget of $1.24 million, according to the indictment.

Facebook has come under attack for failing to alert readers or to police posts and ads on its platform. Facebook now has a tool for users to determine if they liked any pages or accounts created by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA), one of the groups named in the indictment. Nearly 150 million Facebook and Instagram users may have seen ads and posts circulated by the group.

Facebook has announced a new process for election ads which will require that verification postcards be mailed back through the U.S. Postal Service to anyone buying election ads, Reuters reports. The postcards will contain a special code that advertisers must send back to prove they’re in the United States.

Twitter announced last month nearly 700,000 people in the U.S. followed, retweeted or liked content distributed by Russian government-linked Twitter accounts in the 10 weeks before the U.S. presidential election.

Trump also tweeted that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at the press conference announcing the indictments that there was “no allegation” any American was a “willing participant in the illegal activity” or that the “conduct altered the election.” In fact, the indictment reached no conclusion about the Russian impact on the election results.

Trump went on to repeat that the Russian operation was launched in 2014, “long before I joined the race.”
