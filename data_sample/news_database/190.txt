Pharrell Williams listens as Bollywood star Ranveer Singh and presenter Anusha Dandekar explain Holi, a Hindu spring festival. adidas Originals/YouTube

American rapper and music producer Pharrell Williams visited India for the first time last week to promote a new collection of Adidas sneakers and clothing inspired by the Holi spring festival.

The Adidas “Hu Holi” collection includes sneakers, shirts, hoodies, and shorts that come in a variety of bright colors. The company says the collection drew its influence from the “magic and beauty” of Holi celebrations in India and Nepal.

Yet while Williams did learn about the spiritual symbolism behind Holi during his trip, images of him looking slightly uncomfortable during the celebration coincided with accusations that Germany-based Adidas is commercializing a beloved Hindu tradition to sell shoes.

Watch Pharrell Williams play Holi in the Adidas video below.

Some people pointed out that Adidas’ new collection seems to tread rather close to cultural appropriation: After all, a German company is using an American celebrity to sell $250 shoes that very explicitly use imagery from a Hindu celebration.

Don’t really care, but yuppp, technically, this is cultural appropriation. @adidasoriginals @Pharrell https://t.co/XwHENmFFFs — Ishita Trivedi (@Ishita_Trivedi) March 2, 2018

Something about Adidas’ new collection screams cultural appropriation... using our festival to sell a brand, and it’s shoes on top of it all, which Hindus would easily take offense too..and there’s not even an Indian celeb at the face of it @HYPEBEAST @adidasoriginals @HuffPost https://t.co/eNJSlSGWzQ — prarthana iyer (@prarthanaiyer) March 2, 2018

And, as at least one person noted, it would be easy (and much cheaper) to get that same “Holi-inspired” look by wearing white shoes and clothes to a real Holi event.

Uhhhhh @Pharrell and @adidas trying to make people dish out $200 for a "Holi Hoodie?" You know people can wear anything white to Holi and get this look for free right? Not saying you're trying to capitalize on a Hindu holiday but....🤔 pic.twitter.com/aRRXWPmKxE — Bhavin Patel (@Bhav1n) March 2, 2018

Asked to respond to the critique that the collection is appropriating Holi, an Adidas spokesperson told HuffPost that “Hu was founded upon the principles of unity, equality, humanity, and color with an intention to explore humanity and celebrate diversity around the world. Together Adidas Originals and Pharrell Williams use the platform to help tell stories of others from around the globe.”

Suhag A. Shukla, executive director of the advocacy organization Hindu American Foundation, told HuffPost she believes Adidas is definitely commercializing a religious festival, but said calling it cultural appropriation might be a stretch. The company very openly acknowledges the Hindu foundations of the holiday, Shukla said, and Williams takes time to learn about the holiday firsthand from Hindus.

She believes other companies, like The Color Run, use Holi’s imagery but don’t give the festival enough credit.

“I don’t necessarily see a Holi themed sports apparel line any differently than products that might feature Christmas, Diwali, or Hanukkah,” Shukla told HuffPost. “If the usage is respectful and culturally appropriate with a solid nod to roots and meaning, there exists the potential to increase understanding and appreciation, and diversify fashion and beauty aesthetics.”

“Holi is a holiday in which differences are shed and are celebrated, and [Pharrell] seems to express a similar intent for his line,” she added.

Putting questions of corporate cultural appropriation aside, some Twitter users joked that the “Happy” singer didn’t appear too happy about participating in the joyous Hindu festival, which celebrates the triumph of good over evil.

Ranveer Singh, a well-known Bollywood star who promotes Adidas in India, hosted a Holi event in Mumbai with Anusha Dandekar, a TV presenter, and explained Holi’s spiritual traditions and customs to Williams.

In an Adidas video of the event, Williams can be seen occasionally cracking a smile. But some Twitter users joked that he looked like he just wasn’t feeling the event, pointing out the stark contrast between Singh and Dandekar’s energy and laughter, and Williams’ stoic demeanor.

I cant handle this.... I hv not laughed so bad in a long long time. 😂😂😂😂😂😂

At one point, Singh showed off some dance moves. The crowd went wild for the actor, but when the camera pans over, viewers can see Williams watching the raucous party with the stiff smile of an awkward dinner guest.

Shukla of the Hindu American Foundation told HuffPost that when she saw the image of Williams at the Holi party, she saw someone who was “taking it all in.”

“I remember my first Holi in India. I probably had the same look on my face,” Shukla said. “Holi there is at once beautiful and overwhelming, and you better be ready to duck!”

In an interview with the Indian news channel NDTV, Williams praised India’s “incredible” and “fascinating” culture, and said he’s trying to learn more about the country. He said he knows about a couple of Hindu deities.

Williams said his goal promoting the Adidas collection is to “give diversity as many opportunities to present itself as possible.”MELBOURNE, March 7 (Reuters) - Australia’s first gay marriage lasted just 48 days and ended in heartbreak with the death of a terminally ill woman, Queensland state parliament heard on Wednesday after the family gave permission for details to be released.

Queensland woman Jo Grant married her partner of eight years, Jill Kindt, on Dec. 15 in the garden of their home on Australia’s northeast Sunshine Coast, less than a week after the nation became the 26th country to recognize same-sex unions.

The couple had avoided a 30-day waiting period and were granted exceptional circumstances to become Australia’s first married same-sex couple following the passage of the marriage equality laws on Dec. 9.

The wedding had remained private until it was revealed with the family’s permission in parliament on Wednesday.

Before Jo passed away, she was able to call the love of her life her wife. Jo Grant and Jill Kindt were married on December 15.

“Jo and Jill were approved, married, and registered all in one day, after the registrar ruled exceptional circumstances,” Queensland Attorney General Yvette D’Ath told parliament.

“Jo’s mum Sandra believes the marriage renewed Jo’s spirit, keeping her alive long enough to have one last Christmas with her family.”

Grant, who was in palliative care for a rare form of cancer, died on January 30.BEIJING (Reuters) - China launched its first privately developed rocket from a launchpad in northwestern China on Thursday, state media said, the latest milestone in the country’s ambitious space exploration program.

Since coming to office in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made becoming a “space flight superpower” a top priority for the Chinese government, which has a goal of sending a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022.

The launch of the “Chongqing Liangjiang Star” rocket, developed by OneSpace Technology, a Beijing-based private firm, marks the first time a non-state Chinese rocket has successfully entered orbit, the official Xinhua news agency said.

The rocket is powered by a solid fuel engine developed by OneSpace and its control systems are customizable in accordance with user demand, the company’s chairman, Ma Chao, told Xinhua.

Also known as the OS-XO, the craft can place a 100-kilogram load into orbit 800 kilometers from the earth, according to state media.

The rocket uses energy-saving technology, such as wireless communications instead of wired internet that by cutting weight has helped lower fuel costs by about 30 percent, Xinhua said.

Founded in 2015, OneSpace is the result of a government effort to foster China’s commercial space flight and encourage private participation in the sector, according to state media.

The company expects 10 missions for carrier rockets in 2019, founder Shu Chang told the official China Daily last week.

“I hope we can become one of the biggest small-satellite launchers in the world,” Shu said.

Last year, the company signed a deal with the state-run Chongqing Liangjiang Aviation Industry Investment Group to build a joint research and manufacturing base in the southwestern city of Chongqing.

The base’s strategic location as part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, a key foreign policy initiative by Xi that aims to develop trade links between China and Eurasia, will provide a large export market for OneSpace, Shu told China Daily.

“We will develop bigger rockets in the future and participate in the global competition,” Shu said.Gun rights are enshrined in the Second Amendment, but women are still fighting for an equal rights amendment. Harald Sund via Getty Images

Here’s a disturbing fact to consider in 2018, the year women supposedly began to topple the patriarchy: Gun owners in the United States, a majority of whom are men, have better constitutional rights than women.

Gun owners have the Second Amendment, in place since the 18th century. The U.S. is one of only three countries that offer constitutional protection to gun owners.

Women, meanwhile, have been fighting for an equal rights amendment for decades. That’s because the Constitution does not actually grant women equal rights under the law, setting the country apart from 131 other nations that explicitly guarantee gender equality in their constitutions.

This failing means that when it comes to a raft of issues ― including equal pay, sexual harassment and domestic violence ― women lose.

“On the moral plane, there’s a sense in which the Constitution sets forth our human rights and to not have the human rights of women in there is a gross omission,” said Jessica Neuwirth, president of the ERA Coalition, a group founded in 2014 that’s dedicated to amending the Constitution. “It just makes no sense.”

This injustice burns all the more now, in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting, in which a 19-year-old man used an AR-15 to murder 17 people, including 14 high school students. The shooter had a legal right to his guns. He apparently had an arsenal. And because he had no criminal record, the FBI and police did not have any legal standing to take them away. In 2014, police were similarly hamstrung in the case of a 22-year-old man who went on to kill six and injure 13 in a rampage in Isla Vista, California.

“On the moral plane, there’s a sense in which the Constitution sets forth our human rights and to not have the human rights of women in there is a gross omission.” - Jessica Neuwirth, president of the ERA Coalition

Contrast those cases with what happened to Jessica Gonzales, a Colorado mother whose three children, just 7, 9 and 10, were abducted and shot to death by her husband. Those children should still be alive today: Gonzales had obtained a protective order against her husband, who had been violent before. The police refused to enforce it, declining to get involved in a “private” matter between a man and his wife.

Gonzales sued the police, arguing she had a right to protection. Her case went all the way to the Supreme Court. But she lost in 2005. The court ruled that Gonzales, now known as Jessica Lenahan, had no constitutional right to help from law enforcement.

An equal rights amendment, which would force police to take the rights of women as seriously as they apparently take the rights of potential mass murderers, could have theoretically changed the outcome of that case.

Indeed, Gonzales has brought her case to an international court, which has charged the U.S. government with violating her human rights.

Of course, the Second Amendment applies to all Americans. But is there really any doubt that guns are unabashedly, toxically masculine? Recent efforts by the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers to market weapons to women haven’t done much to change this. Thirty-nine percent of men said they own a gun, in a recent Pew survey, compared with 22 percent of women. Of course, Second Amendment rights have traditionally been a liberty fully enjoyed mostly by white men ― and the stats reflect this: 48 percent of those guys own a gun.

If a boy grows up in a house with guns, he’s far more likely to participate in gun-related activities, according to Pew. After all, from the time boys are able to walk, they are lured into loving guns ― they get Army men to play with, fashion pistols out of sticks, watch “cool men” shoot people in video games and on the big screen. Gun companies run advertisements, like this one from Bushmaster, that equate gun ownership with masculinity.

To grown men, guns are marketed as the ultimate safety device, allowing them to protect themselves and, this is crucial, their families ― wives and children ― from danger.

But we know the truth: Women are in greater danger when their partner has a gun. The risk of a woman being murdered in a domestic violence situation increases 500 percent when there’s a gun in the house, according to one study.

Women would be better protected with the help of the law, not a device meant to kill.

There was a big and fairly popular attempt to pass a measure appropriately called the Equal Rights Amendment for women back in the 1970s. The gist of the ERA is simple: “Equality under the law should not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state because of sex.” But in 1982, the amendment reached the deadline imposed on it by Congress. It fell just three states short of the 38 needed to ratify it to amend the Constitution.

While the ERA was initially popular, opponents of the amendment gained traction over the years its ratification was in play. They used arguments that now seem antiquated, such as that the ERA would mean women would go into combat (now they do), that it would make gay marriage legal (check) or that somehow women wouldn’t get a good deal out of marriage anymore (because of alimony).

Others tried to argue we don’t need explicit equal rights under the Constitution because the law already provides women with equality. Tell that to Jessica Gonzales. Or to the female workers at Walmart who famously lost their fight for equal pay at the Supreme Court in 2011.

In Walmart v. Dukes, the high court ruled that the women did not have standing to sue because they didn’t have enough in common. The opinion was written by now-deceased Justice Antonin Scalia who had said earlier that year in an interview that women aren’t guaranteed protection from sex discrimination by the Constitution.

Indeed, even as so many more women are now speaking up in the Me Too era about sexual harassment and discrimination, the sad truth is Scalia wasn’t wrong: The path to justice in the court system for victims of harassment and discrimination is far from guaranteed.

“This amendment is the only legal initiative expansive enough to support what the Me Too revelations have shown is needed.” - Catharine MacKinnon, of the ERA Coalition advisory council

The legal framework that allows women to go after harassers in court is a patchwork. The federal anti-discrimination law, born of the civil rights era in the 1960s, does offer protection for women ― but there are loopholes. If harassment takes place outside of work or school, there’s no avenue to pursue justice. And even if it happens at work or school, there are snags: Small businesses can’t be sued under the law; private schools aren’t covered.

Sure, there are states that do better, with stronger protections for women in place, just as some put more curbs on gun rights. But that’s no substitute for the force of federal law.

The ERA would arguably close those loopholes. (The ERA, if it passed, would be the first amendment since the 27th passed in 1992, setting stricter rules around pay for legislators.)

Women haven’t given up fighting for that protection: The ERA has been introduced in the House every year since 1982, most recently by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.).

Last year the Nevada Legislature ― 35 years too late ― endorsed the ERA.

Giving women equal rights is a popular and not even highly partisan concept. According to the ERA’s own polling, 80 percent of Americans think women already have equal rights under the Constitution. And 94 percent support the ERA.

“This amendment is the only legal initiative expansive enough to support what the Me Too revelations have shown is needed,” said Catharine MacKinnon, the legal scholar who first conceptualized the notion of sexual harassment in the courts and who sits on the advisory council of the current ERA Coalition.Sotheby's

In the market for a replica Roman chariot, neo-Nazi jackboots or some British navy dress clothes? You’re in luck. Russell Crowe is having a garage sale.

The New Zealand-born, Australian-residing star of “Gladiator,” “Master and Commander” and “A Beautiful Mind” is clearing out dozens of pieces of memorabilia from his celebrated acting career, what he is calling a “divorce auction,” as he prepares to finalize his split from Danielle Spencer.

Crowe is selling more than 200 items in a Sotheby’s auction, with the pieces to go under the hammer on April 7 in Sydney ― his wedding anniversary and his 54th birthday. The collection, titled “The Art of Divorce,” is also available for viewing as a public exhibition before the auction.

“The sale represents the dispersal of a highly personal collection that was assembled by Crowe over many years, including those shared with his former wife, Danielle Spencer,” the Sotheby’s listing reads.

“The Russell Crowe Collection comprises important paintings by some of Australia’s most significant historic, modern and contemporary artists, furniture, movie memorabilia, musical instruments, watches and sporting memorabilia.”

Besides movie mementos, Crowe’s divorce auction also includes a number of cars, motorbikes, guitars, paintings, watches, jewelery and pieces of sporting memorabilia.

“We’ve been separated over five years now, our divorce should be finalised around the time of the auction,” Crowe told Australia’s Daily Telegraph newspaper. “Just as we collaborate on the upbringing of our kids, it’s easy for us to work together on something like this. I think she feels the same way I do in regards to just moving on things that help create space for the future.”

The most expensive piece in the collection is an 1890 violin that was used in “Master and Commander.” The total value of the auction may reach $3.6 million ($2.8 million in U.S. dollars), according to Sotheby’s estimates.Texas may elect its first Latina congresswoman, or women, this year. Drew Anthony Smith via Getty Images

The state of Texas appears close to electing its first Latina congresswoman in history, possibly the first two, according to preliminary primary election results released Tuesday.

Democrats Veronica Escobar, running for her party’s nomination in Texas’ 16th Congressional District, and Sylvia Garcia, running in the state’s 29th, were tracking well ahead of competitors in their races late Tuesday. While many votes are yet to be counted, whoever secures the party’s nomination is likely to head to Congress, as both districts lean heavily blue.

Any candidate who secures 50 percent of the vote in a Texas primary secures the party’s nomination, but if no one wins a majority, the top two candidates will head to a runoff on May 22.

The Cook Political Report’s Dave Wasserman noted that both Escobar and Garcia were likely to avoid such runoffs and said that if either secured a win on Tuesday, it’s likely they’ll win in Democratic-leaning El Paso (the 16th District) and Houston (the 29th). He pointed out that either election would make history, as no Latina had ever been sent to Congress from the state.

“That’s ending in 2018,” Wasserman predicted.

Hard to believe, but TX has never elected a Latina to Congress. That's ending in 2018: #TX16 Veronica Escobar (D) and #TX29 Sylvia Garcia (D) both look like they'll avoid runoffs, assuring them safe Dem seats in El Paso & Houston. — Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 7, 2018

Both candidates have built on the momentum surrounding Democratic candidates ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

Escobar, who previously served as county judge for El Paso County’s Commissioners Court, has secured several major endorsements over the other candidates in the race. She’s running to fill the seat vacated by Beto O’Rourke, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Ted Cruz.

Escobar said late Tuesday that she was “overwhelmed with gratitude” after the early results were posted.

“You never know what to expect, especially when there are so many people in the race,” she told the El Paso Times. “I was bracing myself for a runoff, and the night is not over and the final results won’t be in until much later, but we do have a pretty great lead.

Garcia is running to fill the seat that will be vacated by Rep. Gene Green, who has held the seat since 1992. She was elected Houston city controller in 1998 and has served in the Texas Legislature since 2013. Her bid has also garnered major endorsements from Green and the political action group EMILY’s List.

The Houston Chronicle notes that about 77 percent of the 29th District is comprised of people who identify as Hispanic, and Garcia has heavily campaigned on her experience in public service.

“We know that representation matters and that taking the first step to electing our first Latina for Congress is not just a milestone but a step for generations to come,” Garcia said on Tuesday before the election, according to the Chronicle.

Six of the seven Democrats in the primary for the 29th District are Latino. The other is Pakistani-American.

"We know that representation matters and that taking the first step to electing our first Latina for Congress is not just a milestone but a step for generations to come,” candidate Sylvia Garcia said Tuesday. Omar Vega via Getty ImagesIn the opening scene of the Season 2 premiere of “Atlanta,” two unnamed kids are chilling in an apartment complex. One plays a game of “FIFA” while chastising the other for drinking his Powerade straight out the bottle instead of a cup, which may be one the of blackest moments ever aired on television.

After a brief conversation about local rappers and wanting to smoke a J before work, the two decide to hit up Mrs. Winners, a drive-thru chicken shack that’ll sell you an eighth if you order a No. 17. Somewhere along the way, the two kids decide to rob the chicken shack and get into a shootout with one of the employees. Before the robbers peel off, they open the back door. A woman steps out covered in blood and screaming.

If you’re not watching Donald Glover’s “Atlanta,” you should be. Black as hell and relatable to everyone, ratchet and serious in equal measure, “Atlanta” is a dark and funny show, but not that kind of funny. It makes something fascinating out of the mundane aspects of daily life, which is to say it’s a show about nothing — a sort of Southern black nephew to “Seinfeld.” There’s a social conscience at work here, though, and Glover has a knack for addressing systemic American issues without getting didactic.

Plus, the music is damn good.

The new season, “Robbin’ Season,” started last week. The two of us — race reporter Julia Craven and Black Voices editor Taryn Finley — are gonna have a lot to say over the next two months, and we’ll be saying it here weekly, via Slack chat. What follows is our conversation about Episode 1.

A little background: Earn (Donald Glover), Al (Bryan Tyree Henry) and Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) are on the same shit in Season 2, but the stakes are even higher. Everyone around town — even the feds — is ready and willing to hit a lick in the lead-up to the holidays. In the first episode, we get a glimpse of just how much the trio will have to protect their necks from robbers, old friends and the criminal justice system.

Some of the biggest takeaways: Katt Williams is the GOAT, Earn’s backpack is hella tired and the hood deserves good cinematography, too.

Warning: Spoilers galore.

***

Julia Craven: Aight — so Episode 1. First impressions!

Taryn Finly: NIGGA! Earn still on his broke, dumb, tryna get it shit. I admire his hustle but he’s stupid about it. Earn really let himself down. I think he feels like he’s a bigger disappointment than his parents do. And I love how Al and Darius fell out but we never found out what happened and they just popped up at the end like “you tryna smoke” and everything was gucci.

Julia: Earn gotta let all the hurt go. Like, WHO HURT YOU?! (I know who hurt him. He hurt himself.) And, yeah, I wanna know what two niggas like Al and Darius could have possibly have fallen out about. I really do. Did someone eat all the Pringles? What happened there?

Taryn: LMAO! I feel like Darius was mad cause Al kept on leaving only a swallow of milk in the carton. That’s not enough for Darius’ Cinnamon Toast Crunch or the cookies he loves making. Selfish ass. I’d be mad too. And Al don’t care about anybody but himself ... and the nigga on house arrest so he has all the time in the world to lay up, eat all the food and piss someone off.

Julia: asdfghjkjhgfdsadfghj. Wait, I wanna talk about the opening scene and what it meant to me.

Taryn: Please do.

Julia: It’s Robbin’ Season, right? So we’re in the lead-up to holiday season in the hood which means everybody is getting jacked for their shit. But the opener was sooooooooo .... casual. Granted, that made it realistic but also FUCK. I read in The Ringer that it was a metaphor for the stakes being a bit higher in the same ATL and I’m obsessed with it. I also wonder what the overall meaning of the theme will be. Like, what will Earn and crew be robbed of? Not in the literal sense but, like, how Van lost her job, Paper Boi lost his freedom, Earn ain’t got his storage locker no more. What in the fuh-duck could be left to take from them?

Taryn: The whole theme of “Robbin’ Season” is so real on so many levels. I also wonder if they’ll be doing any of the metaphorical robbin’. (Hell, Earn robbed Van of a lot last season so maybe he already had his Robbin’ Season.)

Julia: He has taken so much from Van. I want her to find a better man to occupy her time.

Taryn: I do too but she’s so in love with the good parts of Earn (which don’t appear that often). I’m interested in seeing how their relationship evolves or devolves. Who knows?

Julia: I like Earn but he’s so jaded and broke. But I’m not as open-minded or warm-hearted as Van. “If you ain’t talking money, I don’t wanna talk.” — The Lord’s Prophet Young Dolph.

Taryn: Me neither, sis. Like dude got kicked out of the storage unit he was living in. HOW?!

Julia: RT HOW?! I mean, I know I’m supposed to feel for Earn ― and I do ― but come on bruh.

Taryn: He walking around ATL with this tired-ass backpack looking for a place to stay Episode 1. This is familiar af, bro.

Julia: LOLLL THAT BACKPACK IS DUMB TIRED! IT’S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH!

Taryn: I wanna see some growth. I see it in everyone else but him.

Julia: Sometimes, I think that’s the point of Earn’s character. But it can also be exhausting.

Taryn: Same. He’s corny and a bad liar and that makes me sad. But I’m laughing at his dumb ass in the same breath.

Julia: Omg when he called Tara “Regina” I fell off the couch.

Taryn: And when he tried to have that kumbaya moment with Al and Darius, I lived for how Tara laughed IN HIS FACE and said “get your boy.” EYE LIVED!

Julia: See, I hated that 😂

Taryn: LMAO why?

Julia: Sis, your man’s cousin just called you by another woman’s name because he can’t keep your man’s women sorted out. Bigger issues than Earn loving his peoples.

Taryn: You right. But since none of them ever have their priorities together anyway (except Darius) she just said what was already on my mind lol. Let’s talk about Florida Man.

Julia: The connection between that story and Alligator Man blew my mind.

Taryn: Let’s explore that ― cause Alligator Man took me clean out in the best way.

***

Legendary comedian Katt Williams plays Earn’s erratic Uncle Willie. For some reason, he has a pet alligator, and is called “Alligator Man” by the neighborhood kids.

The alligator behind Alligator Man. FX Networks

Julia: I took it as just like, Florida Man is seen as a wild muhfucka who commits all these wild crimes in Florida, but he’s actually just a collection of disturbed individuals in the news and looped under the umbrella of “Florida Man.” The Alligator Man is a more realistic look at “Florida Man.” Do I sound high? Because I’m not, but that’s what I took from it. Alligator Man, like Florida Man, also had urban legend status in the neighborhood, which was fun.

Taryn: Lol no, you don’t at all. I think that’s on the nose, actually. And a good reason why the Florida Man reference was in this episode, of all episodes. Also, I loved that Katt Williams was Alligator Man. I read that he interned at an alligator farm for three weeks to prep for this role.

Julia: KATT WILLIAMS 2020! When that door opened and I saw Katt Williams, I screamed. I knew I was about to get one hell of a performance and EYE DID!

Taryn: LMAO this man is a comedic legend. Katt Williams was the quintessential hood uncle in this role.

Julia: He really was. All black people have an Uncle Willie. I think I got two.

Taryn: I have four. One shot a white man who threatened his family in the Jim Crow South and we ain’t seen him since. I believe he, too, owned an alligator.

Julia: Help me Father God in Heaven.

Taryn: Uncle Willie (the one in “Atlanta”) opened the door with a merlot-colored robe on, smelling like cloves, daring the cops to try him on his own property. He was in the wrong for holding that nice lady hostage, but this scene felt very familiar. It felt like home in the hood. And it’s shot so beautifully. I love Donald so much because he sees that the hood deserves good cinematic framing and lighting. It shows the hood in a raw, yet elegant way.

Julia: And that’s the beauty of “Atlanta.” It feels like home. The mundaneness of it all is what gets to me and how that’s really what life is like in the hood. Like, these niggas robbed the chicken shack after they wrapped up a game of “FIFA.” Come on. Your cousins could have easily did that. Maybe they have. Who knows?

Taryn: I’ve seen the chicken shack get held up before. I also witnessed the manager come out bussin’ because this ain’t the first time.

Julia: LOOK! And I love how the music corresponds so well with what’s happening too. We all have a family member who is depressed, drinks too much, smokes, is abusive and plays amazing oldies as the abuse is playing out and other family members are intervening. Uncle Willie’s house could have easily been any internal family drama I saw growing up.

Taryn: L.T.D was playing on a quiet storm mix in the background while Uncle Willie was planning his escape. Iconic. And the fact that he gave Earn a GOLD GUN and Earn took it knowing he’s on probation really made me mad.

Julia: I was real over that. As Darius said, “You holding a gun for a nigga while 12 outside?”

Taryn: But it was also a good reminder that people don’t sit up looking for shit to get in. It happens by circumstance a lot of times and black people are usually villainized for those circumstances ― on-screen and off. Earn is still dumb for taking that gun, though. Darius, the prophet, got out of the house just in time. He said, “It’s starting to feel more and more like jail in here,” and hit the door.

Julia: Darius is me. I love tuning into the vibe and getting on out of there if it’s too real.

Taryn: Uncle Willie let that gator out and turned into a track star. I wonder where he went and if we’ll see him later in the season.

Julia: All while in his robe. I want to see him again but I don’t deserve to.

Taryn: And that’s the honest truth.

FX Networks

Earn, a first-time offender who got picked up for narcotics possession with intent to sell last season, is now on probation. During a meeting with his probation officer, he is informed that his mandatory anti-drug classes are $375, a warrant will be issued for his arrest if he doesn’t pay and that he can’t get arrested again. Earn had half of a joint on him when he was arrested.

Julia: Oooh — the probation scene perfectly laid out the jig. You need all this money to pay for state-mandated classes over a trumped-up charge and then you can get arrested if you don’t pay but most employers don’t hire felons? The gag.

Taryn: It sure did. You gotta pay to be on probation. Can’t afford the mandatory classes? Sucks, see you in jail. It’s the biggest catch-22 funding the American justice system today.

Julia: “Atlanta,” within all its layers, shows us the jig while also showing us average everyday people ― like you said.

Taryn: God, this show is good.

Julia: This type of shit really just happens to regular black people. It’s like when Van lost her job over smoking a blunt. It’s perfect and I’m obsessed with it.

Taryn: I’m still pissed about that. I hope there’s another episode (or five) focusing more on Van this season. I feel like we may see more of a dive into black women’s perspectives. (At least I’m praying.)

Julia: Me too. I wanna know how she is and I hope she has a new man.

Taryn: I also love the role weed plays in “Atlanta” because it’s so real. The same thing that got Van fired it the same thing that served as an olive branch for Al and Darius. I hope she finds better, too. I want her bougie friend to come back this season and remind her that Earn still ain’t shit.A West Virginia lawmaker can be seen singing a racial slur in a video obtained Wednesday by HuffPost.

In the video, West Virginia House Delegate Saira Blair (R) and a friend belt out explicit lyrics to Lil Wayne’s 2010 rap single “Gonorrhea,” which appear uncensored below.

The lyrics they sang along to are: “I call it how I see ya. I wish I never met ya. I wouldn’t wanna be ya. Pussy-ass nigga, I don’t want your gonorrhea. Pussy-ass nigga ―”

Blair confirmed the video’s authenticity in a statement to HuffPost and said it was filmed in the summer of 2015. Blair was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in November 2014.

“This video was taken in the summer of 2015 and shows my roommate and I singing along to a Lil’ Wayne song, which is clearly heard playing in the background,” Blair said. “I do not condone the use of racial epithets, and if taken in context, it is clear that singing the lyrics was not meant to offend anyone.”

The video was originally posted to the roommate’s Snapchat, a source close to the matter told HuffPost. While Blair defended her use of the slur as simply “singing the lyrics,” black activists have repeatedly rejected that argument. During an event in November at a high school in Illinois, author Ta-Nehisi Coates explained why non-black people shouldn’t use that epithet while quoting rap lyrics.

“Words don’t have a meaning without context,” Coates said. He explained that even though certain communities can choose to use a derogatory term ironically among themselves, it doesn’t make it OK for those outside that community to do so.

“For white people, I think the experience of being a hip-hop fan and not being able to use the word ‘nigga’ will be very insightful,” he continued. “This will give you just a little peek into the world of what it means to be black. Because to be black is to walk through the world and watch people doing things that you cannot do.”

In a December 2014 interview with the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Blair said she believed Americans are “past the point of looking at things from a racial perspective” and that talking about “racial tendencies” creates further division.

“The issue of race is never going to go away unless we stop talking about the issue of race and stop saying black power, white power, Hispanic power,” Blair told the Gazette. “As long as we keep creating that division it’s not going to be solved... I think harping on the racial issues, the racial tendencies, that enhances them.”

Blair made history in November 2014 when she defeated a two-term incumbent delegate at the age of 18 to become the youngest elected legislator in U.S. history. Blair’s father, Craig Blair, is a Republican state senator in West Virginia and served as her 2014 campaign manager. On top of her legislative duties, she is currently studying economics and Spanish at West Virginia University.

Last week, the 21-year-old lawmaker was the only person in the West Virginia House of Delegates to vote against House Bill 4145, which sought to increase teachers’ pay by 5 percent. Public schools across West Virginia were closed for nearly two weeks as thousands of teachers went on strike to demand higher pay and lower health care premiums.

“We’ve already voted out a pay raise, one that was fair and within our budget,” Blair told West Virginia News last Wednesday about her no vote.

Blair announced in January that she would not seek re-election in 2018, citing plans to attend graduate school outside of West Virginia.

John Isner, a Democrat running for Blair’s seat in the 2018 West Virginia House election, called the video “extremely disappointing.”

“It shows a massive lack of maturity,” Isner, 25, told HuffPost in an email. “This is another example of why we need to make changes here in West Virginia.”A beloved “Queer Eye” contestant is restoring people’s faith in love.

Tom Jackson, who appeared on the first episode of the Netflix revival, tweeted on Wednesday that he has gotten back together with the undeniable object of his affection — his ex-wife Abby.

Jackson wrote that they’d “loved each other for many years and want to spend the rest of our lives together!!!!!!!!”

Jackson’s unwavering devotion to his ex was extremely apparent during his episode, when he proclaimed to Antoni Porowski, the show’s resident foodie: “I love Abby more than anything. I want to spend the rest of my life with her.”

At the end of his episode, a newly confident Jackson went on a date with Abby, and it appeared that the two were rekindling their romance.

What makes the latest news even more delightful ― and unexpected ― is that after the pair’s apparently successful date on the episode, Jackson told his Twitter followers that they weren’t able to make it work after all.

“I just watched my episode for about the 20th time. I cry like a baby every time I watch it,” he wrote. “Just to let the world know, Abby and I are no longer together.”

Jackson continued, “She will always be the love of my life. I will always love her more than anything!!!!!!!”

But now it looks like their status as a full-fledged couple is official.

AdvertisementChelsea Clinton has defended President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron, from criticism, but when it comes to his eldest daughter, Ivanka, the former first daughter feels differently.

In an interview with Stephen Colbert on Monday night, Clinton said Ivanka Trump, in her role as a White House adviser to the president, is fair game for criticism.

“I think anyone who works for the president certainly should expect to be scrutinized for whatever decisions not only he or she is making, but whatever decisions the White House is making on any given day,” she said.

Clinton said she and Ivanka Trump were friends before the election, but that they had not spoken in a long time.

“It’s clear that she has supported policies and decisions that I don’t agree with,” she added. “I’ve been very vocal about my opposition to President Trump.”

As recently as last month, Ivanka Trump avoided answering a question from NBC News by saying it was “inappropriate to ask a daughter.” NBC’s Peter Alexander had asked her if she believed the multiple women accusing her father of sexual misconduct.

“I think it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he’s affirmatively stated that there’s no truth to it,” she said.The Thinking Chair is about to get a new occupant ― “Blue’s Clues” is coming back!

Nickelodeon announced Tuesday that it has picked up 20 new episodes of the beloved children’s series with a “refreshed signature look.”

“The new, modern version of ‘Blue’s Clues’ will capture all the original’s creativity and visual identity for a whole new audience ready for its fun adventures and expertly designed problem-solving curriculum,” Nickelodeon Group president Cyma Zarghami said in a release.

Production is scheduled to begin this summer. The new “Blue’s Clues” still focuses on the puppy Blue, “who invites viewers into her animated world to help solve the day’s puzzles,” the release noted.

Variety reported that the show will likely air on Nick Jr. for the preschool set. (We have a feeling some nostalgic grownups may tune in as well.)A Florida middle school teacher will keep his job after an investigation found he used a racial slur in front of students more than once and told them not to date black boys.

More than 20 students said David Swinyar used a racial slur in front of them during class. Florida DMV

David Swinyar, a 48-year-old math teacher at Kernan Middle School in Duval County, has also been accused by students of belittling them, confronting them in a “physically aggressive manner” and yelling at them, according to an investigation conducted by the Duval County School District.

He will face a 10-day unpaid suspension after the investigation found merit to all the complaints.

In October of last year, while teaching his math class, Swinyar had a conversation with students about the word “fuck” after he overheard it in his classroom.

“If my daughter was dating someone who used the ‘f’ word, I wouldn’t have any respect for that n****r,” Swinyar said, according to the report.

In the same conversation about dating, Swinyar used the slur again.

“If your boyfriend says bad things to you and/or treats you wrong, that means that he’s acting like a n****r,” he said, per the report. “You all should not be dating all these different African Americans [sic] boys because they are not worth it.”

Two dozen students in his class acted as witnesses for the report, and most agreed they clearly heard Swinyar say the word. Students said they were shocked, with one saying he wanted to “go on a rampage” after hearing the epithet. Black students called out Swinyar’s behavior.

“I never said that, but if I did, I am sorry,” he allegedly told students.

Swinyar defended himself further by saying he attends a black church, but then laughed and began mocking black preachers, students said.

“He loves to talk about politics and Donald Trump,” one student told the investigator.

Students said Swinyar regularly berated them, yelling and calling them “idiots.”

“You are only enrolled in my class because you performed poorly on the standardized testing (FSA),” he allegedly told his class at one time.

One female student said she felt uncomfortable because the teacher allegedly “makes female students uncomfortable by staring at their breasts and other parts,” the report says.

After Swinyar used the racial slur during the October incident, a student in his class went to the school’s office to call his mother and tell her about what happened.

“Mr. Swinyar yelled at the student and called the student a liar,” the school’s office assistant told investigators. “He also snatched the phone away from the student.”

On Tuesday night, the Duval County School Board agreed to Swinyar’s 10-day suspension. Because of the “severity” of the incident, customary steps of issuing the teacher verbal and written reprimands were “skipped” in favor of the suspension, a spokesperson for Duval County Schools told HuffPost.

Swinyar’s suspension comes less than a week after another Florida teacher lost her job following a HuffPost investigation found she had a white nationalist podcast.

Swinyar did not return a call for comment from HuffPost.

In the report, one parent said there needed to be a “heightened awareness surrounding racial issues in the country as a whole” and that she “believes our school system should seek to provide a safe haven for our students.”A former attorney and adviser of Donald Trump stunned “Fox & Friends” anchors on Wednesday with a revelation about a lawsuit filed Tuesday by Stephanie Clifford (aka Stormy Daniels).

Jay Goldberg, who represented the president in both of his divorces, told show hosts that Clifford may have a point that her nondisclosure agreement with Trump is invalid if he didn’t sign it.

“It’s true. An agreement, you need the signature of both parties,” he said. “And if there’s no signature by him, it’s not valid.”

Goldberg added that courts tend to look at “nondisclosure agreements” skeptically “because it impairs negatively on the right of free speech.”

After Goldberg’s input, the “Fox & Friends” hosts quickly end the segment, but as you can see on the video below, it appears as if some life was sucked out of the room.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that Trump has already “made very well clear that none of these allegations are true,” according to The Hill.

“This case has already been won in arbitration, and anything beyond that I would refer you to the president’s outside counsel,” she said.

Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, denied that claim to New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg, saying, “Yeah, and he also won the popular vote.”

Earlier this week, the comedian and a few of his male “Arrested Development” castmates came off sounding particularly bad during a New York Times interview about the show’s revival on Netflix.

During the conversation, co-star Jessica Walter opened up about an incident in which Jeffrey Tambor — who plays her character’s husband on “Arrested Development” — was verbally abusive and yelled at her on set. Tambor was fired from another show, “Transparent,” in February after being accused of sexual harassment.

“In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set,” Walter said through tears.

In response, Cross and castmates Jason Bateman and Tony Hale came to Tambor’s defense and were dismissive of Walter’s feelings.

The interview rubbed many readers the wrong way and sparked a backlash against Bateman, Cross and Hale. Bateman and Hale have since apologized to Walter.

On Thursday, New York news site Gothamist asked Cross about the criticism, and the 54-year-old said he understood why people were uncomfortable with his remarks and promised to “unequivocally apologize to Jessica.”

Yet just moments later, Cross couldn’t stop himself from pointing a finger in Walter’s direction.

“There’s never an excuse ever for yelling at somebody and humiliating them in front of other people,” Cross told Gothamist. “And there was no excuse when Jessica did it. To Jessica’s credit, she eventually apologized to the actress and felt bad about it.”

When Gothamist asked him to elaborate on Walter’s alleged outburst, Cross said there was an incident between the actress and a stand-in, “but it didn’t have the same kind of feeling that Jeffrey’s did.”

Some people on Twitter did not appreciate Cross’ tone-deaf attempt to divert attention from the issue at hand.

Thursday, after all, marks the one-year anniversary of the launch of Mueller’s investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election ― a probe the president has labeled “Fake & Corrupt” and a “total WITCH HUNT.”Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon says now is the right time to meet with Vice President Mike Pence.

In an interview with CNN on Wednesday morning, the bronze medalist said he would be willing to accept the vice president’s invitation to sit down and have a conversation.

“I agree with so many people that you don’t get to make any sort of change if you don’t try to at least reach across and have the opportunity to speak,” Rippon said. “I’m making it clear that I would really like to have that conversation because I still have that Olympics platform and I’d like to use it.”

Rippon had previously said that he has nothing personally to say to Pence, who has pushed an aggressive anti-LGBTQ agenda during his political career. But now it seems Rippon is set on using the meeting as a way to represent those whose lives have been personally affected by legislation Pence has supported.

“I felt the responsibility to speak up for people who may not feel like they have a voice,” Rippon said. “The conversation isn’t for me. It’s for people whose lives have been changed by legislation that he’s pushed.”

Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. Winter Olympian, made headlines just before the 2018 Games when he called out Pence for leading the U.S. delegation at the Pyeongchang, South Korea, opening ceremony while simultaneously opposing equality for LGBTQ Americans.

Pence’s office reached out to the figure skater to set up a meeting, which the Olympian declined as he was preparing for competition.

Pence tweeted his support for Rippon and all the athletes competing, which the figure skater labeled at the time as disingenuous.

.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Don’t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get ‘em! — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8, 2018

When asked about it Wednesday, Rippon said of Pence’s Feb. 7 tweet: ″I don’t believe it. When I go home, are you still for me? Are you still for other LGBTQ Americans? Are you still for that trans man or woman that wants to join the military? Are you still for that lesbian couple who wants to get married?”WASHINGTON ― A South Carolina white supremacist who praised racist mass shooter Dylann Roof and longed to commit violence against Jews, Muslims and people of color has reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors that will likely result in a relatively short stint in federal prison.

Benjamin Thomas Samuel McDowell, a 30-year-old from Conway, South Carolina, was arrested in an FBI sting in February 2017 after he purchased a disabled weapon from an undercover FBI agent who McDowell believed was a member of a white supremacist organization. The feds said McDowell, who has white supremacist tattoos, believed white supremacists needed to turn their talk into action, and that he expressed a desire to “do something on a fucking big scale.”

As part of a deal with federal prosecutors, McDowell pleaded guilty last week to a single count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. While the charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, McDowell’s sentencing range will be between 10 months and just over three years. The plea agreement isn’t binding, so the judge could potentially give him a lengthier sentence. But as part of the deal, McDowell has the right to appeal if he’s sentenced to more than three years and one month behind bars.

Mental health issues played a role in McDowell’s case. A mental health evaluation ordered by U.S. District Judge R. Bryan Harwell was filed under seal in December, and McDowell and his federal public defender said McDowell was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder. McDowell’s “cognitive functioning is very low” and his intellectual ability is “significantly below average,” according to a prior court filing, which indicated he’d received disability benefits until he was 18 because he was classified as mentally disabled.

But McDowell’s case still illustrates the differences in how the federal government approaches domestic terrorism investigations compared with investigations that involve foreign terrorist organizations. Had McDowell taken the same actions but been inspired by a group like the self-described Islamic State, rather than by white supremacists, he’d likely be facing a much different future, mental health issues or no.

McDowell came to the FBI’s attention the same way a lot of federal terrorism defendants do: through social media. McDowell, who had a felony conviction and evidently came into contact with white supremacists when he served time in prison, posted a number of troubling screeds on Facebook. In late 2016 he posted a link to the website of a synagogue in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and said he would “love to act.” In early 2017, he posted on Facebook that Dylann Roof ― the white supremacist mass murderer who killed nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston in 2015 ― did what white supremacists were supposed to do.

An undercover FBI agent posing as a member of the Aryan Nations soon met with McDowell, who said he was frustrated that white supremacists were too busy screaming about white power to get the job done.

“I got the heart to do that shit, but I don’t have the good training,” McDowell allegedly said. “I seen what Dylann Roof did and in my heart I reckon I got a little bit of hatred and I... I want to do that shit. Like, I got desire... not for nobody else... it just... I want something where I can say, ‘I fucking did that’... me personally... If I could do something on a fucking big scale and write on the fucking building or whatever, ‘In the spirit of Dylann Roof.’”

McDowell is similar to some defendants caught in FBI terrorism stings in that he may not have had the means or ability to carry out a plot on his own. McDowell, who did some landscaping work and had worked as a janitor at Horry County’s courthouse, ran into logistical problems when he was the target of the FBI sting: His mother would not allow him use her cellphone, and he had to borrow cash from his grandfather to buy the weapon from the FBI for just $109.

McDowell’s inability to plan an actual attack may, in the end, have been to his advantage. In court, according to a transcript obtained by HuffPost, a federal prosecutor said there was “no indication” that McDowell had a “particular target” or “particular plan.” The prosecutor said McDowell had “specifically requested hollow point .40-caliber ammunition,” and that he agreed to purchase a .40-caliber Glock and ammunition.

Bill Nettles, McDowell’s federal public defender, told the court that while his client admitted to the possession offense, there were “no overt acts, no planning, no plotting, no casing of any location.”

But the handling of his case is different, in part because of the way the law is written. The United States doesn’t have a criminal statute that makes domestic terrorism illegal writ large. If McDowell had been planning an attack on behalf of ISIS or another designated terrorist organization, he’d also be facing a material support charge in addition to the weapons charge. But he’s not facing any terrorism-related charge ― just a felon in possession of a firearm charge that is commonly deployed against defendants.

McDowell’s mental health issues likely affected his plea deal. But by and large, raising mental health issues hasn’t worked for many Muslim defendants facing federal terrorism charges. There are a few exceptions: Adel Daoud, an 18-year-old arrested in an FBI sting in Chicago in 2012, still hasn’t been tried, because a judge ruled that his belief in “lizard people” and his “pervasive belief that the Court and the prosecution are members of the Illuminati and that his attorneys are Freemasons” significantly undermined his rational understanding of the court proceedings. Daoud, who has been housed at the Bureau of Prisons’ federal medical center in North Carolina, has another competency hearing scheduled this month.

Mike German, a former FBI agent now with the Brennan Center for Justice, said the issue isn’t necessarily that white defendants are treated too gently, but that the fearmongering about radical Islamic terrorism has made it impossible for anyone to consider the actual circumstances in cases involving Muslim defendants.

“There has been such an effort to drum up fear of Muslim terrorism that it’s hard for these authorities to look at a Muslim person charged with terrorism the same way they would look at a white person,” German told HuffPost.

“It’s a whole-of-society issue, not just an FBI issue,” he said. “Because judges and juries are susceptible to the fearmongering regarding Muslim terrorism, it’s hard for them to make objective decisions about the threat these people actually pose.”

German says judges and juries are more willing to hear out complaints about government conduct in cases that don’t involve Muslim defendants accused of terrorism. Members of the Christian Hutaree militia, for example, had their most serious charges dismissed by a federal judge who rebuked the government for its conduct in the sting case.

“You don’t see that kind of analysis by judges in cases where there are Muslim subjects,” German said. “Quite the opposite ― you have the Newburgh sting case, where a judge acknowledged that only the government could’ve turned the main defendant into a terrorist because he was such a buffoon, and yet found him guilty and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.” The judge in that sting case, which involved defendants from Newburgh, New York, said she believed “beyond a shadow of a doubt that there would have been no crime here except the government instigated it, planned it and brought it to fruition.”

German said he believes that in the terrorism realm, the government goes after individuals who they know have mental health issues.

“You look at the cases where people who don’t have two nickels to rub together are given military-grade explosives and Stinger missiles and provided with room and shelter while the nascent plot is being driven,” German said.

As for McDowell, his guilty plea last Monday received little attention in a busy news week. The U.S. Attorney’s Office put out a statement two days after McDowell’s guilty plea, but the development received no national Justice Department press release, as it likely would have if McDowell had been facing terrorism charges. A federal prosecutor said the U.S. Attorney’s Office could revisit HuffPost’s questions about the case after McDowell’s sentencing, which hasn’t been scheduled.
