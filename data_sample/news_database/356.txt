WASHINGTON ― Republicans have said bonus and raise announcements by companies like Walmart and Humana show that the GOP tax agenda is already boosting worker pay as advertised.

But Republicans had not promised there would be a scattered series of bonus announcements less than a month after President Donald Trump signed the tax bill into law. They said the bill’s corporate tax benefits would trickle down to workers over the long term.

Kevin Hassett, the top economic adviser to the president, provided the intellectual underpinning for the idea that corporate tax cuts would benefit workers in an October paper. Hassett argued that workers would earn at least $4,000 more per year as a result of corporations investing in new equipment that makes workers more productive, which would in turn make them more valuable.

“Effectively, reductions in the corporate tax rate incentivize corporations to pursue additional capital investments as their cost declines,” Hassett wrote. “Standard economic theory implies that the result of more productive and more sought-after labor is an increase in the price of labor, or worker wages.”

Hassett described the wage effects as “long-run outcomes,” not something that would happen right away. Economists generally agree that corporate tax cuts can benefit workers, though not as much as Hassett has claimed, and not as quickly as Republicans are now suggesting.

“It takes a long time,” Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said in an interview. “You don’t instantaneously get wage increases.”

Boeing, AT&T and Wells Fargo announced in December they would give their workers bonuses and pay raises specifically because of the tax reform that had been signed days earlier. If it wasn’t really because of tax reform, then why would they say it was?

“The cynical explanation is they have political motives,” Gleckman said, noting that AT&T needs the government to approve its acquisition of Time Warner. Boeing is a government contractor, and the Trump administration last year suggested it might reconsider fraud penalties imposed on Wells Fargo.

““This is opportunistic timing. The labor market’s gotten tighter. That causes employers to be nicer to employees.”” - Gregg Polsky, University of Georgia

Those are just three of several dozens of raise or bonus announcements that Republicans have been tracking, which could affect 2 million workers, or about 1.2 percent of the labor force. Republicans have amplified the message, which seems to cut against the wide array of expert analyses finding the tax bill benefits the rich more than the working class, not to mention the statements from corporate executives about using their tax windfall to buy back stock.

Tax bill aside, with unemployment plunging to 4.1 percent, there are fewer workers desperate for jobs, so employers are going to have to offer higher wages in order to attract and retain employees. The economy is at or near what economists call “full employment,” which is the lowest level of joblessness that doesn’t lead to price inflation. So companies that might have planned to raise wages anyway can put out a press release crediting Republican policies and at least get a pat on the back.

“This is public relations,” said Gregg Polsky, a tax professor at the University of Georgia. “This is opportunistic timing. The labor market’s gotten tighter. That causes employers to be nicer to employees.”

Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), who was closely involved in drafting the tax bill, called the spate of bonus and raise announcements “icing on the cake.”

“To give the employers credit, a lot of them are recognizing, ‘Look, this is so significant for us, we’ve got to make sure at the very beginning we’re communicating broadly there’s a benefit for our employees,’” Roskam told HuffPost.

Roskam did not credit the possibility that companies are using the tax bill for publicity. “If you starting chasing that type of cynicism, it’s very unsatisfying and it never ends,” he said.

It would make more sense to gauge possible impact of the tax bill by looking at what companies are spending on equipment or capital goods, said Dean Baker, a labor expert with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.

“For their story to hold true, we should be seeing a very quick upturn in investment,” Baker said. The government’s data on nondefense capital goods orders for the month of December will come out on Jan. 26, and January data will be available late next month.

Another way of making Baker’s point: People should evaluate the policy by looking at data instead of at anecdotes.

This week, Humana announced bonuses and raises of an unspecified amount for an unspecified number of its employees. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hailed the news from the Senate floor, and a press release from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) called it the “Human(a) Face of Tax Reform.”

Spokespeople for the company did not respond to a HuffPost inquiry about whether the tax bill had led the company to reconsider laying off 5.7 percent of its workforce, or about 2,700 workers, which the firm announced it was doing in November.

According to the running tally kept by Scalise’s office, nearly 200 companies have announced bonuses and increased compensation specifically because of the tax bill.

“A business restructuring due to individual company performance is an entirely separate issue than having an influx of unexpected savings from tax reform that can be pumped back directly to their workforce,” Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine said.

Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) represents the Louisville area where Humana has its headquarters.

“What they’re doing with the bonuses is a small percentage of what they save from the tax cuts,” Yarmuth said. “I’m glad the workers are getting more money, but I’m not sure it will last.”Jordan Klepper of the “The Opposition” wants to help President Donald Trump’s legal team turn up the heat.

The lack of power can be particularly hard for schoolchildren trying to learn with the sweltering heat of the Caribbean and no air conditioning. But the wait for electricity recently ended for Academia Bautista de Puerto Nuevo (ABPN), a private school in San Juan.

A video of teachers running out of classrooms in disbelief and students jumping and screaming in celebration of getting back power back after 112 days was posted on the school’s Facebook page last week.

“After 112 days, THE POWER IS BACK!” the school wrote in the video caption. “Undisputed joy from all of us who make up ABPN. We thank all of the parents, students and staff who have stayed and continued to support us throughout this situation.”

Hurricane Maria knocked out most of the U.S. territory’s decades-old power grid in September, leaving millions of citizens without electricity to run homes, hospitals or schools. While some areas have gradually started getting power again, according to government data, at least 36 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority subscribers are still without electricity.

ABPN’s bittersweet video went viral this week, and people have noted how truly heartbreaking the joyous video is when you think of what the kids and teachers have gone through.

The Twitter accounts of two former Fox News hosts were hacked on Tuesday, resulting in both of their feeds being filled with Turkish propaganda supporting the country’s controversial president.

The hackers tweeted and sent direct messages from the accounts of Eric Bolling and Greta Van Susteren. Bolling left Fox News last year and Van Susteren left Fox News in 2016, going to MSNBC for a few months in 2017. Both are among the exclusive group of 45 accounts that President Donald Trump follows on Twitter.

During the breach, hackers shared a screenshot of what appeared to be Bolling’s direct messages. They also sent messages to Trump from Van Susteren’s account.

Both accounts were restored within several hours, but not before Twitter users and journalists saved the tweets.

Van Susteren hosted the popular Fox News show “On the Record” for 14 years before she was booted from the network in September 2016 after a reported contract dispute. Her dismissal came months after former network CEO Roger Ailes resigned in light of numerous sexual harassment allegations.

Bolling, also a longtime Fox News host and co-anchor of “The Five,” was ousted from the network in September after HuffPost reported that he sent unsolicited photos of male genital to three of his colleagues.

The screenshot of Bolling’s direct messages show only a portion of the last message sent in an exchange with other Twitter users. At least one message featured a cellphone number.

From Van Susteren’s account, hackers appeared to have sent a direct message to Trump asking him to share a propaganda video from his personal account.

While under the hacker’s control, Bolling and Van Susteren’s accounts shared messages in support of the Turkish government and President Tayyip Erdogan.

One such message, written in Turkish, read: “You are hacked by the Turkish cyber army Ayyildiz Tim! We got your DM correspondence! We will show you the power of the Turk!”

“We love the Turks and Muslims in the world,” another tweet, shared on Van Susteren’s account, read. “We condemn those who persecute them, especially in the United States, and we share their suffering . We love turkish soldiers , we love Erdogan, we love Turkey.”

I announced yesterday that I would not be attending the State of the Union this year. I join other distinguished members, including Rep. John Lewis, in refusing to dignify a president who has used the platform of the Oval Office to fan the flames of racism, sexism and hatred — most recently with his vulgar condemnation of Haiti and other African countries.

As a member of Congress, my highest responsibility is to advance the interests of the 7th District, our nation as a whole and our global community with which we are now so inarguably interconnected. If I felt that attending the State of the Union advanced us, I would absolutely be there.

My analysis, however, is that my highest contribution — in these extraordinary times and circumstances where President Trump is himself breaking all established precedents to serve very narrow and self-serving interests — is to stand up to declare that I profoundly disagree with his approach and his unacceptable behavior. His path is dangerous. His path is destructive. His path cannot be normalized. I will not normalize it. This is our own form of nonviolent resistance, a path advocated for by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday we just celebrated yesterday but whose lessons we must continue to incorporate.

This president has consistently indicated that he has no interest in leading a unified country. He has gone out of his way to play to a small and shrinking base of voters by using language that diminishes and demeans vast swaths of people in our own country and around the world. He does and says things that none of us, as parents, would condone for our children. He consistently uses language that is outright racist. He actively uses the highest office of the land to promote hatred as a political tool for his own benefit.

My constituents and people across the country are heartbroken, terrified and demoralized. It is hard to express how deeply scarring the president’s words are to them and their families. As a brown immigrant female member of Congress, I feel the impact of these words personally, as well as collectively.

In my career standing up for civil, immigrant and human rights, I have also been steadfast in listening to those who disagree with me and in building “unlikely alliances,” even on controversial issues such as immigration. Even in this divided Congress, I work with conservative members, co-chairing a new members coalition on immigration with Republican Rep. Roger Marshall from Kansas. I have introduced several bipartisan bills with Republican members of Congress who I have many disagreements with, but find things on which we agree to work together. My refusal to attend the State of the Union, then, is not about policy differences — of which I have many. I would attend a State of the Union by a president with whom I disagree if I felt she or he was otherwise respectful and adhered to basic moral values or basic tenets of civility and respect.

However, this president has gone beyond the pale, over and over again reaching new lows in his leadership of this country that I love. I cannot and will not reward him as he pushes a self-centered agenda that hurts the district I represent, endangers our country’s struggles for unity and abdicates any moral authority that the rest of the world has accorded to America in the past. I hope that there will come a time soon when Republicans who I respect will also understand that to be silent is to be complicit. History has always judged silence and complicity harshly in these times of moral consequence.

Civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rep. John Lewis fought hard to move our nation forward on civil rights. Courageous women like Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells fought for women to have the rights we have today. And throughout the course of history, here and abroad, men and women have died to stand up against despots, dictators and those who sought to pursue paths of ethnic cleansing. Our job today is to honor those who came before us by refusing to go backward. Our job today is to stand clearly for a moral center that this president has shunned.Legendary ballet dancer Raven Wilkinson with ballerina Misty Copeland in 2015. J. Countess via Getty Images

A new children’s book honors the historic career of Raven Wilkinson, who is widely credited as the first African-American ballerina to dance with a major touring troupe.

Trailblazer: The Story of Ballerina Raven Wilkinson begins with a forward from ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who has called Wilkinson her mentor, and ends with a letter from Wilkinson herself. The book, which was released Tuesday, looks at the dancer’s legendary career and how she opened doors for future performers.

Illustrations and prose show that Wilkinson, who was born in 1935, always knew she was meant to dance. She made history in 1955, when she became the first black ballerina to sign with the touring company Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She danced with the troupe for six years and gained prestige performing in roles such as the solo waltz in “Les Sylphides.” Even after retiring from ballet, Wilkinson continued performing as a character dancer and actor until 2011.

But while touring, the New York native also experienced a type of overt racism with which she was unfamiliar. Wilkinson was in danger whenever the troupe moved through the South during the Jim Crow era. She recounted some of those moments in an interview with Pointe magazine in 2014.

“I remember one time in Montgomery, Alabama, the tour bus rolled into town, and everyone was running around with white robes and hoods on,” she told the publication. “They stopped traffic, there were so many of them. There was a rapping sound on the bus door, and this man jumped on in his hood and gown. Several big strapping male company dancers got up and moved toward him. He threw a fistful of racist pamphlets all over the bus before they chased him out.”

Trailblazer follows Wilkinson’s career, which included stints with the Dutch National Ballet in the Netherlands and the New York City Opera, and ends with a scene of her presenting Copeland with flowers following the young dancer’s debut in “Swan Lake” ― closing with the idea that Copeland will continue what Wilkinson began.

In 2015, Copeland became the first African-American ballerina to be a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. She has also written three books, including a children’s book inspired by her relationship with Wilkerson.

Copeland has said she looks to Wilkinson as an inspiration and as a sign that things can still be changed in the world of ballet.President Donald Trump may be in overall good health, but on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” host Trevor Noah posed one question to the White House’s official physician, Ronny Jackson: “No heart problems, no dementia, no dentures… but did you test for racism?”James Gunn, director of the two “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, is offering $100,000 if President Donald Trump will step on a scale.

Gunn’s unusual proposition came hours after White House doctor Ronny Jackson said on Tuesday that the president was 6′3″ and weighed 239 pounds, or one pound shy of the level that would be considered obese.

The filmmaker and other Trump critics didn’t buy it. Mocking Trump’s involvement in the debunked “birther” conspiracy theory that claimed President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States, Twitter users created the #Girther hashtag to question Jackson’s claims.

Some even demanded to see Trump’s #GirthCertificate.

I will give 100 thousand dollars to Trump's favorite charity if he will step on an accurate scale with an impartial medical professional, okayed by both of us. For real. #Girther #GirtherMovement — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) January 17, 2018

Gunn’s bounty echoed Trump’s 2012 offer of $5 million to charity if Obama would release his college transcripts. When asked what charity Trump might pick, Gunn replied:

I would be afraid that it's the Ku Klux Klan but there's no way in hell he's 239 pounds, so I don't have to worry about it. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) January 17, 2018

Gunn made it clear that his offer wasn’t about body-shaming the president:

This has nothing to do with fat shaming. It has to do with a continuous pattern of fabricating facts by both Trump and his administration. https://t.co/88Jw1pGLfe — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) January 17, 2018

For good measure, Gunn also shared images of others for comparison, including this one:

Is it any wonder communication in the bedroom can be difficult at times?

But at least we can have a laugh at the expense of these brave folks who didn’t mind dishing on national television about the duration of their nooky.

Host Jimmy Kimmel said the segment was inspired by a recent survey in which women said sex should last 25 minutes 51 seconds, and men said 25 minutes 43 seconds.

One fellow told the “Kimmel” interviewer that sex with his wife could be as little as 1 minute ― points for honesty, dude, especially since his spouse gave him credit for 15 minutes.Thomas Brennan addresses Larry Nassar in court. Scott Olson via Getty Images

A coach who sent more than 100 girls to Larry Nassar for medical treatment told the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor to “go to hell” in court Wednesday.

Thomas Brennan, a former gymnastics coach, attended Nassar’s second day of sentencing in East Lansing, Michigan. Nassar abused many of the young women Brennan coached.

Brennan stood next to a gymnast he used to coach, Gwen Anderson, as she gave an emotional victim impact statement in court.

“I am a middle school teacher and I teach kids,” said Anderson, who decided at the last minute to break her anonymity and read her statement herself. “Every single day I am reminded how young and defenseless we were when Larry Nassar assaulted us. ... We were just kids.”

Nassar, 54, has sat through dozens of victim impact statements since Tuesday morning, often times openly weeping. During Anderson’s statement, however, Nassar didn’t seem to be listening as he scribbled notes in a notebook.

“Look at her!” Brennan yelled at Nassar during the young survivor’s statement.

After Anderson finished, Brennan looked Nassar directly in the face and said, “For the record, go to hell.” When Judge Rosemarie Aquilina asked if Brennan would like to add anything, the former gymnastics coach stepped up to the mic.

“I’ve probably sent well over 100 kids to him over the years. So the guilt I feel for that is hard to fathom,” said Brennan, who is currently an exercise physiologist. “He didn’t only deceive these girls ― which is, honest to God, that’s the worst of the worst is what he did to these girls. ... But what you did to everybody else who trusted you and sent girls your way is disgusting, reprehensible, unforgivable.”

Brennan thanked Aquilina for letting him speak, and added that “it’s more about her,” gesturing to Anderson.

Aquilina, who has spoken after every survivor’s impact statement, reminded Brennan that the “blame lies solely with the defendant.”

More than any other current sex abuse claim in Hollywood, the recent Aziz Ansari scandal seems to have flamed up passions surrounding what consent is and is not. Straight men and more women than I’d like to admit (looking at you, Ashleigh Banfield) are crying foul on the star’s accuser, who has admitted to oral sex with him just before she claims he crossed the line.

To be fair, this situation is a little murkier than those of Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey. In those cases, there seemed to be an almost predatory approach to systematically assaulting their accusers. With Ansari, however, there doesn’t seem to be ― on the surface anyway ― any real intent to abuse. He found himself in a situation, like many men, where he claims (in hindsight) he was unable to accurately read his partner’s willingness to engage sexually. I can’t say I’m shocked.

We’ve done such a piss-poor job of educating our nation’s kids when it comes to sexual health overall, it really isn’t surprising that Ansari, like most men who have sex with women, has as much trouble spotting consent as they have spotting a clitoris. Although, speaking as a man whose never actually seen a vagina in his life, neither is that hard to find when you’re actually looking for them. So, I’d like to give some advice to Ansari, and all the other straight men out there who don’t know what went wrong here and would like to avoid the mess the Master of None star is currently in. My advice? Have sex like you’re gay! And no, I’m not talking about back door stuff.

Now it should go without saying that all gay men aren’t the same and some do things that others wouldn’t. Defining consent is an issue within all communities and the gay world is no exception. But there are certain norms within the gay community that when followed, may make for a more “woke” dating and sexual experience than you’re used to. Besides, if you’re honestly expecting anyone, anywhere to speak with absolute authority for an entire demographic of individuals, then the internet probably isn’t for you.

You can read Ansari’s accuser’s full interview of what she claims happened at babe.net. According to the woman, who asked to be referred to as Grace, the encounter started with a date ― a rather short one.

“Grace says she sensed Ansari was eager for them to leave. “When the waiter came over he quickly asked for the check and he said like, ’Let’s get off this boat.” She recalls there was still wine in her glass and more left in the bottle he ordered. The abruptness surprised her. “Like, he got the check and then it was bada-boom, bada-bing, we’re out of there.”

Advice from a gay guy: I’m always talking about how necessary it is for gay men to be upfront with their prospective partners in order to have fulfilling sex lives. There are so many scenes and types of sex gay men can have together, it’s not uncommon to get your desires and expectations for sex out in the open before the first date so you know whether you’re even compatible. Personally, I haven’t walked into a date in years where I didn’t already know what kind of sex my date liked to have, how often they like to have it, and what their sexual expectations were for that very night. If Grace’s account of the evening is to be believed, it’s obvious, to me anyways, that Ansari was angling to get physical without having clearly stated his intentions.

Now, I know what you’re saying: “If you can pick up on the fact that Aziz wanted to have sex, shouldn’t she have been expected to?” Umm, no. And that’s a slippery slope to go down. Never assume what your partner “thinks” your intentions are. People come from very personal points of view when it comes to sex. Taking an invitation to dinner is not a yes. Wearing a short skirt is not a yes. Going home with you is not a yes. In short, nothing means yes except yes! You may also be saying, “Women aren’t men. There’s no way I could be that frank without being slapped across the face.” First off, man that sucks. I’m so happy I only have to worry about sex with men. Secondly, I’m not recommending you go out into the world and start continue sending dick pics to random women and asking them their favorite positions. That’s literally sexual harassment. Duh!

Consent begins with communication. Be clear and honest about your expectations and you can’t go wrong. If you need a practical tip, try asking your date at what point during relationships do they prefer to begin physical intimacy? Easy, right? Now let’s say she responds by saying she usually has sex on the first date. Does that mean she’s consented to sex with you? Nope! Not even close. Remember, nothing means yes except yes. And why should you have to do all the guess work anyways? It’s the 21st century. Make her work (for half the pay). Let her come halfway before you even think about making a move.

Imagine where Ansari would be now had he chosen to express his desire to get physical with his date before heading back to his place after dinner? She’d have had ample opportunity to voice her reservations, state her limits or even gleefully pull a strip of condoms from her purse and shout “woohoo” into the night sky. Or, whatever women do when they want to have sex. I have no clue.

Back to Grace’s story. Shortly after the two arrive at Ansari’s apartment, they began kissing and eventually had oral sex. As she describes this encounter in the article, she talks about how uncomfortable she was with moving so fast. She explains that while she gave no verbal protests, she did send off a fair amount of nonverbal cues, which she continued to do throughout her time in the apartment. So she didn’t say “no.” It’s all her fault, right? Nope again!

Advice from a gay guy: There’s been a lot of talk about nonverbal cues because of this accusation. “What are they? How can anyone expect to read them accurately?” You “straighties” crack me up. Gay men (minus George Takei) are used to picking up on nonverbal cues, because there was a time when they were literally all we had. In fact, depending on where you live in this world, that time has yet to pass. Paying attention to our prospective partner’s nonverbal cues was the only way you knew they were gay and wanted to engage in sex. One thing I’ve noticed is that in heterosexual dating there are far too many assumptions about what your partner wants or doesn’t want. In the gay world, we rarely assume anything about sex with someone.

Look, I’m not going to sugar coat this: communication is a two-way street. In an ideal world, Grace would have felt the confidence and safety in her situation to be more vocal about what she was feeling, but let’s not confuse one person’s responsibility with another’s. Sex is a 50/50 game. Or, 25/25/25/25, depending on whether there’s a pride event in town. If you notice that the sexual encounter you’re in the midst of has been initiated by you alone, then you should take a moment to check in with your partner and make sure that you, in fact, have their consent. Just because someone doesn’t claw your eyes out doesn’t mean they want to have sex with you.

This next part is where things get a bit more confusing. After they engaged in oral sex, Grace claims she told Ansari that she didn’t want to go any further after he said he was going to grab a condom. But he continued to pressure her. This took the form of following her closely around the apartment every time she moved. Putting his fingers in her mouth before grabbing at her genitals, and placing her hand on his penis repeatedly even after she continued pulling it away. One exchange recounted by Grace is particularly telling. It occurred after she claims Ansari kept asking her where in the apartment she wanted to have sex?

“I wasn’t really even thinking of that, I didn’t want to be engaged in that with him. But he kept asking, so I said, ‘Next time.’ And he goes, ‘Oh, you mean second date?’ and I go, ‘Oh, yeah, sure,’ and he goes, ’Well, if I poured you another glass of wine now, would it count as our second date?” After this, Grace excused herself to the bathroom where she pulled herself together and then came back out and said to Ansari “…I don’t want to feel forced because then I’ll hate you, and I’d rather not hate you.”

Advice from a gay guy: To make my backdoor analogy once more, frankly speaking, anal sex hurts. At least a little, every time. Picking up on cues from your partner that they’re constantly engaged and enjoying sex is second nature to many gay men, who have all had moments where they’ve asked to participate in, or asked to stop in the middle of, what started out as consensual sex. Aside from having literally no game, Ansari seemed to be ignoring fairly clear signs that Grace was not in the mood for any further sexual contact.

One of the sketchier arguments I saw repeated time and again to discredit “Grace” was that she had already engaged in oral sex with Ansari before the point at which she claims she was assaulted. Let’s be very clear, at any point during any sexual encounter, your partner has the right to want to stop. If you persist, despite her urging you to stop, then you my friend are now committing sexual assault. And any activity you have or have not engaged in previously does not matter! It’s not just me who says so. Every state in the country, minus Mississippi, have laws on the book that reflect this view of rape. And honestly, do we really want Mississippi taking the lead on anything?Reddit has an entire “Shower Thoughts” subreddit dedicated to “the miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.” In honor of those weird, wonderful and sometimes profound musings, here are 25 of the best posts from the last week:“The rest of the road trip, I think through Ohio up to Michigan, we were fighting so bad we both lost our voice because we were screaming at each other on the motorcycle,” she said. “And I refused to hold onto him, so I held onto the back of the motorcycle, like a boss.”

Glamour said the article had the correct Anna K. on the magazine’s site, so this mishap appears to be on Yahoo (which is owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath).

“Yahoo produces its own original content and it curates content from partners,” said Lori Bongiorno, head of Yahoo Lifestyle and Entertainment. The Anna Kournikova story “came in via a partner feed and the wrong image was pulled in when it was ingested. This was a technical glitch, not human error.”“Stranger Things” star David Harbour will go to great lengths to please fans.

The actor, who plays police Chief Jim Hopper in Netflix’s sci-fi series, joined a high school student in California for her senior photos last week after her Twitter request went viral.

Now, he’s promised to get ordained to officiate Twitter user @ErickaElizabth’s September nuptials, after her plea was retweeted 125,000 times.

What would it take to get @DavidKHarbour to be the Officiant at my wedding in September?! — Ericka (@ErickaElizabth) January 15, 2018

Harbour did add a few caveats to his involvement in the ceremony, however. Mainly, the date has to fit with his shooting schedule for the third season of “Stranger Things.”

And he has to be handed the very first piece of wedding cake.

Harbour’s post reached the 125,000 mark late Wednesday, and he immediately reached out to @ErickaElizabth to “get the ball rolling.”

Dammit. Not even 24hours. You’re kidding me. @ErickaElizabth DM me please to get the ball rolling. I’m making it seriously hard next time, internet, this is not over between us... https://t.co/Ht0kDCl5hz — David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) January 18, 2018

“I’m making it seriously hard next time, internet, this is not over between us,” he added. For reference, here’s how Harbour’s previous promise to a fan on Twitter turned out:

Here’s a distraction the New England Patriots may not need as they prepare to face the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday in the AFC Championship: Their newly acquired linebacker, James Harrison, posted a photo Tuesday of an AK-47-style gun that appears to be customized for him.

“That new Deebo Draco,” Harrison wrote of the semi-automatic firearm, which bears his uniform number, 92, and the brand logo for his “Deebo” nickname.

A post shared by James Harrison (@jhharrison92) on Jan 16, 2018 at 12:06pm PST

Neither Harrison nor the Patriots immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Harrison’s affection for guns has been chronicled before. The hard-hitting veteran star, who was acquired by the Patriots in December after he was cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers, once told Men’s Journal that the best way to stop campus shootings is to arm all teachers and students. A photo of a shirtless Harrison posing with two guns topped the article.

“It is a ridiculous image for kids to see,” ESPN wrote in 2011 of the picture.

Harrison admitted to police in March 2008 that he broke down a bedroom door, slapped his girlfriend in the face and broke her cellphone during an argument, but charges were dropped when he entered a counseling program.

Forget for a moment what James Harrison said. Picture in Men's Journal of him brandishing two guns Exhibit A for worst possible NFL image. — Paul Schwartz (@NYPost_Schwartz) July 13, 2011

Harrison’s photo of the Draco invited backlash (and some admirers).

“This is not necessary!!” one Instagram user wrote. “What kind of example you’re setting?!..Smh”

“Dumbass glorifying guns,” another said.

One responder referenced the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. “This is the musket the founders had in mind right? SMH”

AdvertisementAdam Rippon is using his new, history-making platform to resist the Trump administration’s anti-LGBTQ agenda.

“I don’t think he has a real concept of reality,” Rippon said. “To stand by some of the things that [President] Donald Trump has said and for Mike Pence to say he’s a devout Christian man is completely contradictory. If he’s okay with what’s being said about people and Americans and foreigners and about different countries that are being called ‘shitholes,’ I think he should really go to church.”

Rippon said his skating obligations could prevent him from encountering Pence during a meet-and-greet prior to the opening ceremony. Still, he’s vowed not to “go out of his way” to make it happen, even if he finds the time.

A post shared by Adam Rippon (@adaripp) on Jan 10, 2018 at 2:48pm PST

“If it were before my event, I would absolutely not go out of my way to meet somebody who I felt has gone out of their way to not only show that they aren’t a friend of a gay person but that they think that they’re sick,” he said, pointing to Pence’s reported support of ex-gay “conversion” therapy while serving in Congress.

Though Rippon hasn’t ruled out a post-Olympics meeting with Pence because he “seems more mild-mannered” than Trump, he stressed that the vice president “doesn’t stand for anything that I really believe in.”

Rippon’s comments on Pence come days after the athlete denounced Trump for his use of vulgar and discriminatory language.

“If I talked to people the way that President Trump talks to people,” Rippon told the BBC, “my mom would kick my ass.”

By now, many of us have read Babe.net’s published account of a date between “Grace,” an anonymous 23-year-old photographer, and actor Aziz Ansari. You’ve also likely read counter-articles further pitting two individuals against one another ranging in accusations and claims ― she was assaulted; she wasn’t assaulted; he was inconsiderate and pushy; he isn’t a mind reader. Rather than this being an opportunity to listen, learn, and shift culture, we are yet again contributing to stereotypes and furthering the divide.

Should you have missed the story, Babe describes a 2017 date between Grace and Ansari in which he ignored her verbal and nonverbal attempts to stop. After the date, Grace texted Ansari telling him that she was uncomfortable with the experience, and he apologized. Babe published screenshots of the text exchange and the updated piece now includes Ansari’s statement confirming their exchange and reiterating his support for the #MeToo movement.

Cue the backlash.

Instead of having honest conversations about consent, language, and how deeply personal and situational sexual encounters are, we find ourselves in a position of picking sides, victim shaming, and misunderstanding.

As Jezebel Culture Editor, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, points out, “Because Babe did not have the range or depth to present Grace’s story for what it is—a starting point to discuss the ways consent can feel blurring, no matter how clear we might wish it were, and our lack of language to describe this—we all ended up opening up a conversation that did us no good at all.”

The focus on whether or not to label Ansari as a sexual assailant feels like a step backwards, giving fuel those who look to discredit women and force them to defend their experiences, as well as ignoring what we should be talking about: sex, miseducation, and misogyny in the bedroom.

As a young woman, I have had my share of uncomfortable encounters and downright terrifying situations. I have been guilted into sex, been drugged, felt pressure or expectations of what it meant to be dating, and am continuously learning how and when to be bolder, louder, and more confident in what I want. And I am learning how to do that by listening to storytellers, having uncomfortable or “taboo” conversations, and exploring my personal sexual boundaries.

I have no interest in forcing Grace, or any other person who has felt violated or mistreated, to defend their actions or thought process. I am not concerned with what Grace was wearing or what wine she chose. Because that’s missing the point. What we must talk about is sex, where we learn about it, and how we learn to communicate our boundaries. And frankly, that can shift in every single situation.

There is a scene in the Devil Wears Prada where Simon Baker’s character, Christian, goes on a date with Anne Hathaway’s character, Andy, while they are both in Paris for Fashion Week. There is flirtation and chemistry between the two characters. They are walking on a charming, safe street where the trees are covered in tiny white lights. The music is playful and curious. He kisses her. She kisses back, but stops to say, “I can’t, I’m sorry but I can’t.” She explains that she just broke up with her boyfriend. Christian kisses her again. Andy stops again and says she has had too much wine, that her judgement is impaired. He gently puts his hand on her chin and tips her face to kiss him again. She stops him, this time saying, “I barely know you, I’m in a strange city.” He kisses her... again. She finally tell him she is out of excuses, and Christian replies, “Thank God.”

@YouTube

I bring up this scene because it exemplifies the mixed messages heterosexual men and women have received about how they should act in a potential sexual encounter. Rather than stopping at the first verbal “no,” men are encouraged to chase and convince women to just give in. In fact, it’s this domination and characterization of men as strong and powerful that has been engrained in our brains and continues to fuel the very patriarchy that movements like #MeToo are trying to dismantle.

For too long, girls and women have learned to put others first, to please and smile, and not talk back. Rather than learning how to feel confident and strong in sexual encounters, many of us have learned our boundaries through a lifelong series of trial and error. If someone shoves their fingers in my mouth while we are semi-naked, I can’t tell you with 100% certainty if I will like it or dislike it. I can assume, but I won’t know how I will feel until it happens with that specific individual.

That’s the thing about sex. It isn’t binary. It isn’t black and white. It is full of shades and nuances that may feel completely different with each sexual partner. What feels safe with one person may feel uncomfortable or unsatisfying with another. What feels fun or expected when you are 17 is likely to change by the time you’re 35. Much like a resume that lists jobs you would will likely never work at again but hopefully gained something positive from, one’s sexual history is a never-ending lesson of what feels good, bad, safe, unsafe, wanted, or unwanted.

From ordinary to extreme, our sexual encounters provide opportunity to learn and grow. We have the chance, and a responsibility, to create a culture where boys and men are taught that sex in real life is not the same as porn and should not be pursued like one. A culture where girls and women are not viewed as a reward to be won or dominated. Now is the time to make clear that sexual assault is NOT a “women’s” issue.

To the young man who kept hushing me while physically tried to spread open my legs in college ― stop assuming you can change a woman’s mind when she says no. To the man who yelled at me when I said, “thanks but my girlfriend and I are leaving now” ― women don’t owe you sexual favors in exchange for conversation. (Also, not all women identify as heterosexual.) To the men who feel uncomfortable right now ― rather than sink away or ignore it, please join the conversation with curiosity, compassion, and sincerity.

Ending rape culture means putting an end to victim shaming and embracing a person’s feelings with openness and empathy. It means listening and learning about sex, boundaries, and consent. Ending rape culture means increased education around sexuality, gratification, and how to communicate our feelings and expectations. It means exploring sex through a different lens - one that can shift media, politics, and pop culture - where honest communication before, during, and after sexual encounters isn’t an anomaly.“Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” is back and ready to push boundaries once again.

The reality TV series, which ran on Bravo from 2003 to 2007, returns to Netflix next month in a hotly anticipated reboot. Simply called “Queer Eye,” the new version aims to please fans of the original by helping straight men refine their wardrobes, cultural pursuits and home décor once more.

This time, however, the action takes place in Atlanta (which, the producers are quick to tout, is in the red state of Georgia) rather than New York. In keeping with the times, the new version is taking extra steps to be socially conscious, with nods to the LGBTQ community’s recent advances (and setbacks), the Black Lives Matter movement and more.

The queer men leading the makeovers are: Antoni Porowski (food & wine), Bobby Berk (interior design), Karamo Brown (culture), Jonathan Van Ness (grooming) and Tan France (fashion).

Series creator David Collins told Entertainment Weekly in December that he is excited for a new generation of viewers to discover “Queer Eye.”

“The millennials don’t remember the old show,” he said. “It’s got such a great heart and soul and humor to it, so I’m excited for a new audience.”

As to how “Queer Eye” will differ from its Emmy-winning predecessor, he added, “If the original round was about tolerance, this time it is about acceptance.”

Queer Eye hits Netflix Feb. 7.Sometimes, what goes around does not come around: Take Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson, for example.

After Jackson’s breast was accidentally exposed during their 2004 Super Bowl halftime performance, her career suffered, while Timberlake went on to release one of his bestselling albums of all time.

As Timberlake prepares to return to the Super Bowl halftime show in February, days after his new album “Man of the Woods” is set to drop, the performer is reflecting on his previous appearance on the stage.

“Naturally, that’s something we talked about,” Timberlake, 36, told Beats 1’s Zane Lowe, referring to Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction,” in his first public interview for his new album.

“To be honest, it wasn’t too much of a conversation,” he continued. “It’s just one of those things where you go, like, ‘Yeah, what do you want me to say? We’re not going to do that again!’”

Many believe Jackson was unfairly punished after the now-infamous TV moment dubbed “nipplegate.” MTV claimed the singer “engineered” the stunt, although Jackson and Timberlake admitted they agreed on a version of the costume reveal at the final rehearsal. They intended for the move to expose just Jackson’s red bra, but her breast was exposed when Timberlake inadvertently ripped off the bra as well.

After the uproar, Jackson allegedly was uninvited from that year’s Grammy Awards, and her music videos were blacklisted.

“I stumbled through it, to be quite honest,” Timberlake said of the scandal.

He added: “I had my wires crossed and it’s just something that you have to look back on and go like, OK, well you know, you can’t change what’s happened, but you can move forward and learn from it.”

The former NYSNC singer and Jackson didn’t speak for a period after the incident, but he said they’ve since made peace.

“I don’t know that a lot of people know that,” he explained. “I don’t think it’s my job to do that, because you value the relationships that you do have with people.”

While the Super Bowl scandal clearly isn’t his favorite topic of conversation, Timberlake has addressed the backlash before. In a 2006 interview with MTV, he admitted that he “got 10 percent of the blame,” while Jackson shouldered the rest.

“I think America is harsher on women,” Timberlake said at the time. “I think America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people.”

“I’m a part of a community that consider themselves artists,” he continued. “And if there’s something that I could have done in her defense, that was more, that I could have realized, then I would have.”

Jackson, who recently completed a cross-country tour, has yet to comment on Timberlake’s return to the Super Bowl.Russell M. Nelson, 93, the new president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, greets family members after a press conference on Tuesday in Salt Lake City. George Frey via Getty Images

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has officially named Russell M. Nelson as its 17th president.

Speaking to reporters at a news conference, Nelson characterized his selection as “sacred and humbling.”

He also paid tribute to his predecessor, Thomas Monson, who died at the age of 90 on Jan. 2. He had served as president since 2008.

“No words can do justice to the magnitude and magnificence of his life,” Nelson said.

At 93, Nelson is the second-oldest person in the 187-year-old church’s history to become president.

Watch a recording of the announcement below.

Nelson has been temporarily presiding over the church since his predecessor’s death. He was ordained for his new position during a religious ceremony on Sunday.

The president of the Mormon church is believed to be a living prophet able to receive divine revelations from God. Succession is based strictly on seniority. Nelson was the longest-serving member of a church body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which meant that he was next in line for the role of president. He became part of the Quorum in 1984.

During the broadcast, Nelson announced that he had chosen two counselors to stand beside him in the First Presidency, the church’s highest governing body. As First Counselor, he chose Dallin H. Oaks, who has long been part of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and is next in line to be president. As Second Counselor, Nelson chose Henry B. Eyring, who served in the First Presidency under Monson.

Given the church’s succession process, it’s unlikely the arrival of a new president will mean changes in how it approaches topics that have caused it controversy in recent years, such as queer sexuality and women in leadership roles.

This became apparent when, after the presidency announcement, Nelson and his counselors fielded questions from reporters about the church’s future and vision.

One reporter asked about outreach to queer Mormons, many of whom have said they feel ostracized by the church. In November 2015, the church adopted a policy that deemed same-sex couples “apostates.” It also prohibited children of these couples from getting blessed or baptized until they were 18 years old, at which point they need to disavow their parents’ marriage in order to join the church.

Nelson said that while God loves all his children and wants them to have joy, there are certain challenges associated with following God’s commandments ― “challenges to be worthy to enter his holy presence.”

Oaks was a bit more explicit in his response, suggesting that believers need to follow God’s commandments in order to receive blessings.

“As leaders of the church we have a responsibility to teach love and also to teach the commandments of God,” Oaks said.

Jana Riess, a Mormon blogger, said that the subtext of both men’s remarks “seemed to be a reiteration of the Church’s position that homosexual behavior is in violation of God’s commandments, but that all people are loved.”

She also suggested it’s unlikely that the First Presidency’s traditional responses to concerns about women’s leadership and minority representation in the church will be satisfactory to Mormons with questions about these issues.
