Charlottesville, Virginia, has the highest health insurance premiums in the country for individuals who do not qualify for federal subsidies and are not enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance. Market uncertainty, spurred by White House efforts to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, has resulted in heftier premiums nationwide. Some states are trying to mitigate further hikes.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Repeatedly rated one of the healthiest and happiest places to live in the United States, this medium-sized college town with spectacular views of the Blue Ridge Mountains tends to attract entrepreneurs, freelancers and creative types who can live anywhere they want because they’re not tied to a corporate job.

But this year, many of those untethered workers may be wishing they lived anywhere but here. Residents of Charlottesville and three surrounding counties who buy health insurance without employer support or government subsidies have been hit with the highest health insurance premiums in the country — more than three times the price they paid last year.

Premiums are also substantially higher than average, although not as high as in Charlottesville, in southwestern rural Georgia, certain Colorado ski resort towns, the Connecticut suburbs of New York City, and large parts of Wisconsin and Wyoming, among other places.

Charlottesville’s premium spike may be an anomaly. But insurance experts say it could be an indication of what might happen in other parts of the country next fall, when insurers post their final rates for 2019.

Nationwide, premiums for average-priced policies — according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis — offered on and off the health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act rose by more than a third compared with 2017. The biggest statewide hikes were in Iowa (88 percent), Utah (78 percent), New Hampshire (78 percent), Wyoming (72 percent), and Virginia (66 percent).

The underlying cause of the rate hikes is clear: efforts last year by the Trump administration and its allies in Congress to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — and promises of further attempts in the year ahead.

“It all added up to chaos and uncertainty in the insurance market,” said Sabrina Corlette, a Georgetown University research professor and insurance expert. “And uncertainty always leads to higher premiums.”

This year, a handful of Democratic-led states are gearing up to curb further rate hikes by enacting laws and adopting insurance regulations designed to shore up the traditional insurance industry and restore parts of the ACA, known as Obamacare.

At the same time, at least one Republican-leaning state has moved to further unravel the federal health law by encouraging insurance companies to offer cheap policies with fewer benefits. Others are expected to follow.

Both red and blue states are reacting to a series of federal actions.

The federal tax overhaul enacted in December repealed the individual mandate, which required everybody to have health insurance or pay a financial penalty. The requirement was designed to ensure that healthy people signed up for insurance so that premiums for everyone remained affordable.

Two months earlier, President Donald Trump withdrew billions in federal insurance industry subsidies that allowed insurers to keep premiums affordable while holding down copays and deductibles.

Around the same time, Trump also cut the health exchange enrollment period in half. And earlier in the year, he slashed the marketing budget for federal exchanges to further damage the health law by curtailing enrollment.

This year, both branches of government promise further attacks on the health law, including final actions on two administration proposals. One would encourage insurers to offer short-term policies with variable copays and deductibles, and the other would allow people to form groups to create so-called association health plans with cheap premiums and limited benefits.

Known for its scenic views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah National Park, Albemarle County, Virginia, which includes Charlottesville, has the highest health insurance rates in the country for residents who earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies.

States Respond

In Idaho, Republican Gov. Butch Otter followed the administration’s cues, signing an executive order this month that directs the state insurance agency to draft rules allowing insurance companies to offer cheap plans with stripped-down benefits.

Going in the opposite direction, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Maryland are considering legislation that would recreate the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate by requiring nearly all residents to enroll in a health plan or pay a fee. Massachusetts has a mandate on the books that it said it intends to enforce.

Taking a different tack — one that has been endorsed by members of both political parties — Alaska, Minnesota and Oregon have created so-called reinsurance programs designed to cover higher-than-average claims with state money and thereby reduce overall risk for insurance companies so they can offer consumers lower premiums.

Under the health law, the federal government can reimburse states for any money spent on reinsurance programs that results in lower premiums, and thus reduced federal tax subsidies, as long as the reimbursements do not exceed federal savings. Washington state and Wisconsin are considering similar programs this year.

In New Jersey, newly elected Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed an executive order this month directing state agencies to invest in greater outreach and education to encourage more people to sign up for coverage on the state insurance exchange when it opens in November. California and New York launched similar advertising and marketing campaigns last year for the same reason.

By encouraging more people to enroll, states can improve the odds that their insurance markets will stabilize and premiums will remain affordable.

“Consumers are still confused about health insurance subsidies, and they’re hearing a lot of bad news about the ACA,” said Sarah Lueck, an insurance analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “States need to tell consumers that the market isn’t crumbling, because it’s not. There are still some really good deals out there.”

It’s too early to know how many other states will move this year to fill the policy gaps in the tattered Affordable Care Act. But consumer advocates are urging lawmakers and governors to act sooner rather than later.

“States need to prepare now if their initiatives are going to have the desired effect,” Lueck said. If states want to stabilize the insurance industry by establishing individual mandates or reinsurance programs, they need to have their policies in place before spring and summer, when companies are required to file preliminary rates for 2019, she said.

For states that want to follow New Jersey’s lead and beef up outreach and marketing for their insurance exchanges this year, there’s a little more time. Insurance exchange marketing typically doesn’t start until September, two months prior to open enrollment in November.

But there’s another approach states can take at any time to protect their traditional insurance markets from the continued uncertainty created by attacks on the ACA from Congress and the Trump administration.

Once federal agencies finalize rules allowing cheaper, substandard health policies, states can prohibit those policies from being sold within their borders unless they comply with ACA consumer protections, according to a recent article by a group of consumer advocates in the policy journal Health Affairs.

New Jersey and New York already have such prohibitions, and Minnesota allows non-complying health plans to be sold only under limited circumstances.

Unsubsidized Consumers

Before the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014, people who were self-employed, between jobs or working part time and were not offered employer-sponsored health plans typically had to pay the highest prices for health coverage because insurers considered the relatively small pool of individuals riskier than larger groups.

Many people who faced high-priced individual insurance policies took their chances and went without coverage. Others opted for cheaper plans with high out-of-pocket expenses and limited benefits.

For this group, the ACA’s consumer protections were a huge boon. Confident they could find affordable health insurance, many workers were able to strike out on their own for the first time.

Insurers were prohibited from refusing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or charging people higher premiums because of their medical history. And although individual market premiums still tended to be higher than group plans, rates and coverage improved in the first four years after the federal health law took effect.

But last year’s revisions to the law may have changed all that.

As a result, many states can be expected to take action this year to protect this group of consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, said Timothy Jost, a retired law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia and an ACA expert. They will either be propping up the ACA and the traditional health insurance market, or further undermining the federal health law by promoting cheaper, lower quality policies, he said.

The result, he said, will be even greater disparities than already exist between states in the number of people who can afford quality health care coverage.

In fact, the Trump administration’s tactics are likely to bolster the overall proportion of Americans enrolled in Medicaid and federally subsidized exchange policies, said Joel Ario, a health care analyst with the law firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips who worked in the Obama administration. That’s because the policies will remain affordable and people will enroll in them even without the coercion of the individual mandate, he said.

Left out will be people not covered by employer-sponsored insurance and with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid or federal exchange subsidies. Nationwide, about 22 million people purchase insurance in the individual market, according to Kaiser. About 43 percent of them have incomes too high to qualify for federal tax subsidies on the exchange.

Charlottesville resident Sara Stovall is among them. She, and fellow residents Ian Dixon and Karl Quist, have hired an attorney to represent them and a group of more than 700 other locals who in November were hit with exorbitant premiums. They’re arguing in a case before the Virginia Insurance Bureau that the rates filed by Optima Health — a Virginia-based insurance carrier and the sole remaining provider of health coverage in their area — violated federal law.

But even if they win the case and the state orders Optima to issue refunds, they and the others in their group won’t personally benefit. The money would go to a regional insurance pool and ultimately would be deducted from future premiums for all policies.

Stovall, Dixon and Quist, all of whom had incomes just above the federal limit, could not afford their 2018 insurance premiums, roughly $3,000 a month for a family of four. Stovall, whose husband’s freelance photography business is growing, said their premiums would have been more than their mortgage payment.The U.S. delegation in Jerusalem on Monday to celebrate the opening of the new American embassy includes an evangelical Christian pastor who once said Jews “can’t be saved.”

The Rev. Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist megachurch in Dallas and a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, delivered an opening prayer of dedication at the ceremony.

“I’m going to be thanking God for the strong leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, who is absolutely determined to protect Israel,” Jeffress told Fox News in advance of his appearance. “And I’m also going to be thanking God for our President Donald Trump, who had the courage to do what no other U.S. president has done, and that is to officially recognize Jerusalem and to move the embassy.”

In addition to his remarks on Jews, Jeffress has referred to both Mormonism and Islam as “a heresy from the pit of Hell.” Islam, he also said, “promotes pedophilia.”

Mitt Romney, the subject of Jeffress’ barbs during his 2012 presidential run, criticized the inclusion of a man he called a “religious bigot” in the ceremony:

Robert Jeffress says “you can’t be saved by being a Jew,“ and “Mormonism is a heresy from the pit of hell.” He’s said the same about Islam. Such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) May 14, 2018

The Rev. John Hagee, founder of Christians United for Israel, also delivered remarks at the ceremony. He came under fire in 2008, when audio resurfaced of him seeming to say Adolf Hitler was a “hunter” who was called upon to help Jews return to Israel.

Other members of the 250-person U.S. delegation include White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Ambassadors from only four European Union countries (Austria, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic) attended a welcome reception on Sunday, while representatives from other nations reportedly boycotted the event in protest.Despite plastic bag bans in places like California showing signs of success, a growing number of states are enacting prohibitions on banning plastic bags.

By Scott Rodd

Bisbee, a city of 5,200 tucked into the mountains of southeastern Arizona, has been a haven for artists and left-leaning types since the 1970s. The old mining town has art galleries, live music venues, and stories — many of them revolving around the supposedly haunted Copper Queen Hotel — in abundance.

Until a few years ago, Bisbee also had plenty of something it didn’t want: plastic bags. They sullied the streets, helicoptered through the air and draped the cactuses, according to Mayor David M. Smith. The problem grew so dire that in 2012, the town barred retailers from providing plastic bags to customers.

Some local businesses opposed the ban, but most residents were thrilled, according to Smith. “It made a huge difference,” said the mayor, who voted for the ordinance as a member of the city council. “After, they were all gone.”

But that was just the beginning of Bisbee’s bag battle. The Arizona Food Marketing Alliance, which represents the state’s grocers and food suppliers, lobbied the Legislature for legislation that would quash Bisbee’s ban and prevent other cities and towns in Arizona from following its lead. In 2015, they succeeded.

Republican lawmakers typically tout the benefits of local control. But in states across the country, they have taken action to rein in cities that want to enact progressive measures such as gun control laws and minimum wage hikes. Now plastic bags have become an unlikely flashpoint in the conflict between blue cities and their red state legislatures.

In recent years a handful of states — Arizona and Missouri in 2015, Idaho, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, Minnesota in 2017 — have enacted “bans on bans,” joining a group that already included Florida, Indiana and Iowa.

State Sen. Warren Petersen, the Republican who led the push for Arizona’s law, said it is intended to protect individual rights. In addition to prohibiting plastic bag bans, the measure prohibits local governments from regulating the use of boxes, bottles and containers “used for transporting merchandise to or from a business.”

“It’s not the government’s job to tell you whether or not you should use a plastic bag,” Petersen said. “Are we going to micromanage every decision of every consumer?”

The issue also has attracted national players. The American Progressive Bag Alliance, an offshoot of the Plastics Industry Association, has spent millions of dollars to defeat the local bans and support legislation that preempts local governments from implementing them. And the American City County Exchange, an offshoot of the conservative advocacy group the American Legislative Exchange Council — better known as ALEC — has drafted model legislative language for prohibitions on bag bans.

“A patchwork of bag laws is never good for the consumer and never good for businesses,” said Matt Seaholm, executive director of the American Progressive Bag Alliance. “It should be done at the state level if it’s that important of an issue.”

In Arizona, Bisbee refused to repeal its bag ban — until last fall, when the threat of losing nearly $2 million in state aid finally forced it to relent.

“The state was basically extorting us, saying that we either had to repeal this ordinance or lose our state sharing revenues,” Smith said. “That would have literally bankrupted the city.”

San Francisco Leads the Way

San Francisco in 2007 became the first city in the United States to impose a ban on single-use plastic bags. Roughly 150 municipalities in California, including San Jose, Malibu and Santa Monica, eventually followed suit.

After a series of battles in the lower state courts, the California Supreme Court in 2011 upheld the rights of cities to ban single-use plastic bags and ruled they did not have to complete an environmental impact analysis before adopting such bans.

Buoyed by victory, supporters pushed for a statewide ban, which Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2014.

But bag proponents weren’t through. In the last three months of 2014, the Progressive Bag Alliance spent over $3 million to collect enough signatures to put a reversal of the ban on the 2016 ballot. (Hilex Poly, a leading plastic bag manufacturer, contributed $1.7 million, Superbag Corporation gave $500,000, and Formosa Plastics contributed $400,000 in the successful effort.)

Then, to attract voter support for the ballot measure, the alliance spent another $2.6 million.

Still, Californians upheld the statewide ban, with 53 percent voting in favor. The ban allows stores to offer paper or reusable plastic bags for a 10 cent minimum fee, and certain businesses — like restaurants and department stores — are exempt.

Environmentalists say discarded plastic bags, in addition to being unsightly, are often eaten by animals such as fish and eventually end up in human food, which can make people sick. Citing data collected by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency, environmentalists say bag bans can go a long way toward minimizing those risks.

In 2010, volunteers picked up about 65,000 plastic bags littered along state beaches and rivers during the Coastal Commission’s annual cleanup day. Plastic bags accounted for 7.4 percent of all the items of trash collected throughout the day — the third most common item after cigarette butts and food wrappers.

In 2016, according to the commission, the number of littered plastic bags collected dropped by 63 percent compared to 2010. Plastic bags accounted for only 3.4 percent of the items picked up during the cleanup. In 2017, the number of plastic bags collected continued to drop, down to 3.1 percent of items picked up.

“This is a big win for the coast of California and the state in general,” said Mark Vargas, a commissioner on the Coastal Commission. “And it is proof that [these bans] work.”

Paper or Plastic?

But opponents of plastic bag bans maintain that they do little to protect the environment — and may even harm humans.

Minnesota state Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen, a Republican who successfully pushed a measure prohibiting local bag bans in his state, pointed out that single-use plastic bags can be reused or recycled at many grocery stores. He also argued that single-use plastic bags are more sanitary than reusable bags, and that manufacturing single-use plastic bags creates a smaller carbon footprint than the production of single-use paper bags.

Other bag-ban opponents argue that reusable bags pose sanitary risks. Many cite a 2013 study that found that reusable grocery bags, a common substitute for plastic bags, contain potentially harmful bacteria. The researchers found that emergency room admissions related to these bacteria spiked in San Francisco after it adopted its ban in 2007.

In Minnesota, state lawmakers acted quickly to preempt a bag ban that Minneapolis approved in spring 2016. Days before the city’s ban was slated to go into effect, state lawmakers in 2017 enacted a statewide prohibition on cities imposing bans on any type of bag in stores.

In 2016, the Progressive Bag Alliance spent $20,000 on lobbying at the state level in Minnesota, and the American Chemistry Council — an organization that helped found the Progressive Bag Alliance — spent $270,000.

City councilman Cam Gordon, a member of the Green Party who introduced the Minneapolis ordinance, said he and other proponents of the measure met with business groups and adjusted the ban to address retailers’ concerns. He said state lawmakers were trampling on the will of the City Council and residents of Minneapolis.The U.S. Senate voted Monday on legislation that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and would threaten doctors with up to five years in jail.

The bill, passed by the House of Representatives in October, fell short by a vote of 51 to 46 in the Senate. Only three women in the entire Senate ― Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) ― voted for it, while Republican Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted against it.

Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (W.V.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.) and Bob Casey (Penn.) crossed the aisle to support it. Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), the newly elected Democrat from Alabama, voted against it, suggesting that he will uphold his campaign promise to protect reproductive rights despite representing a red state.

President Donald Trump urged lawmakers to reconsider following the vote. “I urge the Senate to reconsider its decision and pass legislation that will celebrate, cherish, and protect life,” Trump said in a statement.

Conservatives hoped that holding a vote on the bill will put some political pressure on vulnerable Democrats from red states to either support it or risk alienating some of their anti-abortion constituents.

“Clearly, we need more votes, but at some point when you start to get closer, and senators in vulnerable states start to feel the heat, then it starts to look very optimistic,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, told reporters on Thursday.

Democrats slammed Republican leadership on Monday for prioritizing an abortion ban less than a week after the government shutdown, and as the fate of so-called “Dreamers” ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― still hangs in the balance.

“Today, in communities across the country, young people are asking whether they’ll be able to stay in the only country they’ve ever called home,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a floor speech before the vote. “Workers and business owners are wondering — again — whether the government will be open in a few weeks.”

“But, Mr. President — instead of addressing the serious and pressing challenges that people are facing — Republican leaders are debating whether to trust women to make their own health care choices.”

At least two moderate Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), have expressed concerns about the exceptions in the abortion bill, which was introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). The legislation exempts women who require an abortion to save their lives, as well as rape and incest survivors, but the legislation does not include exemptions for health of the mother or severe fetal anomalies, which often can’t be detected until the 20-week ultrasound.

Since Republicans started trying to impose the limit in 2013, many women have come forward with their personal stories of discovering at or after the 20-week mark that the fetus would either not survive the pregnancy or would severely suffer after birth.

“I was absolutely devastated to get that news,” said Kate Williams, who discovered when she was 21 weeks pregnant that her unborn son had Potter syndrome, a fatal condition in which the kidneys fail to develop in the womb. “I called my regular OB-GYN to discuss with her if there was any chance this might not be true. But she looked at the ultrasounds and told me, ‘No, this is the situation.’”

Collins, who voted against the 20-week abortion ban in 2015, told the Washington Examiner last week that she suggested some changes to the language of the bill and will “see what happens.”

A few Democrats are likely to cross over and support the bill, and Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) have already indicated they would vote for it. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Penn.) voted for the legislation alongside Manchin and Donnelly in 2015.

Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) previously voted against the legislation, but are now both up for re-election this year in states that voted for Trump. However, recent polling suggests that supporting abortion rights is more likely to help a candidate, even in red states and especially among independent voters, than to hurt.

The fact that Republicans scheduled this vote for the day before President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address suggests that Trump may just be looking for something to point to that will appease his base.One year after the awards show snub that shall not be named, Beyoncé has returned to the Grammys.

The singer was notably MIA as stars filed into New York City’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday night ― and if we’re being totally the honest, she was one of the only people we were really excited about seeing on the red carpet.

But halfway through the awards ceremony, Beyoncé and daughter Blue Ivy, 6, blessed us with their presence, sitting in the audience alongside Jay-Z, who led the night with eight nominations for his album “4:44.”

The “Lemonade” singer stunned in an all-black ensemble with shoulder cut-outs and high slits on both sides. Of course, no queen’s outfit is complete without some killer accessories, so she paired the look with a dramatic hat, sunglasses and dangling Lorraine Schwartz diamond earrings.

Blue struck a contrast with her famous parents, dressing in white with some sparkling low-heeled shoes.

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Jan 28, 2018 at 3:10pm PSTPresident Donald Trump seemed to be in a fog about the facts of climate change during his British TV sit-down with Piers Morgan, which aired Sunday night.

Trump said in the ITV interview that the polar ice caps were supposed to be “gone by now,” but instead they’re “setting records.”

“The ice caps were going to melt,” he said, “they were going to be gone by now. But now they’re setting records. They’re at a record level.”

Asked if he thinks that climate change is happening, Trump said, “There is a cooling, and there’s a heating. I mean, look, it used to not be climate change, it used to be global warming. Right? That wasn’t working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place.”

This is not how the scientists explain it.

Climate change, according to NASA, refers to “a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels.” The increasing average temperature of the Earth ― that is, global warming ― is one key result. Others are rising sea levels and a growing trend toward extreme weather and weather anomalies linked to that.

Last year was Earth’s second hottest on record. The world’s oceans were the hottest ever recorded in 2017.

As for things getting “too cold all over the place,” there hasn’t been a cooler-than-average year since 1976, according to more than 135 years of temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The last four years have been the globe’s four hottest on record, according to NOAA.

Now the polar ice caps are breaking records — for melting. And last year NASA reported that sea ice in both the Arctic and the Antarctic was at a record low, again due to melting.

But it’s not clear who, except for Trump, thought the melting process would happen so quickly that the ice caps would have disappeared by 2018.

Several scientists criticized Trump’s assessment of climate change and its effects as dead wrong.

“Ice on the ocean and on land are both disappearing rapidly, and we know why: increasing greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels that trap more heat and melt the ice,” Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis told The Associated Press.

Trump recently pointed to a winter cold snap on the East Coast as disproving climate change, apparently confusing climate and weather. As NASA and NOAA explain, “climate” refers to trends in atmospheric behavior over long periods of time, whereas weather is what happens today and tomorrow, varying even minute to minute.

In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017

Perhaps in an effort to demonstrate his environmental bona fides, Trump told Morgan that he does believe in “clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all.”

The president also said he might consider rejoining the Paris climate accord — which he pulled the U.S. out of last year — under different terms.It’s Monday, the sun is shining (somewhere) and Kim Kardashian is under fire for cultural appropriation yet again.

The 37-year-old reality star recently posted a video on Snapchat that shows her hair in bead-adorned braids that resemble Fulani-style braids, which are inspired by the Fulani women of East and West Africa.

But Kardashian credited actress Bo Derek, who is white, for the traditionally black hairstyle.

“So guys I got Bo Derek braids, and I’m really into it,” she says in the video, referencing the actresses’ look from the 1979 movie, “10.”

A post shared by Kim Kardashian Snapchats 🍑 (@kimksnapchats) on Jan 28, 2018 at 6:57pm PST

Kardashian, who recently faced blackface accusations while promoting her new beauty line, has previously attributed credit where credit isn’t due for her hairstyle.

Almost exactly five years ago, she posted a photo of herself with her hair braided and called the look “Bo Derek braids.”

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Feb 13, 2013 at 2:55pm PST

Fulani braids are a style of cornrows that usually consists of braids with beads. And cornrows are a hairstyle worn by both black women and men that have been around since ancient times ― long, long before Derek wore them in 1979.

“History tells us cornrows originated in Africa. The intricate braiding of the hair indicated the tribe you belonged to,” Toni Love, a cosmetologist, barber, instructor and author, said in an interview with Ebony last year.

Love added, “Cornrows on women date back to at least 3000 B.C. and as far back as the nineteenth century for men, particularly in Ethiopia. Warriors and kings were identified by their braided hairstyles.”

Below is a picture of Solange Knowles wearing braids inspired by the Fulani tribe:

It’s easy to see why people were upset by Kardashian’s “Bo Derek braids” comment:

HuffPost’s own Zeba Blay explains why it’s important to denounce these kinds of actions:Model Chrissy Teigen and musician John Legend have donated $200,000 to honor the U.S. gymnasts who recently came forward to testify against now convicted sex offender Larry Nassar.

The celebrity couple gave the money to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, calling the gymnasts’ efforts “heroic,” according to the GoFundMe page.

GoFundMe screenshot

The legal defense fund, run by the National Women’s Law Center, aims to “provide subsidized legal support to women and men who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace.”

Nassar was convicted on seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. Over 140 women came forward to claim that the former USA Gymnastics doctor had sexually abused them.

Teigen previously offered to pay fines that gymnast McKayla Maroney might have faced for testifying at Nassar’s trial, as she had signed a nondisclosure agreement from a previous court settlement.

USA Gymnastics later said they would not fine Maroney, saying it “encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out.”

The actress has long been raving about “Wonder Wheel” director Woody Allen, who has been accused of molesting his daughter when she was young, calling Allen an “extraordinary writer” and saying that the opportunity to work with him made her “feel terrified and also immensely privileged.”

However, in contrast to that message, Winslet shared her thoughts on supporting “vulnerable people” and spoke out against sexual abuse at the London Critics’ Circle Film Awards Sunday night. After accepting a special award, the Oscar winner never named names but did mention “individuals” in power that she regrets working with.

“As women around the world and from all walks of life marched last weekend, once again joining together to speak out against harassment, exploitation and abuse, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to stand here this evening and keep to myself some bitter regrets that I have about poor decisions to work with individuals with whom I wish I had not,” Winslet said, according to the BBC.

“It has become clear to me that by not saying anything, I might be adding to the anguish of many courageous women and men. Sexual abuse is a crime. While it rests with the rule of law to pass judgment, it lies with all of us to listen to the smallest of voices and to never stop listening. ... I know we all stand together in hoping that this moment in history paves the way for a transformed future for generation upon generation to come.”The body of a teenage girl who police had labeled a runaway when she vanished two weeks ago has been found near her home in a Virginia suburb of Washington.

The death of Jholie Moussa, 16, of Alexandria, is being investigated as a homicide, Kent Bailey, a Fairfax County police officer, said Monday. An officer discovered the remains Friday in a wooded area of Woodlawn Neighborhood Park, less than a mile from the teen’s home. The body was “almost entirely covered by leaves and brush,” Bailey said.

Moussa’s family reported her missing on Jan. 13, the day after she abruptly left home after Snapchatting with an unknown person, according to her mother, Syreeta Steward. Police labeled the teen a runaway juvenile, which angered her mother, who described Moussa as a 10th-grade honors student with no history of running away.

“Just because she voluntarily left her home does not mean she voluntarily left her block,” Steward told HuffPost on Wednesday. “Labeling her a runaway takes away a sense of urgency.”

Police said they identified the body based its appearance, including a tattoo on the right shoulder. Moussa and her twin sister, Zhane, have matching tattoos ― an infinity symbol with their names.

A cause of death has not yet been released. A call to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Manassas – the performing the autopsy – was not returned on Monday.

Steward told HuffPost last week that her daughter was last seen after the mysterious Snapchat session. She said she was stepping out and would be right back, according to the mom.

About 8 p.m. that night, Zhane received an unusual text message from her sister saying she was heading to a party in Norfolk, Steward said. Norfolk is approximately 190 miles from Alexandria. The message was sent from Moussa’s phone, but it’s unclear whether it was Moussa who sent it, her mom said.

Later that night, Steward missed a call from Moussa’s phone. Return calls and texts went unanswered.

Steward was unavailable for comment Monday.

Police haven’t named any suspects or persons of interest.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Fairfax County Police Department at 703-691-2131, or the FBI at 202-278-2000. Moussa’s family created a Facebook group to share information in the case.Reality star-turned White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman is heading back to the small screen that made her famous.

The controversial former White House aide who left President Donald Trump’s administration last month amid reports that she was physically removed from the White House will join the cast of “Celebrity Big Brother.”

The special winter celebrity edition of the show will premiere on CBS on Feb. 7.

Newman joins a cast of fellow “Celebrity Apprentice” alums as well as former contestants of “Dancing With The Stars,” per Entertainment Weekly. Fellow cast members include Sugar Ray singer Mark McGrath, “American Pie” star Shannon Elizabeth and former NBA player Metta World Peace, among others.SZA was nominated for five Grammys on Sunday, but that wasn’t the only reason why the “Love Galore” singer was a true winner of the entire night.

The restaurant chain’s parent company, Brinker International, announced last week some outlets were “impacted by a data incident, which may have resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of your payment card data.”

Chili’s, which has more than 1,600 locations worldwide, did not disclose which locations or how many diners might have been affected, but that it believes “the data incident was limited to between March – April 2018.”

The breach involved malware being used “to gather payment card information including credit or debit card numbers as well as cardholder names from our payment-related systems for in-restaurant purchases at certain Chili’s restaurants.”

On May 11 we learned that some of our Guests’ payment card information from certain restaurants was compromised. We value our relationship with our Guests and are committed to sharing details as we know more here: https://t.co/xWnJ1a7Auy — Chili's Grill & Bar (@Chilis) May 12, 2018

Company officials also said they are “working with third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation to confirm the nature and scope of this incident.”

The officials said law enforcement authorities have been notified and “we are working to provide fraud resolution and credit monitoring services” for those whose information may have been obtained through the breach.

The company suggests Chili’s customers monitor their bank and credit card statements for accuracy and contact their banks if there is any suspicious activity.Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted together Saturday night at the Clive Davis and The Recording Academy’s Pre-Grammy Gala in New York City.

The extremely private duo, who have been rumored to be dating for a while now, were called out by Davis. Though they initially sat together at the same table, Holmes briefly walked out of the room a few moments before the gala host and music producer announced Foxx’s presence.

That prompted Davis to say, “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her. She was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else.”

With Holmes by then sitting at another table, he added, “If you’re going to sit together, what better night than tonight?”

Foxx found the commentary hilarious, while Holmes looked more than a little uncomfortable to be “caught.”

Despite the mild awkwardness, Holmes, 39, and Foxx, 50, appeared to be happy and enjoying their time together in many of the shots captured at the event.

“That was one of the best moments of my life,” Peters, 15, told the Chicago Tribune. “I thought it might go in, but when it actually did, it was pretty cool. I remember blinking, I was on such an emotional high.

While Kardashian unloaded on former brother-in-law Lamar Odom earlier this month, the family had stayed silent on another sister’s ex-partner, Scott Disick.

Disick, 34, has recently and somewhat controversially been dating model Sofia Richie, 19. He and oldest sister Kourtney Kardashian were together for years and share three kids ― sons Mason, 8, and Reign, 3, and daughter Penelope, 5 ― but called it quits for good in 2015.

Well, Kendall was feeling some kind of way when she saw a photo of Disick and Richie in a car with one of his offspring on a fan’s Instagram account and basically broke the family’s silence on the matter.

“Awww Scott and his kids,” Jenner commented, adding a laughing face emoji.

A post shared by Scott Disick (@scottthelord) on Jan 27, 2018 at 4:20pm PST

The 22-year-old Jenner is not the only one who has reservations about the relationship. Richie’s father, Lionel, confessed that he was “scared to death” of his daughter dating Disick, given the age gap and Disick’s hard-partying reputation.

Before he was linked to Richie, Disick was seen out and about with actress Bella Thorne, 20, cuddling at the Cannes Festival. When photos of the two made the internet rounds, Kim Kardashian called the self-proclaimed “Lord” “desperate” and “malicious” for trying to make her sister jealous with that fling.

Kourtney, 38, meanwhile, has been living her best life in various exotic locales around the world with her considerably younger boyfriend, 24-year-old model Younes Bendjima.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on European countries on Monday to do more to fight anti-Semitism, saying indifference on the issue was a virus that could allow the ideas of racial hatred to spread.

Francis issued his appeal in a speech to a Rome conference on the responsibility of states to fight anti-Semitism and crimes associated with it.

“We are responsible when we are able to respond. It is not merely a question of analyzing the causes of violence and refuting their (anti-Semitic crimes’) perverse logic, but of being actively prepared to respond to them,” he told the event organized by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

A number of European nations have made it illegal to deny the Holocaust, the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry during World War Two.

Last week, Germany’s lower house of parliament called for the creation of a new government post to oversee the fight against anti-Semitism, following the burning of Jewish symbols and Israeli flags.

“Indifference is a virus that is dangerously contagious in our time, a time when we are ever more connected with others, but are increasingly less attentive to others,” the pope said.

Francis, who made an emotional visit to the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in 2016 and visited Rome’s synagogue the same year, said the “vaccine” against “so many deplorable forms of apathy” is memory.

Quoting his predecessor, Pope John Paul, Francis said everyone should work for a future where “the unspeakable iniquity of the Shoah will never again be possible.” Shoah is the Hebrew word for the Holocaust.

Poland, where Auschwitz is located, has also seen acts of anti-Semitism recently.

One, exposed by a television station, showed people in a forest last year chanting “Sieg Heil” on what would have been Adolf Hitler’s 128th birthday.

About 60,000 people, some carrying banners with slogans such as “pure blood, clear mind,” marched in a far-right demonstration in Warsaw in November and arsonists set fire to a synagogue in Sweden last month.

Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said: “In country after country, we are watching a growing wave of far-right, ultra-national, and in some cases neo-Nazi parties gaining strength.”

“New Europe is suddenly looking an awful lot like the Europe of the 1930s,” Lauder told the conference held at Rome’s foreign ministry.The companies confirmed to Reuters on Saturday they had sent out the alerts to clients.

NCR said in a Friday alert that the cases were the first confirmed “jackpotting” losses in the United States. It said its equipment had not been targeted in the recent attacks, but that it was still a concern for the entire ATM industry.

“This should be treated by all ATM deployers as a call to action to take appropriate steps to protect their ATMs against these forms of attack,” the alert said.Jay-Z accepts the President's Merit Award during the Clive Davis and Recording Academy Pre-Grammy Gala on Saturday.

Jay-Z fans are not pleased with the Recording Academy.

In a year where it seemed hip-hop would prevail, the “4:44” rapper left the show with zero of the eight awards for which he was nominated.

Instead, Hov’s moment of glory during Grammys weekend came when he was honored with the President’s Merit Award at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy gala on Saturday.

People on Twitter were unhappy that the 21-time Grammy Award winner and hip-hop icon didn’t win in a single category, despite being the most nominated artist of the evening.

Tom Hanks has just signed on to play Mr. Rogers in the TriStar Pictures biopic “You Are My Friend.”

Directed by Marielle Heller (“Diary of a Teenage Girl”) with a script by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, “You Are My Friend” has been in the works since 2013, when it appeared on the Black List, an annual survey of the “most liked” motion picture screenplays not yet produced.

“You Are My Friend” follows the friendship of Fred Rogers and journalist Tom Junod. While on assignment to write a profile on the TV icon, the initially cynical Junod’s perspective on Rogers (and life) transforms as the two cultivate a friendship.

The profile Junod wrote, “Can You Say... Hero?” was published in Esquire in 1998. More than just a portrayal of Rogers’ essence, it’s also a meditation on what is lost as we grow up, and taking Rogers’ lessons with us as we do.

Heller told Variety she was “thrilled to be making ‘You Are My Friend,’” saying the “script knocked me out with its message of kindness and its exploration of the human spirit.”

“As a mother, I am so inspired by the teachings of Fred Rogers and as a human I am in awe of his life’s work,” Heller said. “I can’t wait to bring his story to the public and be a part of such a thoughtful, smart group of people who are all coming together to make this film, which truly feels to me like an antidote to our very fractured culture.”

As for Hanks’ role in the project, it’s not known when he’ll begin shooting. He’s expected to be in several upcoming blockbusters, including “Toy Story 4,” “Greyhound” and “Bios.”It’s OK to talk about the extremely divisive subject of Aziz Ansari with friends at dinner, right?

“Saturday Night Live” captured the awkwardness of our post-babe.net world over the weekend with a skit about a group of people whose fun dinner conversation about a dog that eats anything (even steel wool!) devolves into a messy discussion about the sexual misconduct allegations against the comedian.

So, you may be wondering: Is it OK, according to the sketch, to discuss how powerful men tend to abuse, uh … or, how a woman who feels discomfort in a sexual situation could just, you know … leave?

Uh, sure.

If you don’t mind the impulse to cut off your own hair out of frustration.

So ― what was that about a dog that eats steel wool?Pink performs at the 2018 Grammy Awards on Jan. 28 in New York. Jeff Kravitz via Getty Images

On Sunday night, we watched with excitement as four veteran female vocalists competed to take home the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance. But fans of Kelly Clarkson (“Love So Soft”) and Kesha (“Praying””) and Lady Gaga (“Million Reasons”) and Pink (“What About Us”) were ultimately disappointed. None of them took home the prize. They lost out to the lone man in their category: Ed Sheeran (“Shape Of You”).

And he wasn’t even there to accept the honor.

Pink, for one, seemed unfazed by her loss. A few beats later, she took the Grammys stage to perform a stripped-down version of her song “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken.” As her husband Carey Hart and their 6-year-old daughter Willow watched from the crowd, Pink ― dressed in a white, off-the-shoulder T-shirt, loose jeans and minimal makeup ― stood alongside a sign-language interpreter and sang her heart out. Unlike her past performances, this involved no aerial stunts, no elaborate stage design or costumery. It was just Pink and her commanding lyrics. And little else.

Alecia Moore, aka Pink, has been a part of the competitive music industry since the late 1990s. This year, almost two decades since the rebellious girl with a hot pink pixie cut opted to become a solo artist with her biting debut album “Can’t Take Me Home” ― the one everyone described as angry or sassy ― she’s not only continuing to line up Grammy nominations, she’s managing to do so on her own terms.

“I’m just trying to be exciting,” she told Ryan Seacrest on the E! Red Carpet ahead of the show in New York. ”[A woman in a grocery store told me] she enjoys me because I like to F up in public a lot. She finds strength in knowing someone is out there screwing up like [her], too.”

And just like that, Pink synthesized exactly what’s kept her going in a cutthroat business ― where only 9.3 percent of the Grammy nominees from 2013 to 2018 were women ― that was never designed to let her win.

“I’ve always had to put pen to paper and scratch out my rage since I was little.” - Pink

Born and raised in a small suburb of Philadelphia, Pink was heavily influenced by her parents’ tumultuous relationship and eventual divorce. The emotional fallout she experienced as a teen led her to pick up a guitar and write her own music, influenced by idols like Janis Joplin and Madonna. She broke into the industry as a member of the all-girl band Choice, but label executive L.A. Reid quickly told Pink she’d be better off going solo, so she signed with LaFace Records to do so. It’d be one of the last times she’d act on Reid’s advice.

During the creation of her first album, Reid reportedly recommended, among other things, that Pink attend an etiquette class to reshape her image. She ignored him and exposed his misguidance on her second album, which sold more than 10 million copies.

“L.A. told me you’ll be a pop star,” she sang in “Don’t Let Me Get Me,” “all you have to change is everything you are.”

“I’ve always had to put pen to paper and scratch out my rage since I was little,” she said in the documentary “Pink: The Truth. ”[T]o be able to put that in motion to melody and have other kids scream it out the same way, and go to the same place I was at when I wrote it, it’s just like group therapy. Writing is everything to me.”

It’s true. Beyond writing lyrics, Pink has been masterfully writing her own narrative for years, withstanding pressures to adhere to some ideal version of a female pop star and projecting her own, earnest version of it to the world instead.

#Pink has been pretty damn prolific for nearly 20 years. That Greatest Hits could be double disc at this point. #GRAMMYs — Jason Fraley (@JFrayWTOP) January 29, 2018

“Can’t Take Me Home” was a giant success, but Pink decided to do then what she’d go on to do many more times: reinvent herself. Gone were the days of her R&B-pop hits like “Most Girls” ― she craved more rock. Following her Grammy win for a full-pop collaboration on “Lady Marmalade” with Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, Missy Elliott and Mya, Pink recruited 4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry to co-produce her new sound on “Missundaztood,” with songs like “Get the Party Started,” which peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100 in 2001.

“Missundaztood” Pink still sported an edgy, cropped haircut. She preferred pants over skirts; crop tops over blouses; heavy metal horns over peace signs. She didn’t want to be Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson, so she broke the mold originally cast for her ― and fans followed.

She eventually won another Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance with “Trouble” off her third studio album, “Try This.” Her 2006, 2008 and 2012 albums “I’m Not Dead,” “Funhouse” and “The Truth About Love” each sold more than 6 million copies worldwide. And she wrote her successes into her music: “I’m still a rock star / I got my rock moves / And I don’t need you,” she sang ― partly to her estranged husband at the time, but also, we assume, to the people still doubting her triumphs. Her latest effort, “Beautiful Trauma,” topped the Billboard 200 in November.

“I was never as big as Britney or Christina,” she said in a recent New York Times profile. “If you look at any paragraph about pop music, I don’t get mentioned — my name doesn’t come up. And yet, here I go again, right under the wave, duck-diving.”

Speaking of maneuvers, it’s difficult to talk about Pink’s 2018 Grammy appearance without comparing it with her 2010 Grammy performance of “Glitter In The Air.” It’s hard to think of this year’s plain white T-shirt without thinking of the time she calmly walked onstage and sang some verses before breaking out in aerial acrobatics, spinning above the crowd in a soaking wet bodysuit. Some critics deemed it the most beautiful and memorable Grammy performance ever; her ability to continue belting out her lyrics ― no lip-syncing from Pink ― incited a standing ovation.

“I’ve always seen dancers do [acrobatics] behind the singer, but the singer’s never done it,” she told Oprah. “Everyone’s pretty much done everything else that there is to do, so I said, ‘Why can’t I do it and sing?’ ... And I wanted to get all the famous people wet!”

From then on, every time Pink took the stage, people paid attention.

Sunday night, however, she decided to strip it all down. Her performance of “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken” was minimalistic compared with her trapeze acts, but that’s likely exactly how she hoped it’d be perceived. She knew that, no matter what, Grammy audiences would be watching her moves with baited breath, waiting for some imagined harness.

“There’s not enough rope to tie me down / There’s not enough tape to shut this mouth,” she sang, with no spectacle in sight. “The stones you throw can make me bleed / But I won’t stop until we’re free / Wild hearts can’t be broken.”

Standing ovation in a ripped t-shirt and baggy jeans. No dancers! No props. Just good ole sangin’ That’s what I call talent! #Grammys #Pink — ItsEricaE 💋 (@EEvans0712) January 29, 2018

Men won all but one of the major categories at the Grammy Awards on Sunday; Alessia Cara was the only woman able to nab a major trophy, for Best New Artist. In other categories, Rihanna earned a prize alongside Kendrick Lamar for Best Rap/Sung Performance, and Shakira deservedly secured Best Latin Pop Album. But talent like Pink, Kesha, Cardi B, Gaga, Clarkson, SZA, Lorde and Miranda Lambert ― some of whom performed that night ― went unrecognized.

Ahead of the ceremony, the president of The Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, insisted women have to “step up” if they want to be celebrated in the industry. “It has to begin with ... women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level … [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome,” he told Variety, with Ken Ehrlich adding, “Hopefully we’ll see [Taylor Swift] next year.”

Yet Pink has consistently “stepped up,” batting 1,000 in an industry that over-recognizes men and slots the female talent that does manage to get seen into narrow caricatures. She’s been crafting her sound and performances for two decades in an attempt to stay relevant, shirking expectations so as never to be pigeonholed. She’s winning even when she’s not by choosing her own next step, rather than stepping up to some preconceived platform.

Sure, Ed Sheeran took home a Grammy (well, figuratively), but it was Pink and her category colleagues who earned praise throughout the evening for representing what it means to be a determined, singular artist.

Hopefully, we’ll see Alecia Moore next year, and all the years to come.
