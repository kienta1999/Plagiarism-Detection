Some lucky New Yorkers had a celebrity encounter this weekend that can only be described as cheesy.

A rodent was seen on a New York subway claiming a piece of pizza as his own, though it remains to be seen whether it’s the famed “Pizza Rat” filmed gorging on a slice three years ago.

The latest Pizza Rat surfaced on the downtown 6 train tracks at the Lexington Avenue/59th Street station.

Michael Courant filmed the encounter for posterity.

“I was totally in shock!” Courant told InsideEdition.com. “Everyone on the platform was in awe and pulled their phone out like we were seeing a UFO. No one seemed super grossed out. Many people acted like it was no big deal, which is standard protocol for New Yorkers.”

The original Pizza Rat encounter struck a chord with many urban dwellers, for reasons best expressed by HuffPost reporter Maxwell Strachan:

“Pizza Rat is the perfect metaphor for life in New York: He is hungry, he loves dollar pizza, he hates his life and he is trying to carry something that is way too heavy down the subway stairs because the elevator is broken. It’s almost too perfect.”

Courant said he doesn’t believe this weekend’s pizza-toting rodent was the same one who went viral back in September 2015, when it was filmed carrying a slice of pizza down a subway station staircase ― but he jokes that he’s sure they are friends.

Still, he can’t confirm his theory.

“Unfortunately, I did not get Pizza Rat’s phone number, but I overheard him talking about how he loves Patsy’s Pizzeria,” he told Inside Edition.

AdvertisementOn Monday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” Noah feigned indignation over the jokes that Wolf made about President Donald Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

“Michelle should have had the decency not to comment on women’s appearances in any way, shape or form,” Noah deadpanned. “She’s a comedian for God’s sake, not the president.”

Although she left her job on his late-night comedy show last December, that didn’t stop Noah from using a Trump catchphrase from “The Apprentice” to give Wolf her marching orders.In case you needed another reason to be excited about the new season of last year’s TV lightning rod “13 Reasons Why,” Netflix has two: a teaser and a release date.

Based on Jay Asher’s young adult book of the same name, the controversial teen drama starring Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford is set to drop new episodes on the streaming service May 18.

The second season picks up after the death of teenager Hannah (Langford), who left behind 13 tapes for Clay (Minnette) and various classmates to explain what led to her suicide. Her parents are now suing the high school, but someone “will stop at nothing to keep the truth surrounding Hannah’s death concealed,” according to Netflix.

“A series of ominous Polaroids lead Clay and his classmates to uncover a sickening secret and a conspiracy to cover it up,” the official log line for the new season reads.

In response to criticism that the series glorified depictions of self-harm and suicide, the creators are taking steps to reach out to viewers that might be struggling ahead of the second season.

Each episode will begin with a warning featuring cast members addressing the show’s heavy topics. Actors will also appear on an aftershow, “Beyond the Reasons,” alongside mental health experts and educators to encourage discussions between family members and direct viewers to the website 13reasonswhy.info for additional information such as viewing guides.She added: “We really were rooting for Khloe and we still are. She’s so strong and she’s doing the best that she can.”

“It’s a really sad situation all over. I kind of made this rule with my brother,” Kardashian said. “If there’s a baby involved, I’m going to keep it cute and classy and try not to say anything negative, because one day True is going to see this. It’s just so messed up.”Authorities have charged 57 white supremacists with crimes related to a yearslong methamphetamine operation in Texas, a federal court has revealed.

In an indictment unsealed Monday by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and obtained by HuffPost, white supremacists from six different groups are facing charges including drug trafficking and kidnapping.

Members from the Aryan Circle, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, the Aryan Brotherhood, the Peckerwoods, the Soldiers of Aryan Culture and the Dirty White Boys “engaged in a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and other illegal narcotics throughout the Northern District of Texas and elsewhere,” according to the indictment.

The groups all have ties to white supremacist ideology, including the Ayran Circle, which believes “in the complete separation of the races.” The Aryan Brotherhood, meanwhile, may have as many as 20,000 members, the indictment says.

Many of the defendants “used firearms and physical violence to further their drug trafficking activities,” according to the indictment.

In one case, an unnamed victim was held hostage for several days by members of the Aryan Circle and Aryan Brotherhood of Texas after being accused of shorting the members $600 in meth sales. Authorities determined that Aryan Circle member James Mark Nelson had actually stolen the money, then convinced other supremacists that the victim had done it, according to the indictment.

Nelson, along with suspects Ralph “Evil” Adams, Jerry “Looney” Lunsford and Amanda Gallippo, held the victim hostage sometime between January and February 2018, during which time they pointed a gun at the victim’s head and threatened to kill him.

“During this period, Nelson used a black hatchet to chop off a portion of Victim A’s left index finger,” the indictment says. The victim was later released.

U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox announced the arrests in a news conference on Monday.

“These white supremacist gangs have long plagued our communities and prisons,” Cox said.

The meth-selling operation between the groups began as early as 2015, authorities said.

“Throughout the investigation, agents stopped the flow or seized over 190 kilograms of methamphetamine, 31 firearms, and seized approximately $376,587 in cash,” the U.S. attorney’s office said in a statement.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the company’s annual developers’ conference on May 1. Stephen Lam / Reuters

Facebook stands accused of gathering substantially more information on users than it admits, according to claims laid out in court documents filed at the superior court in San Mateo, California, on behalf of a former startup, The Guardian first reported Thursday.

The former startup, Six4Three, alleges that Facebook once used its associated apps to gather information on users by accessing text messages and photos, listening through device microphones and remotely turning on Bluetooth to pinpoint location ― sometimes without explicit consent.

Six4Three detailed the accusations in the fifth version of its official complaint, initially filed in 2015.

Although the case argues for the return of a Facebook policy that has been roundly criticized for failing to protect personal data, accusations of surveillance are enough to raise eyebrows in the wake of the privacy scandal wrought by the research firm Cambridge Analytica.

Rumors that Facebook is secretly listening via users’ microphones have persistently circulated due to anecdotal evidence from Facebook users who have described seeing ads on the site oddly related to topics they discussed earlier. The company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg was even asked about ― and denied ― the theory at an April U.S. Senate hearing.

“These claims have no merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement provided to HuffPost. Facebook’s main interest, she said, is protecting “the user experience.”

Six4Three started waging its battle against the social media giant in early 2015, when, after announcing that it would do so one year before, Facebook axed a policy that allowed third-party developers access to personal information. The startup had offered a controversial app for $1.99 called Pikinis that allowed users to easily locate friends’ swimsuit photos.

The app failed to take off, and the policy change spelled the end of it. Pikinis is now defunct.

Six4Three laid out its disturbing claims against Facebook in a January complaint unearthed by The Guardian.

In the filing, the startup says Facebook “explore[d] and implement[ed] ways to track users’ location, to track and read their texts, to access and record their microphones on their phones, to track and monitor their usage of competitive apps on their phones, and to track and monitor their calls” from about 2013 through 2015.

Specifically, the suit alleges that Facebook accessed and monitored Android users’ microphones without getting explicit permission from some of them.

Facebook stated in March that call and text logging is an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite, a pared-down version of the site for Android users. But the company said the feature allows it to check only contact information and not the content of calls or texts.

Six4Three also alleged that Facebook has meddled with iPhone photo albums. According to the filing, the company “has not fully disclosed the manner in which it preprocesses photos on the iOS camera roll, meaning if a user has any Facebook app installed on their iPhone, then Facebook accesses and analyzes (using facial and other image recognition) the photos the user takes and/or stores on the iPhone.”

The suit appears to refer to photo syncing, a feature that uploads photos from a device into a private Facebook album for easier sharing; Facebook says users must opt into the feature. The Moments app, which Facebook introduced in 2015, also syncs photos.

In another claim, the company says Facebook “implemented a project” to remotely turn on Bluetooth in users’ devices without fully disclosing doing so, in order to discern their location.

The startup also states that Facebook used data from Onavo, an app it purchased in 2013, to study what people did on their phones beyond using Facebook, “including detailed information on things such as which apps people generally are using, how frequently, for how long, and whether more women than men use an app in a specific country.”

Six4Three alleged that Facebook only partially disclosed that it was gathering such data from users.

Lawyers for the startup did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

Court documents filed last week contain emails and messages between Facebook’s senior managers that are currently sealed but may become public in the coming weeks, pending a decision from Judge V. Raymond Swope.A black former White House staffer is speaking out after someone in his new neighborhood reported him to police for armed burglary while he was moving into his New York City apartment.

Darren Martin said he was carrying boxes into his fifth-floor walk-up on Manhattan’s Upper West Side late Friday night when he was stopped by six police officers.

“Can’t go nowhere without the cops following me,” Martin says in a social media video that captures the intense encounter.

I was happy to move back to NYC and into my new apt in the UWS, near Harlem. The plan was to do this today in daylight, recording all the pomp that comes along with such a move. Well, life and work happens and you end up having to move on a Friday night at 11pm, and unexpectedly, pic.twitter.com/D16sHCEI7i — Darren D. Martin (@MartinDarrenD) April 28, 2018

In the video, the officers order him to remain in his building’s hallway as they investigate the reported “burglary in progress.”

A police dispatcher, speaking through an officer’s radio, says officers received a call about someone “trying to break into the door.” The caller, according to the dispatcher, described Martin as armed with “possibly a weapon, a large tool.”

A police spokesperson confirmed that officers responded to a suspected burglary at the building to HuffPost on Tuesday. The spokesperson added that an investigation into the call concluded that no crime had been committed.

Martin, who said he originally planned to move in during the day but was delayed because of work, highlighted on Twitter how badly the situation could have turned.

“I was blessed enough to be released and not become a hashtag,” he said, alluding to the number of fatal police shootings of unarmed black men. “This was a tame encounter compared to others I’ve been in and witnessed.”

Martin, who previously worked in communications with the Obama administration, now works for the NYC Department of Social Services, according to his LinkedIn. He stressed that he has no doubt that his skin color, in a gentrifying area near Harlem, prompted the 911 call.

“As a black man when you’re in an all-white environment, you’re cognizant of that,” Martin, a Bronx native who returned to work for the city, told New York’s PIX 11. “I have to say I found it kinda symbolic. [It’s] like welcome to the neighborhood.”

Officers eventually cleared Martin of any wrongdoing, but the feeling that he was left with did not go away.

“The next & lingering pit in my stomach came from how my neighbors viewed me,” he tweeted. “How they officially welcomed me into the building. Call the police on this Black man who DEFINITELY doesn’t live here. The man who worked for President Obama and now serves his fellow New Yorkers.”

Martin concluded that moving into a fifth-floor walk-up is tough, but it’s nothing compared to doing it while being racially profiled by one’s own neighbors.Andrew Yang is running for president with an appealing offer: He wants to give Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 “free” money each month.

His other policy proposals include universal Medicare and statehood for Puerto Rico. Though his controversial ideas make his candidacy a longshot, Yang, a 43-year-old father of two, hopes at least to draw attention to what he says is a looming employment crisis.

A successful tech entrepreneur himself, Yang expects that the proliferation of industrial robotics and artificial intelligence will put millions — even tens of millions — of people out of a job. Worse, he says, America is completely unprepared to cope with this shift in the employment landscape.

So he’s running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 on a platform of universal basic income (UBI) with the tagline “let’s put humanity first.” He hopes that a $1,000-a-month stipend for all U.S. citizens can ease the pain of a future where much less human labor will be needed.

“I think we’re going through the greatest transition in human history and we’re dealing with it terribly.” - Andrew Yang, 2020 presidential hopeful

“I think we’re going through the greatest transition in human history and we’re dealing with it terribly,” Yang said. “We’re dealing with it by pretending it’s not happening.”

With average monthly rents easily topping $1,000 in big U.S. cities, Yang’s proposed UBI wouldn’t be enough for most people to live on, or at least not enough for the kind of life most Americans prefer. Instead, he believes it would supplement people’s current income and help ease financial anxiety for the underemployed. In April, the presidential hopeful announced he would put his UBI proposal into action and provide a New Hampshire resident with $12,000 throughout 2019.

Endorsements for Yang poured in after he announced his candidacy in February — especially from the tech industry, which has been having a love affair with the concept of UBI. Yang received high-profile media attention from outlets such as Vanity Fair and The New York Times.

Preparing For An Automated Future

Growing up, Yang wasn’t the most popular kid in school. In his book The War on Normal People, he describes his childhood in self-deprecating fashion: “I grew up a skinny Asian kid in upstate New York who was often ignored or picked on — like one of the kids from ‘Stranger Things’ but nerdier and with fewer friends.”

After graduating from Brown University and Columbia Law School, Yang brought his talents to startups, eventually helming a test-prep company that was later acquired by Kaplan in 2009. Yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that things were getting worse for the average American.

Yang took the money he earned from the sale and used it to set up a nonprofit, Venture for America, to create jobs in cities hit hardest by the financial crisis. But along the way, he became convinced that new job creation could no longer keep pace with automation.

UBI enthusiasts often point to studies predicting that the pace of automation is about to hit warp speed. One widely cited Oxford University study, for example, estimates 47 percent of jobs in the U.S. are at risk of being automated in the next 20 years.

President Donald Trump was elected in part, Yang said, because Americans were becoming impatient with the steady loss of secure middle-class jobs.

“Donald Trump diagnosed the problem very powerfully, and he’s president because of it,” Yang said. “The issue is that the solutions are nonsense: Hating immigrants, trying to freeze time or turn the clock backwards. We have to do the exact opposite. We have to accelerate our society and economy forward.”

That acceleration, he believes, means saying goodbye to the era of dependence on stable, full-time employment. The country’s low 4.1 percent unemployment rate, Yang said, is masking a much more ominous trend: underemployment. Definitions of underemployment vary, but in general, it means those who are working part time because they can’t find full-time work.

A March 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics report puts the number of “involuntary part-time workers” at 5 million. Furthermore, there are a lot of people “marginally attached” to the workforce — meaning they’ve been searching for a job in the past 12 months but haven’t found one — and they don’t show up in the unemployment rate either. And the situation, Yang believes, is about to get much worse.

“We have to start facing facts,” Yang said. “Self-driving cars and trucks are real and are going to eliminate millions of jobs. Artificial intelligence is real, and it’s going to eliminate millions of jobs. Even before we get there, 30 percent of malls are going to close, and one out of 10 Americans works in retail.”

Some think a UBI is unnecessary because there will always be jobs — even if we haven’t invented them yet. People in the ’60s had the same fears around automation and technology, but no one could have foreseen jobs of the 21st century such as social media or app development.

“Throughout history we’ve heard that this or that technological advancement would mean the end of jobs,” says Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who researches social welfare policy, health care reform and Social Security. “The large-scale movement of workers from agriculture to manufacturing, as well as the advent of the industrial revolution and its substitution of machine labor for individual hand labor, were greeted with complaints that there would soon be no more jobs.”

Tanner pointed to the time President Franklin Roosevelt actually slowed down government research and development during the Great Depression, out of fear that new inventions would further limit already-scarce jobs.

“Yet, somehow, the creative destruction of capitalism has always resulted in new jobs,” Tanner said. “The burden lies with UBI supporters to explain why this time is different.”

How future industries will affect job availability remains up for debate. Last year, research firm Gartner said that artificial intelligence will create more human jobs than automation eliminates. But the most ardent UBI proponents believe that, even if additional jobs are created, most people will be unable to upgrade their skills fast enough to keep up with the fickle and chaotic job market of the future.

An Argument For Free Money

Universal basic income is not a modern invention. In the 1960s, both civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and conservative economist Milton Friedman argued for the idea. Within the last decade, tech titans such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have thrown their support behind it, with the former arguing during a 2017 Harvard Commencement speech that it would promote innovation, giving “everyone a cushion to try new things.”

The idea tends to get more support from Democrats than Republicans, but has yet to break into mainstream political discourse. Americans are split over the idea, according to a recent Gallup/Northwestern poll that showed 48 percent in support of UBI and 52 percent who said they oppose it.

For Yang, no argument for UBI was more persuasive than that of Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union, which, with 2 million members, is one of the largest unions in the country. Stern’s 2016 book, Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew Our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream, illustrates how even labor leaders themselves are giving up on the idea of preserving full-time jobs in the era of automation and artificial intelligence.

The idea of guaranteed money from the government might feel at odds with traditional “American values” of self-reliance. Yet Alaska, which voted for Trump in 2016, already gives its residents a guaranteed payment every year from its Alaska Permanent Fund, a $60 billion state fund generated by oil revenues. Since 1982, every man, woman, and child who meets certain state residency requirements has received a yearly stipend, which can be as high as $2,000.

Paying For It

When it comes to the idea of a UBI, objections abound. Instead of viewing the proposal as a cushion that a majority of the population will need in an increasingly chaotic world, some see it as a license to be lazy.

Perhaps no objection is greater than affordability. UBI proposals differ, but Yang gives his plan a price tag of $2 trillion, which he says would be paid for in four ways. To harvest the gains from automation, the U.S. would need to pass a value-added tax on production and consumption, which would fall on most of the consumer economy — essentially adding a tax to everything we buy. Money currently spent on income support would be redirected to the UBI. Public spending on incarceration, homelessness, health care and other services would be lower, he posits, because the problems they address would be much less acute with a UBI in place. And additional tax revenue would be created by economic growth generated by a UBI: One recent study indicates that a UBI would put a greater amount of cash into circulation.

Some libertarians, such as political scientist and author Charles Murray, believe a UBI would be a better use of money than continuing to fund our current safety net, which tops $1 trillion per year according to some estimates. Murray sees UBI as “the least damaging way for the government to transfer wealth from some citizens to others,” but warns that it must replace the current welfare bureaucracy.

“If the guaranteed income is an add-on to the existing system, it will be as destructive as its critics fear,” Murray wrote in an article for The Wall Street Journal promoting UBI.

Another objection: Won’t handing out cash simply increase inflation? Not according to a July 2017 study by researchers at the Naval Postgraduate School, the University of Geneva, and Northwestern University. If there’s any effect on inflation, it would be extremely mild, the report suggests. Such studies, though, have not stopped some UBI detractors from calling the idea “inflation on a stick.”

Moving Forward

One of the biggest obstacles facing UBI proponents is the fact that most high-profile Democrats are lukewarm — if not implacably opposed — to the idea.

Take Hillary Clinton: “I was fascinated by this idea, as was my husband, and we spent weeks working with our policy team to see if it could be viable enough to include in my campaign. We would call it ‘Alaska for America,’” Clinton wrote in her 2017 book What Happened. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t make the numbers work.”

Joe Biden calls UBI proponents “class clueless,” fearing that it would de-emphasize work. And Bernie Sanders, while admitting he’s “sympathetic” to the idea, is much more animated by a $15 minimum wage.

Yang knows the odds of capturing the Democratic nomination, and then the White House, are unlikely. But he’s already scored endorsements from the aforementioned Andy Stern; Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures; and Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, as well as executives and alumni from Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

In a campaign like his, there are multiple ways to measure success, Yang said. “If I run for president, and I succeed in elevating universal basic income to become mainstream political wisdom, then that would be a mammoth victory.”

But she felt a twinge of resentment watching her husband, also a doctor, go to work each day to treat patients. “I was going through an identity crisis,” Sultan says. “After a while, I got fed up and I wanted to do something to be back in the field.”

Sultan found a way to practice medicine from home. DoctHERs, a telemedicine platform in Pakistan, connects unemployed or underemployed female doctors like Sultan to patients in remote areas. Despite having one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the world, pressure to prioritize families over careers means that around half of female medical school graduates never enter the workforce.

For those who do overcome myriad obstacles to practice medicine, many drop out of the labor force when they are married or have children. DoctHERs is “about them being able to participate in the workforce and feel a sense of autonomy,” says Asher Hasan, the organization’s co-founder.

Pakistan has one of the world’s lowest rates of female participation in the labor market — it is estimated only 25 percent of women over the age of 15 work. However, there are signs that technology is gradually transforming women’s participation in some areas of the labor force.

Pakistan accounts for 8 percent of the worldwide digital gig economy, trailing only India, Bangladesh and the United States. The rise of gig work (flexible, piecemeal jobs), say some experts, has provided many Pakistani women a foothold in the new digital economy, in some cases shifting women into the primary breadwinner role.

“The gig economy is a unique economic opportunity for women in Pakistan... allowing women to earn a living or access a service from the home when cultural constraints may not allow them to work outside the home,” says Saadia Zahidi, author of Fifty Million Rising: The New Generation of Working Women Transforming the Muslim World.

Sultan normally works in the evenings, when her husband can take over childcare. She selects the number of days and hours she works, and gets paid per video consultation. “They can switch their availability on and off,” adds DoctHERs’ Hasan. “They get to decide their own hours.”

DoctHERs has also been a boon for patients. “People love the idea of having a doctor a message away,” Sultan says. “They don’t have to go to the clinics and wait two hours for an appointment.” Some also feel more comfortable divulging health problems to a woman over a screen. Recently, a female patient disclosed to Sultan that she had been suffering from urinary incontinence for over a decade. In rural Pakistan, it was difficult to find a female doctor to speak to about what the patient saw as an embarrassing ailment.

The digitization of the gig economy hasn’t provided opportunities to everyone, however. Pakistan’s Internet penetration rate is only 22 percent, so most can’t take advantage of technology-based work platforms that favor the urban, English-speaking elite.

And while some digital platforms can afford women greater opportunities, they can also reinforce industry biases and patterns of gender segregation in hiring.

“There is evidence that women are more likely to be hired for “female” jobs (secretarial, writing/translation), but less likely to be hired for “male” jobs (IT and programming),” says University of Southern California professor Hernan Galperin, the lead researcher behind the Future of Work in the Global South initiative. “This type of gender discrimination tends to reinforce sorting mechanisms that lead women to lower-paying jobs and careers,” says Galperin. A 2017 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development highlighted that women in the gig economy might experience reduced job quality while benefiting from more flexibility.

Moreover, the problems that bedevil the gig economy worldwide do not vanish in emerging economies — most positions lack insurance plans, regular sick days or vacation time. However, the absence of these safety nets is felt less acutely in economies that rarely provide them in the first place. “In Pakistan, we don’t have a trend of health insurance,” says 31-year-old Faiza Yousuf, a freelance app tester and business analyst in Karachi.

Faiza Yousuf, 31, a freelance app tester and business analyst in Karachi, says few people in Pakistan expect to get employer-provided health coverage. Faiza Yusuf

For workers who have never benefited from traditional economic protections, the upsides of the gig economy may outweigh the drawbacks. Yousuf finds jobs through freelance marketplaces like Upwork, a global platform for independent contractors.

For her part, she hasn’t experienced any disadvantage from being a woman in the gig economy. Part of the appeal of freelancing online is that international clients “don’t care about your gender,” Yousuf says. “It helps women, especially the ones who are swamped with care work.” Yousuf and her brother are their parents’ primary caretakers, tending to health issues while working full time. Yousuf says the gig economy offers her economic independence and the flexibility to pursue the kind of work she wants.

In a leafy Lahore neighborhood, 28-year-old Farzana Asif is wearing a crisp, gray uniform. In 2013, her husband paid approximately $1,300 to find a job in a Dubai hotel. When he arrived in Dubai, he discovered he had been conned and the job did not exist. The couple had scrounged together the recruitment fee by selling Asif’s jewelry, taking out loans and exhausting their savings.

“It was very difficult for me,” Asif said, whose baby was just 13 days old then. “I had to take care of my child and pay for the household.”

Farzana Asif, 28, is an independent beautician who works for a company that operates similarly to Uber. Farzana Asif

Before marriage, Asif worked at a beauty salon, earning $127 a month. At times, upper-class women would ask Asif to drop by their homes for a pedicure or waxing. The job was inconsistent and the pay highly variable. Since it operated informally, Asif often accepted whatever paltry sum the women doled out.

At-home beauticians have long contended with a lack of standardized rates and exclusion from the formal labor force, says Shameelah Ismail, one of four co-founders of GharPar, an online social enterprise that allows women to work as independent beauticians, delivering at-home services to women across Lahore. By connecting women to the GharPar platform, Ismail says, “the informal market is converted to the formal.”

Asif is now the household’s breadwinner, sometimes bringing home up to $500 a month as a freelance beautician for GharPar. “I’m the only one working in my family,” Asif says.

GharPar has echoes of the Uber model: A beautician receives a request on her phone, which she can either accept or decline. She gets paid on commission, and absorbs the hard costs of running a business, including paying for her own uniform, beauty toolkit and transportation. At the end of a service, the user rates the beautician.

“If we want the economy to boom, we need to tap the women.” - Shameelah Ismail, a co-founder of GharPar

Most salons only pay a fixed salary of around $150 a month, Ismail says, regardless of the number of customers. “In my salon job, even if I put more work into the job, my salary was the same at the end of the month,” Asif says. “Here, if I put in more work, I get paid more; if I put in less, I get less. It’s fair.”

Still, while GharPar has enabled women to become breadwinners, not all men have approved of women in their household taking the lead economic role. “Male members of the family think: ‘If my wife or daughter becomes financially independent, I won’t be able to control her,’” Ismail says.

For this reason, many of the freelance beauticians GharPar contracts have their husband or a brother drive them to a client’s house. “The men see it as a family business where they’re also stakeholders,” says GharPar co-founder Arooj Ismail.

Ultimately, according to women like Asif, the gig economy’s flexible, part-time work model — long derided as precarious and exploitative in West — may prove beneficial, accommodating dual mother/worker roles and allowing women to join the labor force at times when they would usually drop out to concentrate on their families.

“After getting married, I wasn’t working at all because I had a child,” says Asif. Today, she typically sees two to three clients a day and juggles parenting and work. “I don’t need to ask anyone for money because I earn my own money.”

“The entire purpose was to give economic independence,” Shameelah Ismail says. “If we want the economy to boom, we need to tap the women. When they see their mothers are the ones earning and the main breadwinners, their mindsets change. They are more open to women working, and the entire society changes.”Negative comments have rained down on a pro-gun political ad by controversial Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in which the Republican points a shotgun at a young man supposedly interested in dating one of Kemp’s daughters as the teen professes a “healthy appreciation” for the Second Amendment.

Viewers are demanding that an Atlanta television station stop running it. “We are gun owners and we are outraged,” one told Atlanta NBC affiliate 11 Alive. Kemp is currently Georgia’s secretary of state.

“I’m a conservative businessman with a four-point plan to put hardworking Georgians first,” Kemp said in a tweet Friday when he unveiled the ad. ”I’m also the proud father of three teenage girls. Here’s the thing: If you want to date one of my daughters, you better have respect for women and a healthy appreciation for the Second Amendment.”

While his shotgun is “broken” open and unable to fire as the ad starts, he closes it up at the end and aims it at the boy, which viewers found especially disturbing, particularly in the wake of school shooting deaths. Other weapons lean against the wall in Kemp’s “study” in the ad.

Some viewers took Kemp’s “aw shucks” attitude in the ad as an attempt at down-home humor (or an “audition” for “Saturday Night Live”) and found it hilarious. But most people responding on Facebook and YouTube were horrified that Kemp appeared to be threatening a minor with a gun.

“After young children have lost their life to gunfire you set there flopping around a gun with a minor. Wow,” wrote one viewer on Facebook.

Another called it “all sorts of stupid.” Others were furious that Kemp seemed to fortify negative stereotypes about Georgia.

Kemp hadn’t yet defended the ad by late Monday. He directed a supporter on Facebook to his campaign website.

Atlanta TV-11 issued a statement Monday saying that, despite an onslaught of complaints about the ad, it can’t be removed or altered because the Federal Communications Commission’s “political broadcast rules prohibit television stations from refusing or altering political advertising from any legally qualified candidate.”

Kemp is one of seven GOP candidates hoping to replace Republican Gov. Nathan Deal. The battle among them for Georgia’s gun-toting voters is intense. Earlier in April, former Republican state Sen. Hunter Hill, who’s also running in the primary, aired an ad that showed him loading a semiautomatic rifle while proposing to lower the legal age for all firearm purchases to 18.

Not only is Kemp a staunch gun backer, he also supports a “sales tax holiday on guns.” He also believes he can get Georgia working. “I know what it takes to build a business — God’s favor and hard work,” he wrote on Facebook.

A recent poll by the Atlanta Journal Constitution and Channel 2 News found that 47 percent of likely Republican primary voters and 90 percent of likely Democratic voters want stricter gun laws.

The primary is May 22.Prince Louis’ birth certificate was delivered Tuesday, making official his already announced name: His Royal Highness Prince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge.

But the best parts of the document are the listed occupations of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, his parents.

“Prince of the United Kingdom” and “Princess of the United Kingdom” would sure look good on a resume too, wouldn’t they?

Chip Gaines dismissed an online article that accused him and his “Fixer Upper” co-star wife Joanna of failing to put their family first.

Gaines said he doesn’t know USA Today contributor Daryl Austin, whose article last week wondered how the HGTV stars could “even find the time to brush their teeth, let alone spend quality, one-on-one time with each child daily.” But Gaines rejected the criticism, and said it’s possible to have both “an amazing family AND career you love.”

“I don’t know daryl, & he clearly doesn’t know me,” Gaines wrote on Twitter. “But for the record: If there is ever a need w/ my family (1st), I’ll shut this circus down so fast it will make your head spin. BUT jo & I believe, w/ God anything is possible. Including having an amazing family AND career you love.”

Austin argued the Gaineses have too many business ventures and TV commitments to live up to the child-centric image they present. The couple, who are expecting their fifth child together, recently wrapped the final season of their hit show, “Fixer Upper,” and said they now want to focus on one thing: their family.

“Chip and Joanna Gaines did not get where they are by putting their family first,” Austin wrote. “They want to be seen as a couple that can do it all while at the same time making their family their top priority. This is just not possible, and it does a disservice to the parents who really are putting their children first.”

The author added: “No matter how rich and famous, we are all limited by the same 24 hours in a day. You cannot do all they’ve done (or even a fraction of it) and still have any real time left over for family. Frankly, I wonder where they even find the time to brush their teeth, let alone spend quality, one-on-one time with each child daily.”

Chip Gaines

Joanna Gaines talked about the couple’s decision to leave “Fixer Upper” in an AOL Build interview last year.

″For people, they think there’s got to be a reason, like, ’Oh, something bad happened and therefore that’s why they’re leaving the show,′” she said. “I think it’s just hard for people to comprehend, no, we’re just leaving because it’s right instinctively for us and our family. No negative reason.”

Chip Gaines’ mother, Gayle Gaines, offered additional insight into why the couple were walking away from their show in a 2017 interview with Closer Weekly.

Chip and Joanna “earned some time to rest,” Gayle Gaines said. “They care very much about how their children turn out, and they are very well aware that spending time with them and investing in their lives is important.”

And pretty soon, they’ll have another little one to look after.Adams cites other reports and implores the 40-year-old rapper to “start by dealing with the facts.”

“Love deals with truth. Over the past ten years, I have tolerated all the errors, misinformation and frank lies told be reporters, journalists and people on the street out of respect for the doctor-patient privilege and your mother. Nonetheless, do not mistake kindness for weakness,” wrote Adams toward the end of the letter.

Recent reports say that the rapper is set up to launch a social program for Chicago on behalf of his mother called DONDA Social. The initiative will supposedly “help Chicago residents in need and will serve as the latest offshoot of the DONDA creative collective.”Kanye West dropped by TMZ on Tuesday to tell the newsroom staff that he loves President Donald Trump and that he believes slavery “sounds like a choice,” only to get completely shut down by writer Van Lathan.

“When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,” West said.

“Like, you was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all? It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word ‘prison’ because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It’s like slavery, Holocaust. Holocaust, Jews. Slavery is blacks. So, prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. We’re the human race,” he continued.

In the snippet from “TMZ Live,” West is shown asking the entire newsroom: “Do you feel that I’m feeling ... do you feel that I’m being free and I’m thinking free?”

Kanye with the worst take yet

That’s when Lathan hopped up and said he didn’t think West was thinking anything.

“I think what you’re doing right now is actually the absence of thought and the reason why I feel like that is because, Kanye, you’re entitled to your opinion,” said Lathan.

The sportswriter and podcast host then explained what it’s like being a black man when you’re not famous or creatively talented like Kanye West:

You’re entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real world, real life consequence behind everything you just said. And while you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice.

Lathan said he was not only “disappointed” and “appalled,” but also hurt: “I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that is not real.”

The clip ends with Lathan insisting that West be responsible and West apologizing profusely. HuffPost reached out to Lathan for further comment and did not immediately get a response.

The responses to West’s comments have already set social media ablaze:

I’m not even mad at Kanye. I think what he’s publicly doing is a perfect example of how a large portion of the country feels and thinks. There’s a tide of miseducation and falsehoods and conspiracies that prey on those who are susceptible. Kanye is one of them. — Kevin McHale (@druidDUDE) May 1, 2018

West also told TMZ that his recently shared thoughts on Trump, which have upset many people over the last few weeks, emerged from his “subconscious.”

“It was a feeling I had. ... I just love Trump.”

On Tuesday evening, West attempted to clarify his comments in a series of tweets. Here are some of them:

My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) May 1, 2018

we are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) May 1, 2018

the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought It was just an idea — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) May 1, 2018

For some reason, “Arrested Development” creator Mitch Hurwitz has remixed the fourth season of his own show, ahead of the much-anticipated debut of Season 5, and on Tuesday he tweeted its imminent release.

“Arrested Development Season 4 Remix: Fateful Consequences” will present the events of that season in chronological order on Netflix beginning Friday, May 4 ― which also happens to be a Bluth universe holiday known as Cinco de Cuatro.

In his lengthy message to fans, Hurwitz noted that the show had followed a nontraditional format throughout Season 4, to some viewers’ frustrations. Many of the original cast members were not able to film together for the 2013 season due to scheduling conflicts, and so episodes focused on individual characters and jumped forward and backward in time.

It was, Hurwitz wrote, “in some ways to be an experience for that viewer, perhaps, akin to eating some toast, then some bacon ― maybe a sliced tomato followed by some turkey and realizing ‘Hey I think I just had a BLT.’” (He later changed that to “Hey I think I just had a club sandwich,” after a reader pointed out what happens to a BLT when you add turkey.)

At times during Season 4, producers relied on green screens to artificially insert actors into scenes ― which some viewers found awkward.

Hurwitz’s announcement comes about three-and-a-half years after he first mentioned his odd recutting project ― and hopefully does not signal how long it took him to accomplish the feat.

Although he tweeted that Season 5 will drop “soon” ― “[l]ike really soon” ― Hurwitz neglected to mention precisely when to expect it.

In the remix, the series creator shuffled footage “from 15 individualized stories into 22 interwoven stories the length of the original series.” He said he pursued it not only as a blatant cash grab but “as a comedic experiment to see if new jokes and a new perspective would emerge from a remix that features all the Bluths in every episode. ... And I’m really excited about the final result.”

On the next... Arrested Development pic.twitter.com/NjP26k9KE7 — Arrested Development (@arresteddev) May 1, 20189-1-1, yes this is an emergency: Blake Lively just did the unthinkable ― unfollow Ryan Reynolds on Instagram.

The “Gossip Girl” star sent her fans into a tailspin on Tuesday when she went dark on Instagram, deleting all of her photos from her account (um, where will we go to feel bad about ourselves now?) and unfollowing all of her celebrity friends along with Reynolds, her husband.

Confused? Us, too. Lively is currently promoting her new mystery film, “A Simple Favor,” co-starring Anna Kendrick. Based on the novel of the same name, the film follows Kendrick’s character as she searches for her best friend named Emily Nelson (Lively) who unexpectedly goes missing.

Instagram

Before she scrubbed her social media, Lively posted a cryptic message to her 20 million-plus followers with a picture of a game of hangman.

She later completed the game to spell “What happened to Emily?” which also happens to be her new bio.

The actress now only follows 28 seemingly random people named Emily Nelson, one of whom was especially shaken by the news that Blake freakin’ Lively deemed her account worthy.

“Does anyone want to tell me why Blake Lively followed me and had this as a bio,” that one Emily Nelson asked. “Goodbye cruel world some hacker is anti-Emily, my time has come :-)”

Reynolds apparently liked the tweet, signaling that he’s very much in cahoots with his wife, who, in case you forgot, he loves to troll on social media.

“ALRIGHT SO LONG FUCKING LOSERS MY EGO IS ETERNALLY THROUGH THE ROOF BYE,” the same Emily Nelson wrote after the “Deadpool” actor showed her some love.

Lively’s BFF Taylor Swift pulled a similar publicity stunt ahead of announcing her latest album “Reputation” last year, only to re-emerge with videos of a slithering snake.

BRB, changing my name to Emily Nelson.The hardware on Uber’s self-driving car that struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Arizona this March worked just fine, a new report found — it’s the software that failed.

That’s one of several takeaways from a preliminary report released Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, which found Uber’s self-driving Volvo SUV observed the woman six seconds before the fatal crash, but failed to take any action to avoid her.

On-board software initially classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, and finally as a bicycle in the seconds leading up to the crash, though the vehicle couldn’t definitively predict the bike’s path and adjust accordingly.

1.3 seconds before the collision, the SUV was traveling at about 40 mph and determined an “emergency braking maneuver” was necessary. No such action was taken, however, as the system is currently disabled “to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,” the NTSB said.

Uber told HuffPost it disables the emergency braking system on all of its Volvo SUVs while the cars are operating in autonomous mode as it’s a Volvo system, not an Uber system. That aligns with a report earlier this month that concluded the Uber did in fact recognize the woman, but failed to avoid her because of a software setting.

A human safety driver who was in the Uber at the time should have intervened and taken control of the car, but didn’t. Video from the accident shows the driver wasn’t looking at the road, and instead was “monitoring the self-driving system interface,” she told NTSB investigators.

Uber suspended all of its self-driving operations after the accident, and permanently ceased testing in Arizona on Wednesday. An Uber spokesperson told HuffPost that when it resumes testing in its two remaining cities of San Francisco and Pittsburgh, it will likely be on a more limited basis.

Adding to the confusion, the median the pedestrian crossed prior to the collision features two prominent brick-colored pathways, seen below forming a broad “X”:

National Transportation Safety Board

Despite looking like a safe spot to cross, however, the paths aren’t meant for pedestrians. A spokesperson for the City of Tempe declined to comment on the median’s design or the intended purpose of the brick pathways, citing the ongoing investigation.

The NTSB report also noted the pedestrian tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. That information is of limited use ― the Uber should have identified and avoided her either way ― but it does potentially provide insight into why she didn’t cross at the crosswalk 360 feet to the north, and why she was unaware of the vehicle until immediately before impact.

Investigators added the woman crossed in a section of road that isn’t illuminated by street lights, was wearing dark clothing at the time, and her bicycle had no reflectors that were visible to the car.

“Over the course of the last two months, we’ve worked closely with the NTSB,” Uber said in an emailed statement to HuffPost Thursday. “As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program.”A network of Chicago charter schools has policies so strict that some menstruating girls are bleeding through their pants for lack of permitted bathroom breaks, an NPR affiliate reported on Monday.

In early April, NPR Illinois outlined the “dehumanizing” disciplinary practices at the Noble Network of Charter Schools, which has 18 campuses that serve 12,000 students in the area. Teachers and students subsequently reported other practices, including strictly limited bathroom visits.

“We have [bathroom] escorts, and they rarely come so we end up walking out [of class] and that gets us in trouble,” an anonymous student texted to an NPR reporter. “But who wants to walk around knowing there’s blood on them? It can still stain the seats. They just need to be more understanding.”

A spokesman for the charter school network confirmed to HuffPost that students are given an escort to the restroom during class, which works similarly to having a hall pass.

Feminine hygiene products can leak if they aren’t changed every few hours. Tampons that aren’t changed regularly can cause toxic shock syndrome, a life-threatening type of bacterial infection.

Noble Network of Charter Schools has carved out an exemption in the dress code so menstruating students who stain their clothes can tie their school sweatshirts around their waists, NPR reported. An email to staff members names the girls who are exempt from the dress code so they don’t garner demerits.

Students receive automatic detention after four demerits in a two-week period and are required to take a “character development” course after 13 such detentions, according to NPR’s first report. Prior to the 2017-2018 school year, Noble schools charged students $140 to take the behavioral course.

Wow: At a network of Chicago charter schools, bathroom breaks are so infrequent that girls regularly bleed through their pants when they have their periods. The administration's solution: Give special permission to tie a sweatshirt around their waists. https://t.co/fJ67IIF8o2 pic.twitter.com/3jZC7DQtxj — Jessica Roy 🦅 (@jessica_roy) April 30, 2018

One teacher told NPR that the school is disconnected from its predominately black student body, and students sometimes resist the stringent policies.

“One student says it best, ‘When you treat us like animals, what do you think we are gonna act like?’” the teacher told NPR anonymously, for fear of retaliation.

Constance Jones Brewer, president of the Noble Network of Charter Schools, released a statement to HuffPost rejecting the NPR report’s characterization of the bathroom policy. Brewer’s statement claimed that the schools were being attacked as a result of the “unfortunate political and emotional debate” around charter schools.

“Let me be clear - Noble absolutely accommodates our students during menstruation, including bathroom trips whenever the student needs one,” Brewer said in a statement. “This is the same accommodation as high schools everywhere, and I would tolerate nothing less from my organization. We love our students and it is our sacred responsibility to ensure their health and safety. We also know that stains are still not 100% preventable for factors that are private to each student, but when they happen, our schools provide supportive solutions as quickly as possible.”

These solutions include borrowing clean uniform items from the school’s office and covering the stains, as previously mentioned.

Scott Cameron, executive editor of the Illinois Newsroom, told HuffPost in a statement that the affiliate stands by the reported article.

“Our story focused on a range of responses to a previous piece about discipline policies at Noble schools,” Cameron said. “This issue was one part of the response. As we previously reported Noble discipline policies vary by campus. Sources on several different Noble campuses independently shared experiences about a lack of bathroom access. Additional sources also came forward with similar experiences after publication. We stand by the story. ”

This article has been updated with a statement from the Noble Network of Charter Schools and NPR Illinois.President Donald Trump’s doctor claims that Trump himself wrote the bizarre letter of health that included results from a 2015 physical suspiciously written with many superlatives, CNN reported Tuesday.

Trump’s presidential campaign released the letter, signed by his personal physician Dr. Harold Bornstein, after Trump’s health came into question in 2015.

“Mr. Trump has had a recent complete medical examination that showed only positive results,” Bornstein’s letter read. “Actually, his blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent.”

“His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,” Bornstein continued. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”

Bornstein told CNN on Tuesday that Trump essentially wrote the letter himself.

“He dictated that whole letter. I didn’t write that letter,” Bornstein told CNN. “I just made it up as I went along.”

Trump has been Bornstein’s patient since 1980, according to the doctor’s original letter.

Bornstein, who is based in New York City, told NBC News earlier Tuesday that White House aide Keith Schiller (Trump’s longtime personal bodyguard), Trump Organization chief legal officer Alan Garten and an unidentified “large man” raided his office in search of medical records in 2017.

The surprise raid allegedly took place in February 2017, two days after Bornstein told The New York Times that he had prescribed Propecia, a medication that promotes hair growth, for Trump for years. Bornstein also told the paper that Trump took medications to treat cholesterol and rosacea, a common skin disease that causes redness.

During the raid on Bornstein’s office, Trump’s team took all of the president’s medical records, including the only copies of Trump’s charts and lab reports. They also reportedly told Bornstein to take down a framed photo of Trump and Bornstein from a wall in the waiting room.

The incident left the doctor feeling “raped, frightened and sad,” Bornstein NBC News. “They must have been here for 25 or 30 minutes. It created a lot of chaos.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Boston Globe reporter Matt Viser that the alleged raid of Bornstein’s office was “standard procedure” for a newly elected president.
