Der Spiegel/Twitter

Germany’s respected weekly news publication Der Spiegel doesn’t much care for Donald Trump. But after the U.S. president announced the nation is withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, the magazine pulled out all the stops, portraying Trump on its cover as a blond-mopped middle finger flipping off all of Europe. “Goodbye, Europe!” says the digit.

The magazine, which hit newsstands Friday, has already triggered an avalanche of comments. A tweet featuring the cover was quickly retweeted by Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the U.S.

Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas lamented the fact that the image is how Europe now regards the U.S. “When America First actually means America Alone, the United States is significantly weaker,” he tweeted.

The cover, created by artist Edel Rodriquez, is accompanied inside by a scathing editorial. “Clever resistance is necessary, as sad and absurd as that may sound: Resistance against America,” states the piece.

Trump’s life is built on falsehoods: Women don’t actually lust after him, he is not a skilled businessman and he has no strategy, states Der Spiegel. “Trump is only proficient in destruction.”

His decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal “marks the temporary suspension of the trans-Atlantic alliance.” He is again bringing “chaos where there was once order,” the magazine says.

“Our relationship to the United States cannot currently be called a friendship and can hardly be referred to as a partnership,” says Der Spiegel. “The West as we once knew it no longer exists. It is impossible to overstate what Trump has dismantled in the last 16 months.”

As an American, I hang my head in shame. — Mush 🌊 (@mush_seely) May 11, 2018Jimmy Kimmel threw shade at disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein while praising “The Shape of Water” for dominating the 2018 Oscar nominations.

The Guillermo del Toro-directed romantic thriller about a mute woman who falls in love with a mysterious underwater creature received 13 nominations for this year’s Academy Awards.

“Finally Hollywood is recognizing a monster other than Harvey Weinstein,” the comedian quipped on Tuesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

Kimmel, who returns as host for this year’s ceremony on March 4, then highlighted some noteworthy nomination omissions and even managed to get in a joke about President Donald Trump.

Of course, he couldn’t resist poking fun at last year’s Best Picture flub, which he addressed to amusing effect in the commercial below:

What goes best with your Super Bowl chips and dip platter? How about watching a beloved character perish.

At this point, “This Is Us” should probably be renamed “This Is Emotional Manipulation,” because for nearly two seasons it’s been teasing the on-screen death of forever WB hunk Milo Ventimiglia.

Well, the time has come to reveal exactly how Jack (Ventimiglia) kicks the proverbial bucket, and it happens to be right after the Super Bowl. The NBC tearjerker has landed the coveted post-game slot for a special episode.

In a trailer released on Tuesday, fans are treated to a collage of some of the Pearson family’s most heartwarming moments before we see their home engulfed in flames.

“Take deep breaths,” Jack yells, as his kids start to panic.

This is the episode.



Tune in Sunday, February 4 after the Super Bowl and set your DVR with extra time so you don't miss a single minute. #ThisIsUs pic.twitter.com/yBpnIlqLrC — This Is Us (@NBCThisisUs) January 24, 2018

The mystery of Jack’s death has fascinated fans of the series with hints ― a battery-less smoke detector, a defective crock pot, etc. ― sprinkled throughout episodes. Last week’s installment ended with a major cliffhanger, as the family’s home burned down.

Ventimiglia has confirmed that the episode will be “an absolute soul-crushing event,” so if you’re in your feels after the big game it might serve you well to change the channel.

He added: “Once you figure out the moment where it’s going to happen, you may get some hope — and then it’s all going to go away.”

Gulp.Much like the cat that looked like “Girls” and “Star Wars” actor Adam Driver, the internet is going crazy for this dog that many think resembles actress Laura Dern.

Twitter user Margaret Lyons tweeted out a photo of Kimchee the Maltipoo, an adorable dog with over 6,300 Instagram followers.

Dern had a great sense of humor about her doggie doppelgänger and shared the photo with followers on her Twitter account.

“Should she have played Renata in Big Little Lies?!” the actress jokingly tweeted.

Kimchee’s owner, Erica Ngo, told HuffPost this is the first time the pet has been compared to the actress.

“We love that Kimchee is getting affectionate attention from the internet and that Laura was so gracious in playing along,” Ngo said, via email.

She added, “We are surely flattered for any comparison between our Kimchee and an admirable woman like Miss Dern. We of course communicated [the] news to our sweet pup mostly with extra belly rubs and boiled chicken, both of which were certainly well received.”

Perhaps Kimchee could score a Season 2 appearance on Dern’s hit HBO show?

We’ll be waiting.Chrissy Teigen does not have time for foolishness.

In true Chrissy fashion, the Queen of Twitter decided to voice her opinion about the 2018 Oscar nominations on Tuesday shortly after they were announced.

In her tweet, Teigen showed her support for two specific movies, one being Jordan Peele’s horror-thriller “Get Out.” The film — in which things go very, very wrong when a black man meets his white girlfriend’s family — received nods for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor, the last thanks to lead Daniel Kaluuya.

John said I can’t talk shit about any nominated movies so I will simply say Get Out and I,Tonya should win everything also one of the highly nominated movies sucks — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 23, 2018

Though Teigen didn’t name which nominated movie she thinks “sucks” (“Lady Bird”? “The Shape of Water”? “The Boss Baby”?), she did immediately clap back when another Twitter user called “Get Out” “predictable.”

(If you have yet to watch, be warned: There’s spoilers ahead.)

Get Out was so predictable it was terrible! — Sartorialist (@sartorialblog) January 23, 2018

There is literally nothing predictable about Get Out.

Yet the “Get Out” hater still wasn’t convinced.

Come on, you couldn't see it was a trap? Of course I didn't see it from the start but after a while... — Sartorialist (@sartorialblog) January 23, 2018

The Twitter user’s response inspired other users to jump on the Teigen bandwagon.

I mean, could it be that you're not seeing (and therefore can't appreciate) the nuance/layers to the movie? — Stephanie Tran (@YouAndYourEgo) January 23, 2018Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” was not only one of the most commercially successful films of 2017, it was a smartly executed, critically acclaimed horror-thriller that tackled systemic racism.

Despite some early award season snubs, Peele’s directorial debut was recognized with four Oscar nominations on Tuesday ― Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for Daniel Kaluuya.

Peele, 38, spoke about the honor in an interview with the Los Angeles Times published Tuesday, in which he explained why he had given up on his directing dreams early in his career.

“I left my dream of being a director behind long ago, and I think that was because, while I have a great respect for film, I didn’t really believe there was a place for very many black directors,” he told the newspaper. “I thought it would be harder for me as a person of color to convince someone to let me use their money to make a movie. Many years later after an odyssey through acting and comedy, I came back to my original dream. And the fact that it’s been received the way it has been received teaches me a lot about how I internalized the system.”WASHINGTON ― U.S. Park Police shot and killed an unarmed American man of Iranian descent in Fairfax County, Virginia, last November. In the months since the incident, the federal government hasn’t offered any explanation as to what led unnamed federal law enforcement officers to shoot and kill 25-year-old Bijan Ghaisar. But local authorities on Wednesday released a disturbing dashcam video that sheds new light on the shooting and could put pressure on the federal government to bring charges against the agents involved.

The dashcam video shows the fatal encounter that was a culmination of a police chase of Ghaisar’s Jeep. An unidentified federal officer hops out of the passenger seat of his police vehicle and points his gun at Ghaisar’s stopped vehicle. As the officer stands near the driver’s side of the Jeep pointing his weapon, the car slowly moves forward. The officer fires once. He fires four more times. His partner comes up behind him. More shots are fired, and the vehicle abruptly stops.

Officers with the U.S. Park Police shot Ghaisar in the head four times on Nov. 17. Ghaisar, who by all accounts was unarmed and alone on George Washington Memorial Parkway, died 10 days later due to brain damage. Since then, the Ghaisar family has been seeking answers from the federal government about what happened to the football-loving young man from suburban Virginia who worked at his dad’s accounting firm and was looking forward to becoming an uncle.

“Not only did we lose Bijan, on top of it [all] but ... we have no information,” Ghaisar’s mother, Kelly, told HuffPost. “The total silence of this case makes us, our whole family, feel even worse, because we have to deal with Bijan’s loss and the way that he was taken.”

In shootings involving federal officers, like the U.S. Park Police which are under the U.S. Interior Department’s National Park Service, there’s often little information available upfront, while shootings involving local officers typically provide more.

The FBI is now investigating the case, but they initially opposed releasing the video. Federal authorities still haven’t named the two officers who killed Ghaisar, though the Interior Department has said they’re both on administrative leave. The lack of public information on the investigation has garnered criticism. The Washington Post’s editorial board criticized the dearth of information about the shooting last December, calling it “a mockery of the open society that distinguishes the United States from autocracies and dictatorships.”

But the veil of secrecy surrounding Ghaisar’s death was lifted a bit on Wednesday, when Fairfax County Chief of Police Edwin Roessler issued a press release for the dashcam video. While Fairfax officers weren’t involved in Ghaisar’s shooting, they did assist the U.S. Park Police in chasing Ghaisar’s vehicle. Roessler said he was releasing the video as a “matter of transparency to all in our community, especially the Ghaisar family.” He added he was confident in the FBI’s investigation.

U.S Park Police say they pursued Ghaisar’s vehicle after his SUV was involved in a collision on southbound George Washington Memorial Parkway at Slaters Lane in Alexandria, Virginia. Ghaisar reportedly was hit by an Uber driver in a Toyota Corolla before driving off. The Uber driver told FOX 5 that he and his passenger got Ghaisar’s license plate tag and called police. The Uber driver and his passenger did not report any injuries. The Uber driver was ticketed for failing to maintain proper control, according to the police report HuffPost obtained.

Fairfax Police later joined U.S. Park Police in their pursuit of Ghaisar, which initially began around 7:30 p.m. EST. Ghaisar is seen in the video being stopped twice by U.S. Park Police before coming to a full stop the third time at Fort Hunt and Alexandria. During the previous stops, police are seen pulling up alongside Ghaisar’s car, and drawing their weapons. Ghaisar’s family has speculated that the officer’s weapons frightened Ghaisar and caused him to drive off again.

The video “shows the senseless killing of a young man at the hands of those charged” with protecting the public, said Roy Austin Jr., an attorney for the family who previously served in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division before joining former President Barack Obama’s White House.

“Bijan Ghaisar was repeatedly threatened by over-aggressive and out-of-control law enforcement officers, after he drove away from a minor traffic incident in which he was the victim and in which there was little property damage and no known injuries,” Austin said in a Wednesday statement. “No one was even close to being in harm’s way until a pair of U.S. Park Police officers repeatedly shot Bijan at close range as he sat, unarmed, in his Jeep on a residential street. We don’t know why the U.S. Park Police officers shot Bijan multiple times, or whether those officers are still patrolling the area’s parkways. What we do know is that justice demands that those responsible for taking Bijan’s life answer for this illegal and unconstitutional killing.”

Ghaisar’s family and friends want to know how a minor fender bender escalated into a police chase that ultimately ended in the young man’s death. Ghaisar graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2015 and worked for his father’s firm Caesar & Associates in McLean, Virginia. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Friends and family who knew Ghaisar described him as being very upbeat and positive and as an avid New England Patriots fan. A first-generation Iranian-American, Ghaisar and sister were born in Virginia. His parents immigrated to the United States decades ago.

“I believe that the people who shot and killed Bijan should be held accountable. Doesn’t matter if they are police officers or civilians. Once you kill someone in this heinous way, you should be held accountable and that’s what I want to see,” said Kelly Ghaisar. “This whole thing, it’s such an out of body experience ... but we are trying to cope because we want to get justice for Bijan. It’s what drives us to get out of bed and do something.”Before a Michigan judge on Wednesday sentenced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to up to 175 years in prison for sexually assaulting more than 140 young women, state Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis honored the role of investigative reporting in the case.

“It shouldn’t take investigative journalists to expose predators,” Povilaitis, whose office prosecuted the case, said in her closing argument. “But thank god we have these journalists, and that they exposed this truth and that they continue to cover this story. Thank god Rachael Denhollander made that first contact with the reporter and decided to allow them to publish her name.”

"Thank God we have these journalists," says the prosecutor in the Larry Nassar case.

“We, as a society, need investigative journalists more than ever,” she said later. “What finally started this reckoning and ended this decades-long cycle of abuse was investigative reporting.”

Without The Indianapolis Star’s initial 2016 investigation into USA Gymnastics, she continued, “he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids,” pointing at Nassar.

After reading the Star’s investigation, former gymnast Rachael Denhollander contacted the reporters and came forward with her account, the first public accusation of Nassar’s abuse, in a story published in September 2016.

She was the last woman to read a victim impact statement in Nassar’s sentencing hearing on Wednesday.

Mexico’s former president doubled down on previous statements that his country would not foot the bill for Trump’s southern barrier on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Opposition With Jordan Klepper.”

“I said, I’m not paying for that fucking wall,” said Fox.

He later revealed how the spirit of his dead grandfather partly inspired him to take on Trump, and described the U.S. president as a “mediocre businessman.”

“When you move from business and private sector into politics, you have to go through a process,” said Fox. “This guy doesn’t have any idea of the difference between running a nation and running a business.”Pope Francis condemned the spread of fake news on Wednesday, comparing it to the evil that brought destruction to the Biblical figures Adam and Eve (and by extension, all of humanity) in the Garden of Eden.

The pontiff made his remarks on the state of journalism today in a message released on the Catholic feast day for journalists, in anticipation of the Vatican’s World Communications Day, which falls this year on May 13.

In a time when many are worried about the negative impact fake news has had on democracies around the world, the 81-year-old pope said it was the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.

“If responsibility is the answer to the spread of fake news, then a weighty responsibility rests on the shoulders of those whose job is to provide information, namely, journalists, the protectors of news,” he wrote.

In the message, Francis said fake news grabs people’s attentions by appealing to stereotypes and prejudices and exploiting their anxieties and frustrations.

In the United States, the proliferation of fake news stories, especially on social media sites, caused concern during and after Donald Trump’s election. A BuzzFeed analysis found that in the final months of the presidential campaign, fake news stories drew more shares and engagement on Facebook than real news from major outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post.

Last September, The New York Times found that Russian hackers had created fake accounts on social media sites to promote fake news stories during the election.

Some public figures, like Trump, have capitalized on fears about fake news to attack the media and discredit news sources he disagrees with.

Francis did not mention any specific, modern-day examples of fake news in his message. However, he did refer to what he believes is the first instance of fake news ― the story of the “crafty serpent” who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden.

The pope recounted the Biblical story in his message, which says the serpent asked Eve if God had instructed her not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. God had never told Adam not to eat from any tree, Francis said, but only from one tree, the tree of knowledge. This opens the door to more misinformation and enticement, which ultimately had disastrous effects for Adam, Eve, and the rest of humanity, the pope said.

“We need to unmask what could be called the ‘snake-tactics’ used by those who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place.”

The best antidote to fake news is not strategy, Francis wrote, but people who are ready to engage in sincere dialogue and take responsibility for how they use language.

He invited people to promote a “journalism of peace” that is opposed to lies and “sensational headlines,” and that serves people who have no voice.Bradley Cooper at the Academy Awards on Feb. 22, 2015. Lucas Jackson / Reuters

The year is 1993. Bill Clinton is president, Nirvana is one of the biggest bands in the world and high schooler Bradley Cooper is a senior at Pennsylvania’s Germantown Academy, writing a steamy editorial about hooking up with his best friend.

Tommy Rowan, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, uncovered Cooper’s first piece for The Philadelphia Daily News and tweeted it out on Tuesday. The headline, “When best friends cross the line,” says it all.

Rowan tweeted a photo of the article, and a larger version can be seen here. He also confirmed its authenticity in an email to HuffPost.

Intern Bradley Cooper, age 18, wrote in his first @PhillyDailyNews story: "Can best friends who are of the opposite sex hook up with each other without destroying their friendship? In my case, yes . . . so far." Bold. pic.twitter.com/DDyKIFtNqM — tommy rowan (@tommyrowan) January 23, 2018

According to Rowan, Cooper wrote the piece as an 18-year-old intern at the newspaper. He quoted Cooper’s introductory paragraph, “Can best friends who are of the opposite sex hook up with each other without destroying their friendship? In my case, yes . . . so far.”

The reporter called that declaration “bold.”

“Bold” is one of many words that can be used to describe Cooper’s piece. The article goes on to talk about the progression of his relationship with his “best friend,” Deborah Landes.

“I know once you take that step over the platonic line everything is supposed to change,” Cooper wrote. “Suddenly you start to hate that guy she always told you was hot. But that’s not really true in my case.”

His article also includes such gems as:

There has always been an underlying attraction between the two of us; however, it was never confronted until this year. Before, we could never fathom the idea of being more than just friends, especially because she was involved in a relationship with a friend of mine. After they broke up, things began to change.

This sweet bit about prom:

We never even thought twice about going to the prom with anyone else.

And a reference to the sun setting on their relationship once summer begins:

It is somewhat easy to say everything is cool now, because we are still in school. The real test will probably come when I have to hear about how much fun she’s having at the shore this summer.

Just for fun, here’s another photo of Cooper from his high school days:

It’s safe to say we all know what happened to Cooper after the article’s publication. He went to Villanova University for a year, graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in English, picked up some French at some point and ultimately became an A-list actor.

However, the decision might have come just too late for the 81-year-old four-times premier, who only three days ago gave his blessing to his political ally the League to form a government without him in the wake of a disappointing election result.

Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in 2013, triggering his expulsion from the upper house of parliament and a bar on holding any elected position for six years. However, in a decision made public on Saturday, a court in the northern city of Milan which oversees the application of sentences ruled that the bar could be lifted a year early because of “good conduct”.

“Finally five years of injustice has come to end,” Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party said in a statement. “Berlusconi can once again be a candidate.”

Berlusconi campaigned actively ahead of a March 4 national election even though he was not a candidate. But Forza Italia did not perform as well as he had expected, slipping behind the League to lose its top spot in the center-right bloc.

Berlusconi blamed the poor showing on the fact that voters knew he could not be prime minister. The center-right emerged as the single largest force at the March vote, while the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerged as the biggest individual party.

Neither side won enough seats to govern alone and efforts to put together a coalition were complicated by 5-Star’s refusal to work with Forza Italia, saying Berlusconi symbolized political corruption in Italy.

After more than nine weeks of stalemate, and with fresh elections looking increasingly likely, Berlusconi on Wednesday finally gave his blessing to the League to seek a coalition deal without Forza Italia.

Negotiations between the League and 5-Star are continuing, with President Sergio Mattarella giving them until Monday to strike an accord. Both parties say that if they fail to agree terms, the only solution would be a revote, perhaps in July. A political source, who declined to be named, said the fact Berlusconi was now free to run might make him less amenable to a League/5-Star government and could work to make life difficult for it in parliament, should it take office.

The billionaire media tycoon was written off after he quit as prime minister in 2011 amid a sex scandal involving his “bunga bunga” parties, while Italian bond yields surged to unsustainable levels at the height of the eurozone debt crisis.

However, he has fought hard to remain politically relevant. Last year he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ban on holding public office. A verdict is still awaited but the Milan ruling makes it irrelevant.Civil rights groups have filed a suit against Dallas County, Texas, over allegations that officials are running an unconstitutional judicial system that forces defendants, including a transgender woman who has struggled with homelessness and unemployment, to spend days or weeks behind bars before trial simply because they can’t afford to pay bail.

That system has allegedly had direct consequences for plaintiff Shannon Daves, a 47-year-old who like many defendants was arrested on low-level charges. After being booked for misdemeanor theft earlier this month, Daves was unable to post $500 bail. As a result, she was indefinitely detained in solitary confinement, due to the county’s policy on transgender inmates, while she awaited trial. Daves says she was confined to her cell for 24 hours a day.

“I never know what time of day it is or when mealtime will be,” she wrote in an affidavit filed in the case. “I feel that because I am transgender they have allowed me to fall through the cracks.”

The federal class action lawsuit, filed this week, details a callous pretrial process in which Dallas County judges file rapidly through arrestees, assigning predetermined bail amounts based solely on the type of charge. As in many jurisdictions in Texas and around the nation, when judges assign bail they don’t ask whether individuals can afford to pay the money. They also don’t consider other non-monetary conditions that might otherwise allow poorer defendants to be released while awaiting trial. This process leaves many people left to languish in jail, where they may end up losing jobs or shelter, getting stripped of access to public assistance or other support systems, or being separated from their families. Although these defendants are still legally presumed innocent under the law, they are effectively punished long before any determination of guilt.

These practices contribute substantially to the number of people incarcerated in the U.S. At any time, there are nearly 450,000 people who have not been convicted of a crime in jails across the country, with many facing only low-level charges. They account for nearly two-thirds of the jail population, and one-fifth of all people behind bars. Jailing these people costs U.S. taxpayers approximately $38 million each day, or $14 billion annually, according to a Pretrial Justice Institute report published last year.

“What people are fighting against all across the country is the dehumanization of the folks who are processed through the criminal legal system.” - Civil Rights Corps attorney Elizabeth Rossi

This “two-tiered system of justice” in Dallas County disproportionately affects people of color and the poor and violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, claims the lawsuit, filed by Civil Rights Corps, the Texas Fair Defense Project and the American Civil Liberties Union. The plaintiffs, six indigent misdemeanor and felony defendants arrested in Dallas this month, are seeking injunctive relief to halt the county’s judicial system. The suit names as defendants Dallas County and the county’s sheriff, as well as the felony and misdemeanor court magistrate judges who currently assign bail to defendants.

The Dallas County suit is the latest to challenge the use of money bail in jurisdictions around the country. Civil rights groups claim such “wealth-based” detention practices provide no public safety benefit and come at a high cost to taxpayers, all while forcing many poorer defendants to plead guilty just to get out of jail.

For defendants with money, this money bail system might look less controversial. They put up the cash and get out of jail, regardless of whether they might be considered a threat to the community or a flight risk. If they return for future trial dates, they reclaim that bail money.

But people like Daves fare much worse. She was booked into jail on a misdemeanor theft charge on Jan. 17. Hours later, she went before a judge with about 10 other defendants. Hearings in Dallas County can include more than 20 people. The sessions are not recorded, and there are no defense attorneys, prosecutors or members of the public present, according to the lawsuit.

“During these hearings, each individual is addressed for about 40 seconds or maybe a minute,” Civil Rights Corps attorney Elizabeth Rossi told HuffPost. “The magistrate judge informs the person of the charge against them but not the factual allegations underlying the charge.”

A judge ultimately assigned Daves $500 bail, the generic amount under Dallas County’s schedule. But she didn’t have that kind of money, so she was sent back to jail, where she was set to remain until her trial date.

Daves was finally released from jail on Monday along with two other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, as part of a broader effort by Faith in Texas and the Texas Organizing Project, a pair of civil justice organizations, to put up the money to bail out indigent defendants.

Bail reform advocates have been campaigning to replace this system with one that bases release decisions on individualized assessments that measure a defendant’s flight risk and potential threat to community safety. In places like New Jersey and Washington, D.C., pretrial services agencies now conduct these evaluations and provide recommendations to judicial officers. Under this system, many low-level defendants are released without payment, simply on the promise that they’ll return for future court dates. Others are subjected to some level of monitoring by the pretrial services agency or held without the option of bail.

Although Dallas’ use of money bail is in some way unremarkable, it also employs some particularly egregious practices. After bail hearings, deputies have a unusually direct way of extracting cash from defendants who can afford bail.

“They take those folks who have enough money in a bank account to an ATM that’s inside the jail in the booking area, so that person can take that money out and pay cash for that release,” said Rossi. “Everyone else is housed in jail cells and will stay in jail ― if you’re charged with a misdemeanor, for a minimum for four to ten days before going to court, and for felony arrestees, a minimum of two weeks before being taken to court.”

This practice “highlights just how shameless Dallas County is about its money-based pretrial decision making process,” Rossi added.

The lawsuit also claims that deputies often tell arrestees that if they aren’t silent during bail hearings, judges may arbitrarily increase the amount required for release. A judge in Harris County, Texas, came under fire for exactly this behavior in 2016, when he was recorded doubling a defendant’s bail from $1,000 to $2,000 after she responded to a “yes or no” question by saying “yeah” instead of “yes.” The woman had been arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession.

Civil Rights Corps and other groups are also suing Harris County over its bail system, though unlike their Dallas County suit, that challenge wasn’t extended to felony defendants. A federal judge in that case has issued a preliminary injunction banning the county from holding misdemeanor defendants for more than 24 hours if they say they can’t afford bail. A final ruling is still forthcoming.

Despite the Dallas County lawsuit, officials there have already stated an interest in implementing reform and moving away from their reliance on money bail. That gives people like Rossi hope that they’ll be able to find common ground going forward.

“What people are fighting against all across the country is the dehumanization of the folks who are processed through the criminal legal system,” she said. “One of the key reasons that this system has developed is that the folks running it have stopped seeing the human beings that pass through it as people and have started seeing them as just cases to be processed.”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s defenders are brushing off reports that he asked his acting FBI director how he voted in the presidential election as simply Trump’s way of “getting to know people.”

Trump, who has taken repeated steps to undermine the independence of the FBI, asked the bureau’s acting head, Andrew McCabe, whom he voted for in the 2016 election, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. The question, which Trump reportedly posed shortly after firing FBI Director James Comey in May, would put a non-political law enforcement leader in an awkward position. McCabe responded that he did not vote, the paper reported, citing unnamed current and former administration officials, and later said he found the conversation “disturbing.”

Asked whether Trump acted inappropriately, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel on Wednesday dismissed the conversation as normal small talk that came up during an introductory meeting.

“I think it is just a conversation. I don’t think it intends of, you know, all of these terrible things that people are trying to put forward,” McDaniel said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I ask people who they vote for sometimes. I think it’s trying to get to know somebody. This is a president who is just getting to know people, and that’s part of those conversations.”

A White House official told The New York Times that Trump’s question “was in the context of first asking about Mr. McCabe’s family.”

McCabe, who stepped into the FBI acting director job after Trump abruptly fired Comey amid the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, has long been a target of Republican attempts to undermine the probe.

Trump and his allies have alleged McCabe is biased because in 2015, his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, was a candidate for Virginia state Senate and received campaign donations from a super PAC of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a friend of Trump’s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton. Jill McCabe, a Democrat, was defeated in the election.

How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017

Andrew McCabe later faced scrutiny, as Comey’s deputy, for his role in the FBI investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. He didn’t assume that position until well after his wife’s campaign had ended, and, under pressure, he recused himself from matters involving Clinton.

Nevertheless, Trump has repeatedly attacked McCabe, who is now the FBI deputy director. In December, Trump falsely stated that McCabe was “given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation.”

Trump has frequently blasted his FBI and Justice Department, and claims he has the “absolute right” to direct the Department of Justice as he sees fit.

Wisconsin Republicans voted Tuesday to remove the state’s top election and ethics officials, despite looming state and federal elections.

Led by Republicans in a vote along party lines, the state Senate voted to oust Ethics Administrator Brian Bell and Elections Administrator Michael Haas from their respective roles by denying to confirm them on a permanent basis. Both men did not get a customary public hearing before the vote.

Haas and Bell previously worked for the state’s Government Accountability Board when it was probing whether the campaign of Gov. Scott Walker (R) illegally coordinated with outside conservative groups. The probe was shut down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2015, but The Guardian obtained information from the investigation and published an article on its contents. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel (R) conducted an investigation into the leak and recommended charges against nine people who worked on the probe, but not Bell and Haas. Despite that, House Speaker Robin Vos (R) and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R) both called on Haas and Bell to resign.

The Government Accountability Board was disbanded in 2015 and replaced with the state ethics commission and election commission.

In 2016, the members of the elections commission, which is bipartisan, unanimously picked Haas to lead it. The six-member body is charged with overseeing and implementing Wisconsin’s election laws.

Haas’ removal comes just weeks before a Feb. 20 primary in the state and a little under three months before the first day when candidates can begin circulating petitions for the 2018 fall election. As Wisconsin’s chief election official, Haas is responsible for administering those elections, ensuring compliance with federal law and overseeing investigation and enforcement of the state’s election code. He is also charged with overseeing the state’s election equipment, a role with increased importance this year because Wisconsin was one of 21 states targeted by Russian hackers ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Mark Thomsen, a Democrat and the election commission’s chairman, noted during a meeting Wednesday that Haas was the only person in the agency with the required clearance to work with the Department of Homeland Security to secure the state’s election system.

Haas only had a peripheral role in the Walker probe, where he was responsible for legal documents, but not the core part of the investigation into the governor’s campaign, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.

Meanwhile, the members of the state’s ethics commission unanimously picked Bell to serve as their administrator in 2016. The six-member panel is charged with overseeing the state’s campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws. An investigation by the ethics commission into Bell found there was “not a scintilla of evidence” he was partisan in his duties at the Government Accountability Board. Earlier this month, Bell said he left the board because it was too partisan.

Fitzgerald, the Republican Senate leader, said Tuesday the fact that neither men had been linked to wrongdoing didn’t really matter to him.

“I can’t have confidence in an agency that still is employing some of the individuals that were there [the Government Accountability Board],” he told the Wisconsin State Journal on Tuesday.

Chris Ott, the executive director of the Wisconsin ACLU, said the timing of Haas’ dismissal was suspicious and said the sudden push to oust the officials was out of the blue.

“The Wisconsin Senate’s vote yesterday along party lines to try ousting the head of our Elections Commission looks like political interference in a nonpartisan agency that helps and protects Wisconsin voters, just a few weeks before important statewide elections start,” he said in a statement.

Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, called the vote not to confirm Haas and Bell “one of the most grotesque abuses of power that has occurred in Wisconsin in its history.”

“No evidence, no charges, no specific examples of misconduct, nothing. Just secret agreement among the members of the majority party in the State Senate to get rid of them both, right before important elections, and replace them, presumably, with sycophants and pawns that the Republicans will dictate what they decide and what the result of their work on elections and ethics will be,” Heck said in a statement.

Wisconsin law says both the election and ethics commissions ”shall be under the direction and supervision of an administrator, who shall be appointed by a majority of the members of the commission, with the advice and consent of the senate” to a four-year term. While the law says the administrator will only serve on an interim basis until approved by the state Senate, it also says the administrator can only be removed “by the affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the commission voting at a meeting of the commission called for that purpose.”

The Walker administration said Wednesday it does not believe the commission can legally appoint Haas to lead it. “Because the Senate voted against confirmation of the potential Administrator who was serving as the interim, there was no way for the statutory requirement of ‘consent of the Senate’ to be met and thus the appointment had to end. This is not a removal of an administrator because the administrator serves as interim until consented to,” Steven Michels, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Administration, said in an email to HuffPost.

A legal fight is expected over Haas’ future at the election commission.

Thomsen, the commission’s chairman, believes only the commissioners can vote to fire Haas despite the Senate vote. The panel met Wednesday afternoon and split along party lines about keeping Haas, with Republicans saying they believed the law made the administrator position vacant after the Senate vote on Tuesday. The election panel eventually voted 4-2 to keep Haas as administrator through April 30 to oversee some of the state’s elections.

Fitzgerald told reporters Tuesday he hoped the Republicans on the commission would decline to support Haas. He said he also wants lawmakers to get rid of the positions of two civil servant lawyers at the ethics and elections commission who worked at the Government Accountability Board.Humorist and longtime radio personality Garrison Keillor performs at City Winery in New York City on Oct. 4, 2017.

Garrison Keillor, the former Minnesota Public Radio host who was fired for harassment, may have done far more than “accidentally” place his hand on a female colleague’s bare back, as he claimed in November.

MPR News published an investigative report Tuesday on 75-year-old Keillor, revealing allegations of inappropriate behavior going back as far as 1998.

The report claims Keillor, a humorist who created the MPR variety show “A Prairie Home Companion,” wrote and displayed a suggestive poem about an employee in his bookstore, sent $16,000 and a confidentiality agreement to a subordinate he was romantically involved with, and told a 21-year-old student in his writing class that he was intensely attracted to her.

MPR’s report comes nearly two months after a colleague accused Keillor of acting inappropriately with her. MPR responded to the accusation by cutting business ties with and firing Keillor.

In a statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune in November, Keillor defended himself by saying that he was trying to console a colleague by patting her on the back, but that his hand had moved up her bare back:

I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it. We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.

In the report published Tuesday, MPR News interviewed former staff members who worked with Keillor on shows including “The Writer’s Almanac” and “A Prairie Home Companion,” and his bookstore in St. Paul, Common Good Books.

While some of Keillor’s former colleagues described the radio host as a reserved and respectful man, others claimed he treated women unfairly, made sexist remarks and could be cruel.

Keillor was romantically involved with two former female colleagues who weren’t named in MPR News’ piece. Their colleagues told the news organization that while those relationships were consensual, they also had a harmful power dynamic.

Through his Prairie Home Productions company, Keillor gave one of the women a $16,000 check, a confidentiality agreement and a new work contract, but she didn’t sign or use them.

Patricia McFadden, who worked for “The Writer’s Almanac” in 1998, filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Keillor and MPR, and claimed that Keillor had a “pattern and practice of abusive conduct” that included “hostile and demeaning” emails and memos. McFadden said MPR had told her she was being fired due to “restructuring,” but she was instead replaced with a younger woman.

Molly Hilgenberg, who worked at Common Good Books, told MPR News that Keillor had once written a sexually suggestive poem about her on the whiteboard behind the store’s cash register. She showed MPR News a photo of the poem on the white board ― and another with employees’ attempts to cover it up.

The poem, which Hilgenberg said Keillor later apologized for, reads:

A beauty who goes to Macalester ― O, her face, her limbs, her ballast, her Tiny blue kilt And the way she is built Could make a petrified phallus stir.

In addition to its investigative report on Keillor, MPR News published an editor’s note on Tuesday saying its editorial staff members were working “independently of their parent company’s senior leadership.” MPR operates under the nonprofit public radio organization American Public Media Group, which is headquartered in the same building in Minnesota.

MPR noted that its newsroom and APMG’s offices are on separate floors, and that the journalists who covered Keillor’s harassment did so “as they would if covering some other company.”

Before Keillor’s alleged misbehavior was made public, he wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post, published Nov. 28, defending Al Franken after sportscaster Leeann Tweeden accused the former senator of kissing and grabbing her without her consent.

“This is pure absurdity, and the atrocity it leads to is a code of public deadliness,” Keillor wrote.

The Washington Post later added a note to Keillor’s op-ed: “Knowing he was under investigation for his workplace behavior, [Keillor] should not have written a column on that subject; or, if he was going to write, he should have told his editors and readers that he was under investigation.”

Days after publishing the op-ed, and after his alleged abuse was made public, Keillor defended his own reputation in a statement to the Star Tribune, calling himself “the least physically affectionate person in the building.”

“If If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the belt line, I’d have at least a hundred dollars,” he added. “So this is poetic irony of a high order.”

Keillor did not return HuffPost’s request for comment on the latest allegations against him.

Where Amy Sherman-Palladino leads, Lauren Graham will follow.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Graham could possibly, maybe, (hopefully!) appear on the second season of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” Amazon’s Golden Globe-winning series.

Series creator Sherman-Palladino, also created the hit “Gilmore Girls,” which starred Graham as the quick-witted, fast-talking, bottomless pit Lorelai Gilmore.

“I gotta get my girl Lauren on the show,” Sherman-Palladino, told The Hollywood Reporter over the weekend. “I want to have her on it.”

And Graham is totally game. She has even been pitching ideas.

“Lauren wants to be something very specific,” Sherman-Palladino said. “She has it all figured out.”

Sherman-Palladino didn’t give details about Graham’s potential character (will she play a role similar to Lorelai? Or a cheeseburger? Or a cheeseburger with a side of cheeseburger?) But she did offer a few tidbits about the second season of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”

Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) and Suzie (Alex Borstein) are taking their comedy act on the road, according to Sherman-Palladino. And by “road,” she means the Catskills, where comedians such as Joan Rivers, Billy Crystal and Rodney Dangerfield honed their acts.

“I want to see those two girls stay some nights in shitty hotels and playing some dumpy clubs,” Sherman-Palladino said.Westend61 via Getty Images After David Bowie’s death in January 2016, the number of baby boys named Bowie more than doubled from 53 in 2015 to 130 in 2016.

There are many big and small ways to express your love for your favorite musicians: traveling around the world to see them, getting a special tattoo ... even naming your children after them.

The latter may seem extreme to some, but it certainly happens. This is particularly true for iconic musicians who’ve passed away in recent years. After David Bowie’s death in January 2016, the number of baby boys named Bowie more than doubled from 53 in 2015 to 130 in 2016.

We examined the Social Security Administration’s most recent baby names data to see what other famous artists have appeared on the charts. Below we’ve compiled a list of musician-related names and how many newborns were given those names in 2016.

Of course, in some cases, the name choices may only be coincidentally related to these famous bands and musicians — but the distinctiveness and growing popularity of many suggest a clear homage.

WASHINGTON — For months, the Trump administration has imprisoned an American citizen without charging him with a crime. The government says the man, whose name has not been released, fought with ISIS in Syria — but officials appear to lack the evidence to bring charges against him in court.

In October, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the detainee, arguing that his imprisonment is unlawful. Since then, government officials have floated a clever way to potentially avoid a protracted fight over the legality of the prisoner’s detention: Instead of continuing to imprison the man themselves, they could simply transfer him into the custody of another country, where he could be detained and interrogated out of the reach of American law.

Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia complicated that plan on Tuesday, ordering the government to provide the court with 72-hour notice before transferring the detainee — creating a scenario in which the ACLU could stall the transfer by challenging its legality in court.

Jonathan Hafetz, the ACLU lawyer representing the detainee, cheered the ruling as a measure that “helps to ensure that this citizen’s rights are respected and that he will receive due process in an American court.”

Chutkan’s order came in response to an ACLU request for her to prohibit the government from transferring the detainee for the duration of his habeas challenge. The judge appeared sympathetic to the ACLU’s concerns during a court hearing on Thursday. The U.S. government transferring the prisoner to another country while being sued for unlawfully detaining him would allow the administration to do an “end run” around habeas litigation, the judge suggested.

Hafetz, said on Monday that his team would be satisfied with receiving 72-hour notice and the chance to challenge any transfer. The government opposed the requirement to give notice, arguing that it would complicate sensitive diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and the country that would receive the detainee.

U.S. officials first detained the American citizen in mid-September after he surrendered to a Syrian rebel group, which turned him over to the Americans. He was held at an undisclosed location in Iraq for months without access to a lawyer.

Two months after the ACLU filed the habeas petition, Chutkan ordered the Pentagon to allow ACLU lawyers to speak with the detainee. The ACLU announced earlier this month that the detainee asked the group to represent him in challenging the legality of his imprisonment. ACLU lawyers have spoken with their client three times at the Pentagon through a video-conferencing system, Hafetz told reporters on Monday. The ACLU is working to arrange an in-person meeting.

The government has withheld the prisoner’s name and the man has also requested to remain anonymous, according to Hafetz.

So far, the court proceedings in the habeas case have focused more on the issue of the detainee’s potential transfer rather than the core issue of whether the government has a legal basis for detaining the anonymous American citizen.

In December, The New York Times reported that Trump administration officials had coalesced around the idea of sending the detainee to Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally in the war against ISIS, and a country with virtually no due process protections. The ACLU quickly moved to block the government from transferring its client out of U.S. custody. Chutkan put a temporary transfer ban in place that expired on Tuesday.

Department of Justice lawyer James Burnham argued in court on Thursday that sending the detainee to another country with a “significant interest” in him would effectively grant him the relief he is seeking through habeas litigation — release from U.S. custody. The government has not officially decided to send the detainee to another country, but views a transfer as one of several available options, Burnham said.

“Forcible transfer is not release,” countered Hafetz, who argued that the government has no legal basis for transferring the prisoner into another country’s custody.

Burnham declined to disclose where the government is planning to send the detainee, but acknowledged that the individual is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

If the detainee were to be sent into Saudi custody, he could be imprisoned there under a counterterrorism law that has been used by Saudi officials to arrest and detain citizens accused of posing a security threat, but which human rights groups have also criticized for being overly broad and tool for imprisoning government critics.From the looks of the first trailer for “Gringo,” David Oyelowo‘s character goes through some serious hell. Harold Soynika, dispatched to Mexico by the pharmaceutical snakes (Charlize Theron and Joel Edgerton) he works for, gets abducted by local drug lords and is physically (and emotionally) bruised and battered for the vast majority of the preview.



“Every day I felt like I had been put in a blender and then spilt onto my bed,” Oyelowo laughed when talking to Yahoo Entertainment about the darkly comedic thriller directed by Nash Edgerton (The Square) from a script by Matthew Stone and Anthony Tambakis. “It was quite the journey.”



In fact, Oyelowo said he was literally put in a blender on the film’s south-of-the-border set, all under the most uncomfortable of circumstances. “We were shooting in Mexico and I got the worst food poisoning imaginable. I literally thought I was going to die. And while in the middle of dealing with that, we had a scene where there’s this terrible car crash. [To film it] they put this car in the equivalent of a hamster wheel. So you’re basically spinning the car ’round and ’round.



“Imagine someone being put in a washing machine. And that is what I had to do in the middle of having terrible food poisoning. So when you see that moment in the film and I’m screaming, there’s no acting there.”



Human hamster wheels and stomach turns aside, Oyelowo relished in the role. “The character I get to play in this film is actually a character I personally haven’t seen on film before. He’s a Nigerian immigrant who really believes in the American dream, probably to a detrimental level. And his belief in that dream, his belief in his coworkers, his desire to please, gets him into some terrible scrapes. So he goes on a journey of self-realization while amassing a massive amount of bumps and bruises.”



Actors out of their element, in fact, is a theme to film’s casting, the Selma and Queen of Katwe alum explained. “What you’re going to see when you see the film is those actors, actors who I deeply admire, almost all of us are getting to do something a little bit different than what people are used to seeing us do.



“Charlize plays this really questionable human being. And Joel the same thing. Sharlto Copley is very unhinged. There’s the amazing Thandie Newton. We had a lot of fun playing these characters because there’s such a fine line between self-preservation and just downright immorality. And these characters are constantly right on that line.”
