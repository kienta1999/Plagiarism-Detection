WASHINGTON ― As Republicans in 2016 hammered then-President Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran, their party’s foreign policy leaders and even many of the GOP candidates themselves understood that the deal, while not ideal, was worth keeping.

Somebody, it seems, forgot to give candidate Donald Trump the memo.

Two years later and still bashing the agreement, Trump is now on track to effectively end it next month ― with an unintended possible consequence of triggering a resumption of the Iranian nuclear program.

“The Iran deal is a terrible deal. We paid $150 billion. We gave $1.8 billion in cash. That’s actual cash, barrels of cash. It’s insane. It’s ridiculous. It should have never been made,” Trump said earlier this week ― once again repeating his false and misleading claims from the campaign trail.

“I strongly doubt he understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement,” said Richard Nephew, a top State Department official in charge of Iran sanctions during the period the agreement was being negotiated.

The 2015 deal Obama’s State Department reached with Iran forced that nation to dismantle its nuclear enrichment program for at least a decade in return for the suspension of some economic sanctions. The deal’s other signatories include France, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the European Union, Russia and China.

But for Republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the Iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.

The deal was achieved by Obama. The Republican primary voting base hated Obama. Anything Obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.

But even as GOP presidential candidates lambasted the deal, Republican foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill understood that an international agreement that put the Iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. They passed a law that allowed Obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to Republicans who believed they needed it.

“The GOP votes in 2015, especially in the Senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-Obama, anti-Iran and pro-Israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the Middle East,” said Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.

Among the established GOP presidential candidates in the field, though, there was little chance of the deal collapsing.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ― they and others, had they won the presidency, almost certainly would have stayed in the agreement, said Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Cruz.

“They probably would have looked at it and thought: What’s best for the country?” he said. “I don’t know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.”

That, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.

And if Trump was woefully ill-informed about the Iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, they tracked congressional Republicans’ attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the GOP nomination, which were then further escalated by Fox News hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.

“Our president has betrayed Israel,” Rubio said at a March 5, 2016 rally in Florida. “On my first day in office, I’m going to cancel the Iran deal,” he said two days later.

“If a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don’t buy him a knife,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Feb. 10, 2016 town hall. “This Iran deal is the worst deal.”

Cruz promised literal violence to the agreement itself. “Day one, I will rip to shreds the Iran deal,” he repeated at a North Carolina rally on March 7, 2016.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee went even further, essentially accusing Obama of enabling the eventual genocide of Israelis. “It is so naive that he would trust the Iranians. By doing so he will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven,” he said on July 26, 2015.

Right-wing media, meanwhile, described the agreement as literally giving Iran nuclear weapons as well as billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer cash.

In fact, the agreement has forced Iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. The $1.7 billion the United States gave to Iran was money it held in U.S. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by U.S. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.

Whether Trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. Trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like NATO, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about NATO. In August 2015, Trump told NBC News that he learned military policy from “the shows” ― television news and interview programs.

One Republican adviser close to the White House said on condition of anonymity that Trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the Iran deal or policy issues generally. “He doesn’t know,” the adviser said. “And he doesn’t care.”

Trump’s former top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But administration shakeups in the past two months have brought interventionists like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo aboard. AOL

The Iran deal is just one instance where Trump’s not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.

On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. Only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn’t that simple. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” he said in February 2017.

Trump’s promise to rip up the Iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.

After Iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser Michael Flynn went before the White House press corps to deliver a bellicose response. But just hours later, top National Security Council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that Iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the United States would continue to comply as well.

Under the lran deal legislation passed by Congress, Trump must certify every 90 days whether Iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of U.S. sanctions. Trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. Last October, he refused to certify that Iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, May 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.

During his first year in office, Trump’s top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But in the past two months, Trump has fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, leaving Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.

Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on Iran and other countries in his Fox News appearances. And newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a Kansas congressman in December 2015, told a Westminster Institute audience that the only real solution in Iran was “the abolition of the current regime.”

Given that shift in the Trump administration’s policy-making lineup and Iran’s threat to resume its nuclear program should the United States re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in their White House visits this week has been to persuade Trump to remain in the agreement.

During his visit earlier this week, Macron tried to appeal to Trump’s fondness for largeness, selling the idea that the deal could be made bigger and better by adding on agreements that dealt with missile technology and Iran’s role in funding regional conflicts. Merkel is to repeat that message Friday, according to Western European diplomats.

Whether their words have any effect remains to be seen. Trump has already ignored U.S. allies on tariffs and the Paris climate agreement because he believes those issues are important to his loyal supporters, even as his popularity has plummeted among everybody else, according to those close to him.

Ironically, it is precisely that cult-like loyalty that could give Trump a path to preserving the deal without losing any support, said Tyler, the former campaign aide to Cruz.In early March, a severed head in a bag was found near a Louisiana lake. Twenty-three days later, another head in a bag was found near a lake in neighboring Texas.

About 150 miles separate the discoveries, but in each case, the victims, who have yet to be identified, are thought to be white women with brown or auburn hair and between 25 to 40 years old, police said.

Las Vegas criminologist Scott Bonn, who has spent years studying and interviewing some of the most notorious criminals, is disturbed by the similarities in the two cases.

“If the victims had been male, I’d say it could be gang related because that area is fraught with drugs and distribution,” Bonn said. “But we’re talking about two women, which increases the likelihood that this could be a serial killer’s dumping grounds.”

A prison inmate doing clean-up labor along Louisiana Highway 27 in Cameron Parish discovered the first severed head on March 1. It was inside a grocery bag not far from Calcasieu Lake. A preliminary autopsy indicated the head had been outside for about three months. There was no obvious trauma to the skull, but the medical examiner did note the victim had had extensive work done on her teeth, police said.

The second head was discovered by volunteers cleaning up trash near Farm-to-Market Road 1960 in Houston. It was found inside a black plastic bag in a rocky area by Lake Houston, according to the Houston Police Department. An autopsy determined the head had been outside for at least one week. The medical examiner noted the victim’s teeth were in especially good condition, and she had eyeliner and eyebrow makeup tattoos.

Because authorities have only partial human remains, it makes it difficult to gather clues. The head found in Louisiana has been sent to Louisiana State University’s forensics lab for additional testing. The Texas head is being examined by an anthropologist at the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office in Texas.

Finding the torsos, according to Bonn, would go a long way toward determining whether the cases are linked or if more than one person is responsible.

“Sometimes dismemberment is simply part of an elaborate plan to dispose of a body,” Bonn said. “Other times, it’s part of a fantasy or signature. The bodies are somewhere, and it’s just a question of what’s been done with them.”

The Cameron Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Houston Police Department are working on the cases together. As of Friday, neither agency has ruled out the possibility that the cases are connected or that a serial killer could be responsible.

Houston police said a person of interest was seen getting out of a vehicle similar to the one pictured here. Houston Police Department

While authorities do not have any suspects, they do have a person of interest they’d like to identify. According to Houston police, about two weeks before the head was found near FM 1960, someone was seen throwing a bag off a bridge on that roadway.

The individual being sought is described as a light-skinned male in his early to mid-20s, 5 feet, 4 inches to 5 feet, 8 inches, with short dark brown hair with long bangs. He was reportedly seen getting out of a teal or bluish green Chevrolet Silverado extended-cab pickup truck. The truck had rust spots and visible damage, and the rear left passenger window was missing and covered with a cardboard-like material, police said.

Maurice Godwin, a criminal investigative psychologist, thinks it’s likely the same person is responsible for both slayings and is familiar with the areas where the heads were discarded. Serial killers, he said, will sometimes intentionally kill or dump bodies in separate jurisdictions to throw off investigators.

“The killer likely lives within the 150-mile area of where the severed heads were found,” Godwin said. “I suspect [the individual] has killed before.”

Godwin also said the person responsible probably has a criminal record. “Domestic violence, drug convictions and alcohol-related charges.”

Bonn and Godwin both said that additional victims might be found along the 150-mile stretch between the two crime scenes. It would be an area to start searching, they agreed.

The two experts also share the same belief that if a serial killer is responsible, he or she would continue killing until stopped.

“More victims will be found,” Godwin said.

Bonn added, “Not all serial killers have a type, but given the similarities in those two heads, this killer could very well have a certain type [of victim] they’re looking for.”

AdvertisementThe musician-actress Janelle Monáe came out as pansexual in an interview this week with Rolling Stone. Within 24 hours, the word catapulted to the top of Merriam-Webster’s searches for the day.

Monáe, in the magazine’s cover story, talked about her experience as a queer woman of color in 2018.

“Being a queer black woman in America,” she said, “Someone who has been in relationships with both men and women ― I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker.” She said she initially identified as bisexual, but then read about pansexuality “was like ‘Oh, these are things that I identify with too.’ I’m open to learning more about who I am.”

Merriam-Webster defines the word pansexuality as “of, relating to, or characterized by sexual desire or attraction that is not limited to people of a particular gender identity or sexual orientation.”

Many people on Twitter said they didn’t know what the word meant, and contributed to the dictionary site’s surge:

Monáe hadn’t been particularly forthcoming about her sexuality in the past. She told The Guardian in February that while making her “Make Me Feel” music video, she felt “sexually liberated.” That song, along with the recent music video for her song “Pynk,” have frequently been called bisexual anthems.

“Pynk” is on Monáe’s “Dirty Computer” album that was released on Friday.

Youtube

Monáe told Rolling Stone that “Dirty Computer” is for everyone “dealing with their sexuality.”

“I want young girls, young boys, nonbinary, gay, straight, queer people who are having a hard time dealing with their sexuality, dealing with feeling ostracized or bullied for just being their unique selves, to know that I see you,” said Monáe. “This album is for you. Be proud.”Finally, a fun run that’s really fun ― or at least really short.

On May 5, the town of Boerne, Texas, plans to hold its first ever “Boerne 0.5K” run.

That decimal point is no typo: This run isn’t the typical five kilometers. It’s only half a kilometer ― about a third of a mile.

“Very, very conveniently,” the race starts at one local brewery and ends at another “exactly” half a kilometer away, organizer Jay Milton told KSAT, a station in nearby San Antonio. At least close enough, he added, “that we can lie and say that it is exact.”

Participants not only get a free beer at the start and end of the race, but there is a doughnut and coffee station about 150 meters into the course ― right next to the smoking section, NPR noted.

If walking about 1,640 feet is too strenuous, VIPs can pay an extra $25 and be transported across the finish line in a 1963 Volkswagen bus, according to CBS Houston.

Organizers promise bigger medals for those VIPs “because you are even more important!” according to NPR.

Although the run seems designed for people who don’t actually like any kind of physical movement, so many participants raced to sign up that organizers are no longer accepting entries.“Normally, when Trump has a bad day we know Trump watches ‘Fox & Friends’ and yells at the TV, but today he did the same thing but we all got to listen in,” Noah said on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show.”

After dissecting some of the strangest bits of the interview, including Trump’s admission that he hadn’t bought first lady Melania Trump a birthday gift, Noah then described Trump as “the first sober person I’ve heard doing ‘Drunk History.’”

“I actually almost feel bad for ‘Fox & Friends,’” Noah said. “Because if you are at a party and some boring ass dude wouldn’t stop talking to you, you could just be like, ‘Ah, I’ve got to get a drink.’ But these guys are on live television.”President Donald Trump should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, according to Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.). Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images

Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) is launching an effort to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“We are seeing unprecedented progress toward peace, and it’s a direct result of President Trump’s strong leadership,” Messer said in a statement Friday.

The GOP congressman is pointing to Trump’s work on North Korea as the impetus for promoting the nomination. Messer first proposed the idea in March and has consistently pushed it since then.

At a historic summit this week, North and South Korea announced that they agreed to the goals of removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula and pursuing talks with the United States to declare an official end to the Korean War.

“Our peace through strength strategy is delivering never before seen results,” said Messer, saying Trump deserves the credit for the Korean leaders’ announcement.

Messer said he is in the process of gathering congressional support for the nomination.

Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, possibly in late May or early June. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s newly confirmed secretary of state, met with Kim in secret three weeks ago. At the time, Pompeo was the CIA director.

But Trump had also ratcheted up tensions with North Korea. White House officials contemplated striking the country, and he and Kim traded insults.

President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, less than one year into his first term ― an honor that infuriated conservatives. The Nobel Committee pointed to “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” and “attached special importance to Obama’s vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.”

Messer is seeking the Indiana GOP Senate nomination this year, and many of the candidates are trying to prove how much they’re like Trump. Messer has pitched himself as a “conservative who supports the Trump/Pence agenda.”A judge ordered the National Weather Service to reinstate Chinese-American scientist Sherry Chen. SAUL LOEB via Getty Images

After a long legal battle, a Chinese-American hydrologist who was wrongly accused of espionage is finally getting justice.

Chief Administrative Judge Michele Schroeder ruled Tuesday in favor of Sherry Chen, whom the National Weather Service had fired in 2015 even after the espionage case against Chen had collapsed. Schroeder ordered the federal agency to reinstate the hydrologist and give her back pay.

“My findings indicate that Ms. Chen is an expert in her field of hydrology,” read the decision, which HuffPost obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. “There is no reason why she cannot continue to be a productive employee and continue to contribute to NWS’s mission.”

The victory has been a long time coming for the hydrologist, who challenged her termination through the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that protects public employees.

FBI agents arrested Chen in 2014, accusing her of using a stolen password to obtain information about U.S. dams. She was also accused of lying about a meeting with a Chinese official. Yet just a week before Chen was to go to trial, the case fell apart and charges were dropped with little explanation.

“We are exercising our prosecutorial discretion,” Jennifer Thornton, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, told press at the time.

Chen’s troubles didn’t end there, however. Months after the case fell apart, Chen received a termination letter citing “conduct demonstrating untrustworthiness” and “misrepresentation” among the reasons she was being fired.

However, Schroeder wrote that officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which the National Weather Service is part of, were intent on firing Chen regardless of what facts arose. They were “more concerned about being right than doing the right thing. Based on the unyielding nature of their testimony, I would not have been surprised if they rejected that 2 + 2 = 4,” the judge wrote.

Officials failed to consider a dozen sworn declarations from Chen’s co-workers in their termination decision, Schroder added. Ultimately, the National Weather Service failed to prove the “vast majority” of Chen’s alleged conduct, she said, and the Commerce Department didn’t have cause to terminate Chen.

“It’s clear that Sherry Chen was the victim of gross injustice and unwarranted racial profiling during her time at the [Commerce] Department.” - Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.)

The judge swapped Chen’s termination for a 15-day suspension without pay, due to what Schroeder called a “singular lapse of judgment on Ms. Chen’s part.” This referred to Chen’s agreement to “provide data to a former member of the weather service with a written assurance not to tell anyone she was doing so.”

Several Asian-American legislators applauded the decision and are now calling for an investigation into the handling of Chen’s case.

“Unfortunately, there have been multiple cases in which Chinese American scientists like Sherry have been wrongfully targeted and arrested for alleged espionage only to have those charges dropped with no explanation,” Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “That is why [Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus] has made it a top priority to urge the Department of Justice to examine whether there is a pattern or practice of Asian Americans being singled out by federal law enforcement and prosecutors for espionage.”

Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) issued similar statements.

“It’s clear that Sherry Chen was the victim of gross injustice and unwarranted racial profiling during her time at the Department,” Lieu said. “I’m calling on the IG to immediately open an investigation into this wrongdoing so that it does not happen to our fellow Americans again.”

As the legislators pointed out, Chen is among a string of scientists and researchers of Asian descent who have been wrongly accused of espionage, including Chinese-American professor Xiaoxing Xi, Eli Lilly scientists Guoqing Cao and Shuyu Li, and NASA contract worker Bo Jiang. While their cases dissolved, the damage had already been done.

“Dropped charges do not erase the trauma and paranoia from FBI surveillance, $200,000 in legal fees, or the many shattered pieces of our lives we still have to put together,” Xi’s daughter Joyce wrote in a blog for HuffPost. “It does not erase the fact that the federal government exerted its overwhelming power to try and criminalize my father in the name of national security, as if he were an enemy of his own country, America.”“Late Night” writer Mike Karnell is on a mission to make red hats great again.

“I’d wager that most of, if not all of the audience members here have a red hat that they love,” he explained to host Seth Meyers on Monday. “And ever since [President Donald] Trump’s base started rocking those MAGA hats, we’ve had to keep them tucked away, out of fear that we’d be confused for one of them.”

“Well, that ends now,” Karnell went on. “Trump has taken so many things from me that I once loved ― the NFL, Kanye, the idea of having sex with a porn star. I’ve had enough.”

Using a line from Justin Timberlake’s 2006 hit “SexyBack,” Karnell hopes to “take red hats back” for good. “We’re in a culture war and I have to choose a side,” he said. But Meyers wasn’t convinced.These superheroes need their mouths washed out with soap.

In a Friday interview with “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopolous, Cosby’s publicists went so far as to compare the disgraced comedian to Emmett Till, the black teenager who was mutilated and murdered in Mississippi in 1955.

Q: "You're saying all these women ... are all 60 women lying?"



Bill Cosby’s publicist: "Since when are all people honest? Since when are all women honest? We can take a look at Emmett Till for example." pic.twitter.com/DJNSEjocAO — Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) April 27, 2018

“This became a public lynching,” Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt said on the program.

“You’re saying all these women, all 60 women, are lying?” Stephanopolous asked.

“May I ask a question?” Cosby spokeswoman Ebonee Benson said. “Since when are all people honest? Since when are all women honest? We can take a look at Emmett Till, for example. Not all people are honest.”

Till, who was 14 when he died, was lynched after a white woman falsely claimed that he had briefly and crudely accosted her. His death and the acquittal of his accused killers became a symbol of how the American justice system places far less value on black lives. The woman recently admitted she’d lied.

Stephanopolous appeared visibly frustrated by Benson’s response.

Wyatt then went after lawyer Gloria Allred, who has been representing Cosby’s accusers.

“What Gloria Allred was able to do, what she did, was take a salt-and-pepper shaker — she shaked out a lot of salt and sprinkled in a little black pepper,” Wyatt said. “And the south came east. And that’s what we saw.”A Texas man avoided murder and manslaughter convictions after his attorney cited a defense often called “gay panic” as the reason he killed a neighbor.

James Miller of Austin was found guilty Tuesday of criminally negligent homicide in the 2015 death of Daniel Spencer, local NBC affiliate KXAN reports. He was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years probation and six months in jail. Miller also must complete 100 hours of community service, pay $11,000 in restitution to Spencer’s family and use an alcohol monitoring device for at least a year.

In September 2015, Spencer had invited Miller to his East Austin home to drink and play music. Miller testified that Spencer, who had relocated to Texas from Los Angeles about a year before his death, grew angry when Miller rejected his sexual advances, according to the Austin American-Statesman. Miller said Spencer then moved forward, brandishing a glass.

“We’re musicians and all that kind of stuff, but I’m not a gay guy,” Miller told police, according to an affidavit cited by KXAN. “It seemed like everything was alright and everything was fine. When I got ready to go, it seemed like [expletive] just started happening.”

Miller later testified that he stabbed Spencer, who was 37 years younger and at least 8 inches taller than him, twice.

“He had height advantage over me, arm length over me, youth over me,” he said. “I felt he was going to hurt me.”

Defense attorney Charlie Baird told KXAN that he didn’t think the verdict was fair. “We thought that he should have been acquitted on the basis of self-defense,” he said.

Prosecutor Matthew Foye told the TV station that the fact the jury didn’t let Miller off on his claims of self-defense “established that Daniel Spencer was a victim of a senseless killing by the defendant and he did not do anything to bring this upon himself.”

At present, 48 U.S. states allow the “gay panic” or “trans panic” defense, in which a defendant can cite a victim’s sexuality or gender identity as the justification for violent crime, usually to obtain lesser charges or a reduced sentence.

The defense tactic sparked debate in the LGBTQ community in 2016 when James Dixon was sentenced to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the 2013 beating death of Islan Nettles. Dixon said he’d been flirting with Nettles on the street before he knew she identified as transgender and that he attacked her after friends mocked him for trying to pick up a trans woman.

Queer rights advocates, including Nettles’ mother, felt the sentence was too light.A video showing former NFL player Desmond Marrow being violently arrested by police in Henry County, Georgia, is going viral, and one of the officers has been placed on administrative leave.

The video was taken in December but Marrow posted it to Facebook Thursday. He said officers arrested him for having a gun that in reality was his phone.

“During the arrest the police knocked my teeth out, slammed me on my head and choked me out until I was unconscious,” he said in the post, adding that he also suffered a shoulder strain and a concussion during the incident.

He added:

“I was fully cooperating with the officers with ZERO resistance. I thought I was going to die. I was sure I was passing out or dying when [the officer] was choking me as my breath kept slipping away.”

The video has been viewed more than 100,000 times.

Henry County Police officers showed the station a police report from Dec. 2 regarding a road rage incident allegedly involving Marrow, according to Atlanta station WXIA.

The report said when someone in another vehicle tossed coffee at the 30-year-old Marrow’s car, he chased it into a shopping center outside Atlanta.

An officer who responded to the scene said he saw Marrow and “several others” arguing in the mall parking lot.

A witness told the officer that he overheard Marrow say he was “going to shoot them,” according to WMAZ TV.

Other officers who arrived on the scene reportedly asked Marrow if he had a gun. After he told them no, an officer patted him down but found no weapon.

After officers told Marrow they were going to arrest him, he refused to cooperate. That’s when the struggle captured on video began.

Marrow was later charged with making terroristic threats, reckless driving and aggressive driving, according to the police report.

Marrow’s attorneys, Andrea Boyd and Chris Stewart, said the alleged road rage incident was actually a hate crime against their client.

“Prior to the violent incident with Henry County sheriff’s deputies, Mr. Marrow was the victim of a hate crime,” Boyd and Stewart said in a statement late Friday afternoon, according to WXIA. “He was called racial slurs by two white males while driving and had hot coffee thrown in his vehicle by these individuals. He then followed the individuals and a discussion ensued.

“A separate individual called 911 and erroneously reported that Mr. Marrow had a weapon, which he did not. When deputies arrived on scene, Mr. Marrow cooperated with their demands,” the statement continued. “We are working to determine why the deputies resorted to this level of violence with a man who was already handcuffed and complying with orders.”

A magistrate judge later dropped the terrorist threats charge and the case was transferred to the DA’s office, which must now decide if the case will be presented to a grand jury, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

On Friday, one of the officers involved in the incident was placed on administrative duty Friday pending the outcome of an internal investigation, according to the Henry Herald.

“Henry County Police Department is reviewing the events surrounding the arrest of Mr. Desmond Marrow, who was arrested by Henry County Police on December 2, 2017,” Capt. Joey Smith told the paper. “Although at the time of arrest an initial use of force review was conducted by Internal Affairs, earlier this month, Police Chief Mark Amerman ordered an Internal Affairs Investigation to be conducted.

“As of today, the officer involved is on administrative duty pending the outcome of the investigation. The criminal case against Mr. Marrow is currently pending in the Henry County District Attorney’s Office,” Smith continued. “The Henry County Police Department takes any charges of excessive use of force very seriously and wants to assure the public that this event will be fully investigated.”

Marrow was a defensive back for the University of Toledo and briefly played with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012, but never made it out of pre-season, according to NFL.com.“Don’t you think that it’s kind of surreal that we are in a place now as a country where we’re, like, ‘Oh, don’t listen to the president,’ like he’s a crazy person on a park bench with an onion tied to his belt, just mumbling incoherently?

The King blew some minds at the Dubai International Motor Show in November. Inspired by stealth fighter jets like the F-117 Nighthawk, the Karlmann King has a hulking, polygonal body frame, which pushes the SUV’s weight to nearly 10,000 pounds, and a matte finish. But while the company views the outside as a beast, it thinks of the inside as a jewel.

It features a 40-inch television, Playstation, internet, refrigerator, bar, integrated laptops, satellite navigation system, coffee machine and a rainbow of mood lighting. And for nearly $4 million, we would sure hope to have a coffee machine included.

The standard cost is $3.8 million, but the Karlmann King’s price is negotiated with each owner due to the customization options available, the company said. Check out some more photos of this monster below.

Police arrested DeAngelo, a 72-year-old former police officer, Tuesday in connection with the so-called Golden State Killer series of murders ― as many as 12 homicides, 45 rapes and several burglaries that investigators have spent decades trying to solve.

Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said at a Wednesday news conference that investigators found DNA evidence linking DeAngelo to two of the unsolved murder cases. Investigators believe those homicides are connected to at least 10 others committed by the same individual.

“We all knew that we were looking for a needle in a haystack, but we also all knew that the needle was there,” Schubert said.

Asked by reporters where officials had obtained DeAngelo’s DNA, Schubert would say only that they used a “discarded DNA sample.” More information, she said, would be forthcoming.

On Thursday, Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi confirmed reports that investigators used DNA collected from one of the crime scenes decades ago and compared it to genetic profiles on genealogical websites. Such sites allow individuals to present DNA samples in order to learn about their family backgrounds and determine any genetic predispositions they may have.

Grippi would not comment on which sites were used in the investigation. But one such service, called GEDmatch, said in a statement on Friday that its database was used in the investigators’ search.

“Although we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch’s policy to inform users that the database could be used for other uses, as set forth in the Site Policy,” the company said in a statement shared with HuffPost.

The statement added that site users should “understand the possible uses of their DNA, including identification of relatives that have committed crimes or were victims of crimes.” Those concerned by such potential uses, it said, should not upload their DNA to the database and/or remove already uploaded DNA.

Other well-known genealogical websites 23andMe and Ancestry said they were not involved in the investigation.

“It’s our policy to resist law enforcement inquiries to protect customer privacy,” a spokesperson for 23andMe said in a statement to HuffPost. “23andMe has never given customer information to law enforcement officials. Our platform is only available to our customers, and does not support the comparison of genetic data processed by any third party to genetic profiles within our database.”

Ancestry said in a statement: “We have not been in contact with law enforcement regarding the Joseph James DeAngelo case. Ancestry advocates for its members’ privacy and will not share any information with law enforcement unless compelled to by valid legal process.”

After narrowing in on family trees that were potential matches, investigators focused their search on DeAngelo, who had lived in the areas of the attacks and fit the age profile.

The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department then began watching DeAngelo and collected two DNA samples to cross-reference with the DNA from the crime scene, though officials did not elaborate on their methods for collecting those “discarded” samples.

Both results came back positive, leading to DeAngelo’s arrest Tuesday. He is scheduled for arraignment in Sacramento Superior Court on Friday.Kim Kardashian appears on a taping of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show." Ellen

Since Kim Kardashian has become her famous family’s de facto crisis manager at this point *cough* Kanye *cough* she’s taken on her next assignment: Tristan Thompson allegedly cheating on her sister Khloe Kardashian.

In a sneak peek of her appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” airing on Monday, Kim broke her silence about the various videos that surfaced earlier this month allegedly showing Khloe’s boyfriend, NBA star Tristan Thompson, cheating with multiple women.

“Poor Khloe,” the reality TV star told the talk show host. “I don’t even know how to describe it besides it’s just so fucked up.”

Days after the videos made the internet rounds, Khloe welcomed her first child with Thompson, a baby girl named True. Thompson was reportedly at her side during delivery and left the hospital hours later.

Neither Thompson nor Khloe have yet responded to the videos.

“We really were rooting for Khloe and we still are. She’s so strong and she’s doing the best that she can,” Kim added. “It’s a really sad situation all over. I kind of made this rule with my brother. If there’s a baby involved, I’m going to keep it cute and classy and try not to say anything negative because one day True is going to see this. It’s just so messed up.”

After the birth of her newest niece ― sister Kylie also had a daughter of her own earlier this year ― Kim praised Khloe’s strength on social media.

💕 @khloekardashian I’m so happy for you! Your baby girl is so beautiful! You are so strong, you made that look so easy! I can’t wait for our baby girls to grow up as best friends the way we are! I’m so happy I was able to return the favor of holding your leg while you pushed LOL — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 13, 2018

The beauty mogul also addressed husband Kanye West’s increasingly worrying return to Twitter on the talk show.

The rapper has been endlessly tweeting about his support for President Donald Trump, including sharing a photo of himself in a “Make America Great Again” hat. It’s put him at odds with some of his famous friends like John Legend and Chrissy Teigen.

While it’s not clear exactly when Kardashian’s appearance was filmed, (she doesn’t comment on any of West’s pro-Trump tweets in the clip) the mother of three did express some surprise about his return to social media.

“I didn’t even know he got his Twitter again,” she said in the clip. “At night, he came in and was like did you see my tweets ... and I followed him back.

On Wednesday, Kardashian came to West’s defense, criticizing media outlets for framing his social media resurgence as a mental health issue.

In 2016, The “Life of Pablo” rapper reportedly suffered a mental breakdown after a series of bizarre outbursts at his concerts. He was later hospitalized and proceeded to cancel his remaining tour dates.

“To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary,” she wrote. “So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.”

The ABC spy series’ timeline jumps ahead three years, and three new cast members were introduced, including Oscar winner Marlee Matlin and Alan Powell.

There were also some tweaks behind the scenes. Series creator Josh Safran has taken a backseat, with Michael Seitzman stepping in as showrunner. And this year, “Quantico” will offer just 13 episodes as opposed to the more usual 22.

Series star Priyanka Chopra told HuffPost that she thinks the last change is great news as “you don’t want to stretch out a whodunnit.”

One thing that remains the same is the topical and global nature of the storylines.

“This show rips headlines off the newspapers that we read and has your favorite TV characters solving those problems,” said Chopra, speaking to HuffPost at Build Series. “And each episode is a case that deals with some country that America liaisons with. We start with Italy and we end in Ireland, and in the middle we go to a lot of other countries as well.”

The first episode this season finds Chopra’s character, Alex Parrish, leaving her FBI and CIA work behind and harvesting grapes in Italy.

“Alex quits everything after the first two seasons. Everyone is always after my life. I need a little wine and tranquility,” Chopra said about her character. “She moves to Italy and you’ll find out through the season how and why that happened. And she has a new family drama there.”

That’s not the only drama that will unfold this season: Alex has multiple romances ahead.

“She has a lot of man drama this season,” Chopra said. “There are three guys she’s dealing with. It’s a lot.”

Throughout the season, those love stories will become intertwined with the action viewers have come to expect from “Quantico.”

“Alex almost dies this season — that’s a big spoiler alert,” Chopra revealed. “It has to do with water.”

Chopra, who performs her own stunts on the show, took part in the water scene.

“I was on my swim team. I love swimming, but I’m scared of drowning,” she said. “That scares me. And I had to do this one shot in which I was floating underground in a pool of water for a really long time ― and you know that sense of panic that comes in. And I wanted to do it myself because you see my waist and you see my hair, and I was like, ‘Come on. What kind of body double are we going to get for that?’”

Speaking of hair, that’s one of the few things Chopra has in common with her character. “We both have great hair,” she joked.

But otherwise, she said, “I’m very different from Alex. I’m a little bit more shy. I’m a lot more feminine. I like skirts. We both love heels. She does stunts in heels. I’ve actually started believing that if I get robbed or mugged or something that I actually would be able to beat people for real. I think it’s working adversely on my self-confidence ― that I’m becoming really, really confident. It’s probably not a good idea because I don’t want to be mugged. I don’t want to test the theory.”

In real life, Chopra is thrilled to be on a series that celebrates diversity. With “Quantico,” she is the first South Asian woman to lead the cast of an American network drama series.

“Kudos to ABC and Disney for actually pushing diversity in such a big way and it’s amazing that TV’s doing it. But, guys, it’s a little bit late! Can we acknowledge that? We need to be seeing a lot more representation. … We don’t look like one person. It makes me super proud to be able to do that, but I don’t like harping on the fact that I’m the first,” she said. “I like to make people believe and understand that … there should be a lot more like that. I hope with the show doing as well as it has and us delivering numbers that diversity doesn’t become a conversation or an anomaly, but a norm ― because inclusion is important.”

Whitney Houston fans will soon be treated to “an intimate, unflinching portrait” of the legendary pop diva, who died in 2012, in a new estate-approved documentary.

“Whitney,” which hits theaters this summer, “probes beyond familiar tabloid headlines and sheds new light on the spellbinding trajectory of Houston’s life,” according to a press release sent to HuffPost. (Catch a sneak peek of the film in the trailer above.)

“Using never-before-seen archival footage, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances, audio archives and original interviews with the people who knew her best, Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Macdonald unravels the mystery behind ‘The Voice,’ who thrilled millions even as she struggled to make peace with her own troubled past,” the release says.

Macdonald, whose credits include 2006’s “The Last King of Scotland,” told Rolling Stone that “Whitney” is “an intimate family story that reveals a new side to a woman that even her most die-hard fans never knew.”

“I approached Whitney’s life like a mystery story; why did someone with so much raw talent and beauty self-destruct so publicly and painfully? I was lucky enough to have the support of Pat Houston and the Whitney Houston estate in this quest,” he said. “They entrusted me with the ‘keys to the vault’ while giving me complete freedom to follow the story wherever it went.”

“Whitney” follows an unauthorized documentary, “Whitney: Can I Be Me.” That film, directed by Nick Broomfield, sparked controversy for appearing to confirm longstanding rumors about Houston’s bisexuality by implying she was in a romantic relationship with her childhood friend Robyn Crawford.

Houston’s family, however, denounced “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” which debuted on Showtime last year.Emmy Award-winning actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus is slated to be honored with this year’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced on Wednesday.

The coveted prize is considered one of the top honors in the comedy world. It aims to celebrate humorists who have made a similar impact on American culture and society as literary legend Samuel Clemens, known as Mark Twain.

“Like Mark Twain, Julia has enriched American culture with her iconic, unforgettable, and outright hilarious brand of humor,” Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, said in a statement, according to the New York Times. “Over four decades, her wildly original characters and her gift for physical comedy have left us in stitches.”

Louis-Dreyfus’ portrayal of Elaine Benes in NBC’s “Seinfeld” made her an American comedy icon and beloved in the hearts of audiences everywhere. But it’s her role as everyone’s favorite incompetent politician, Selina Meyer, in HBO’s “Veep” that led her to break award records.

She holds the record for the most Emmys won by a single performer, and she has won the most consecutive Emmys for a single role ― Meyer in “Veep,” which enters its seventh season this year. Louis-Dreyfus also executive produces the show.

Louis-Dreyfus tweeted that the news of the announcement was “insanely exciting.”

The actress will be honored with the Mark Twain Prize on October 21, 2018 in an event filled with more of comedy’s best. The gala is taped every year and broadcast on PBS.

Louis-Dreyfus announced in September that she has breast cancer and has been vocal on social media about fighting it. In February, she posted her “first post-op photo,” a glamorous headshot that the Kennedy Center used in the tweet above, along with the caption, “Fuck you, cancer.”“Somebody is going to produce a tape of prostitutes peeing on a bed. It’s going to look like security camera footage from a hotel room. It may be in black and white.

The Pledge of Allegiance describes the United States as “one nation, under God.” But a new study from the Pew Research Center shows that for a significant number of Americans, “God” is not the God of the Bible.

The online survey of more than 4,700 adults, published Wednesday, found that a slim majority of Americans described themselves as believing in God “as described in the Bible” (56 percent). On the other hand, 33 percent of Americans said that while they don’t believe in that God, they do believe in some other higher power or spiritual force in the universe.

This belief in something bigger is found even among those who identify as atheists, agnostics or “nothing in particular” ― a group that previous Pew research has found makes up more than 22 percent of adults and is growing. In fact, 72 percent of that religiously unaffiliated group, collectively known as “nones,” expressed belief in God or a higher power. Fifty-three percent of them said they believe in a vague spiritual force, 17 percent confessed to believing in the God of the Bible, and 2 percent were unclear on the particulars.

Pew Research Center

Not surprisingly, Christians were the most likely to say they believed in the God described in the Bible (80 percent). This belief was especially pronounced among Christians who go to historically black Protestant churches (92 percent) and evangelicals (91 percent).

But there were some differences in belief within Christian denominations. For example, 26 percent of mainline Protestants and 28 percent of Catholics said they believe in a higher power or spiritual force, but not in the God of the Bible.

Only 33 percent of Jews said they believe in the God of the Bible, while 56 percent just believe in a higher power or spiritual force.

There were not enough responses for Pew to draw conclusions about Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and other religious believers.

Ryan T. Cragun, a professor of sociology at The University of Tampa who studies secularization, told HuffPost that the survey aligns with other research indicating that non-belief is growing in the U.S.

While none of the atheists surveyed said they believe in the God of the Bible, about 18 percent said they believe in another higher power or spiritual force. Cragun said he suspects that this higher power that atheists and many other religiously unaffiliated folks are referring to is not necessarily supernatural and may lack other classic Judeo-Christian characteristics.

“For many people, when they claim they believe in a higher power, they are not referring to something supernatural, like a deistic god or the force that underlies all things that is part of Hinduism or Buddhism,” Cragun said. “To the contrary, they are describing something like the laws of nature or a sense of connection to all of humanity.”

Young people were less likely than older Americans to say they believe in the God of the Bible. About two-thirds of adults 50 and older said they believe in God as described in the Bible, while only 43 percent of those aged 18 to 29 said the same.

While the new survey did not address how beliefs in God or another higher power have changed in recent years, previous studies have indicated that the percentage of Americans who say they believe in God or a universal spirit has generally been declining. In 2007, Pew found that 71 percent of U.S. adults said they believed in God with absolute certainty. In 2014, that number had slipped down to 63 percent.

Tom Krattenmaker, a religion columnist and author of Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, told HuffPost that the Pew findings bring encouraging news for those who don’t think faith and secularism need to be at loggerheads.

“Despite this being an age of disaffiliation,” Krattenmaker said, “it’s clear that people are still pursuing spirituality and trying to cultivate meaning and purpose in their lives.”Wake Smith imagines a fleet of experimental airplanes, not much larger than Boeing 757s, that could climb to 60,000 feet, high enough for people aboard to see the curvature of the earth, and release gas into the lower stratosphere.

In order to ensure global coverage of their payload, the planes, looking more like firefighting tanker aircraft than commercial airliners, would take off from four different latitudes ― say runways in Houston, Manila, Brasilia and Johannesburg. On five-hour missions, they would seed the skies with blankets of clear, stinky, aerosolized sulfur dioxide gas. Dispersing 100,000 tons of SO2 annually over several years would begin to approximate levels of the gas that follow a major volcanic eruption, blocking out the sun and lowering the temperature of the earth.

Scientists have proposed solar radiation management, as it’s called, for decades as a form of global-scale geoengineering that could combat global warming. But few have done what Smith, a partner at a private equity firm and former airline executive, has done ― turned pie-in-the-sky, back-of-the-envelope calculations into a full-fledged feasibility study, complete with a development and operating budget for his fleet of planes.

Encouraged by the attention he has been getting from researchers at institutions like Harvard, where he was recently invited to present his work, Smith has worked out a 10-year operating plan for planes that would begin spraying SO2 in 2023.

The whole endeavor, Smith said, is far cheaper and simpler than he initially imagined. There are no real barriers, he said. The total cost of the project? A measly $3.5 billion, he estimated.

“I think it’s bad news how cheap this is,” Smith told a small group last month in a conference room at Harvard’s Center for the Environment. For that kind of money, Smith argued, it’s possible that any rogue nation, organization or individual could start experimenting with the climate.

The impacts of geoengineering on the global scale are unknown, in part because no massive geoengineering project has been undertaken ― apart from human-induced climate change. But models are potentially troubling. Some suggest geoengineering will disrupt rainfall worldwide and damage the earth’s protective ozone layer. A Rutgers University study published in January suggested that suddenly stopping a large geoengineering project, once it has started, could lead to rapid warming, pushing species into extinction and accelerating climate change.

As global temperatures continue to rise, however, some researchers say geoengineering shouldn’t be dismissed. Helene Muri, a researcher at the University of Oslo geosciences department, said it shows promise as a way to reduce harm from climate change, but it is not ready. “We need to know more about the risks involved before we, if we can ever, deem it safe to use,” she said. “Solar geoengineering is in any case not a substitute for cutting CO2 emissions.”

Yet, with every year and climate conference that passes, a global-scale geoengineering project becomes more and more feasible. There’s virtually no regulation stopping a country or individual from trying this, Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told me. In fact, from a legal perspective, it’s easier to seed the stratosphere than get a permit to remodel your home, he added.

“I think there is such a large chance that someone will try geoengineering that it really needs to be governed,“ said Gerrard. That’s why, together with Tracy Hester at the University of Houston Law Center, he just published a book, Climate Engineering and the Law, intended to help policymakers, technologists and lawyers better understand current regulations and science underlying big-scale geoengineering projects.

The question is when such a project might be attempted, and by who? Gerrard imagines a scenario in which some country, in the wake of a ruinous climate disaster, sees no other choice.

“One could imagine that if some catastrophic [climate] event were to occur in India, and they had a real concern that another one could happen, they would want to, on their own, launch a geoengineering effort to protect themselves against the next one. That’s an entirely plausible scenario,” said Gerrard. That’s why global agreement on governance is needed, he said, followed by country-by-country laws on geoengineering. Failing to legislate, he warned, could result in war because of the harmful climatic consequences of one country’s hasty project.

However imminent a large-scale geoengineering project may be, what’s complicating serious debate on the matter is the narrative perpetuated, in the media and online, that geoengineering is a way to “solve,” “fix” or “stop” climate change.

This trend has persisted for over a decade. For a 2014 paper published in Environmental Humanities, researchers in Sweden analyzed hundreds of news articles and found that one of the most prevalent storylines around geoengineering was “the notion that pure technology is the only possible solution and that it is an adequate substitute for politics.”

This may be partly because of the way scientists angle their research. “In these days of click-baits and social media likes, it is perhaps tempting to pitch the extreme case scenarios,” said Muri. “I think it is our responsibility as scientists to present our findings in a careful and nuanced way.”

Washington has now caught the geoengineering bug. Ironically, it’s the politicians who have long questioned ― and attacked ― science who are now heralding it as a quick-fix to our climate conundrum.

In a recent op-ed for conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, House Science Committee Chair Lamar Smith (R-Texas), an avowed global warming skeptic, called out geoengineering as an “area of research that has been overlooked for too long.” Instead of “broad, burdensome, ineffective government regulations” or pledging to meet an “arbitrary climate goal,” Smith wrote, we should use technology to find solutions. “As in the past, by letting technology lead the way, Americans will reap the benefits and enjoy a better quality of life,” he wrote.

It’s no surprise that geoengineering is such an easy sell. Relying on a technological fix that’s just over the horizon avoids the mountain moving required to wean ourselves off fossil fuels, bring hundreds of countries into agreement on how to limit and clean up emissions, and alter the consumption habits of an entire civilization. Those are systemic complexities ingrained in our economies and cultures. Propping up glaciers to limit sea level rise, sprinkling iron dust into the oceans to encourage plankton growth to absorb carbon, or spraying the skies to reflect the sun’s heat just seems simpler. And, as Wake Smith shows, increasingly feasible.

But the problem with the way geoengineering is discussed today, lamented John Ehrenfeld, former director of the MIT Program on Technology, Business, and Environment, is that it doesn’t address the societal issues that got us in this mess in the first place.

“It’s a failure to accept complexity of the system, and the system includes people,” Ehrenfeld told me recently over coffee. For decades, Ehrenfeld, who is now retired, researched and promoted the concept of sustainability. But to Ehrenfeld, after all the climate conferences, all the stakeholder roundtables, all the debates on market-driven solutions, the questions and answers being debated never questioned capitalism, civilization, and the notion of progress.

Tackling a problem as deeply ingrained as global warming, Ehrenfeld said, will require humanity to face an existential question that geoengineering alone cannot address: Are we willing to sacrifice growth to ensure the survival of our species?

“Absent decoupling growth from progress,” Ehrenfeld said, “we won’t address the core of the problem.”
