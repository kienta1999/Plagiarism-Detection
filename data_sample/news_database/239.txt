KFC restaurants in the United Kingdom are facing an unprecedented problem: not enough chicken.

The shortage, which was blamed on delivery issues, has forced KFC to close more than half of its 900 British restaurants, leaving some of its customers clucking mad ― with some apparently even calling the police.

As of late Tuesday morning, 646 of the fast-food chain’s restaurants remained closed after its delivery contractor failed to make good on its orders, the BBC reported.

“The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants,” KFC said on Twitter. “We’ve brought a new delivery partner onboard, but they’ve had a couple of teething problems ― getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex!”

DHL reportedly took over responsibility for delivering chicken for the restaurant last week. The delivery company has since blamed “operational issues” for the delays and incomplete shipments.

According to The Financial Times, delivery company Bidvest had supplied KFC’s European restaurants since 2011.

The decision to switch contractors didn’t come without criticism from the U.K.’s general trade union, GMB. In a statement posted to its website on Monday, GMB criticized KFC for making what it called a “bird-brained” decision in an attempt to increase profits.

“We tried to warn KFC this decision would have consequences – well now the chickens are coming home to roost,” the union said in a statement. “Bidvest are specialists – a food distribution firm with years of experience. DHL are scratching around for any work they can get, and undercut them.”

GMB expressed concern not only for KFC’s chicken-loving customers, but also the restaurants’ employees “who are not being paid.”

KFC told the BBC that its employees working at chain-owned restaurants, as opposed to franchises, will be paid the average number of hours worked per day over the past 12 weeks, and that those who receive fixed salaries will be paid as normal.

The chain encouraged franchise owners to follow the same compensation protocol. According to KFC’s website, 95 percent of its U.K. restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees.

John Boulter, a managing director for DHL in the U.K. and Ireland, said Tuesday in a statement to HuffPost that it is committed to ensuring that KFC will be able to reopen its stores in the coming days.

“DHL regrets the interruption of supply and is working diligently to rectify the situation by working with KFC and other partners involved in the supply chain,” Boulter said. “Whilst we are not the only party responsible for the supply chain to KFC, we do apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment caused to KFC and their customers by this incident.”

A representative for KFC did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Tuesday.

As KFC works to rustle up some chicken, Twitter users offered some advice, alternatives and theories behind the delays. Among the social media posts were local police in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets reminding the public that a fried chicken shortage isn’t enough of a crisis to call them for help.

JC x — Jesus Christ (@ResurrectedDude) February 19, 2018Russia has its own blond-haired reality TV star running for president, and much like Donald Trump’s 2016 race for the White House, there is suspicion that the Kremlin might be colluding with her campaign.

Ksenia Sobchak, known to many as the “Paris Hilton of Russia,” is a candidate in the country’s presidential elections next month, when she officially hopes to unseat Vladimir Putin. Modeling her “Against All” campaign on Trump’s anti-establishment politics, the 36-year-old socialite is a unique voice in Russia’s election season. Unlike Trump, however, she won’t come anywhere close to winning the presidency.

Putin, who doesn’t have to worry about criticism in Russia’s state-run media, enjoys remarkably high approval ratings. His victory is essentially a foregone conclusion. So why has Sobchak bothered to challenge him? In an election where nothing seems left to chance, the true goals of her candidacy have given analysts and pundits something to talk about.

Kremlin Ties

Russian opposition figures suspect Sobchak’s presidential bid is part of a thinly veiled Kremlin plot that serves three main purposes: to reduce voter apathy, divide support for Putin’s other opponents, and foster the illusion of a free and democratic election in a country plagued by widespread allegations of political corruption.

The TV anchor, journalist and actress is a household name in Russia, having risen to fame in 2004 as a reality show host. She has known Putin since she was a child ― he even attended her baptism ― but she has publicly opposed his rule for years.

Her father, Anatoly Sobchak, was Putin’s mentor. In 1999, after Sobchak came under investigation for the alleged misuse of funds during his time as mayor of St. Petersburg, then-Prime Minister Putin helped him return from exile. Sobchak died suddenly the following year, when his daughter was still a teenager, and Putin wept at his funeral.

The close ties between Ksenia Sobchak and Putin have led analysts to question her opposition credentials. Her candidacy is merely “a Kremlin-managed opportunity, simply to undermine [Putin’s rivals], and more to the point, to try to create some degree of excitement around the election,” according to Mark Galeotti, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague.

“That’s pretty obvious,” Galeotti said in a video for The Moscow Times. “This is all an attempt to increase the turnout rate and increase the sense that this is a genuinely legitimate election.”

But Sobchak and Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov have fiercely denied such claims. She maintains that she simply wants to present a liberal alternative to the incumbent, although she believes the vote is already rigged in his favor.

“These elections, to my mind, are a kind of fake elections. They are not real. You can’t win in a casino — the casino always wins. In the same way, Putin always wins,” Sobchak told NPR during a visit to Washington this month.

The Alternative To The Alternative

Putin became Russia’s prime minister in 1999 and then first won the presidency in 2000, serving in that post until 2008. After four more years as prime minister, he was again elected president in 2012.

Sobchak told NPR she thinks Putin has not interfered with her candidacy ― as he is accused of doing to other presidential hopefuls ― because she appears to present less of a threat.

“I think Putin maybe underestimates me. Or he’s less afraid of me than, let’s say for example, [political activist] Alexei Navalny,” she said. “But that’s good for me, and that’s good for [the] opposition, because it gives us a chance to squeeze through all those restrictions.”

Navalny, perhaps the Russian president’s most vocal critic, was barred from registering as a candidate in this election because of a previous conviction in a fraud case, which itself was widely viewed as a move by Moscow to prevent him from running. But Navalny is not going quietly ― he is urging Russians across the country to boycott the vote in protest.

Over the years, Navalny has been jailed repeatedly for organizing public rallies. Now, rather than instructing his supporters to back Sobchak, the 41-year-old has lambasted her candidacy, saying in a YouTube video last year that Putin and his supporters “need a cartoonish liberal candidate at a time when they don’t want to allow me to enter the race.”

Eyes On The Prize

Sobchak will not win the presidency this year, but her campaign could boost her legitimacy in future runs for office. She told NPR that after the March 18 election, she plans to set her sights on a seat in the Russian Parliament. Russia observers suspect she could be positioning herself to run for president again in 2024 ― when Putin, who will be 72, will be constitutionally barred from seeking another consecutive term.

“We have to work hard for those six years to make [Putin] really go away and give his powers to a compromise figure between [the] opposition and his rule,” Sobchak told BuzzFeed this month. “I think that’s the only peaceful option ... but that’s a realistic option.”

With his ironclad grip on power, however, what incentive would Putin have to allow Sobchak to become his successor?

“The answer is simple,” according to New Yorker writer Masha Gessen, who has authored several books about Russia and Putin, and has reported on Sobchak for years. “[Putin] could trust [Sobchak] to protect him from prosecution the way that he once protected her father,” Gessen wrote recently, adding that it’s also possible that Putin might “try to stay in office indefinitely.”

Others like Paul Christensen, an expert in Russian domestic politics and a political science professor at Boston College, doubt that Sobchak would have a chance even in 2024.

“Unless something fundamental changes in the way Russian politics works, I don’t see that happening. ... Barring a major shift in the way the political system is structured, the heir apparent will probably come out of the existing government or the hierarchy of [the political party] United Russia,” he told HuffPost.

“If you want to look for successors to Putin, you don’t really look at the liberal opposition,” Christensen said. “You look at the existing structures of power.”

Candidate Sobchak’s Accomplishments

Even if she doesn’t position herself for 2024, Sobchak’s doomed bid for the presidency this year has not been entirely frivolous. She has used her fame ― which has expanded outside Russia thanks to her campaign ― to discuss topics that are often taboo in her country, including LGBTQ rights, political prisoners and feminist issues.

“In Russia, unfortunately, we have a conservative kind of thinking about women, and for many, it’s totally unacceptable that a woman can be a politician and can run for [the] presidency,” she told BuzzFeed. “I have a dream. I want one day to see a big women’s march as it was here in America.”

Sobchak has also described herself as the “only candidate who supports the sexual minorities in Russia,” saying that she would “vote for them to be married in a moment where most people want them again to go to prison just for doing this.”

The “faux candidate” could potentially become a female political role model in Russia, according to Galeotti, and that could make a long-term difference.

AdvertisementBEIRUT, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Pro-government forces bombarded Syria’s eastern Ghouta on Tuesday, killing at least 49 people, after the heaviest one-day death toll there in three years on Monday, a war monitoring group said.

Some 127 people were killed in air raids, rocket strikes and shelling of the area near Damascus on Monday, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

About 190 have died since the bombing intensified late on Sunday and 850 have been injured, it said.

The United Nations called for an immediate ceasefire in the area on Monday, saying the situation was “spiraling out of control” after an “extreme escalation in hostilities.”

The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, a coalition of international agencies that funds hospitals in Syria, said bombs had hit five hospitals in eastern Ghouta on Monday.

In Geneva, the U.N. children’s fund issued a blank “statement” to express its outrage at the casualties among Syrian children, saying it had run out of words.

The violence in eastern Ghouta is part of a wider escalation in fighting on several fronts in Syria as President Bashar al-Assad pushes to end the seven-year rebellion against him.

Mortars fired by rebels in eastern Ghouta landed in Damascus on Tuesday, causing two deaths and several injuries, Syrian state media reported. At least one person died from rebel mortar fire in the capital on Monday.

Lebanon’s al-Manar television, which is aligned with Assad’s ally Hezbollah, reported on Monday that the Syrian army was sending reinforcements towards eastern Ghouta after rebel assaults.

Assad’s most powerful supporter, Russia, has been following a diplomatic track at the same time as the increase in fighting, resulting in the establishment of several “de-escalation zones.”

Eastern Ghouta is in one of these areas, where violence is meant to be contained, but the de-escalation agreement does not include a former al Qaeda affiliate which has a small presence there.

Other insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta, including Islamist factions, say the Syrian government and Russia are using the jihadist presence as a pretext to continue their bombardment.

Neither the Syrian military nor Russia commented on the renewed bombardment in eastern Ghouta, but they have often said they do not target civilians.Ziga Jeglic #8 of Slovenia celebrates after scoring the winning goal in a shootout against Slovakia during the Men's Ice Hockey Preliminary Round on Day 8 of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at Kwangdong Hockey Centre on February 17, 2018 in Gangneung, South Korea. Maddie Meyer via Getty Images

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Slovenia men’s ice hockey player Ziga Jeglic has tested positive for a banned substance and has been suspended for the remainder of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Tuesday.

It added that Jeglic, who tested positive for fenoterol, had accepted the anti-doping rule violation and would leave the Olympics within 24 hours. Fenoterol can be taken for asthma as it facilitates breathing by opening up the airways.

Jeglic, who scored the shootout winner against Slovakia on Saturday, had failed an in-competition test and the final decision on his sanction would come after the end of the Games, CAS said.

The 29-year-old has played his entire career in Europe and has been competing in the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the past four seasons.

The Slovenian Olympic committee said Jeglic was tested four days ago and that only the ‘A’ sample had been examined before the player accepted the violation.

“Ziga Jeglic will not play for Slovenia against Norway today. Until the completion of the procedure, the leadership of the Slovenian Olympic team cannot and will not make any statements,” it added.Cambridge Analytica may technically no longer exist,* but revelations about its conduct before and during the 2016 election continue to raise concerns about how social media can be used to undermine fundamental democratic processes.

On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie testified before the Senate judiciary committee. The wide-ranging, three-hour exchange with the company’s former research director did little to allay fears.

The panel also featured Mark Jamison, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Eitan Hersh, a professor at Tufts University and an expert on voter behavior and election strategies.

Here are some of the major points of discussion:

There were targeted efforts to suppress voters by race.

Wylie testified that Cambridge Analytica actively worked to undermine voters of color and foster political disengagement ― a tactic that featured more and more heavily in conversations just before Wylie left the firm in 2014, though he says he didn’t personally oversee or participate in any of those programs.

According to Wylie, Cambridge Analytica’s algorithms could very accurately predict race, and then go a step further by serving differentiated messages within that group. So instead of serving similar, generic messages to a large group of black people, for example, Cambridge Analytica could isolate and target specific individuals within that group who displayed certain character traits.

“When you pull a random sample of African Americans, they’re all different people,” he said. “Understanding their internal characteristics is a very powerful thing. You don’t treat them just as a black person, you treat them as [individuals].”

Cambridge Analytica likely made similar efforts to suppress the votes of other communities, Wylie said, targeting “anybody with characteristics that would lead them to vote for the Democratic Party.”

The Mercers carried a lot of clout within Cambridge Analytica ― and there’s a chance they violated campaign finance law.

Robert Mercer is a billionaire megadonor who supports conservative causes. The Mercer family initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the 2016 Republican primary, then shifted their support to Donald Trump in the general election.

In 2013, at the urging of Steve Bannon ― who would later serve as White House strategist in the Trump administration ― Mercer invested tens of millions of dollars in Cambridge Analytica to effectively create an American shell company for its British parent, SCL Group.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) posited on Wednesday that Mercer’s move gave Cambridge Analytica the appearance of following U.S. election law, which prohibits foreign firms from working on U.S. elections. But Wylie testified that Cambridge Analytica nevertheless featured numerous British staffers, in violation of a 2014 memo from outside legal counsel warning it not to do so.

What’s more, Mercer’s funding came on the condition that Cambridge Analytica work only with Republicans. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wondered Wednesday if the “investments” may have been a deliberate attempt to circumvent campaign finance laws.

“Whenever Mercer invested money, it was for [research and development] which ultimately was to the benefit of its clients ― various PACs and campaigns,” Wylie told Blumenthal. He added that Mercer’s funds allowed Cambridge Analytica “to work on projects and charge clients substantially less money for the work that was being done than it would have actually cost had the clients been paying for it themselves.”

After Mercer put money in, “the only restriction was that we not work with Democrats,” he said.

Cambridge Analytica had its hands in a lot of cookie jars ― many of them Russian.

According to Wednesday’s testimony, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, engaged yet another subsidiary, named Aggregate IQ, to bolster the Brexit campaign. Per Wylie, the campaign groups Vote Leave, BeLeave and Veterans for Britain all had contracts with the company. (Separately Wednesday, The Guardian reported that Vote Leave and BeLeave both used the same data sets to target Facebook users, indicating a higher level of coordination than previously realized.)

Wylie also says Cambridge Analytica enlisted the help of Black Cube, an Israeli private intelligence group, to conduct espionage work in Nigeria.

And Cambridge Analytica has numerous ties to Russia. In 2014, Alexander Nix, Cambridge’s CEO, met with executives from Lukoil, Russia’s second largest oil company, to discuss the firm’s political work in Nigeria and elsewhere.

The firm was also in contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, though Feinstein acknowledged Wednesday that “the extent of Cambridge Analytica’s connection to WikiLeaks and other Russian interests” isn’t clear.

Wylie said Cambridge Analytica also engaged with contractors who had advanced pro-Russian messages in Eastern Europe, at one point collecting data on how Americans viewed the leadership style of Russian President Vladimir Putin and what their thoughts were on issues “relating to Russian expansionism.”

“There was a lot of contact with Russian companies that made it known this research was being done,” Wylie said. “A lot of noise was being made to companies and individuals who were connected to the Russian government.”

Did it even work?

Probably ― though it’s not clear to what extent.

Armed with enough data points from Facebook, Wylie said, Cambridge Analytica could target people remarkably well. Based on as few as 100 of a person’s Facebook “likes,” he said, “you can get to the same level of accuracy predicting personality traits as your spouse.”

Hersh, the Tufts professor, disputed the idea that predictive capacity translates to persuasive advertising, pointing out that political campaigns have a long history of engaging in tactics that don’t work particularly well.

“Every election brings exaggerated claims about the effects of the latest technologies,” Hersh said, noting it’s in the interest of campaign consultants like Cambridge Analytica to embellish their role in a candidate’s victory. “From everything I’ve publicly seen about [the firm], I’m skeptical its strategies were unusually effective.”

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), however, called Hersh’s argument “rubbish,” saying advertising can absolutely have a lasting impact when done well.

“I see kids walking around all the time saying ‘Dilly dilly,’” Kennedy said, referring to a popular tag line from a recent series of beer commercials. “They didn’t just dream that up.”

The Senate judiciary committee would like to ask Steve Bannon a few questions.

Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014 and was therefore unable to answer specific questions about the firm’s work during the 2016 election. Instead, he repeatedly referred the senators to Bannon, who helped launch Cambridge Analytica and was reportedly deeply involved in its early efforts to collect Facebook data and use it to target and influence voters.

Bannon served as Trump’s chief campaign strategist during the 2016 election, then assumed a similar role in the White House until his ouster last summer. Per Wylie, Bannon was in charge when Cambridge Analytica began touting its voter suppression tactics to candidates.

Bannon was also behind crafting messages like “drain the swamp” that would ultimately become focal points of the Trump campaign.

“The company learned [there] were segments of the population that responded to messages like ‘Drain the swamp,’ or images of walls, or indeed paranoia about the ‘deep state,’ that weren’t necessarily reflected in mainstream polling or mainstream political discourse,” Wylie said, adding that Bannon “saw cultural warfare as the means to create enduring change in American politics.”

It seems pretty clear: Social media hurts democracy.

Amid much uncertainty about Cambridge Analytica and just how much influence it wielded in 2016, most of the experts Wednesday agreed on one thing: Social media is bad for democracy.

“We’re seeing a resegregation of society that’s catalyzed by algorithms,” Wylie said. Sites like Facebook reward informational echo chambers where partisan views are reinforced instead of challenged. “Instead of a common fabric,” he said, “we’re tearing that fabric apart.”

The further people drift from the mainstream, the more they’re susceptible to absurd conspiracy theories and increasingly vitriolic messaging.

Hersh agreed. “We have a basic human response that we are attracted to provocation and extremism,” he said, “and online platforms are encouraging that behavior. We aren’t drawn to things that are truthful. We’re drawn to what we want.”Activist and actress Yara Shahidi is celebrating Black History Month by paying homage to black girls and their endless magic.

In partnership with Google, Shahidi wrote an open letter and filmed a video, both titled “To Be a Black Girl.” Her words capture the struggles and joys of black women past and present.

“To be a black girl is to be one of the reasons the universe thrives,” she begins. “Our lineage has taught me that I am integral, that we are important, even when society dismisses us, hiding the wonder of our presence, a trail set for and before us by generations of powerful and empowered Black women.”

The letter, which reads like an acrostic poem, goes on to list the ways black women have influenced black culture and American society as a whole. She drops names including activist-authors Angela Davis and Janet Mock. Shahidi also makes it a point to mention that musician Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and not Elvis Presley, invented rock ’n’ roll. She then quotes poet Nikki Giovanni: “Art is not for the cultivated taste. It is to cultivate taste.”

Shahidi recites the letter in the video. With images of pioneering black women playing in the background, the star emphasizes that this history is one to honor. Supporting her are snaps from the South African Women’s March in 1956, simple shots of black women attending Howard University and classic portraits of civil rights heroes Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King.

In each moment, this letter gives credit to the black women typically forgotten and celebrates those continuing to make waves.

“A study of my history tells me that I will soar, despite the continuation of oppression, neglect and objectification. We will soar,” she says.President Donald Trump has endorsed Mitt Romney's bid for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Utah's Orrin Hatch. Bloomberg via Getty Images

President Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney’s bid for the U.S. Senate in a tweet Monday evening, despite a history of criticism between the two men.

“He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!” the president said on Twitter.

.@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018

Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican nominee for president, formally announced last Friday that he would seek the seat that will be vacated by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) later this year after 42 years in office.

Romney is expected to be a popular candidate in Utah, where he is remembered as the man behind the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he also enjoys strong support among Utah’s large Mormon population.

However Romney, 70, was one of the most outspoken Republican critics of Trump during the 2016 election, and he bashed the then-candidate as a “phony” and a “fraud” after Trump failed to denounce white supremacists. Romney later said he couldn’t vote for him or his rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, saying he wished Americans “had better choices.”

“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle, and I only hope and aspire we’ll see more greatness,” he said in March 2016.

Trump fired back his own barbs, saying Romney “choked like a dog” during his own bids for the presidency. Some of that tension appeared to wane after reports that Trump was considering Romney to be his secretary of state, but the president has reportedly remained wary of Romney’s allegiances and lobbied heavily for Hatch to run for re-election rather than retire.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told The New York Times on Friday he couldn’t imagine why Trump wouldn’t endorse Romney, despite the duo’s history.

“We don’t want to lose the seat, and this looks like a pretty formidable candidate,” he said, noting that Romney’s prestige would allow him to “come in here with a level of national identity and respect that will make him effective from Day 1.”

During his candidacy announcement on Friday, Romney delivered some pointed critiques of lawmakers in Washington, D.C., including an overt attack on Trump’s restrictive immigration plans.

Conservative cable network Fox News is launching a paid streaming service it’s billing as “an exclusive Over-the-Top (OTT) opinion platform” called Fox Nation, the outlet announced Tuesday.

The platform, which is scheduled for a late 2018 debut, will cater to Fox News “superfans,” the network’s senior vice president of development and production said in a statement. Content exclusive to the streaming service will focus on hosts’ opinions and give viewers a chance to interact in some way with big network personalities. They will also be given access to “exclusive events,” but the network released few details about how the service will work.

The cost of Fox Nation will be announced at a later date, the network said. Viewers will not need a cable subscription to access it.

The announcement comes days after the network’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, announced quarterly profits that beat Wall Street estimates. The earnings were helped in part by increases in the fees it collects from cable and satellite distributors.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters

In 2018, America’s students are a diverse bunch ― a majority of students in our schools now come from minority groups. However, the educators working with these students are still overwhelmingly white and female. President Donald Trump’s immigration policies may only make this problem worse ― especially for Latinx students and teachers.

Latinx students are the largest ethnic minority in our nation’s schools, making up about a quarter of all students in kindergarten through 12th grade. On the other hand, less than 8 percent of the nation’s teachers identify as Latinx.

This problem is especially severe in certain states, per new data from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. In states such as California, about half of the school students are Latinx, yet there is a gap of more than 36 percentage points between the numbers of Latinx students and teachers. States like Nevada, Arizona and Texas also have gaps of over or about 30 percentage points.

Advocates fear this problem will get worse as the future of programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals are in jeopardy. About 20,000 teachers nationwide are Dreamers, the name given to recipients of the DACA protection against deportation for those who arrived in the U.S. as minors. Trump has rescinded DACA but given Congress a deadline to “fix” the program. So far, however, he has put obstacles in the path of several efforts to spare it.

And as the president generally maintains a contentious relationship with the nation’s immigrant and Latinx communities, teachers who understand these issues can be an important resource for students. Bilingual Latinx teachers could also play a key role in helping English language learners.

It’s an issue that has grown in urgency as teachers report watching their immigrant students experience increasing difficulty engaging in school amid what appears to be a more hostile national climate.

“Teacher diversity in general is an issue. The problems we face to attract Latino teachers has its own separate sphere of problems,” said Sarah Shapiro, a research assistant at the Center for American Progress who worked on the brief.

The Center for American Progress found that 40 of 41 states with available data had a Latinx student and teacher diversity gap.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Tuesday that it had raised $9.3 million last month, the largest ever January haul for the campaign arm of House Democrats.

Of that total, the DCCC raised $3.4 million online in average donations of $18, a figure that points to enthusiasm among grassroots activists in addition to well-heeled donors.

The January numbers reinforce early signs of Democratic excitement that bode well for the party’s performance in November’s midterm elections.

“Our long run of record-breaking fundraising has been fueled by an energized and motivated grassroots base that is working every day to take back the House,” Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), chairman of the DCCC, said in a statement. “The huge size of the House battlefield, combined with incredible candidate recruitment and candidate fundraising, is spreading vulnerable Republicans thin and forcing them to fight for every inch.”

The DCCC’s January fundraising total increases its cash on hand to $43.8 million, compared with $33.2 million it had at this time in 2016.

But the party has a tough task ahead if it hopes to flip the 24 GOP-held seats needed to take back the House of Representatives.

The DCCC, buoyed by voter discontent with President Donald Trump and a slew of Republican retirements, is casting a large net. The campaign arm announced earlier this month that it is investing in races in 101 GOP-held districts, including once-safe Republican areas like South Carolina’s 5th district.

For its part, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to elect House Republicans, raised record money in an off year in 2017. The total gave it $43.6 million in cash on hand as of the end of December, which at the time was more than the DCCC had.

But as Bloomberg reported, a sizable share of the NRCC’s donations came in the form of large checks not subject to the same contribution limits. These donations, which reach as high as $101,700 a piece, cannot be used toward federal elections. As a result, the NRCC had $20 million in cash that could not be used for electoral purposes.

Republicans still enjoy the support of super PACs and other outside groups that can fill gaps left by party fundraising. These outside groups potentially have the power to fundamentally alter the dynamics of key House races.

One such contest is the March 13 special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, which Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points but where Democrats are putting up a serious fight. Democrat Conor Lamb has proven a more adept fundraiser than Republican Rick Saccone, but the latter has benefitted from the largesse of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), and Ending Spending, another outside conservative group.

DCCC chairman Luján acknowledged this factor in his statement celebrating the January fundraising numbers.HAMILTON (Reuters) - A Bermudian lawyer has filed a legal motion with the island’s Supreme Court to undo a new law banning same-sex marriage, according to a court document seen on Monday.

On Feb. 7, Bermuda’s Governor John Rankin in the wealthy British overseas island of 60,000 people approved the Domestic Partnership Act (DPA), which was a rare reversal of a trend among Western countries of legalizing same-sex marriage. The government says domestic partnerships may be formed under the law that will offer equal rights as marriage.

Mark Pettingill, the lawyer challenging the act, is representing Roderick Ferguson, a Bermudian who lives in the United States. Ferguson is not currently trying to wed, but wants to be able to avail himself of gay marriage rights in the future, Pettingill said.

“My client has the right to the constitutional protection of the law and that has been infringed as a result of the DPA,” Pettingill said on Monday. He seeks to render the DPA void for contradicting Bermuda’s constitution, which guarantees freedom from discrimination.

The motion was filed on Feb. 16 against the Attorney General, whose lawyers serve as legal advisers to the government.

A government spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the motion.

Pettingill, a former attorney general, won Bermuda’s marriage equality case in May 2017 in the Supreme Court, only to see it reversed nine months later.

The Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality was celebrated by the Atlantic island’s small gay community, but also outraged many, leading to protests outside parliament.

Bermuda was first settled in 1609 and is the oldest British colony, having rejected independence in a 1995 referendum.GANGNEUNG, South Korea - Canada thumped the Olympic Athletes from Russia 5-0 on Monday to book their spot in the Olympic women’s ice hockey final and renew one of the Winter Games’s greatest rivalries.

Canada have played for gold at every Winter Games since women’s hockey became part of the Olympic program in 1998 and for the fifth time in six Winter Games will face off against the United States.

“We have something special here and we’re ready our coaching staff has prepared us as best they can and we just need to go out and just play,” Canada forward Meghan Agosta told reporters.

“This is something we have worked hard for all year and it comes down to one game and it is going to be the better team that comes out on top and there is no doubt in my mind that we are going to be ready for whatever it takes.”

The U.S. set the stage for a rematch when they shutout Finland 5-0 to reach the final for the third consecutive Olympics.

Although the U.S. and Canada have met on every final except at the 2006 Turin Olympics, the Americans have not had gold hung around their necks since the Nagano Games with the Canadians occupying top spot on the podium ever since.

On a day when International Ice Hockey Federation President Rene Fasel announced the Olympic tournament at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games would expand from eight to 10 teams, Canada and U.S. continued to show they remain a class apart.

Canada wasted no time getting on the scoreboard as they connected on their first shot, Natalie Spooner digging the puck out of the corner and feeding an unmarked Jennifer Wakefield, who slammed it past Valeria Tarakanova 1:50 into the opening period.

The defending champions dominated large stretches of play put could not put another puck by Tarakanova until Marie-Philip Poulin beat the OAR netminder with a neat backhand five minutes into the second.

After two gritty periods the OAR finally succumbed to Canadian pressure in the third when Wakefield collected her second of night and Emily Clark added another 31 seconds later, chasing Tarakanova from the game in favor of Nadezhda Alexandrova.

“I’m just excited to kind of get the monkey off my back a little bit,” Wakefield said. “We’re just excited to play them (U.S.).

“We have the rivalry, it’s well-documented and we’re just looking forward to the opportunity to bring home another gold.”

Rebecca Johnston closed out the scoring by banging home a loose puck from a scramble in front of the Russian net.American alpine skier Lindsey Vonn says she’s determined to bow out of the Winter Olympics with an all-out effort.

Vonn, 33, issued a fierce rallying cry on Twitter Tuesday for her upcoming women’s downhill race in Pyeongchang, South Korea. She also appeared to suggest she’s retiring from Olympic competition.

Tomorrow I will push out of the starting gate in what will most likely be my last Olympic Downhill race. I’m trying to enjoy the moment as much as I can and I am thankful to share this race with such amazing teammates. I know everyone expects a lot from me, and I expect even... — lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 20, 2018

More of myself....however there’s only one thing I can guarantee; I will give everything I have tomorrow. Count on it. — lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 20, 2018

“Tomorrow I will push out of the starting gate in what will most likely be my last Olympic Downhill race,” tweeted Vonn, who won gold in the event at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. She was unable to defend the title at the 2014 game in Sochi, Russia, due to a knee injury.

“I know everyone expects a lot from me, and I expect even more of myself,” Vonn added. “However there’s only one thing I can guarantee; I will give everything I have tomorrow. Count on it.”

Vonn placed sixth in the women’s super-G event on Saturday. Donald Trump-supporting Twitter trolls hounded her with abuse following her failure to medal, in apparent retaliation to her earlier criticism of the president.

She is also scheduled to compete in the ladies’ alpine combined event on Thursday, but her best shot at glory is seen as the downhill.

Vonn’s determination for what could be one of her last Olympic appearances was cheered by people on Twitter:A gun-owning Dallas politician said he won’t support the National Rifle Association holding its annual convention in his city this year after last week’s Florida school shooting unless the group will discuss gun law reform.

“I have five guns,” Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway said Monday. “One in my car and one in every room in my house. But I’m saddened that every time we turn around we have some type of gun violence. Gun violence. When you look at what is being done — it’s absolutely nothing.”

Asking the NRA to reconsider Dallas for its convention “is putting our citizens first,” said Caraway, who emphasized his disdain for assault-style rifles like the one used by the Florida school killer. “Who needs an AR-15 to go hunting? Who needs an AR-15 to protect their house?”

Caraway zeroed in on President Donald Trump’s focus on mental health in the massacre, instead of addressing gun control.

“Yes, mental illness is an issue, but it’s not just an issue that should only be associated with guns,” Caraway said. “At the end of the day, we need to connect the dots. The NRA needs to step up to the plate and show leadership. Elected officials are receiving dollars from the NRA, and they’re afraid to set policy and to set necessary gun rules.”

NRA campaign funding is a point raised in recent days by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman’s Feb. 14 rampage killed 17. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who holds an A+ rating from the NRA, received almost $10,000 from the group in the 2016 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

“To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you!” Florida shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez said during a speech Saturday.

Children keep dying, added David Hogg, another Douglas student, because “politicians refuse to take action and continue to take money from the special interest groups.”

“All money is not good money,” Caraway said. “Children’s lives, citizens’ lives and people’s lives are greater than any dollar amount.”White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the daily news briefing last week. Alex Wong via Getty Images

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders evaded reporters’ questions Tuesday about what the president is doing to address Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

A federal grand jury empaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities Friday, and it provided evidence that foreign nationals interfered in the 2016 election and boosted the candidacy of President Donald Trump.

Sanders said Tuesday that the president had repeatedly “acknowledged” the meddling took place but asserted that “it didn’t have an impact” and that the Trump campaign did not aid Russia in its covert operation.

But asked why the Trump administration has refused to impose the sanctions against Russia that Congress had passed, the press secretary answered indirectly: “Well, there’s a process that has to take place, and we’re going through that process.”

The Trump administration said in January that it would not immediately impose additional sanctions on Russia, even after Congress almost unanimously passed a measure last year designed to punish Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The administration insisted that the legislation was already working by “deterring Russian defense sales,” making additional action on Trump’s part unnecessary.

Critics have questioned the administration’s logic.

“The State Department claims that the mere threat of sanctions will deter Russia’s aggressive behavior. How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that’s already underway? It just doesn’t make sense,” Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters in January.

Reporters on Tuesday also questioned why Trump has not directly called out Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead blaming former President Barack Obama for failing to prevent Moscow from interfering in the U.S. election.Once the most powerful man in Hollywood, disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein surrendered himself to New York police Friday morning, a watershed moment for the Me Too movement catalyzed last fall by the countless women who came forward with sexual harassment and assault allegations against him.

Weinstein was arrested and charged with rape and sexual assault stemming from cases involving two accusers whose crimes were within the statute of limitations.

Some of the other women, including actresses who say they faced intimidation, reprisal and career consequences from the mogul, responded with both surprise and relief at his arrest.

Actress Rose McGowan, who has accused Weinstein of raping her at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, said she was “shocked.”

“I have to admit I didn’t think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him,” she told ABC News in an interview taped Thursday, when news outlets first reported Weinstein’s imminent surrender to authorities.

McGowan hesitated when asked if she would attend his trial, saying that “his face has terrorized me for so long,” but added that she may attend to join other survivors.

“I would rather be ready for that kind of coverage and his trial, than just coverage of him golfing in Scottsdale, so I will be ready for it,” she said. “And I will sit in that courtroom, and I will support the other survivors all around the world.”

Actress and director Asia Argento, who said Weinstein raped her at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, tweeted simply: “What took you so long Harvey?” She added later that “this is the only movie Harvey Weinstein will be remembered for.”

Her partner, chef and TV host Anthony Bourdain, tweeted that when she came forward with her allegations, “you were sure this day would never come, that you would be crushed, that you were alone. And yet you did it anyway.”

The outspoken actresses also warned that there are still countless other sexual predators who have not faced consequences for their actions.

Last week, at the closing ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival, where Weinstein was once a fixture and several of his alleged sexual assault incidents took place, Argento gave an impromptu speech, calling out other sexual predators.

“Even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women,” she said. “You know who you are, but most importantly, we know who you are, and we are not going to allow you to get away with it any longer.”San Francisco is considering legislation that would ban merchants from providing customers with single-use plastic straws, an ocean pollutant that environmentalists say poses serious health risks to marine life.

The proposed legislation, introduced Tuesday by Supervisor Katy Tang, prohibits the distribution and sale of not only single-use plastic straws but also plastic stir sticks, plastic toothpicks and plastic splash sticks anywhere in the city.

Tang asserts that more than a million plastic straws are discarded daily in San Francisco, an amount that surpasses the city’s population. Straws and other small pieces of plastic are among the most frequently littered items, advocates for straw bans say, and they easily make their way to the ocean when washed down storm drains.

And because of their size and plastic composition, plastic straws typically cannot be recycled.

“Here in San Francisco, this is quite literally the last plastic straw,” Tang said Tuesday. “We need to step up and do something about our wasteful daily habits when there are other alternatives.”

Many San Francisco food and beverage businesses are already on board, despite the higher cost of paper straws.

“I am in support of the plastic straw ban because it will be so much better for the environment,” said Lauren Crabbe, co-founder of the city’s popular Andytown Coffee Roasters. “At Andytown, we were actually in the process of phasing out plastic straws already, so the legislation is not disruptive for us at all.”

They’re switching to “the most durable paper straws we can find, and also selling very affordable metal straws for the ‘slow drinkers’ who need a longer-lasting material,” likely by the end of June, she said.

The co-owner of Sightglass, another well-trafficked coffee outpost in San Francisco, also stood by the proposal.

“We’ve always offered fully-compostable straws produced from plants, so this legislation definitely aligns with our business practices,” co-owner Jerad Morrison said.

Tang noted that the Surfrider Foundation’s San Francisco chapter has also started working with more than 100 businesses in the city to help them phase out plastic straws.

The danger of plastic straws may be among the more well-known threats to marine life. An agonizing video from 2015 of scientists spending nearly 10 minutes removing a plastic straw from a sea turtle’s nostril has more than 24 million views on YouTube. That turtle has since become an unofficial mascot for the anti-plastics pollution movement.Teen romances don’t get much more otherworldly or boundary-pushing than “Every Day.”

Based on David Levithan’s 2012 novel of the same name, the movie offers plenty of sigh-inducing moments, but raises questions about gender, sexuality and self-identity along the way. It follows 16-year-old Rhiannon (played by Angourie Rice), whose life takes an unexpected turn when she falls in love with a mysterious soul known as A, who appears as a new person by inhabiting a different body each day.

In translating the book’s central conceit for the big screen, director Michael Sucsy cast 15 different actors in the role of A, allowing the character to appear as male, female and transgender over the course of the film, which opens Friday.

Paranormal circumstances aside, A and Rhiannon face the same challenges as most young, real-life couples. Both must let themselves be seen for who they are, and not be defined by what others think of them as, in order to experience true love.

Levithan, whose list of works include 2003’s Boy Meets Boy and 2013’s Two Boys Kissing, spoke with HuffPost about bringing his “extremely queer” story to the big screen, and shared his current picks for the best LGBTQ-inclusive books for young readers.

As an author, your creative job is done when the book gets published. What was your reaction to seeing your work on the big screen?

Levithan: It’s one thing as a novelist to describe a character in all these different bodies, but it’s another to actually see all these actors bring that character to life so seamlessly. It was extraordinary to see that conceit carried through so beautifully in the film.

The director, Michael Sucsy, encouraged the cast to read the entire script and not just their part. They had to understand who A was in all of the scenes in order to do their own scenes. There was a very concerted effort to make sure everybody knew each part of the character.

Below: Ian Alexander, who identifies as trans, is one of 15 actors to portray A.

Many of your books have dealt with LGBTQ themes. To what extent do you consider ‘Every Day’ to be a queer story?

I think it’s an extremely queer story. It’s about self-definition. It’s certainly about being agender, as well as aracial ― A’s name is a nod to that, in fact. A’s sensibility is, hopefully, something that’s very relatable to queer readers ― and to queer viewers now, too.

The ‘Every Day’ movie will introduce your work to a whole new audience. Who do you hope comes to see the movie?

One of the most amazing things about the book’s life, so far, is because of its paranormal conceit, a lot of people who would not otherwise gravitate toward a queer story come around to it. I hope the movie has that effect, too. I’d love young queer viewers to see themselves in it the same way that young queer readers have seen themselves in my book. I hope non-queer viewers will start to question the notion of gender and how we’re defined by our bodies after seeing the movie, too.

When you first wrote Boy Meets Boy in 2003, queer books for young readers were rare. Since then, a number of LGBTQ authors have emerged and written books specifically for young audiences. Which are your favorites?

I love so many of them! Will Walton has a book coming out this summer that I edited called I Felt a Funeral, in My Brain, which is this incredible prose-poetry novel about grief, loss and having an alcoholic mother. It’s unlike anything I’ve read before. It has a queer sensibility, but it’s not about being queer.

I think Billy Merrell’s Vanilla, which is about two boys who’ve been dating since eighth grade who get to their high school years and sex comes into the equation and throws them off, is brilliant. Probably my favorite queer book of the past couple years is Nina LaCour’s We Are Okay, which just won the [Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature]. That was astonishing ― to see a queer book get the biggest young adult literature prize.

As a queer author, do you feel any responsibility to present the LGBTQ community in any specific way through your work?

Only realistically. I don’t think queer authors have to write queer stories, and I certainly don’t think queer writers have to write queer stories a certain way. For me, it’s all about trying to find aspects [of queer life] that haven’t been talked about and trying to reach young queer readers while making sure readers [who don’t identify as LGBTQ] feel welcome in my stories as well.

“Every Day” hits theaters Feb. 23.

Orion Pictures“Black Panther” star Michael B. Jordan almost wishes that the Marvel film didn’t have as much hype as it got before its release this past weekend.

The actor, who plays Erik Killmonger in the record-breaking film, spoke to AOL Entertainment over the phone the day before “Black Panther” was released in theaters and discussed how hype can occasionally backfire.

“There’s so much hype and I would almost rather it fly under the radar, have people not hype it up at all and we just blow people away,” Jordan explained. “With there being so much hype, people want to find reasons to try to pick at it. That’s what it is with anything. For me, there’s so much going on in this movie ― in the best way possible ― with so many different themes and a lot of different points of view.”

The 31-year-old star added that, regardless of the hype, he just wants “people to take away a sense of pride about where they come from” after seeing the movie.

Jordan likened the night before “Black Panther’s” release to “the night before the first day of school,” noting that he was tired of having to keep so many secrets about Marvel’s latest.

In the lead-up to the premiere of “Black Panther,” the actor and his production studio, Outlier Society, teamed up with Brisk’s Creators Class initiative to encourage and assist young artists.

“Their mission coincided with what my production company Outliers Society’s mission is,” he told us of the collaboration. “People often see the finished result, but they don’t know the journey or what it actually took to get to the finish line. The hours, the blood sweat and tears the failures it took.”

To convey that idea, Jordan directed a 30-second spot called “Hidden Hustle” that puts a spotlight on his own creative process of getting into character for “Black Panther.”

U.S. skier Gus Kenworthy is taking no garbage from homophobic internet trolls.

On Monday, Twitter user @ShitGate — who in other tweets stated it is “evil to have same sex partner” and “gay is a sin and devilish” — asked this question:

Question is,if men marry men and women marry women who will produce children in this world — John Dowd (@ShitGate) February 19, 2018

Kenworthy, one of two openly gay men representing the U.S. at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, replied:

hopefully not you https://t.co/UiwA2471bz — Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) February 19, 2018

The comeback was cheered by others on Twitter:

Kenworthy, who placed 12th in the slopestyle event, has blazed a trail for the LGBTQ community at the Olympics.

Before the games, he described Vice President Mike Pence as a “strange choice” to lead the U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony due to his opposition to LGBTQ rights.

NBC aired footage of Kenworthy kissing his boyfriend before a qualifying run over the weekend, which has been hailed as a significant moment.Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon responded to actress Sally Field’s earnest effort to make him her future son-in-law with surprise and admiration.

And he said he finds her matchmaking attempt pretty “bold.”

The Oscar-winning actress on Friday attempted to set up her son, Sam Greisman, with the popular American athlete, retweeting a text-message conversation between her and Greisman in which he admitted a crush on Rippon. Field upped the ante in her retweet by tagging Rippon, enhancing the chance that the bronze medalist would actually see the post.

Though it seemed everyone on the internet saw Field’s extremely conspicuous nudge, Rippon apparently did not. When BuzzFeed on Monday informed the 28-year-old athlete of Field’s move as a wing woman, Rippon seemed completely shocked. He reportedly screamed and applauded her move as “bold.”

Rippon then sent a sweet message to Greisman:

“Sam, your mom — I admire her,” he said via BuzzFeed. “And I’m sure one day we’re going to meet! So thanks, Mom.”

Though Greisman, 30, hasn’t responded to Rippon’s message on Twitter, his heart may be doing triple axels.

Before Field blew up his spot on Twitter, Greisman, a writer and director, had professed his fondness for the “sassy, beautiful” Rippon numerous times on Twitter. In one tweet, he says he is “in love with him,” and in another, he bluntly tweeted: “marry me Adam.”In an unprecedented ruling, the University of Louisville’s men’s basketball program has been ordered to vacate its 2013 national championship title and 122 other victories following a sex scandal involving its players.

The NCAA Division 1 Infractions Appeals Committee announced its final decision on Tuesday after an unsuccessful appeal by the school.

It’s the first time in the NCAA’s modern history that a Division I men’s basketball national championship has been stripped from a school.

The punishment follows a 2015 investigation that found a basketball team staffer paid prostitutes to have sex with the school’s athletes and recruits and also had striptease dancers perform for them. The committee first ruled against the school last June.

Following the June ruling, Rick Pitino, the school’s longtime head basketball coach, was suspended for the team’s first five games of the 2017-18 season. He has since been fired in the wake of another scandal. Louisville is one of the schools the FBI is investigating for “pay for play” deals with basketball recruits.

The NCAA, in its final decision on the sex scandal, said that the basketball team’s former staff member knew that his actions violated NCAA bylaws. The athletes knew their behavior violated the rules, or should have known, making them ineligible for the competition.

“In its review of the case, the appeals committee found that because of the serious and intentional violations with direct involvement of a university staff member, the Committee on Infractions panel was within its legislated authority to prescribe the vacation of records and financial penalty,” the NCAA stated.

The NCAA’s ruling orders the school to vacate all of its wins during the academic years between 2011 and 2015, which included two Final Four appearances. It must also repay revenue earned from appearances in the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 basketball tournaments, amounting to about $600,000.

The university’s interim president Greg Postel, said at an afternoon press conference that he agrees the conduct that led to the penalties was wrong but that he disagrees with the committee’s ruling.

“I cannot say this strongly enough: We believe the NCAA is simply wrong to have made this decision,” Postel said. “The pain this infraction has created for our fans and for our players who were not involved in the events in question is perhaps the most regretful result of this determination.”

Postel added that there will be no further appeal of the ruling, which orders the school to scrub any sign of those years’ victories from its campus and its records. Individual records of student-athletes will also be vacated.
