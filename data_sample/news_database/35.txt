All eyes have been on Teigen and her husband John Legend since West seemingly posted a private text message conversation with the “All of Me” singer professing support for President Donald Trump. Teigen and Legend are longtime friends of the Yeezy designer ― Legend’s debut album was released on West’s record label.

West, who met with Trump shortly after the election, recently doubled down on his “love” for the president on social media.

“You don’t have to agree with trump but the mob can’t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy,” West wrote in a string of tweets on Wednesday. “He is my brother. I love everyone. I don’t agree with everything anyone does. That’s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.”

Legend apparently reached out to West via text, writing that he hopes the rapper will “reconsider aligning yourself” with the president.

Teigen addressed West’s tweets on Thursday, kindly asking everyone to stop bothering her about various controversies of late.

Everyone keeps asking me to comment on shit. Comment on psycho Tami Lasagna, whom I refuse to give the joy to, say something about RHOA, speak up about kanye. When it comes to people we know, we DO speak up. To THEM. not on Twitter. And sometimes, I guess it makes it to Twitter. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 26, 2018

West later explained why he shared his texts with Legend, including Legend’s plug for his new album, to his nearly 30 million Twitter followers.

“I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion,” West wrote. “I respect everyone’s opinion but I stand my ground.”

But leave it to Teigen to capture how everyone’s feeling after the exhausting back and forth.

So many years have been packed into this week. No more please, brain hurts. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) April 26, 2018Tuesday night, Patton Oswalt joined the family of his late wife, crime writer Michelle McNamara, at a promotional event north of Chicago to promote I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, a new book about McNamara’s scrupulous hunt for a serial killer who terrorized California in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

“He’s running out of time,” the comedian recalled saying.

Hours later, his line read as prophecy. On Wednesday afternoon, Oswalt watched with a breathless online community of true-crime enthusiasts as authorities in Sacramento, California, announced the arrest of a man believed to be the so-called Golden State Killer, who has eluded justice for decades.

Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was jailed without bail nearly two years to the day after McNamara died unexpectedly in her sleep.

“I think you got him, Michelle,” Oswalt wrote on Twitter on Wednesday alongside a news article on the suspect’s arrest.

McNamara’s book has become a bestseller since its Feb. 27 release. But asked whether it truly helped solve the case, an official at Wednesday’s briefing said it had not but that the book kept the case top of mind.

Oswalt suspects otherwise, writing on Twitter that his late wife’s book did, in fact, play a part.

“[Michelle McNamara] didn’t care about getting any shine on herself,” he wrote. “She cared about the Golden State Killer being behind bars and the victims getting some relief.”

It did, but #MichelleMcNamaradidn’t care about getting any shine on herself. She cared about the #GoldenStateKiller being behind bars and the victims getting some relief. She was Marge Gunderson in FARGO, not Chilton in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. https://t.co/krMOWaWh9m — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) April 25, 2018

He added: “She was Marge Gunderson in FARGO, not Chilton in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.”

Officials at the news conference credited the arrest to the diligent work of law enforcement, investigators and members of the public who sent in tips. Evidence from a “discarded DNA” sample provided the evidence needed, they said, without elaborating.

They did not say McNamara’s name, but Oswalt said he considered every mention of the Golden State Killer ― a term McNamara coined ― as a credit to her.

Also, the cops will NEVER and HAVE NEVER credited a writer or journalist for helping them solve a case. But every time they said #GoldenStateKiller they credited the work of #MichelleMcNamara and #IllBeGoneInTheDark. — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) April 25, 2018

Throughout the day, the Emmy-winning comedian shared with his fans a number of heartfelt and humorous congratulatory messages directed at his late wife.

Oswalt and fans were particularly struck by a final passage in I’ll Be Gone in the Dark in which the author addresses the unknown killer in a letter ending, “Open the door. Show us your face. Walk into the light.”

In an odd coincidence, police said Wednesday they apprehended DeAngelo by waiting for him to step outside.

This #GoldenStateKiller thing is fascinating. It's like #MichelleMcNamara reached out from beyond, grabbed the killer by the collar and said, "Nope. You aren't going anywhere, asshole." — Brian Lambert (@stink_dumb) April 25, 2018

But was DeAngelo ever actually on McNamara’s list of suspects?

Oswalt said her research partners are combing through her notes to find out.On Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” the comedian imagined how the recent West/Trump Twitter lovefest could “confuse” people on the conservative network.

“Why don’t these celebrity rap thugs stay out of politics and...” Noah imagined one of the network’s anchors saying, before suddenly flipping stance after finding out that West was pro-Trump. “Sorry, I mean, this guy understands the American people. He understands all of them.”“This was obviously the hardest decision of my life so far. But so far it has paid off tremendously in terms of well-being for me,” he said at the time. “I’m happier than I have been in a very, very long time. Stress-free more than I have been in a very long time. I can’t say I’m never going to have a show again. I just don’t think I’m going to go back to the touring life.”

At the time of his death, Avicii was working on new music. Geffen Records’ executive Neil Jacobson told Variety it was the DJ’s “best music in years, honestly,” calling the unreleased album “incredible, magical music.”Dr. Claire Karekezi will return to her home in Rwanda in July as the first and only female neurosurgeon in the entire country.

The 35-year-old has been studying neuro-oncology and skull base surgery, with a specialty in brain tumor removal, at Toronto Western Hospital in Canada since last year.

Her 12-year journey in medicine thus far comes after a childhood surrounded by horror and tragedy. The 1994 genocide in Rwanda took the lives of hundreds of thousands, including some of Karekezi’s cousins and aunts.

Karekezi told The Toronto Star in an article published on May 13 that the genocide is “what sort of made us who we are today as Rwandese people because we grew up knowing that we cannot count on anyone but ourselves.”

She added she believes in doing “whatever it takes to get where I want to go.”

“I keep pushing because the genocide happened, the whole world was watching and no one did anything. But we came through that, we are a strong nation, and we have very brave people who have managed to do impressive things now,” she told the publication.

Karekezi finished high school in Rwanda and then went to a local university on a full government scholarship. Her medical schooling journey then took her to Sweden ― her first time away from home. Her time in Sweden serendipitously introduced her to neurosurgery as it was the only department operating during the time period in which she was in the country.

“I knew nothing about neurosurgery, I had no training in brain anatomy,” Karekezi told The Star, who had initial plans to study radiology.

The course of her life drastically changed since then, taking her everywhere from England to Morocco as she honed her skills and practice. She hopes that when she finally returns to Rwanda, she’ll collaborate with the four male neurosurgeons currently practicing in the country to launch a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology center.

Karekezi did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Many on social media, including friends and fellow colleagues, praised Karekezi for her work and for the inspiration she’s given others:

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Full Frontal,” the comedian began her monologue by describing CIA Director Mike Pompeo as “a pretty typical Trump pick.”

“It would be unfair to simply call Mike Pompeo a raging Islamophobe, because he’s also a raging homophobe,” said Bee, as she pointed to Pompeo’s past comments about Muslims and LGBTQ communities as proof. “It’s what Republicans call intersectionality.”

“At a time when our tantrum-throwing, Garbage Pail Kid of a president has fired most of the grown-ups who are reining in his worst instincts, it’s more important than ever to have a secretary of state who’s willing to stand up to him when necessary,” Bee added. “Unfortunately, Pompeo is even more of a balls-out warmonger nut job than the president.”

Bee concluded by calling Pompeo a “racist warmongering homophobe.”UPDATE: April 27: Amber Renae Wagers, a 15-year-old who walked out of her school in Kentucky on Wednesday and disappeared, was found safe in Louisville early Friday, authorities said.

No details have been released.

Previously:

A Kentucky teenager who vanished after leaving school sent an alarming message to a friend after she disappeared.

Amber Renae Wagers, 15, was last seen in Berea at about 10 a.m. Wednesday, when she walked out of Berea Community School. Berea is a small city located about 40 miles south of Lexington.

“She told a friend during school that she was leaving and when classes changed she walked out,” Berea Police Lt. Jake Reed told HuffPost. “Shortly after that she sent her friend a message on Snapchat that said, ‘I think they’re taking me to Ohio, probably should call police.’”

The teen’s parents told investigators they suspect she’s with someone she met through social media. The teen, according to police, has multiple accounts online, which are being examined for clues.

According to Reed, surveillance cameras at the school captured the teen getting into a vehicle, but the quality of the video is not sufficient enough to make out the license plate number.

“The camera was kind of at a distance, but it was enough that we could pretty much make out a make and model on the car,” the lieutenant said. “We think it’s a white Chevy Malibu, but there was nothing special about it ― nothing unique, like different colored doors or anything.”

Investigators have additional information, Reed said, but don’t want to release anything that could jeopardize the teen’s safety.

While authorities say Wagers has been entered into a national database of missing persons, her case does not meet the qualifications for an AMBER Alert.

“In Kentucky, those requests must go through state police,” Reed said. “They are the final decision makers on an Amber Alert. We immediately called them. They have a checklist and the criteria is very specific and [this case] did not meet that criteria. This girl went willingly with these folks and we have very little for a suspect description.”

Wagers is described as a white female, approximately 100 pounds, with brown hair. No other physical descriptors have been made available and authorities have not provided a description of the clothing she was wearing when she was last seen.

“Our detectives found out she took a change of clothes with her, so what she had with her when she left is not necessarily what she has on now,” Reed added.

The lieutenant said this case should serve as a warning to parents about the potential dangers of social media.

“Parents have to be very aware of what their kids are doing online,” said Reed. “They need to know what apps they’re using, who they’re talking to and things like that. The way things are nowadays, parents have to be on top of that stuff.”

Authorities have not named any suspects or persons of interest in Amber Wagers’ disappearance. Anyone with information in the case is asked to call the Berea Police Department at 859-624-4776.PRAYER

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:

God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Bless the Members of this assembly as they set upon the work of these hours, of these days. Help them to make wise decisions in a good manner and to carry their responsibilities steadily, with high hopes for a better future for our great Nation.

As legislation on taxes continues to be debated this week and next, may all Members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great Nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success, while others continue to struggle.

Joy Reid claims a recent batch of screenshots appearing to show homophobic statements on her now-defunct blog are “fraudulent” and the result of a cyberattack.

However, several aspects of the cyberattack claim seem highly questionable.

The host of MSNBC’s “AM Joy” came under fire this week after a Twitter user shared screenshots of anti-LGBTQ content Reid had seemingly written between 2005 and 2009 for her old blog, The Reid Report.

Reid apologized in December for writing homophobic posts about former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (D) between 2007 and 2009 after Twitter user @Jamie_Maz shared screenshots of the posts.

Last week, @Jamie_Maz tweeted dozens more screenshots, also allegedly from Reid’s old blog, that included statements such as “most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing” and “adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young, post-pubescent types.”

Yet this time around, Reid has steadfastly denied writing the posts. She released the following statement to Mediaite on Monday:

In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology. I began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity, and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach. The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago. Now that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries. I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups.

This statement raises a number of questions, however. To accept Reid’s hacking claim at face value, you would also need to explain at least some of the following:

1.) Why would someone hack Joy Reid’s blog repeatedly for years, at a time when she had a much lower profile?

The screenshots circulated this week were allegedly captured using Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, an expansive digital library that archives sites in real time so people can continue to access the pages. HuffPost confirmed several of the alleged posts captured in the screenshots could be found on Wayback Machine.

Jonathan Nichols, a cybersecurity consultant hired by Reid, said in a statement Monday that “fabricated” posts were not a result of a cyberattack against Wayback Machine, but against The Reid Report.

Since Wayback Machine captures sites in real time, this means someone would have had to hack Reid’s blog numerous times between 2005 and 2009. If someone hacked her blog recently and attempted to change the timestamps to a previous year, Wayback Machine would still archive the posts according to the date they were actually hacked.

Nichols confirmed to HuffPost that he believes the blog was hacked in that period, but would not say exactly when. He later told HuffPost the recent screenshots themselves could also have been manipulated ― a separate issue from the alleged blog hacking. (More on that to come).

It’s unclear who would repeatedly target Reid in the mid-to-late-2000s, more than a decade before she rose to national fame with MSNBC. Reid’s Wikipedia page wasn’t even created until 2014.

2.) Why didn’t Reid notice that someone else was posting content under her name on her own blog?

Reid and Nichols both claim her blog was repeatedly hacked in the mid-2000s ― and yet the journalist apparently never noticed until December 2017.

“I don’t think that’s too much of a stretch,” Nichols told HuffPost. “Why would anyone go back to their own blog to check to see if what they posted was authentic?”

For example, an allegedly fraudulent post was added on March 7, 2005. On March 9, 2005, Reid published a post that has not been called into question. Wouldn’t the supposedly unfamiliar post have caught her eye when she added the next one?

Nichols also argued that the lack of comments on the disputed posts suggests the blog was hacked. But there don’t appear to be any comments on most of the posts from the mid-2000s.

3.) Are the bigoted statements really such a departure from the statements Reid has already owned up to?

Reid took responsibility in December for writing the homophobic statements captured in the screenshots @Jamie_Maz initially shared. In the several posts dated between 2007 and 2009, she accused Crist of being a closeted gay man and mocked him by calling him “Miss Charlie.”

“It was insensitive, tone-deaf and dumb,” Reid wrote in her apology statement. “There is no excusing it — not based on the taste-skewing mores of talk radio or the then-blogosphere, and not based on my intentions.”

1/x From 2007 to 2009 @joyannreid authored a dozen homophobic posts not only attempting to out Charlie Crist as gay, she attacked & mocked him for being so.

Reid’s Twitter profile has been a platform for insensitive comments toward gay people in the past:

"@mediaite: Report: Elton John, Who Is Gay, To Perform At Rush Limbaugh’s Wedding http://bit.ly/cV0VoS FM" /Elton to serenade the beard — Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) June 5, 2010

The more recent screenshots @Jamie_Maz shared don’t sound very different from what Reid has already admitted she wrote.

“Does that make me homophobic? Probably,” Reid allegedly wrote about her disinterest in seeing “Brokeback Mountain” in a newly released but disputed post from 2007. “For the record, I’m sure gay people think straight sex is gross, too, it’s just that the nature of political correctness is that gay people are allowed to say straight sex is gross, but the reverse is considered to be patently homophobic.”

4.) Are the screenshots fake, or was the blog hacked?

Nichols’ position about the authenticity of the screenshotted posts ― whether they were forged or genuine screenshots from Reid’s hacked site ― isn’t clear.

“We have significant evidence indicating that not only was Ms. Reid’s old blog compromised, some of the recently circulated posts were not even on the site at any time, suggesting that these instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation with the intent to tarnish Ms. Reid’s character,” Nichols wrote in his statement Tuesday.

@Jamie_Maz has repeatedly denied altering the screenshots, aside from underlining statements in red to highlight specific statements.

In his statement Tuesday, Nichols also discussed these same posts as if they had truly appeared on the site: “Oddly, there were no responses in the comments section of the entries, despite the inflammatory nature of the posts. If those posts were real, they would have undoubtedly elicited responses from Ms. Reid’s base.”

Nichols told HuffPost on Wednesday that most of the recent screenshots @Jamie_Maz shared have been manipulated to appear as though they were captured from Reid’s blog, but had never existed on the blog before or after it was hacked.

However, HuffPost was able to find many of the posts in the Wayback Machine archives.

When asked for clarification, Nichols appeared to walk back his statement that most of the recent screenshots had never existed on the site.

“I would suspect that that is one of the fake posts,” Nichols told HuffPost. “I would defer to Joy on any specific instance.”

The Library of Congress, which uses a local installation of the Wayback Machine, contains the disputed posts, CNN reported Tuesday. Archive.today, another archiving site, also contained the posts, HuffPost discovered.

HuffPost asked Nichols whether he had sent letters to these sites requesting they remove the posts and help with the investigation into the alleged hacking, as he did in December with Google and the Internet Archive. He replied that he had not.Comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty on Thursday on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault by a Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, jury.

Cosby, 80, was retried on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. Constand, 44, was a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University where Cosby was a trustee and major donor during the time he assaulted her.

“This is an extraordinary case to have jury service,” Judge Steven O’Neill told the jurors after announcing the verdict. “You have sacrificed much, but you have sacrificed in the service of justice.”

A sentencing date for the comedian has not been set. Each count of felony aggravated indecent assault carries a sentence of five to 10 years. The maximum Cosby could be sentenced to is 30 years, though it could be as little as five.

According to reports, people in the courtroom gasped as the guilty verdict was handed down. Lili Bernard, who was allegedly assaulted by Cosby, and her friend Caroline Heldman fled the courtroom in tears, hugging one another.

Cosby lashed out at prosecutors after they requested to revoke his bail, with District Attorney Kevin Steele pointing out that Cosby owns a plane. The comedian reportedly shouted in response: “He doesn’t have a plane, you asshole!”

Constand was seen hugging friends and family and smiling as she walked out of the courtroom. Cosby exited the courtroom swiftly, holding onto the arm of his spokesman, Andrew Wyatt.

A few of Cosby’s accusers spoke at a news conference after the guilty verdict was handed down.

“It is a victory for womanhood,” said Bernard, an accuser and former actress on “The Cosby Show.” “It is a victory for all sexual assault survivors, female and male.”

Another accuser, Janice Baker-Kinney, said she felt “vindicated.”

“We are vindicated, we are validated and we are now part of the tsunami of women’s power and justice,” she said. “We are not shutting up and we’re not going away. Get over it!”

Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of Cosby’s accusers, also spoke after the trial.

“We are so happy that finally we can say that women are believed and not only on hashtag MeToo, but in a court of law where they were under oath, where they testified truthfully, where they were attacked, where they were smeared, where they were denigrated, where there were attempts to discredit them,” Allred said. “When all is said and done: Women were finally believed.”

Allred read a statement on behalf of one of the witnesses, Chelan Lasha, whose testimony was used as evidence of Cosby’s prior bad acts to establish a pattern of behavior. “Thirty-two years of nightmares and tears are over,” Lasha’s statement said.

Cosby’s attorney Tom Mesereau said the defense team is “very disappointed” by the verdict, adding that “the fight is not over.” He said Cosby’s defense team plans to appeal the verdict.

In June of last year, a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the charges and the judge declared a mistrial. Cosby reportedly paid Constand $3.4 million in a civil lawsuit settlement in 2006.

The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network released a statement applauding the jury’s decision.

“RAINN is pleased with the jury’s decision in this case. There are many forces that discourage victims from reporting these crimes,” RAINN President Scott Berkowitz said. “Let’s hope the legacy of this case is that victims feel empowered to come forward, knowing that it can truly make a difference in bringing perpetrators to justice.”

“[R]emember this case is about trust, betrayal and the inability to consent,” Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her closing arguments on Tuesday, according to Deadline.

Assistant District Attorney M. Stewart Ryan added during his closing arguments that “it is time for each and every one of you to stand with Andrea Constand and tell the truth about what he did.”

Throughout the prosecution’s closing arguments, Cosby was reportedly smiling. Feden called out the comedian’s smirks during her closing arguments.

“He’s laughing like it’s funny,” Feden said. “But there’s absolutely nothing funny about them being stripped of their capacity to consent.”

In the defense’s closing arguments, Cosby’s attorneys attempted to sway the jury by blaming the recent Me Too movement.

“When you join a movement based primarily on emotion and anger, you don’t change a damned thing, which is why each single case must be examined on its merits. All of the evidence must be weighed,” defense attorney Kathleen Bliss said, according to ABC News.

“Yes, we do have to deal with sexual assault. We do. It’s a worldwide problem,” Bliss continued. “But questioning an accuser is not shaming a victim. Gut feelings are not rational decisions. Mob rule is not due process, and just as we have had horrible, horrible crimes in our history, we’ve also had horrible, horrible periods of time where emotion and hatred and fear overwhelmed us: witch hunts, lynchings, McCarthyism.”

This trial was slightly different from last year’s because O’Neill allowed five additional accusers to testify, as their stories closely resembled the claims made by Constand. Their testimonies were used as evidence of Cosby’s prior bad acts and allowed the prosecution to show a pattern of predatory behavior by Cosby.

The five other accusers who testified were former supermodel Janice Dickinson, Heidi Thomas, Lise-Lotte Lublin, Baker-Kinney and Lasha.

Dickinson testified that Cosby drugged and raped her after the two had dinner at a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel.

“Here was ‘America’s Dad’ on top of me ― a happily married man with five children. And I remember thinking how wrong it was ― how very, very wrong,” she testified, adding later that she wanted to “punch him in the face.”

Cosby’s lawyers unsuccessfully sought a mistrial during the hearing. On April 11, a visibly emotional Lasha took the stand to testify that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1986 when she was 17 years old.

As the courtroom was being dismissed for a lunch break after Lasha’s testimony, Lasha looked at Cosby and said, “You know what you did” or “You remember, don’t you, Mr. Cosby?” according to various reports. O’Neill denied the defense’s mistrial request.

The three-week trial was the first high-profile sexual assault case in the Me Too era and tensions were high. Dozens of protestors flocked to the Pennsylvania courtroom outside of Philadelphia.

One protestor named Nicolle Rochelle, who appeared on “The Cosby Show” in the 1990s, lunged at Cosby outside of the courtroom on the first day of the trial. Rochelle was topless and had the names of Cosby’s alleged victims written all over her body, with the words “women’s lives matter” written on her chest.

“He’s a man who’s disempowered women’s bodies for decades. It doesn’t seem to be recognized,” Rochelle told People at the time. “The case is being publicized with this narrative of race. He’s being painted as the victim. I wanted to emphasize that this is about rape. I wanted to make him uncomfortable and to make people think about women’s bodies.” Other demonstrators protested in support of Cosby, claiming the entertainer is innocent. One protester passed out fliers at the courthouse throughout the trial that warned of “mass demonstrations” if Cosby is convicted.

More than 50 women have accused the veteran entertainer of sexual assault, with many saying he drugged and raped them.President Donald Trump on Thursday called into his favorite TV program, “Fox & Friends,” and spoke for more than 30 minutes in what at times was an agitated, stream-of-consciousness rant. The president careened over a lot of ground in the rare interview.

Here’s a summary:

He said “nuclear war” with North Korea “would have happened if we had weak people.”

Trump dismissed criticism of his hyperbolic rhetoric on North Korea, which has included insulting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Little Rocket Man,” and bragging about his nuclear “button.”

“Everybody said, ‘This guy’s going to get us into nuclear war.’ Let me tell you, the nuclear war would have happened if we had weak people,” Trump said.

He cited the Civil War to claim Republicans can gain more support from black voters, and praised rapper Kanye West for his supportive tweets.

Trump, asked about favorable tweets from Kanye West this week, attributed the rapper’s support to low black unemployment.

“He sees this stuff,” Trump said.

Trump falsely claimed he “got a lot of support” from black voters, even though he won 8 percent of the black vote in 2016.

“People don’t realize, you know, if you go back to the Civil War, it was the Republicans that really did the thing,” he said. “Lincoln was Republican. Somehow it changed over the years, and I will say, I really believe it’s changing back.”

He acknowledged that his personal attorney Michael Cohen represented him in “this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.”

The president previously claimed he was unaware of Cohen’s hush-money payment to bury Trump’s reported affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. On “Fox & Friends,” Trump tried to distance himself from his longtime personal attorney, saying that Cohen does only a “tiny, tiny fraction” of his “overall legal work.”

But in the process, he admitted that “he represents me with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me.”

Daniels’ attorney Michael Avenatti, appearing on MSNBC at the same time, called it “a hugely damaging admission” and “another gift from the heavens.”

When “Fox & Friends” pushed back by noting Trump’s longstanding ties to Cohen, the president responded that he has “many, many attorneys, so many you wouldn’t believe.”

Trump’s comments were quickly used against him: Hours later, federal prosecutors cited them in an ongoing legal case over a review of documents seized during FBI raids targeting Cohen.

He threatened political consequences for the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.).

Minutes before Trump began his call to “Fox & Friends,” his nominee for Veterans Affairs secretary, Ronny Jackson, withdrew his nomination after allegations of improper workplace conduct, including being drunk, wrecking a car, and overprescribing medications.

“These are all false accusations. They are trying to destroy a man,” Trump said. He fingered Tester, who released a report a day earlier detailing allegations against Jackson based on more than 20 people who have worked with him.

“I think Jon Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana,” Trump said.

Trump bragged that in 2016, he won Montana by a wide margin.

He repeatedly bragged about his electoral victory nearly a year and a half ago.

He also dubiously claimed the Electoral College favors Democrats.

Reminder: It is April 2018. The election was in November 2016.

He claimed “nobody talks about” this week’s special election for Congress in Arizona.

That race, to fill the seat of former Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), was anticipated to be an easy GOP win. Instead, the Republican candidate, Debbie Lesko, won by only 5 points ― another warning sign for Republicans in this year’s midterms.

He repeated his claim that former FBI Director James Comey is “guilty of crimes.”

An agitated Trump attacked Comey as “a liar and a leaker,” and said he’s “guilty” for leaking classified information in memos he wrote after meetings with the president.

He acknowledged that he stayed overnight during the infamous 2013 Moscow trip.

“Of course I stayed there. I stayed there a very short period of time, but of course I stayed,” he said.

The trip matches the unconfirmed “dossier” of salacious, unconfirmed allegations about Trump, including the claim he hired prostitutes and asked them to urinate on a hotel bed while in Moscow for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. Russians allegedly recorded the episode, now known as “the pee tape” and the “golden showers” incident, to use as blackmail.

Trump on Thursday went on to claim that Comey “lied” when the then-FBI director wrote in a memo that Trump told him that he didn’t stay on the trip overnight.

He resumed his attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice.

Trump sounded enraged, at times yelling, when talking about special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into his campaign’s ties to Russia. He said he’s staying out of Mueller’s investigation, but might intervene “at some point.”

“I have decided that I won’t be involved. I may change my mind at some point, because what’s going on is a disgrace,” he said.

He also took swipes at his FBI and Justice Department. “You look at the corruption at the top of the FBI, it’s a disgrace,” he said. “And our Justice Department ― which I try and stay away from, but at some point I won’t ― our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia. There is no collusion with me, and everyone knows it.”

You’ll never guess what grade he gives his presidency.

“I would give myself an A+,” Trump said, claiming that he has defied many obstacles, chiefly the “phony cloud” and “witch hunt” of Mueller’s Russia investigation.

The outburst came as Kevin Steele, district attorney for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, argued to the judge that Cosby, 80, should be taken into custody and his $1 million bail revoked. He said Cosby could use his private plane to flee.

“He doesn’t have a plane, you asshole!” Cosby stood up and shouted at Steele, according to The New York Times. “I’m sick of him!”

Judge Steven T. O’Neill said he did not view Cosby as a flight risk and ruled that he could remain free until his sentencing hearing.

Cosby faces up to 30 years in prison ― 10 years for each count of aggravated indecent assault ― for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.

Several of his alleged victims sobbed as the verdict was announced. Lili Bernard, who alleged Cosby assaulted her, fled the courtroom in tears with her friend Caroline Heldman as the two hugged.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is proposing to increase rent for millions of low-income tenants in government-subsidized housing and impose stricter work requirements.

The plan, unveiled Wednesday, would raise rent to 35 percent of gross income for more than 2 million families now paying 30 percent of adjusted income for subsidized housing. It would also mean that the poorest households ― more than 700,000 of them ― could see monthly rental caps triple to $150 from $50, HUD said. Elderly and disabled tenants would be exempt from the increase.

In addition, Carson wants to give public housing agencies the ability to impose minimum work requirements, excluding the elderly and the disabled.

“Every year, it takes more money, millions of dollars more, to serve the same number of households,” Carson said Wednesday on a call with reporters. “It’s clear from a budget perspective and a human point of view that the current system is unsustainable.” It also discourages people from working, he added.

Carson’s plan could push low-income people toward homelessness, some advocates said.Well, I better not get into that ’cause I may get in trouble. Maybe I didn’t get her so much. I tell you what she has done, I got her a beautiful card. You know I’m very busy to be running out looking for presents, OK? But I got her a beautiful card and some beautiful flowers.Stacey Abrams won the Democratic nomination for governor of Georgia on Tuesday, delivering a victory for the national liberal groups and elected officials who backed her historic bid.

If elected in November, the 44-year-old Abrams would be Georgia’s first woman governor and the nation’s first black woman at the helm of a state. She previously served 10 years in the Georgia House, and for much of that time was her party’s leader in the chamber.

Her primary win reflects the increasingly diverse makeup of the state’s Democratic voters, as well as the party’s turn toward a more base-centric strategy.

The landmark nature of her candidacy attracted a surge of national attention and resources that helped her clinch the nomination, according to Kerwin Swint, a Georgia politics expert at Kennesaw State University.

Her nomination “energizes the Democratic Party in Georgia to a large degree,” Swint said.

Abrams defeated former state Rep. Stacey Evans, 40, who ran as a champion of the HOPE scholarship ― a greatly-diminished free public college program from which she benefited.

In the general election, Abrams will face either Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle or Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Cagle and Kemp were the top two vote-getters, but neither won an outright majority, so they proceed to a July 24 runoff.

A key premise of Abrams’ bid is that in Georgia the Democratic Party no longer needs to cater to moderate white “swing” voters in the state’s suburban and rural areas who have increasingly migrated to the GOP since the 1990s.

It’s a strategy promoted by Californian Steve Phillips, author of Brown is the New White, which argues that Democrats can win with the help of a “new American majority” ― progressive whites, Latinos, Asian Americans and black voters, especially black women.

Seeing a prime opportunity to vindicate his theory, Phillips, whose wife Susan Sandler is heir to a mortgage banking fortune, has boosted Abrams’ bid both with his checkbook and his platform. PowerPAC Georgia, which is associated with Phillips’ nonprofit Democracy in Color, spent $1.5 million on Abrams’ behalf.

That money supplemented Abrams’ own considerable campaign haul of $3 million.

Abrams also benefited from an all-out bombardment of support from major progressive groups, including Democracy for America, the Working Families Party, MoveOn, NARAL Pro-Choice America and EMILY’s List.

Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) campaigned for her on the stump, and both Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), endorsed Abrams’ bid.

Abrams also enjoyed the support of nearly every labor union in Georgia, three of its four Democratic U.S. House members and almost every civil rights leader in the state.

She has run on protecting voting rights, expanding Medicaid using Affordable Care Act funds, raising the minimum wage, eliminating cash bail and allocating more needs-based college aid, among other liberal priorities.

But Abrams will need all the help she can get in a state that has not elected a Democrat as governor since 1998. And Republicans do not lack for ammunition to use against her.

For example, they are likely to seize on Abrams having more than $200,000 in personal debt, including $50,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS.

“Georgia is turning purple but it is still a red state and I think she would do very poorly outside metro Atlanta,” Swint said.

“It really depends on how big the blue wave is this year,” he added. “If it’s a tidal wave it could help her chances. If it’s a ripple, probably not.”The YouTube stars known as "Diamond and Silk" appear with Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. Rick Wilking / Reuters

Conservative internet pundits Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson appeared on Thursday to lie under oath to a congressional panel about their financial relationship to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on free speech and social media, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas) asked the pair whether the Trump campaign had paid them. The two emphatically denied receiving any payments.

“Ms. Hardaway have you ever been paid by the Trump campaign?” asked Jackson-Lee.

“No, we’ve never been paid by the Trump campaign,” replied Hardaway.

“Not $5?” Jackson-Lee followed up. “Not $100? What about $1,274.94?”

“We have never been paid,” Hardaway replied.

The Trump campaign’s Federal Election Commission filings indicate that the pair were paid $1,274.94 on Nov. 22, 2016 for “Field Consulting.”

During a combative exchange, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) asked Hardaway and Richardson about the discrepancy, reminding them that they were under oath and subject to criminal penalties if they lie.

Hardaway and Richardson told the committee that the payment was improperly labeled and that money was actually a reimbursement for airfare that the two had purchased to speak at a Trump rally.

The two also repeatedly claimed that Facebook has “censored” them, despite a lack of evidence proving the social network specifically targeted their content. While the social media giant had messaged the pair that their videos were “unsafe,” it later clarified that it was sent in error.

“We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,” a Facebook representative told the Washington Post, “We have provided them with more information about our policies and the tools that are applicable to their Page and look forward to the opportunity to speak with them.”

Hardaway and Richardson are among President Trump’s most ardent and popular African-American supporters. They currently have nearly 150,000 subscribers on YouTube and several of their videos have been viewed over a million times each. They began their rise to fame in December 2015, when then-candidate Trump invited them onto the stage at a rally.

“I hope you’ve monetized this,” Trump told the pair, referencing their growing fame on social media.

During the hearing, they exhibited the same mixture of indignation and ultra-conservative politics that have made them famous. “If illegal aliens can come here and achieve the American dream,” exclaimed Hardaway at one point, “why can’t Diamond and Silk?”

After being pressed on their payment from the Trump campaign, the two rebuffed Rep. Jeffries for attacking what they described as their entrepreneurial spirit.

“I don’t see you walking up to a white person saying ‘no, you shouldn’t monetize that,’” Hardaway said.

“I respect your game,” Jeffries replied.

This isn’t the first time that the social media stars have found themselves financially entwined with a campaign. On Aug. 14, 2016, Hardaway and Richardson received $7,025 in payments from the campaign of Republican businessman Paul Nehlen, according to the FEC. Nehlen was mounting a primary challenge to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Several days later, the pair endorsed Nehlen’s campaign.

Late Thursday afternoon, Bradley Crate, treasurer for Donald Trump’s election campaign, issued a statement saying the Trump campaign’s disbursement of $1,274.94 to Diamond and Silk was erroneously listed due improper paperwork.

“The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations,” Crate said. “The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.”

AdvertisementTwo more women have come out against the boss of disgraced coach and convicted child molester Larry Nassar, alleging the man sexually assaulted them while performing practice medical exams, according to court filings from Tuesday.

Police arrested former Michigan State University dean William Strampel in late March on two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty, one count of misconduct of a public official and one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct after four women accused him of sexual misconduct. The latest allegations now bring the total number of women accusing him to six.

Strampel reportedly lured the two young women into becoming models for practice examinations while he was the dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, according to Tuesday filings from the Michigan Attorney General’s Office obtained by CNN.

“Strampel conducted a full examination, including a breast examination, an anal examination that included the penetration of the anus, a pelvic examination that penetrated the vagina, and all were conducted in front of a small group of medical students,” a complaint from the office stated.

One of the women who participated accused Strampel of saying the examinations “turned him on” and that he was “beginning to get hard,” CNN reported. Another woman accused Strampel penetrating her vagina with his fingers before offering to admit her into medical school with a score of 19 on the MCAT, 6 points lower than MSU admissions benchmark for the standardized test.

Strampel is already facing allegations from four women who accuse the former dean of groping multiple female students, as well as soliciting them for nude photos and sexual acts in exchange for favorable treatment, HuffPost reported in March.

A hearing scheduled for May 3 will determine whether the new testimonies of the two women will be allowed in court for Strampel’s trial, according to CNN. The Michigan Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

MSU Interim President John Engler told HuffPost that “there will be no more Bill Strampels,” in response to the new allegations of abuse during practice exams.

“What I continue to learn about Bill Strampel disgusts me,” Engler told HuffPost in a statement. “Anytime concerns are raised about faculty and staff behavior, we take those concerns seriously and investigate. We will not let our students and employees down. There is zero tolerance for abusive behavior and comments. We are making changes in our Human Resource policies, including those governing evaluations and reviews.”

Strampel oversaw convicted sexual abuser Larry Nassar while at MSU and handled a 2014 Title IX investigation into sexual abuse accusations against the doctor. The dean allowed Nassar to continue working throughout the investigation, a time in which Nassar continued to abuse young athletes.

Investigators have found pornographic images and videos on Strampel’s computer, which included one of Nassar sexually abusing a young female athlete.Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) and the rest of the gang heroically filled up those squares ― and some even flexed real vocal muscle in this clever parody.

They summed up their union perfectly, singing: “So then one day all the heroes were assembled/to fight a villain who packed much more than a punch/and this group was labeled the Avengers/that’s the way we all became the Marvel Bunch.”In another sign of the impact of their reporting, the team of New York Times journalists whose bombshell investigation into movie mogul Harvey Weinstein catalyzed the Me Too movement will get a big screen adaptation.

Annapurna and Plan B, two Hollywood production companies behind a number of prestigious movies, have optioned the movie rights to the Times’ reporting, which was led by reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and editor Rebecca Corbett.

The deal was first reported by Deadline Hollywood late Wednesday and later confirmed by multiple news outlets.

Sources told Deadline that the forthcoming movie aims to focus on the dogged reporting process behind the big story:

The thrust of the film isn’t Weinstein or his scandal. This is about an all-women team of journalists who persevered through threats of litigation and intimidation, to break a game-changing story, told in a procedural manner like Spotlight and All the President’s Men.

The earlier two movies are frequently cited as among the best depictions of journalism on film, for how they reveal the mechanics of reporting in a riveting way.

No writer, director or stars have been announced for the film about The New York Times, but according to Variety, “the project is sure to gain momentum very quickly.”If you’re using Hulu this May, it will probably be for “The Handmaid’s Tale” and the many new movies the service is adding this month.

The second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” premiered April 25 and will have new episodes on a weekly basis through May. Hulu adds only one other original show this month (“All Night”) so “Handmaid’s” will likely take up your attention.

You’ll be able to choose from quite a few movies, though, including “I, Tonya” from last year and popular series like the “Rocky,” “Matrix” and “Nightmare on Elm Street” movies. That said, “I, Tonya” doesn’t join until May 31, so you’ll have to wait a few weeks.

Many movies are also leaving Hulu this month, but not too many notable ones. It’s a shame that “Fred: The Movie,” “Fred: Night of the Living Fred” and “Fred 3: Camp Fred” are all disappearing, but you had your chance with those Criterion Collection shoo-ins.

May 31Two Arizona women face felony charges for allegedly impersonating dentists and performing unlicensed dental work on unwitting patients, including injecting anesthesia and extracting teeth.

According to an indictment filed in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Melissa M. Pavey, 45, and Jolene E. Houchens, 38, used drills, lasers and surgical tools on at least five people between July 2016 and December 2017.

The women operated out of an office in Glendale, where they charged victims thousands of dollars for illegal procedures, according to the Arizona Attorney General’s Office.

In one instance, Pavey and Houchens allegedly charged a man $6,000 for a tooth extraction. In another, a Glendale woman had multiple teeth extracted by the pair in January 2017, authorities said.

“During the whole procedure, I felt something was off ― the time it took, the numbing … the pain I felt, dropping the tool on the ground and putting it back in my mouth,” she told CBS 5 News in Phoenix.

The Glendale woman claims the phony dentists told her she did not need antibiotics and instead gave her loose pills in a bag, along with a prescription for Percocet. The prescription, the indictment alleges, was written on a prescription pad taken from a licensed dental office.

Extreme pain prompted the woman to visit an emergency room, where she says doctors said her mouth was infected.

The Glendale woman is just one of their alleged victims. The indictment says Pavey and Houchens “recklessly caused … physical injury” to four other people they performed dangerous surgical procedures on. The investigative documents further allege that neither Pavey nor Houchens has ever been licensed to practice dentistry.

Special agents with the Arizona Attorney General’s Office investigated the pair after the Arizona State Board of Dental Examiners reported receiving a complaint.

Both women face multiple felony charges, including fraud, aggravated assault with a dangerous instrument and theft. They are scheduled to appear in court for their arraignments early next month. Court documents do not list an attorney for either woman.

Read the indictment below:Samantha Bee explained why Steve Bannon’s growing influence on Europe’s far-right political parties “should scare you” on Wednesday’s “Full Frontal.”

Bee noted how President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist has in recent weeks been conducting a “racist” “tour de creeps” across the continent, meeting with right-wing politicians in Italy, Germany and France.

“Am I the only one getting a weird sense of déjà vu?” Bee asked. “I can’t remember, but I feel like someone else once united the far-right parties of Italy and Germany and then invaded France with their ideas.”

Bee acknowledged it was “easy to make fun” of Bannon’s “nationalist, white supremacist views as well as, you know, literally everything else about him.”

But his “presence around the world should scare you,” Bee warned. “Not just because Steve Bannon looks shockingly close to Jeff Goldblum as he transforms into The Fly, but also because he is really good at transforming countries to conform to his far-right, hyper-nationalist vision. Remember, we thought he was a joke here, too, until he wasn’t.

“We know the cost of underestimating him. It’s Donald Trump as president,” Bee added.

WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm one of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees, Kyle Duncan, a lawyer who built his career on fighting abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights.

Every Republican voted to confirm Duncan, 45, to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. One Democrat voted for him, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.).

There’s nothing particularly surprising about Republicans lining up behind a Republican president’s court pick. In fact, not a single GOP senator has voted against any of Trump’s judicial nominees, aside from one no vote cast by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).

But what’s puzzling is that Republican senators who identify as pro-choice or pro-LGBTQ rights keep voting to confirm lifetime judges poised to chip away at those rights ― and the interest groups that praise these senators for their views seem to be ignoring their contrary votes on judges, whose decisions will affect generations of people.

Take Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Both are pro-choice; Murkowski is a member of several GOP organizations that support abortion rights, including the Republican Majority for Choice, and Collins just won a big award from Planned Parenthood.

“Throughout my service in the Senate, I have been a strong proponent of measures to promote and protect women’s health and expand all Americans’ access to quality health care,” Collins said in November when she received her award.

And yet, both just voted to confirm Duncan, who led the legal fight against the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that employers provide insurance coverage for contraceptives. He also wrote a brief in opposition to a Washington state law that required pharmacies to stock birth control, and co-authored a brief supporting Texas’ extreme restrictions on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court later struck down as unconstitutional.

They voted in July to confirm 53-year-old John Bush as a U.S. circuit judge. He had compared abortion to slavery and referred to them as the “two greatest tragedies in our country.”

They voted in October to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, then 45, to the 7th Circuit. She had suggested Roe v. Wade was an “erroneous decision” and called the Affordable Care Act’s birth control benefit “an assault on religious liberty.”

They voted in August to confirm Kevin Newsom, then 44, to the 11th Circuit. He had equated the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 Supreme Court decision upholding slavery.

They voted in December to confirm Leonard Steven Grasz, 56, as a U.S. circuit judge. He had compared the “personhood” of fetuses to the civil rights of Native Americans and African-Americans. He’d also argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because “abortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.”

“I have been a strong proponent of measures to promote and protect women’s health and expand all Americans’ access to quality health care.” - Sen. Susan Collins, who consistently votes for Trump's anti-choice judges

Ahead of Duncan’s vote, Planned Parenthood tweeted for days urging senators to vote no and highlighting how awful he would be for women’s reproductive rights. After he was confirmed, the group thanked Democrats for speaking out against Duncan, but said nothing about its GOP allies who voted yes.

Aides to Collins and Murkowski did not respond to requests for comment on how they square their pro-choice position with their votes for Trump’s judges.

What happened to being an LGBTQ ally?

It’s not just hypocrisy on abortion rights. Collins, Murkowski and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) have cast themselves as allies to the LGBTQ community, yet they keep voting to confirm lifetime judges who are rabidly anti-gay.

Collins said in 2014 that she was “proud” to be an ally to the Human Rights Campaign, which endorsed Collins in her reelection campaign that year. Murkowski announced her support for same-sex marriage in 2013, and voted to repeal the military’s ban on openly gay troops in 2010, saying, “I’ve heard from Alaskans across the state who believe it’s time to end this discriminatory policy, and I agree with them.”

Portman, meanwhile, announced his support for same-sex marriage in 2013 after his son came out as gay. He followed that by voting for a bill to ban workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

All three of them voted in December to confirm James Ho as a U.S. circuit judge. Ho had donated thousands of pro bono hours to First Liberty Institute, a conservative legal group that takes up cases opposing LGBTQ rights. Its clients include the owners of Sweet Cakes, an Oregon bakery fined for refusing to serve a lesbian couple, and a newspaper editor fired for writing a post condemning the “LGBTQXYZ crowd and the Gaystapo” for trying to “make their sinful nature right with God.”

They all voted for Judge Bush, who criticized the State Department for modifying passport application forms to include same-sex parents.

They all voted for Judge Grasz, who, as chief deputy attorney general for Nebraska, opposed the recognition of same-sex marriages contracted in other states. He also used his role on a city of Omaha committee to push for an amendment to the city charter to allow employers to discriminate against LGBTQ employees by citing religious liberty.

And on Tuesday, they all voted for Duncan, who previously filed a brief on behalf of 15 states opposing nationwide marriage equality and led efforts to keep same-sex marriage bans in Louisiana and Virginia. He also represented the birth mother of three children who refused visitation rights to her former same-sex spouse.

The Human Rights Campaign torched the Senate for confirming Duncan and cast him as one of Trump’s most extreme anti-LGBTQ judicial nominees. But the group didn’t call out any of its supposed GOP allies for voting for him.

“In a string of anti-equality nominees from the Trump-Pence administration, Kyle Duncan stands out for his long career fighting to limit the legal protections for LGBTQ Americans,” David Stacy, HRC’s government affairs director, said in a statement. “It is unconscionable that the Senate has rubber stamped yet another unfit and extreme nominee to a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.”
