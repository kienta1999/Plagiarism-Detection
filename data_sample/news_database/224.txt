The Trump National Golf Club in Florida has agreed to pay close to $5.45 million to settle a class action lawsuit after members argued that a regulation imposed by Donald Trump before he became president cheated them out of fees.

Details of the agreement to settle the suit — filed on behalf of 65 former club members — were released in an unopposed motion filed Friday in federal court in West Palm Beach.

Trump changed the membership rules of the club in Jupiter when the Trump Organization purchased the former Ritz-Carlton Golf Club & Spa in 2012. The club had allowed members who wanted to leave to continue to play golf (and pay dues) until replacement members were found. Their memberships deposits were refunded once replacements stepped into the spots.

Under Trump, members who had declared they wanted to leave either had to convert their memberships to discounted nonrefundable deposits to continue club access — or stop using the club altogether while replacements were found, which meant it could take years before their fees would be refunded.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled last year that Trump had breached the club’s contract with members by essentially canceling their memberships and denying them access to the club without compensation.

Marra ordered the golf club to refund all the membership fees with interest, which amounted to $5.77 million. The former members later agreed to the lower amount to avoid a lengthy appeal that the club vowed to carry out. They will still recover approximately 94 cents on every dollar owned, Bloomberg reported.

Trump National Golf Club has agreed to pay the money, but will not admit wrondgoing.

Marra still must approve the settlement.

After he was elected, Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action lawsuit against his Trump University, which clients said was a fraud.

Trump has been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits and legal actions.It was written in the stars above Springfield.

The U.S. men’s curling team’s unexpected gold at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Saturday shouldn’t have come as a surprise to fans of “The Simpsons.”

That’s because Fox’s animated comedy show accurately predicted a Team USA gold in the sport back on Valentine’s Day in 2010.

In an episode titled “Boy Meets Curl,” Homer and Marge Simpson and Agnes and Seymour Skinner topped the podium for curling. And what’s even spookier is that, just as on Saturday, the cartoon quartet beat Sweden to do so.

ESPN reporter Darren Rovell noted the accurate prediction on Twitter:

No one could have predicted that the US would win curling gold, right? Actually, the Simpsons did in a February 14, 2010 episode. They beat Sweden, who the US happened to beat to win gold today (H/T @dansnierson) pic.twitter.com/0gkhycQ3xF — Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) February 25, 2018

And here’s a clip to prove it:

“The Simpsons” set its episode at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, which was going on at the time of its broadcast.

As Rovell noted, it is the latest in a line of accurate predictions from the long-running cartoon:

As was show writer Rob LaZebnik, who actually penned the curling episode:The more than five million law-abiding members of the National Rifle Association have enjoyed discounts and cost-saving programs from many American corporations that have partnered with the NRA to expand member benefits.

Since the tragedy in Parkland, Florida, a number of companies have decided to sever their relationship with the NRA, in an effort to punish our members who are doctors, farmers, law enforcement officers, fire fighters, nurses, shop owners and school teachers that live in every American community. We are men and women who represent every American ethnic group, every one of the world’s religions and every form of political commitment.

The law-abiding members of the NRA had nothing at all to do with the failure of that school’s security preparedness, the failure of America’s mental health system, the failure of the National Instant Check System or the cruel failures of both federal and local law enforcement.

Despite that, some corporations have decided to punish NRA membership in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice. In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve.

Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.Crafting the score of your own on-screen appearance would be a next level cameo.

In an interview with BBC Radio, award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar says he’s not just interested in a cameo in the next “Black Panther” movie, he wants to play a villain similar to Michael B. Jordan’s critically acclaimed character Erik Killmonger.

Lamar, who produced the film’s soundtrack, says that Killmonger is a “loved and misunderstood” villain, and if he had the choice, that’s the type of role he’d want to be cast in.

In January, the 30-year-old rapper took home a Best Rap Album Grammy for “Damn,” as well as awards for best rap song and rap performance.The California Democratic Party rebuked its senior senator early Sunday by declining to make an endorsement in the state’s U.S. Senate race.

State Senate leader Kevin de León, a fellow Democrat mounting a progressive challenge to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, won the support of 54 percent of the delegates at the party’s convention in San Diego over the weekend. Only 37 percent of the delegates backed the 25-year incumbent, who is seeking her fifth term in office.

The backing of 60 percent of the delegates was needed to secure the party’s official endorsement.

In a statement following the vote, de León hailed the result as “an astounding rejection of politics as usual,” one that signaled growing momentum for his campaign.

“California Democrats are hungry for new leadership that will fight for California values from the front lines, not equivocate on the sidelines,” de León said. “We all deserve a leader who will take our climate action to Washington, and will fight each and every day to protect our human and civil rights, our immigrant families and Dreamers, champion universal health care and create good paying middle class jobs.”

The vote is seen as a sign of nagging discomfort among progressives to Feinstein’s centrist and hawkish brand of politics. Her skeptical view of single-payer health care, anti-marijuana stance, and her votes in favor of some President Donald Trump’s nominations to key administration jobs rankled activists at the core of the state’s Democratic Party.

Yet Feinstein, who will turn 85 years old later this year, is still expected to cruise to victory over her relatively unknown opponent. She holds a lead over de León of nearly 30 percentage points — 46 percent to 17 percent ― in a recent poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California.

Feinstein also has a considerable fundraising advantage. While the senator started the year with nearly $10 million in the bank, her rival had only about $360,000 cash on hand.At first, the tweet seemed like standard criticism from President Donald Trump.

“Congressman [Adam] Schiff omitted and distorted key facts,” he said, appearing to quote a Fox News report about the California Democrat, who has frequently butted heads with the president over the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

“So, what else is new,” Trump added. “He is a total phony!”

“Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts” @FoxNews So, what else is new. He is a total phony! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2018

But CNN’s eagle-eyed Brian Stelter noticed something off about the tweet. Though Trump had suggested that a Fox News correspondent was saying Schiff had “omitted and distorted key facts” in a memo by Democrats about the Russia probe released on Saturday, Fox News’ Molly Line actually said the opposite.

“Congressman Schiff, he argues [a] Republican memo omitted and distorted key facts, that it was initially meant to mislead the public,” Line said of the GOP document released earlier this month that alleged FBI spying abuses.

As Line put it, the Democratic memo that refutes the GOP’s “was supposed to be the rebuttal memo that was meant to show what was left out.”

Below is Schiff’s announcement of the new memo. In his tweet, he said the Republican version “omitted and distorted key facts in order to mislead the public.”

Some time ago, Republicans on our committee released a declassified memo that omitted and distorted key facts in order to mislead the public and impugn the integrity of the FBI.



We can now tell you what they left out: https://t.co/jeVCVTBUBZ — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 24, 2018

That Trump would so egregiously misquote a news report ― from his favorite network no less― to attack a rival shows that he, not Schiff, is the one omitting and distorting key facts.

Watch the clip below:Florida school shooting survivor David Hogg sharply criticized the NRA Sunday for its continued opposition to stricter gun control and lambasted the organization’s spokeswoman for misrepresenting its agenda.

“Honestly, it’s disgusting. [The NRA acts] like they don’t own these politicians, but they do,” Hogg said during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week. “They’ve gotten gun legislation passed before in their favor, in favor of gun manufacturers.”

“The NRA is an organization that’s completely broken,” he added.

Hogg was responding to comments made earlier in the program by NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch, who contended that the NRA was working to make people safer.

“We have been supporting proposals to make sure that the system works,” Loesch told host George Stephanopoulos. “We’ve been calling for politicians to work with us and make sure that dangerous people who have received due process” can’t access firearms.

″[Loesch] is serving the gun manufacturers,” Hogg said during his appearance following the conclusion of Loesch’s interview. “She’s not serving the people of the NRA, because the people that are joining the NRA, 99.9 percent of them are amazing people that just want to be safe, responsible gun owners. And I fully can support that.”

Hogg was joined on the program by one of his teachers, Ashley Kurth, who sheltered her students in a classroom during the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Kurth voiced her opposition to President Donald Trump’s proposal to arm some teachers across the country.

“These are kids that have passions, very raging passions, and when they get into fights,” observed Kurth, “having something like this in their vicinity is just not a good idea.”

Asked whether he and other gun control activists can maintain the political momentum spurred by shooting, Hogg, 17, cited his generation’s growing electoral influence.

“Columbine was about 19 years ago,” Hogg said, referring to the shooting at a Colorado high school in which 13 people were killed. “Now that you’ve had an entire generation of kids growing up around mass shootings, and the fact that they’re starting to be able to vote, explains how we’re going to have this change. Kids are not going to accept this.”

Seventeen people were killed and another 14 wounded when suspected gunman 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. In response to the shooting, Hogg and about 20 of his classmates founded Never Again MSD, a group dedicated to enacting stricter gun control measures to stymie school shootings.

During his “This Week” appearance, Hogg reflected upon his upcoming return to classes.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf speaks during the 2016 Cannabis Business Summit & Expo on June 22, 2016 in Oakland. Justin Sullivan via Getty Images

The mayor of Oakland on Saturday night warned the city’s residents of potential raids being conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a statement released at the end of the day, Mayor Libby Schaaf said she learned from “multiple credible sources” that, within the next 24 hours, ICE would be gearing up for operations in the Bay Area of Northern California, including Oakland.

She said her warning was not intended to panic residents, but protect them. Schaaf didn’t provide exact locations because she said she didn’t know which areas ICE would be targeting.

“My priority is for the well-being and safety of all residents ― particularly our most vulnerable,” Schaaf said in a statement tweeted just after sunset on Saturday.

“And I know that Oakland is safer when we share information, encourage community awareness, and care for our neighbors.”

Last summer, Oakland city council voted to end an agreement the city had with ICE that allowed police to work with ICE. Oakland then strengthened its status as a sanctuary city in January by barring any city officials from cooperating with ICE in any capacity.

The city’s decision to double down on protecting undocumented residents came in January after immigration agents raided about 100 7-11 stores across the country before sunrise to arrest undocumented workers. Dozens of the targeted stores were located in Northern California.

Schaaf reminded citizens of these laws in her Saturday statement, while also noting a state law that prohibits business owners from helping ICE agents and bars federal agents from employee-only areas.

ICE officials told ABC 7 News that they weren’t aware of which specific immigrations operations the mayor was referencing.

“There are ICE operations every day and it is unclear what the mayor is referring to,” the agency said.

In her statement, Schaaf said that Oakland is a “city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation.”The “Pulp Fiction” star joined the growing chorus of critics of the plan with this tweet on Friday:

“Can someone that’s been in a Gunfight tell that Muthafukka that’s Never been in a Gunfight, the flaws of his Arm The Teachers plan??!!” asked Jackson.

His post has gone viral.

Trump first touted the idea of arming 20 percent of teaching staff at schools during a “listening session” last week at the White House that included students and parents personally affected by the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

The proposal has sparked an avalanche of criticism, with many teachers using social media to speak out against it.

Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education Association, told Education Week that solutions are needed to “keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators.”Much has been made of Robin Williams’ torment detailed in a new biography of the actor. But the author of “Robin” described another side of the late comedian on “The Tonight Show” Tuesday.

Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times told host Jimmy Fallon of the time he and Williams were “geeking out” one night when Itzkoff mentioned that he shopped at the Forbidden Planet comic book store in Manhattan. Williams, known to frequent comic and collectible shops, said he was a fan of the place and vowed to take Itzkoff there.

The writer said he dismissed the proposal as an empty celebrity promise, but Williams followed through, inviting Itzkoff to meet him weeks later at the shop.

“He was like a kid in a candy store,” Itzkoff said. “He’s like walking around looking at all the statuettes and he’s like, ‘I got that one at home, got that one, don’t have that one yet.’ ”

Itzkoff said there was a regular guy in Williams that wanted to connect with people without celebrity getting in the way.

“All his life he wanted to knock down the barrier and you can’t really get rid of it when you’re that famous,” the author said.NurPhoto via Getty Images

The president of Mexico halted upcoming plans to visit the White House after a reportedly tense phone conversation with President Donald Trump, according to the Washington Post.

U.S. and Mexican officials told the Post that President Enrique Peña Nieto called off his visit to Washington D.C. after Trump refused his request to publicly affirm Mexico’s ongoing stance that the country will not pay for a border wall between the two countries during a phone call on Tuesday.

President Peña Nieto has long maintained that Mexico will not pay for Trump’s plans to fortify the border with a wall, as the country finds the gesture offensive.

The officials who were familiar with the call spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity because the 50-minute call was confidential.

A White House official confirmed with CNN that Peña Nieto’s meeting with Trump was tentatively scheduled for March, but was placed on hold after their conversation.

A three-sentence White House readout of the phone call did not specifically mention Trump’s multibillion-dollar border wall, but it did note that the president “underscored his commitment to expanding cooperation between the United States and Mexico on security, trade, and immigration.”

According to the Washington Post, Peña Nieto and Trump spent a “considerable portion” of the phone call discussing the border wall.

A Mexican official told the paper that Trump “lost his temper” during Tuesday’s conversation. U.S. officials said Trump was frustrated and exasperated because he thought Peña Nieto was being unreasonable for expecting him to walk back plans for his controversial campaign promise, according to the Post.

Trump and Peña Nieto had previously quarreled over the border wall during a phone conversation early last year.

Leaked transcripts of a Jan. 27, 2017, phone call between the two leaders reportedly show Trump insisting that his wall was “the least important thing” to talk about while adding that “politically [it] might be the most important.”

During the conversation, both leaders agreed that talking about the wall was unproductive, but when Peña Nieto said, “Mexico cannot pay for that wall,” Trump responded: “You cannot say that to the press.”

“The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that,” Trump told Peña Nieto, according to the transcripts. “You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.”The Disney Channel’s “Andi Mack” made history last fall when it revealed one of its principal characters to be gay ― a first for the family-friendly network.

The coming-of-age series’ second season premiere found Andi (played by Peyton Elizabeth Lee) struggling over her feelings for a middle school boy, Jonah Beck (Asher Angel). As Andi confides in her pal, Cyrus (Joshua Rush), he begins to realize that he, too, has a crush on Jonah. In subsequent episodes, Cyrus comes to embrace his identity as a young gay teen.

When the character’s storyline was introduced in October, it quickly made countless headlines and stirred its share of controversy. For his part, Rush said he expected that playing a gay character would be scrutinized. But he said that ultimately, he’s grateful to be a part of such a groundbreaking storyline.

“I think the most important thing for me when I got this part was to do it right,” the 16-year-old told People. “I knew that I wanted to do it justice, because I knew that people were gonna end up seeing this and being like, ‘Wow that’s me, I identify with that [and] I can be who I am now,’ but I also wanted to make sure that it’s not all-encompassing. Like that’s not all of Cyrus’ personality.”

Rush, whose other credits include “The Lion Guard” and “Chuck,” hopes young LGBTQ people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality will find inspiration in Cyrus’ story.

“I think this storyline is definitely going to help a lot of my peers,” he said. “I hope that more shows will follow in Disney’s footsteps with Cyrus’ storyline. Really, I look forward to the day that it’s not an unusual occurrence. I hope everyone can one day see that our differences are beautiful and that love is love.”

The show’s creator, Terri Minsky, said last fall that she and the Disney Channel consulted child development experts and a number of LGBTQ advocacy groups, including GLAAD and PFLAG, to ensure Cyrus’ coming out story would be portrayed “in an age-appropriate and respectful manner.” (The series has already received a GLAAD Media Awards nomination for its efforts.)

Rush believes they’ve succeeded.Former first lady Michelle Obama announced new details Sunday about her much-anticipated memoir.

AdvertisementBEIRUT/UNITED NATIONS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Rescuers in Syria’s eastern Ghouta said the bombing would not let up long enough for them to count the bodies during one of the bloodiest air assaults of the seven-year war, while the U.N. Security Council called for a 30-day humanitarian truce.

The vote at the United Nations came as warplanes pounded eastern Ghouta, the last rebel enclave near Syria’s capital, for a seventh straight day while residents holed up in basements.

The Security Council approved a resolution demanding a 30-day truce to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations with the support of Syrian ally Russia after a flurry of last-minute negotiations.

Medical charities have decried attacks on a dozen hospitals but the Damascus government and Russia, its key ally, say they only target militants. They have said they seek to stop mortar attacks injuring dozens in the capital, and have accused insurgents in Ghouta of holding people as human shields.

There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military.

A surge of rocket fire, shelling and air strikes has killed more than 500 people since Sunday night, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The dead included more than 120 children.

The Britain-based monitor said raids hit Douma, Zamalka and other towns there on Saturday, killing 31 people.

First responders searched for survivors after strikes on Kafr Batna, Douma and Harasta, the Civil Defence in eastern Ghouta said. The rescue service, which operates in rebel territory, said it had documented at least 350 deaths in four days earlier this week.

“Maybe there are many more,” said Siraj Mahmoud, a civil defense spokesman in the suburbs. “We weren’t able to count the martyrs yesterday because the warplanes are touring the skies.”

As the bombs rain down, some hitting emergency centers and vehicles, workers have struggled to pull people from the rubble, Mahmoud said. “But if we have to go out running on our legs and dig with our hands to rescue the people, we will still be here.”

A witness in Douma said he woke up in the early hours on Saturday to the sound of a squadron of jets bombing nearby. The streets have mostly remained empty.

The United Nations says nearly 400,000 people live in eastern Ghouta, a pocket of satellite towns and farms under government siege since 2013, without enough food or medicine.

The local opposition council said it was setting up emergency volunteer teams in several districts to reinforce shelters with sandbags and try to link them through tunnels.

“Every day we say God willing tomorrow will be better...Today, the main sight in the Ghouta is limbs, blood,” Mahmoud said. “There is no need to dig graves, we will be buried under our houses.”

CEASEFIRE VOTE

The U.N. Security Council is to vote on Saturday on a draft resolution which demands a 30-day ceasefire across Syria to allow aid access and medical evacuations.

The 15-member council postponed voting on the text, which Sweden and Kuwait drafted. The delay followed a flurry of last-minute talks after Russia, a veto-holding ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, proposed new amendments.

The truce does not cover militants from Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and the Nusra Front.

Several previous ceasefire attempts have quickly unraveled during the multi-sided conflict, which has killed hundreds of thousands and forced 11 million people out of their homes.

Syrian state media said Ghouta factions fired mortars at districts of Damascus on Saturday, including near a school. Insurgent shelling wounded six people, it said, and the army heavily pounded militant targets in the suburbs in response.

The Ghouta pocket has become the war’s latest flashpoint, after a string of rebel defeats and negotiated withdrawals. With Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, Assad’s military has restored state rule over the main cities across western Syria.

Insurgents in eastern Ghouta have vowed not to accept such a fate, ruling out the kind of evacuation that ended rebellion in Aleppo and Homs after bitter sieges.

Russia has blamed Nusra fighters, from al-Qaeda’s former Syria branch, for provoking the situation in the Ghouta. The two main Islamist factions there in turn accuse their enemies of using the presence of a few hundred jihadist fighters as a pretext for attacks.A cow in Poland celebrated as an icon of freedom for her dramatic escape from slaughter has died from stress after being recaptured.

The red Limousin beef cow was caught Thursday near the village of Siestrzechowice and loaded onto a truck back to captivity, but she died during transportation, The Associated Press reports.

Her escape, which happened on Jan. 23, garnered attention worldwide after being reported by Polish website Wiadomosci in February.

Workers were leading her towards a slaughterhouse-bound truck in southern Poland near Lake Nyskie. The cow fled, smashing through a metal fence and breaking the arm of a farm worker, according to the BBC. She then dove into the water and swam out to an island in the middle of the lake. There, she managed to evade capture for weeks.

Her fans included Polish politician Pawel Kukiz, who told Sky News, “If all citizens could show such determination as this cow then Poland would be a much more prosperous country.”

In the end, it took a team of five people and three shots of sedatives to recapture her. According to the AP, had she lived, she would have been “kept” at “a local governor’s farm,” though it’s not entirely clear what her fate would have been there.

South Korean Kim Bo-reum slipped into the channel created by Takagi to win the silver medal 0.12 seconds behind the Japanese as Schouten settled for bronze.

Takagi, who won gold in the women’s team pursuit earlier this week, now has an individual Olympic title to add to her collection.

“I‘m feeling very good,” Takagi told reporters. “Only lost focus on two laps, then I showed good acceleration. Then with 100 meters –- go. I‘m very happy. I focus on team pursuit and mass start.”

The race made its Olympic debut in South Korea and was given a touch of celebrity by the presence of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the U.S. President.

It was a tactical encounter, with 16 skaters simultaneously vying for an advantage on the track.

None of the trio who finished on the podium tried to win any of the three intermediate sprints, preferring instead to stay well back in the peloton and save their legs for the final push for a medal.

The first three to finish the race earn 60, 40 and 20 points respectively, while the top three skaters in each of the intermediate sprints earn five, three and one points to decide the classification places.

With two laps to go in the 16-lap race, the pack began to pick up speed, rapidly reeling in early pace-setter Saskia Alusalu of Estonia, who finished in fourth place after winning all three intermediate sprints.

Schouten had the lead going into the final corner but the Dutch skater misjudged her line slightly and was forced wide coming out, and Takagi stormed up the inside channel to capitalize on the mistake.

She crossed the line in a flurry of effort, her arms and legs pumping furiously to hold off Kim by a narrow margin.

Kim was crestfallen after finishing second. She made a deep bow to the crowd and took a lap around the track waving her country’s flag.

Kim and her team mate in the women’s team pursuit, Park Ji-woo, faced calls for them to be banned from the national team after they appeared to blame a team mate for their failure to reach the women’s team pursuit semi-finals this week.

The Czech is only the fifth person to win gold in two different events at the Winter Olympics. Ledecka defeated Germany’s Selina Joerg in the final by 0.46 seconds to claim the gold.

Germany’s Theresia Ramona Hofmeister won the bronze medal race against Sochi bronze medalist Alena Zavarzina to complete the podium.

Zavarzina fell in both the semi-final and small final to open the door for the Germans. Ledecka dominated from the outset, setting the fastest time in qualifying and handling the pressure to win a historic double gold in Pyeongchang.

The U.S. men’s Olympic curling team made history on Saturday after they bested Sweden to win the squad’s first ever gold medal.

After nine nail-biting rounds, the U.S. team took victory with a 10-7 score.

Team USA’s only previous medal was a bronze in the 2006 XX Olympic Winter Games in Italy.

This year’s win came after the team’s unlikely path to the finals. Earlier in the Games, they appeared headed for disappointment after losing four of their first six round-robin matches. But they managed to make a shocking comeback by winning the three remaining games to advance to the semi-finals, where they beat Canada–– a three-time gold medal-winning team.

“It’s a little surreal right now still, just coming off of where we were to where we are now,” American curler Tyler George said. “It feels like two different tournaments. One’s a dream and one’s a reality. Fortunately for us the winning streak is the reality, but we’re trying not to get too excited.”

Pelosi, the liberal House minority leader from San Francisco, has consistently been one of the GOP’s favorite targets. She’s been featured in roughly one-third of Republican TV ads aired in House races this year.

Now she’s popping up in a couple of Senate ads as well. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is running to unseat Sen. Bill Nelson (D), is out with a new ad arguing that Nelson always “votes the party line.” One of the people in the spot says, “I think Nancy Pelosi’s a huge influence on the Democratic Party and Bill Nelson.”

“The ad features testimonials of Florida voters expressing their frustrations of Bill Nelson being a party-line voter who is more influenced by his party bosses in DC than by the needs of the Floridians he’s supposed to serve,” Scott campaign spokeswoman Lauren Schenone wrote in an email.

A campaign press release for the ad pointed out how often Nelson has voted with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Nelson’s campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel said he has “a long record of working across the aisle and has been recognized for it.”

“For eight years, Rick Scott ran a one-party-rule state, and now he’s doing and saying anything to be part of the one-party rule in Washington,” she added.

Republican Matt Rosendale, who is competing for his party’s nomination to go up against Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), also recently put out an ad highlighting Pelosi’s criticism of the tax law.

The conservative group Americans for Prosperity released an ad in February against Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), saying that by voting against last year’s GOP tax bill, he “stood with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer” instead of with voters in the state.

It’s clear that Republicans see Pelosi as a huge boon for them this cycle. She was central to their strategy in a June 2017 special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jon Ossoff lost to Republican Karen Handel. The race attracted big money from both sides of the aisle, and Republicans portrayed Ossoff as tied to Pelosi and other national Democrats.

But the attack-Pelosi tactic hasn’t been as successful since then. Republicans featured her prominently in their attacks against Democrat Conor Lamb in a heated special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District in March, portraying him as a tool of the party establishment. He was victorious, in an area that Donald Trump handily won in 2016.

In February a GOP super PAC went after a woman running for a seat in the Florida statehouse with a mailer reading, “Margaret Good and her liberal pal Nancy Pelosi want to expand Obamacare in Florida.”

Good ended up winning that race, in a surprise victory for Democrats.

Pelosi’s office pointed to observations by GOP pollster David Winston, who cautioned his party against relying too heavily on an attack-Pelosi strategy:

Anti-Pelosi rhetoric and negative advertising still stir the GOP base, and perhaps the specter of another Pelosi speakership will send some on K Street heading for their checkbooks to get behind Republican PACs. But Pelosi’s value as a political target may have come and gone, or at least reached a point of diminishing returns, especially with independents who tend to decide elections these days. In our most recent “Winning the Issues” survey, we asked voters what would matter more to them in deciding their vote for Congress this fall — a candidate’s position on Pelosi or a candidate’s position on the tax cut plan and how individuals are benefiting. The tax cut beat out Pelosi 73 percent to 12 percent.Mr. T had words with the U.S. men's curling team before their final against Sweden at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

There was no time for any jibber jabber when Mr. T got on the telephone with the U.S. men’s Olympic curling team on Saturday morning.

John Shuster, Tyler George, Matt Hamilton, John Landsteiner and Joe Polo received a rousing pep talk from the actor on the 1980s TV series “The A-Team” before their final against Sweden in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Guess who just phoned our guys to say good luck tonight?? The one and only @MrT himself. Can’t thank T enough for calling and hopping on board the #TeamShuster and @usacurl train!! #TeamUSA #curlingiscoolfool #TeamT pic.twitter.com/qN3MNMsybN — Team Shuster (@TeamShuster) February 24, 2018

“I want you guys to know, I’m your biggest fan back here in the United States,” said Mr. T, whose real name is Laurence Tureaud. “You know I love what you’re doing and I understand the athletic ability that it takes.”

The team shared footage of themselves taking part of the call to Twitter, above, and it’s now going viral. It’s unclear what else Mr. T said to motivate them, but he also posted these tweets as further encouragement:

I predict PAIN for Sweden and victory for the USA! Yeah that’s what i’m talking about. We’re in it to win it fool! #curlingiscoolfool #TeamUSA — Mr. T (@MrT) February 24, 2018

I really don’t have to pump you up, motivate or inspire you because the gold medal was your dream. Now just live the dream and make it real! @TeamShuster #curlingiscoolfool #TeamUSA — Mr. T (@MrT) February 24, 2018

This is your moment @TeamShuster . Now go out there and do what you do best! Bring home the Gold or else. Grrr! #curlingiscoolfool #TeamUSA #Curling — Mr. T (@MrT) February 24, 2018

It seemed to do the trick, as the team beat Sweden 10-7 to scoop the squad’s first ever Olympic gold medal in the sport.

And Mr. T, whom George lightheartedly dubbed their “unofficial team captain,” was one of the first to congratulate them over Twitter:As the reports of Porter’s alleged abuse were made public, “President Trump defended Mr. Porter, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly stated that Mr. Porter is a man of ‘integrity,’” the amended suit now states.

“After Porter and Sorensen’s resignations, Trump tweeted: ‘Peoples [sic] lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused — life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?’” the suit adds.

The lawsuit argues that this “animus towards women gives license to and encourages executive branch decision-makers who share the same discriminatory views to perpetuate those views in their work.”

This anti-woman bias is apparent in DeVos’ new policy in September rolling back protections for those in public kindergarten through college claiming sexual assault and increasing protections for those accused, the lawsuit says. DeVos said that the Obama administration hadn’t ensured the rights of the accused. Before revising the federal guidelines, DeVos criticized the Obama administration for toughing the campus sexual assault policy in 2011, calling it “shameful” and “wholly un-American.” DeVos raised the standard of proof for accusers from a “preponderance of evidence” to “clear and convincing evidence.” The new guidelines also allow even cases of sexual assault to be settled by mediation. The suit argues that DeVos and Candace Jackson, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, hold “discriminatory stereotypes” about women and are convinced that many who report sexual abuse or assault “misunderstood a harmless romantic advance,” are lying or just came to regret a “consensual sexual encounter.”An Instagram post by former Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin prompted a private Los Angeles area high school to shut down Friday as authorities worked to understand the somewhat cryptic message.

The LA Times reports police took Martin into custody for questioning Friday.

Harvard-Westlake School informed students it was closing “out of an abundance of caution” in an email Friday morning, adding, “we believe there is no imminent threat to our campuses or our school community.”

Martin, a graduate of the high school, shared a photo of a shotgun and a handful of shells on his Instagram story Friday morning, along with the caption, “When you’re a bully victim and a coward, your options are suicide or revenge.”

Martin tagged four people, including his former Dolphins teammates Richie Incognito and Mike Pouncey in the post, referencing both the high school and the Dolphins in text overlaying the image of the shotgun.

In 2013, Martin accused Incognito and Pouncey of aggressively bullying other players in the Dolphins locker room. A subsequent independent NFL investigation confirmed their misconduct, and Incognito was suspended for the remainder of the season.

After Martin suffered a back injury and retired from the league in 2015, he disclosed he has dealt with depression and has tried to kill himself several times. He detailed his struggle in a post on Facebook, saying he hoped it might help other struggling kids “know that they aren’t alone.”WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he will leave it to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to settle a security clearance dispute involving son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner, but left little doubt he wants the case settled in a way that allows Kushner to keep his job.

Problems with security clearance for White House aides surfaced this month in fallout over the abrupt resignation of White House staff secretary Rob Porter over allegations of domestic abuse against two former wives.

Kushner is one of dozens of aides operating under an interim clearance, not yet fully cleared due to complications in their backgrounds. In the case of Kushner, a wealthy New York businessman, his financial links have taken a long time to examine.

Kelly a week ago set Friday as the deadline for adjudicating the cases of Kushner and others in clearance limbo. A source familiar with the matter said earlier this week that the situation had caused tensions between Kushner and Kelly.

Trump, at a joint news conference with visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, said: “General Kelly respects Jared a lot and General Kelly will make that call” on how to resolve the issue.

With Kelly seated nearby, Trump said: “I have no doubt he will make the right decision.”

Trump heaped praise on Kushner, a leader in the administration’s attempts to resurrect moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. He noted that Kushner does not receive a salary.

Two weeks ago, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein called White House Counsel Donald McGahn to inform him that additional information was required from Kushner that would further delay his security clearance process.

White House officials have been trying to smooth over the dispute in a way that would allow Kushner to continue his work, the source familiar with the matter said.

The source said there were frustrations on both sides between Kushner and Kelly and they wanted to find a solution.

Trump has the option of simply granting a security clearance to Kushner, but officials wanted to avoid that option. There was no sense that Kushner would be leaving his job.

Options included giving Kushner a lesser clearance that would allow him to keep doing his job.

Kelly said in a statement on Thursday that he would not comment on anyone’s specific security clearance situation.The Republican National Committee used Twitter to ask people to tell President Donald Trump their priorities on Friday night.

And it provoked a series of curt responses.

“The President is listening,” the tweet read. “Let him know your priorities here.”

It invited people to click on a link to the GOP’s official website, where they could fill in a 32-question survey featuring questions such as: “Are you concerned by the potential spread of Sharia Law?” and “Is Russia a concern to you?”

On completing the questionnaire, it linked to a donation page on Trump’s official website, which asked folks to “please take the next step and consider making a contribution to help us enact our America First agenda and fend off vicious attacks.”

A small group of evangelical Christian leaders is hoping to promote stricter gun legislation by injecting a key element of conservative Christian theology into the conversation ― the principle of protecting life at all stages.

In the wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last week that left 17 people dead, the group has put forward a petition that uses the language of the anti-abortion movement to encourage fellow Christians to fight for gun reform.

The signers claim it’s their “Biblical responsibility” to urge America’s lawmakers to pass common-sense gun legislation that will “protect life.” Though the meaning of “common-sense” varies for individuals in the group, they’re generally looking for tighter background checks, ensuring that certain high-risk individuals are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and potentially banning certain high-capacity and semi-automatic weapons.

The petition has the backing of at least 16 evangelical leaders, including Max Lucado, the best-selling Christian author, Lynne Hybels, co-founder of the Illinois megachurch Willow Creek Community Church, and Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition.

Because of his background as a militant anti-abortion activist, Schenck is a controversial figure in progressive circles. Some have questioned his commitment to gun control, given his past statements and lifetime membership in the National Rifle Association ― which Schenck justifies by saying it was a gift from a financial supporter of his ministry and something he uses to “listen and learn” about the ideologies of those involved in popular gun culture.

But he says he’s modified his stance on gun legislation and become an ally in the fight for stricter gun laws. For years, he’s tried to encourage his faith community to break from its longstanding support of gun rights.

It’s a difficult task, but Schenck is optimistic. “I believe there is a change happening among evangelicals,” the preacher told HuffPost. “We will see a tipping point when many evangelicals will begin advocating for sensible gun safety measures.”

The ‘Prayers And Action’ Campaign

Schenck’s petition for gun reform started circulating in the evangelical community after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, last November. It was released widely on Monday and has gathered over 200 signatures by Friday, according to the campaign’s site. Only a handful of those names are publicly listed on the site. The rest of the signatures are being funneled into a database that will be used to keep signers up to date with future actions, Schenck said.

The pastor told HuffPost that he wants to keep the petition an “evangelical family matter” and is hesitant to expose the signers to criticism from the larger faith community. His first purpose is to “find friends” in the community who care about gun reform.

And he thinks framing gun reform as an effort to “protect life” could help swing the conversation for evangelical Christians.

“Evangelicals believe deeply in the sanctity of every human life. Any public policy that contributes to a disregard for human life is a violation of this tenet,” Schenck told HuffPost. “The lives of children are especially precious to God and should always be for Christians.”

A Deep Loyalty To Guns

The task of rallying evangelical support for stricter gun control legislation is bound to be an uphill battle. As a whole, white American evangelicals are some of the strongest supporters of gun rights. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 41 percent of white evangelicals own guns, more than members of other faith groups.

Pew could not break out black evangelical Protestants in the survey, due to a small sample size. However, the researchers did conclude that only 29 percent of a larger category, black Protestants, own a gun. (An estimated two-thirds of black Protestants identify as evangelicals.)

White evangelicals are more likely than most Americans to say that their right to own guns is essential to their sense of freedom (70 percent vs. 47 percent). Twenty-four percent of black Protestants said the same. White evangelicals also said that they are satisfied with gun laws in this country (44 percent). Sixteen percent of black Protestants agreed.

In addition, a 2013 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute found that many evangelicals don’t see a contradiction in labeling themselves “pro-life” while opposing gun control. In fact, among the white evangelical Protestants who said the term “pro-life” described them very well, a majority (64 percent) also said they opposed stricter gun control laws.

Schenck’s experiences have taught him that for many evangelicals, guns are a “volatile issue.” He believes evangelicals’ loyalty towards guns stems from deep-seated distrust of the government.

“Evangelicals have long felt like a persecuted minority, even though we enjoy some of the largest, most influential, and wealthiest churches and institutions in the country. This misperception makes many in my community fearful of government oppression,” he said.

“There is a deep emotional and psychological bond between people that are fearful and the instruments they feel will protect them, their loved ones, and their way of life,” Schenck told HuffPost.

“There is a deep emotional and psychological bond between people that are fearful and the instruments they feel will protect them, their loved ones, and their way of life.” - Rev. Rob Schenck

A Broader ‘Pro-Life’ Movement

At the same time, Schenck senses that a change is brewing in some communities ― people are becoming increasingly concerned and anxious about gun violence, particularly mass shootings.

“More and more voices calling for restrictions on gun access are being heard. We are trying to curate those voices and give them a united platform to speak from,” Schenck told HuffPost about his campaign.

“We’ve been actively reaching out to evangelical leaders, mostly behind the scenes, and are finding many that are distressed by our seemingly unrestrained enthusiasm for easy gun access — and the perception that all evangelicals have a kind of bloodlust for firearms,” he added. “That’s not true, particularly when it comes to under-40 evangelicals and their pastors.”

Kathryn Freeman, director of public policy for the ethics commission of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, is one of the evangelical leaders who publicly signed Schenck’s petition (although she pointed out she is not speaking on behalf of her organization). Freeman says she believes in working to support human flourishing “from the womb to the tomb.” For her, that includes supporting “common-sense gun legislation.”

“I am concerned about gun violence in this country, because I think to do nothing is to devalue human life, to treat that which God deems of ultimate value as of no value at all,” the Baptist leader told HuffPost. “Reducing gun violence is part of what it means to love God’s people and want them to flourish.”

For These Strange Bedfellows, The Ends Justify The Means

Over the years, Schenck has gone through an evolution in his views about gun reform. When he first began speaking up about this issue, he didn’t think the answer to gun violence would be found in more federal laws. In 2015, he claimed it wasn’t an issue about “gun control, but of self-control.”

Today, Schenck says he’s still hesitant about the phrase “gun control,” since it suggests to gun owners that the government is seeking to “control” their personal behavior. He prefers the phrase “gun regulation.”

He’s also hesitant about pushing for more federal controls, preferring that local and state governments take the lead. But he told HuffPost he now realizes that there are important instances when federal laws are needed ― such as when it comes to closing the gun show loophole and making sure all firearm purchases are routed through federal background checks.

“You have to deal with reality and the reality is that in many of these instances, the only remedy is on the federal level. I’ve acquiesced to that,” he said.

Lucy McBath is a faith and outreach leader for the gun control advocacy groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She told HuffPost she’s known and worked with Schenck for about four years. The pair were the subjects of the documentary “Armor of Light,” a 2015 documentary about the evangelical response to gun violence.

McBath identifies as an evangelical Christian herself, but supports women’s right to make their own choices about their reproductive health. Although she and Schenck don’t see eye to eye on abortion, McBath said she supports Schenck’s efforts to rally the evangelical community around gun control. Not everyone in her movement is going to be happy with that stance, she said, but she believes people on opposite ends of the political spectrum are going to need to come together to try to solve the issue of gun violence.

“What I like to say to people is we need everybody,” McBath told HuffPost. “We need gun owners, we need non-gun owners, we need people of faith, people of no faith. We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue. We all have to be able to come to some common ground to work together to make sure we’re changing this dangerous gun culture.”

“We need everybody because gun violence is a nonpartisan issue.” - Lucy McBath

Other gun control advocates seem to agree. The Rev. Jim Atwood, a board member of Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and a retired Presbyterian minister, said that he would welcomes the activism of Schenck and other evangelical Christians who want to fight for gun reform.

“I can’t speak for everybody but I would think that’s what we need to do,” Atwood told HuffPost. “We need to cross boundaries, cross lines of different political entities and work together.”

Looking at the list of prominent evangelicals who have publicly signed Schenck’s petition, McBath said she’s excited about the potential in that group. In her years as an activist, she said she’s never seen this level of support from evangelical leaders.

McBath hopes to see more of it.

“We need to see this kind of solidarity across denominational lines,” she said. “Because the end goal is saving lives.”

A Growing Sense Of Urgency

Dr. Jamie Aten, one of the signers of Schenck’s petition, is the executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian institution. In that role, Aten helps churches prepare to respond to disasters in their communities, including mass shootings.

In the past, he said that he tried to avoid controversial topics like this. But now he believes that “silence only divides people further.”

“I think we owe it to the victims and survivors of mass shootings, and to each other, to do what we can to try and prevent this from happening again and prioritizing that in our policies,” Aten said.

After the shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs, congregations around the country grew increasingly worried about security. But unless sensible gun laws are passed, Aten worries that churches’ preparedness efforts will fall short. As it stands, he believes evangelical Christians’ affinity for gun culture “does more to protect our fear than it does the lives of innocent people.”

Rev. Dr. Joel Hunter, a former megachurch pastor from Florida who served as one of President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers, also signed Schenck’s petition. He believes that a “pro-life ethic” is the key ingredient needed to move the needle on evangelicals’ beliefs about gun control. Hunter is optimistic that more members of his faith community will sign on to Schenck’s campaign after witnessing teenage activists protesting against guns since the Florida school shooting.

“I think the connection will be made, the more carnage that is accumulated,” Hunter said. “I think people will begin to see this as a life and death issue.”

Schenck said that as a pastor, he understands the strong emotions that evangelicals associated with gun rights ― particularly the fear they have about any supposed threats to those rights. But in the end, he hopes that his community will be patient and “listen before they judge.”
