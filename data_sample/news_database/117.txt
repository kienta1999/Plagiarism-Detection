Sarah Jessica Parker has officially endorsed her “Sex and the City” co-star and longtime friend Cynthia Nixon in the New York gubernatorial race.

Parker called Nixon “a mother, an activist, an advocate, a fighter, a NY’er, a dear friend” in an impassioned Instagram post on Thursday morning.

Parker famously played Carrie Bradshaw opposite Nixon’s Miranda Hobbes in the HBO dramedy, in which the two were BFFs. Art is now imitating life, with the two supporting each other in the real world as Nixon faces off against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in the state’s primary election, set for September.

In response to Parker’s post, Nixon tweeted out a thank you:

Thank you @SJP, it means so much. ❤️

Previously, Parker’s support of Nixon appeared extremely vague. The New York Post’s Page Six published a statement on Wednesday in which Parker said, “Cynthia has been my friend and colleague since we were little girls. I look forward to talking to her about her New York state gubernatorial bid.”

Most of the primary members of the “Sex and the City” cast have shown their support for Nixon. Kristin Davis, Willie Garson, David Eigenberg and Lynn Cohen have all sent their well-wishes or issued public endorsements on social media.

WASHINGTON ― Seeking to satisfy the demands of Republicans on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly revealed Thursday that a top federal prosecutor has been examining a number of issues that Republicans insist are worthy of attention.

In a letter to several members of Congress who’ve asked for the appointment of a second special counsel in addition to Robert Mueller, Sessions wrote that U.S. Attorney John Huber ― the current top federal prosecutor in Utah ― would be examining several matters identified as priorities by Republicans, such as the FBI’s handling of the Trump-Russia investigation and Hillary Clinton’s ties to a nuclear energy agency.

“I receive regular updates from Mr. Huber and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive his recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,” Sessions wrote.President Donald Trump delivers remarks on the Infrastructure Initiative at the Local 18 Richfield Training Site in Richfield, Ohio, March 29, 2018.

President Donald Trump’s long-stalled infrastructure package is unlikely to happen until after November’s midterm elections, he acknowledged Thursday.

“We’ll probably have to wait until after the election,” Trump said in Richfield, Ohio, during what administration officials billed as a major speech on infrastructure.

It was an admission rooted in political reality and the congressional calendar. Lawmakers are mostly done legislating for the year and are looking to focus on the November elections. Republican leaders, in particular, have been dubious about the prospect of passing another massive spending package.

Trump’s infrastructure proposal, which the White House unveiled earlier this year, seeks to leverage $200 billion in direct federal spending over the next decade into an additional $1.3 trillion for infrastructure development with the aid of state and local tax dollars as well as private investment. The administration has not proposed a way to pay for the initiative.

If there is to be any compromise between Republicans and Democrats on infrastructure, it’ll likely only happen after the election, retiring House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) said last month.

“It could be a lame-duck strategy, that we do it after the election,” Shuster said.

In his speech on Thursday, which touched on not only infrastructure but seemingly every other subject as well, including actress Roseanne Barr and her television show, Trump touted new funding Congress had approved for highways, airports, railroads, and waterways. Those funds were included in a $1.3 trillion budget package he signed earlier this month ― a measure he’d called “ridiculous” and had initially threatened to veto.

Trump also suggested to Congress that his infrastructure plan doesn’t necessarily have to be taken up in one piece.“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert says a lawsuit could mean that President Donald Trump may have to answer under oath some “uncomfortable questions” about his alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.TONIGHT: VA Secretary David Shulkin: OUT

Doctor who’s seen Trump naked: IN pic.twitter.com/PgdkOTYe1I — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) March 29, 2018

Trevor Noah thinks he knows why President Donald Trump wants to promote his doctor, Ronny L. Jackson, to Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” the comedian said it “sort of makes sense.”

“Anyone who’s seen me naked deserves a reward,” said Noah, while mimicking Trump. “So it was either this promotion or paying him $130,000, and I’m never doing that again.”Less than 24 hours after he was fired as Veterans Affairs secretary under the cloud of an ethics scandal, David Shulkin slammed Washington as “toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive” in a scathing op-ed published in The New York Times.

“I have fought to stand up for this great department and all that it embodies,” Shulkin wrote. “In recent months, though, the environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve.”

He continued: “I came to government with an understanding that Washington can be ugly, but I assumed that I could avoid all of the ugliness by staying true to my values.”

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced Shulkin’s termination on Twitter, after weeks of speculation he was on the outs. Trump said he intends to name Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, the presidential physician, to the post.

Shulkin, the lone Democrat in Trump’s Cabinet, was appointed in January 2017 after serving in the Obama administration, though Trump had promised to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Shulkin’s tenure wasn’t without scandal. An inspector general’s investigation concluded he had violated ethics rules with a trip to London and Copenhagen with his wife last summer. The 10-day trip involved only 3-1/2 working days, cost taxpayers $122,334, and included the use of a VA subordinate as “a personal travel concierge” and improper acceptance of free tickets to the Wimbledon tennis match, the inspector general’s report said.

Shulkin pledged to reimburse the government for his wife’s travel costs and make a contribution to the treasury for the value of the Wimbledon tickets.

“I have been falsely accused of things by people who wanted me out of the way,” Shulkin wrote in his op-ed for the Times, blaming administration political appointees “who seek to privatize veteran health care as an alternative to government-run V.A. care.”

“But despite these politically-based attacks on me and my family’s character, I am proud of my record and know that I acted with the utmost integrity. Unfortunately, none of that mattered,” he wrote.

“As I prepare to leave government, I am struck by a recurring thought: It should not be this hard to serve your country.”The new movie, which debuted at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, follows a young Han Solo (Ehrenreich) and his associates Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Glover). On a more personal note, it gave Glover what he describes as a “full circle” moment with his young son, Legend.

The actor reveals that his very first toy was the original action figure version of Lando. Now, Legend is the proud owner of a Lando action figure in his father’s likeness.

“It’s super weird to me, because I gave it to my son,” Glover said. “His mom is always being like, ‘Who’s that?’ And he’s like, ‘Oh, this is Daddy.’ Daddy’s, like, riding a horse made out of Play-Doh.”

Witnessing his son play with an action figure of Dad, Glover said, was “weird, but beautiful.”A voter and her daughter cast a ballot in North Las Vegas during the 2016 presidential election.

By Matt Vasilogambros

Tucked away in the massive $1.3 trillion spending bill President Donald Trump signed last week is a nugget of funding that local election officials have desperately needed. Unfortunately, they say, it isn’t nearly enough.

Congress set aside $380 million that will be divvied up among states to shore up election security, including new software, cybersecurity staff and other protections for state registration databases and aging voting equipment. But while the funding is certainly welcomed by local election officials, many of them warn it falls far short of what they need to deal with the potential security challenges of the midterm elections in November.

It’s only “a drop in the bucket of what is really needed,” said Jeff Greenburg, the director of elections in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is one of 41 states where some counties and cities use election equipment that is more than a decade old, according to the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. Older machines are more likely to malfunction or break down on Election Day, causing long lines and potentially dissuading some people from casting their ballots. Some older machines also are susceptible to wireless malware attacks, even if they are not directly connected to the internet, or have removable memory devices a hacker might manipulate.

Pennsylvania is also one of 13 states where some counties use voting machines that lack a paper record. Paper records are essential to having a secure election, said Larry Norden, the deputy director of the Brennan Center’s democracy program. They can ensure an accurate audit if electronic records of vote tallies are compromised.

During the 2016 presidential election, Russian hackers targeted election systems in Pennsylvania and 20 other states, according to U.S. intelligence officials. Those officials fear that, during the 2018 midterms, hackers may target state voter registration databases, county websites and official social media accounts to spread misinformation and sow doubt in the U.S. election system.

In February, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, directed all counties that are planning to update aging election equipment to buy machines that create a paper trail. However, the directive from Wolf, aimed at machines used by 83 percent of the state’s voters, did not come with funding attached, placing the financial burden on federal or local budgets.

It could cost as much as $79 million to replace paperless machines in Pennsylvania, the Brennan Center estimates. With the Trump-signed spending bill, the state is only expected to receive $13.5 million, covering just 17 percent of the estimated costs. Barring a new proposal at the state level, counties would have to foot the rest of the bill.

“If they want to make any real dent in the cost to replace an election system,” Greenburg said, “this is woefully insufficient.”

His county of 72,000 mostly middle-class registered voters in western Pennsylvania uses paperless voting machines, which officials there purchased in 2006. Replacing its current voting machines would cost between $750,000 and $2.5 million, depending on the type of equipment — a hefty bill for a county like his, Greenburg said.

‘It’s Killing Us’

Kim McKiernan, the registrar of voters in Rappahannock County, Virginia, knows all too well the burden of replacing election equipment in a very small county without state and federal support.

With just two months left in the 2017 gubernatorial race, Virginia’s Board of Elections in September ordered all counties that use touchscreen voting machines to replace them with paper ballots and optical scanners before Election Day. The state provided no financial assistance.

Rappahannock County was one of the 22 local jurisdictions in the state that used a paperless voting system. The small community with 5,600 registered voters, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, quickly set aside $53,000 to purchase eight new machines, calibrate the equipment and train poll workers.

McKiernan and her assistant — the only two election officials in the county — pulled off the quick transition, but it was a struggle.

“It’s killing us,” she said. “Mentally and physically, it’s killing us.”

In California, Debbie Bautista, Tuolumne County’s clerk and auditor-controller, is worried her 13-year-old voting machines won’t last much longer. The ones that still do work often require repairs.

It would cost about $200,000 for the small county to update its voting equipment, Bautista said. But the county, which has 32,000 mostly lower-income registered voters, seems unwilling to make that investment, she said, preferring instead to spend money on a new jail and juvenile center.

“We don’t have the money,” she said. “Even though people believe elections are important, they have a hard time justifying the money to run them.”

Bautista is hopeful some funds may trickle down from the state level in the coming months. In his budget, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown allocated $134 million to help pay for new voting equipment — about half of what counties need statewide. The state Legislature has until June to reach a budget agreement.

“There’s just no finish line in this race,” said Neal Kelley, the registrar of voters for Orange County, California.

With the investment from the state, Kelley said his county of 1.6 million registered voters may get new equipment in 2019. Though it is wealthy, the county has been using the same 11,000 voting machines since 2004.

Finally Getting Support

Joe Gloria, the registrar of voters for Clark County, Nevada, started seeing some of his voting machines break down around five years ago. If the problems continued, he feared, the public might lose confidence in statewide elections.

So, in 2015, he began lobbying the state to help fund updated election equipment. His county, the largest in the state, encompasses Las Vegas and has more than one million registered voters.

Soon, election officials from all 17 counties in Nevada joined the fight, and in 2017 the state enacted a law setting aside $8 million to update election equipment ahead of the June 2018 primaries.

“Not every county has the resources that we do,” Gloria said. “And I only got a small portion of it.”

Clark County received $4.5 million in a state grant. New election equipment, including 5,000 new voting machines, would cost an additional $12.5 million, for a total of $17 million.

Douglas County, which hugs the southeastern shore of Lake Tahoe, received $250,000 in grant funding from Nevada, which paid for nearly half of the county’s 147 new voting machines. The new machines, which will replace units that have been in service since 2004, produce a secure paper trail.

The state grant “means a lot,” said Kathy Lewis, the clerk-treasurer, even if the county of 37,000 registered voters is one of the more affluent counties in Nevada. It means even more, she said, to the many rural counties who may not have been able to afford upgrades. Esmeralda County, the smallest county in Nevada, has just 600 registered voters.

“Elections aren’t in a vacuum,” she said. “We have some very small counties. If they fail, the whole state fails. It’s something we all have to work together to make sure the integrity is there.”

States such as Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah also enacted legislation in 2017 that allocated money for new election equipment.

Norden, at the Brennan Center, recently lauded the Trump-signed spending bill as an “important down payment,” but said it provided “only a fraction of the necessary funds” for states. The reality is that in a U.S. election system with more than 10,000 separate jurisdictions, local election officials are working on limited funding to make sure their polls are secure.Let us toast actress Hilary Swank for her excellent wine prank.

Advertisement(Reuters) ― Oklahoma’s Senate on Wednesday approved legislation for the first major tax increase in a quarter century to help fund pay raises for teachers and avert a strike.

Low teacher pay in the United States came into focus earlier this month when educators in West Virginia, whose pay is slightly higher than in Oklahoma, held a nine-day strike that ended after they received a 5 percent pay rise.

The Oklahoma measure, which will raise about $450 million to fund increased pay for teachers, school staff and state workers, had already passed the state House and Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin said on Wednesday she would sign it into law.

But the money may not be enough to satisfy the demands of Oklahoma’s teachers, who rank among the worst paid in the United States and had been planning a strike for next week.

“There is still work to do to get this legislature to invest more in our classrooms,” Alicia Priest, president of the Oklahoma Education Association (OEA), the state’s largest teachers union, said in a Facebook post after the Senate vote.

“That work will continue Monday when educators descend on the Capitol”, Priest said.

The tax hikes on cigarettes, fuel, lodging and oil and gas production will fund a $6,100, or 16 percent, pay raise on average for Oklahoma teachers, Fallin said in a statement.

The OEA, which has about 40,000 members, has said it is seeking a $10,000 pay increase over three years for teachers and a $5,000 raise for support personnel.

According to National Education Association estimates for 2016, Oklahoma ranked 48th, followed by Mississippi at 49 and South Dakota at 50, in terms of average U.S. classroom teacher salary.

Oklahoma secondary school teachers had an annual mean wage of $42,460 as of May 2016, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

For the past few years, Oklahoma has battled budget deficits stemming from the 2014 collapse in oil prices that hit its large energy industry and slammed state revenue.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) signed a bill Wednesday that bans youth “conversion therapy,” the medically discredited practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

The new law means licensed health care providers won’t be allowed to use the so-called therapy on anyone under 18.

It’s another win for proponents of LGBTQ rights, who consider the practice to be dangerously abusive.

Eleven states and Washington, D.C., now protect children from conversion therapy, according to The Human Rights Campaign. That figure includes New York state, which does not have a full ban but enacted measures in February 2016 to discourage the practice, forbidding health insurance providers from covering it for anyone under 18.

“Banning conversion therapy sends a loud and unequivocal message to LGBTQ youth: there is nothing wrong with you,” Washington state Sen. Marko Liias (D), the openly gay lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said in a statement.

“As a community, we love and support every person and we celebrate the diversity that makes us stronger. I am proud that Washington is standing up for our queer youth and I look forward to the day that these monstrous practices are illegal in every state,” he said.

An estimated 20,000 LGBTQ teens now ages 13 to 17 will undergo conversion therapy from a licensed health care professional in states with no protections, according to The Williams Institute at UCLA’s School of Law.“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert said many people are worried that President Donald Trump appointed an “unstable lunatic” when he named John Bolton his new national security advisor.

Carvey’s version of Bolton drinks shampoo, makes wild threats and talks to his mustache ... which grows throughout the segment:Wisconsin Republicans have ended their legal fight to wait until November to conduct elections for two vacant legislative seats.

The seats ― one in the state Assembly, the other in the state Senate ― have been vacant since December when the Republicans holding them resigned to take jobs in the administration of Gov. Scott Walker (R). Walker said he wouldn’t call special elections, and instead allow the seats to be filled in the regularly scheduled votes in November to save the state money.

Democrats sued Walker over that refusal, saying he was violating a state law requiring that special elections be called as promptly as possible for vacancies. A state circuit court judge sided with them on March 22, giving the governor until noon Thursday to schedule the special elections.

Walker twice appealed that decision and asked for more time, as Republican legislative leaders called lawmakers back for a special session to try to change the state law. A judge denied Walker’s request, and the governor decided Wednesday not to appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court.

The judge ruled that “representative government and the election of our representatives are never ‘unnecessary,’ never a ‘waste of taxpayer resources.’”

On Thursday, Walker issued an executive order scheduling the special elections. The primaries will be on May 15 and the general election on June 12. The seats will again be on the ballot in November. Wisconsin Republicans, meanwhile, announced they would drop their attempt to change the state law on special elections.

Democrats had accused Walker of refusing to call the special elections out of fear Republicans would lose the seats. In January, a Democrat won a surprising victory in a state Senate district President Donald Trump won by over 20 percentage points in 2016. Walker called the Democratic victory a “wake up call” for Republicans.

Walker said in a Thursday radio interview that the special elections would be “meaningless” because whoever wins the June contest will serve for just a few months, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

In a series of tweets Thursday, Walker blamed former Attorney General Eric Holder and other Democrats for forcing the issue on the special elections. Holder is the chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is affiliated with the National Redistricting Foundation, the group that brought the lawsuit on the matter.

Amy Hasenberg, a Walker spokeswoman, said in a statement Thursday that a special election would just be duplicative.

“A D.C.-based special interest group is forcing taxpayers to pay for special elections for seats that will be filled again in just a few short months,” she said. “The Legislature has indicated they are done. To illustrate how ridiculous this is, nomination papers for the fall elections are due on June 1, which means candidates will already be on the November ballot before the special elections are held.”

State Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R) said Thursday Walker was “boxed in” and risked being held in contempt of court if he didn’t call for the special elections, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.

State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, the chamber’s Democratic leader, celebrated the call for elections.

“There is nothing more fundamental to our democracy than the right to vote. Despite Gov. Walker’s best attempt to block elections and deny 200,000 voters their constitutional right to representation, justice prevailed and the courts correctly ruled that Republicans can’t ignore the law,” she said in a statement.

″This is a victory for the citizens of Wisconsin who are without representation because of Governor Walker’s refusal to do his job,” Holder said.Now this could be delectably adorable.

Film giants Disney and Pixar will be premiering an animated short about an aging mom in a Chinese immigrant community in Canada and a “lively, giggly dumpling boy,” according to a press release on the project. “Bao” is scheduled to come out this summer attached to the release of “Incredibles 2.” What’s more, it’s the first original Pixar short to be directed by a woman, Domee Shi.

In the short, the mother grapples with empty nest syndrome, the release says. When one of her dumplings comes to life, she’s afforded another chance at motherhood but soon learns that the dumpling child, like most things in life, won’t stay “cute and small forever.”

Ultimately the film “explores the ups and downs of the parent-child relationship through the colorful, rich, and tasty lens of the Chinese immigrant community in Canada,” the statement says.

Domee Shi, the director of the short, is an immigrant herself. She was born in Chongqing, China and lived in Toronto, Canada, for much of her life. The story, the release notes, draws from Shi’s experiences as an only child living in Toronto’s Chinese community.

AdvertisementKeiynan Lonsdale has followed up his already acclaimed performance in the movie “Love, Simon” by releasing a new song with a similarly queer-inclusive theme.

Lonsdale told Billboard that “Kiss the Boy” ― which debuted Wednesday on YouTube, Spotify and other streaming platforms ― was inspired by “Kiss the Girl” from Disney’s “The Little Mermaid,” as well as his role in “Love, Simon.”

The 26-year-old actor-singer plays Bram, a high school soccer jock and one of several possible love interests for the movie’s closeted gay protagonist, Simon (Nick Robinson). The film has earned near-universal praise from critics and fans as Hollywood’s first mainstream coming-of-age comedy to center on a gay teen.

“I had so much to draw off,” Lonsdale said, “with the movie, my own personal life and every relationship I’d been in, and other people’s stories that they’d told me.”

The lyrics are reflective of Lonsdale’s experience as an openly bisexual man.

So.. I wrote a song about love, & it’s out now everywhere :) I hope you feel it. #KissTheBoy https://t.co/ysGJmF39Lk 💖🌈 pic.twitter.com/49n3gjfae6 — Keiynan Lonsdale 🌈 (@KeiynanLonsdale) March 28, 2018

“If you wanna kiss the boy, then you better kiss the boy right now,” he sings. “And you ain’t gotta be afraid of the words you wanna say right now, ’cause love is a game we deserve to play out loud.” (Catch the lyrics video for the song, which features many real-life young LGBTQ couples, above.)

Lonsdale, who came out publicly as bisexual after “Love, Simon” wrapped, has been in the midst of a creative blitz. He’s slated to join the CW’s “Legends of Tomorrow” as a series regular this year and is currently at work on a full-length album that will feature “Kiss the Boy.”

The rest of the album won’t shy away from the subject of his sexuality either, he said.UPDATE: 11 a.m. ― Sarah Jessica Parker on Thursday shed her neutral tone on Cynthia Nixon’s candidacy, wholeheartedly endorsing her “Sex and the City” costar’s run for New York governor. “My sister on and off screen, you have my love, support and vote,” Parker wrote.

PREVIOUSLY:

This could get awkward.

Nixon last week announced she would oppose Democratic incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a September primary, prompting quick and enthusiastic reactions from “SATC” castmates Kristin Davis (Charlotte) and Willie Garson (Stanford Blatch).

But in a statement Wednesday to the New York Post’s Page Six, Parker doesn’t appear on board ― at least yet.

“Cynthia has been my friend and colleague since we were little girls,” she said through a spokeswoman. “I look forward to talking to her about her New York state gubernatorial bid.”

Another costar, Kim Cattrall (Samantha), doesn’t appear ready to join Team Nixon, either, saying last week: “I support & respect any former colleague’s right to make their own career choices.”

According to People, Nixon said all three of her former costars in “SATC’s” fictional quartet of women have “expressed love, support and excitement” about her political aspirations.SACRAMENTO, Calif. ― Hundreds of mourners gathered in California’s capital on Thursday, to honor the life of 22-year-old Stephon Clark ― an unarmed black man shot and killed by police.

Two Sacramento police fatally shot Clark, a father of two, on March 18 outside of his grandparents’ home after neighbors had called police to investigate someone hiding in one of their backyards. Footage from both police body cameras and helicopter coverage showed officers opening fire on Clark; they later said they mistook his cell phone for a gun. Clark was shot 20 times.

On Thursday morning, Clark’s funeral in south Sacramento was held open to the public.

Long before the funeral was set to begin, mourners had already lined up down the block of the Bayside of South Sacramento Church. Some of the attendees had driven hours to attend the funeral. Many of those in line were Muslim, coming to pay their respects to a fellow member of their religious community.

In a funeral program, Clark was described as a young man who loved sports, had a “great sense of humor” and was the “life of the party.”

As the funeral began just before noon, several religious leaders took the podium to read from Christian scripture, the Old Testament and the Quran.

“Only Stephon could bring together all races and religions in one room,” one speaker said.

At one point, a speaker was interrupted by Clark’s brother Stevante, who took to the podium and in an emotional call to the crowd, yelled: “I am!”

“Stephon Clark!” the mourners yelled back.

As Rev. Al Sharpton took the stage to deliver his eulogy, he began by repeating Stevante’s call: “I am!”

“We will never let you forget the name of Stephon Clark until we get justice,” Sharpton said. “Because this brother could be any one of us.”

Sharpton had told reporters ahead of the service that the country should think of Clark’s killing as a national issue, not a local one.

“The community has come together to say that we cannot have unarmed people shot by the people we trust to protect and serve,” Sharpton continued. “Look at what we’ve seen all over the country. The president needs to address it. Congress needs to address it.”

“We need to deal with this issue and deal with it nationally,” he added.

PBS News Hour

De Angelo Wilson and Ken Ken, who are both from Sacramento and attended the service, said they grew up with Clark and remembered Clark fondly as “an energetic kid.”

William, a cousin of Clark’s father who declined to give his last name, told HuffPost that Clark was “a good kid,” but that it’s hard to be perfect “when you come from where we come from.”

Clark’s death, one of several high-profile killings of black Sacramento men in the last two years, sparked fierce protests across California’s state capital. Alongside local activists, Clark’s family and friends have shut down Interstate 5, blocked entrance to Sacramento Kings games, disrupted city council meetings and demonstrated outside District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert’s office.

“They didn’t have to kill him like that. They didn’t have to shoot him this many times,” said Sequita Thompson, Clark’s grandmother, on Tuesday in Sacramento.

“If you’re that scared, you don’t need to be a police officer,” Tanya Faison, the founder of the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter, said while protesting outside the DA’s office on Wednesday.

BLM and members of the Sacramento community are calling for the firing of the two police officers (who are currently on paid administrative leave). They also want more power and resources given to the Sacramento Community Police Review Commission, a community-led group that reviews police policy, standards, and behavior and provides feedback to the city.

Activists say Clark’s shooting is indicative of excessive force used against the black community, and the continued lack of justice for victims of police violence and their families. (On Tuesday, for example, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry announced that the police officers who killed Alton Sterling in the summer of 2016 would not face charges.)

The Sacramento BLM chapter is calling to change “use of force” laws practiced by the Sacramento Police Department that broadly allow police officers to whatever amount of force they deem “necessary under the circumstances.” According to Faison, they are “too subjective.” Other groups, like the NAACP, have also condemned the practice.

Faison and other community members are also calling to re-elect a new DA in this year’s election, saying that Schubert is not doing enough work for the black community.

The incident also inspired outcry on a national scale. Protests have sprung up in other cities across the country, including New York and Phoenix. Prominent black celebrities, activists and influencers have amplified the calls for justice for Clark.

California’s Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it would join the investigation into Clark’s death, and also review SPD’s policies and practices.“As a young corporate attorney I saw my role as the protector of the BET brand and its employees, and today, more than 32 years later, I still see myself as the protector and defender of a brand that I have helped to grow as a top destination for audiences across the globe,” Lee, who was hired in 1986 as the company’s first vice president and general counsel, said in the announcement.

She was promoted to president and chief operating officer in 1996 and was made chairman and CEO in 2005, according to Variety.

“Debra’s vision and creativity has cemented BET Networks as a premiere network for African Americans and lovers of black culture,” said Bob Bakish, president and chief executive of Viacom, BET’s parent company. “As BET continues to move forward, we will always be grateful to Debra for her leadership and commitment to creating top-notch entertainment that both entertains and empowers.”

Bakish has overseen several executive changes at BET since he became Viacom’s chief executive in late 2016, the Los Angeles Times notes.

Zola Mashariki, the head of original programming, was fired in April 2017 while she was on medical leave for breast cancer treatment, Variety reported at the time. She sued the company, alleging gender discrimination, and settled out of court. Stephen Hill also stepped down as president of programming last year.

Lee, who has been the face of BET for three decades, has kept the network No. 1 in the ratings with black viewers for 17 years, according to The Hollywood Reporter. She oversaw the addition of such programs as “The Game,” “Being Mary Jane,” “Real Husbands of Hollywood” and “In Contempt.”

Lee plans to keep working on corporate and nonprofit boards, and to continue her work with the Time’s Up movement and the Recording Academy Diversity and Inclusion Task Force, according to BET’s statement.Warning! Spoilers for “Black Panther,” “Infinity War” and whatever else below.

Just a couple of months ago (yeah, it was that recently), “Black Panther” was obliterating the box office. News of a sequel hit the internet, to a chorus of “Wakanda Forever.”

Then “Avengers: Infinity War” happened, and forever wasn’t what it used to be.

In perhaps the most unexpected of many expectation-destroying moments in the new film, the king himself, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), crumbles to ashes as a result of Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his widely analyzed finger snap. We were all like, “Wakanda movie is this?”

Nate Moore, a development and production executive at Marvel Studios, as well as a producer on “Black Panther,” recently told HuffPost that he learned a while ago that “Infinity War” directors Anthony and Joe Russo planned to kill off T’Challa. In fact, he knew T’Challa would turn to dust way back when “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler was still working on his 2015 film “Creed.”

Even then, the decision was perplexing. Moore said he initially asked the Russo brothers to hold off on murdering the Black Panther.

“I knew pretty well what they were talking about and personally urged them to reconsider,” Moore said over the phone earlier this month. “But the storytelling made sense, so I love that we got to see a little bit more of Wakanda in that film, and I hope to see how they’re going to resolve that.”

Moore added that it was difficult to argue with the Russos’ reasoning, though he didn’t elaborate on the specifics of their stance.

“Touching on all the different ideas you can have, you talk about the pros and cons of each, and they had some really compelling arguments as to why what happened happened,” Moore said. “I think ultimately it made for a really interesting, almost more complicated ending to that film because of how well ‘Black Panther’ was embraced by audiences. Again, personally painful, but I understand the reasoning.”

The Russo brothers have said the decision to kill ― or not kill ― particular “Infinity War” characters was story-driven, but that wasn’t enough of an explanation for me. I recently got the chance to ask them: Why T’Challa? Did they ever consider changing their position after seeing how successful “Black Panther” had become?

Well, let’s just say they were resolute.

“We were very cued into the storyline of Panther from his origins in ‘Captain America: Civil War,’” Anthony Russo said. “The role that Panther and Wakanda played in this movie was sort of a bedrock of the movie, a bedrock of the [Marvel cinematic universe]. I think ‘Black Panther’ could’ve done half the business that it did and it still would’ve been a valid creative choice.”

“One thing we talked a lot about was the notion of legacy and what it means to be African-American and be so disconnected to the place you are from.” - Nate Moore, development and production executive at Marvel Studios

Of course, there’s a strong likelihood the superhero isn’t gone for good, given the “Black Panther” sequel that’s in the works. Will a Quantum Realm reality bring T’Challa back? Or will Shuri (Letitia Wright), T’Challa’s sister, become the next Black Panther, as some fans are already speculating?

During the rest of our interview, Moore talked about the various possibilities ― and answered some of my most pressing questions: Was Beyoncé secretly on the “Black Panther” soundtrack? Could Kendrick Lamar be in the “Black Panther” sequel? What should we make of Chadwick Boseman’s supposed “Wakanda Forever” fatigue?

Where did that “Wakanda Forever” sign come from?

It was something that Chadwick and Ryan came up with in rehearsal, and there weren’t a ton of variations. It sort of just seems to make intuitive sense. I have to say, initially, I think the first time they did it was in tribal council, and part of me was like, “Is that going to look cool?” [Laughs] “Is that going to be cool or are people going to reject it?” But the more that it was used, the more it sort of almost felt like it had always been.

It’s one of those decisions you always forget when it happened, and it just felt so natural and so a part of the fabric of the movie. Chadwick ― I think, because he developed it with Ryan ― owns it. Everything Chadwick does just feels real, so by the end of [the film shoot], extras were doing it, crew members were doing it to each other. Everyone was doing and that’s when you know, OK, this is something that’s going to resonate.

The cast gets asked to do it a lot. Have you seen the memes of Chadwick doing Wakanda Forever and not looking as enthusiastic?

Yeah, I’m not surprised, because you have to do it quite a bit. But also my friends will send me, like, soccer players doing it now. It’s made its way into pop culture, which I think is amazing.

chadwick really went from “wakanda forever” to “wakanda sometimes” pic.twitter.com/laFcFumZKA — kay’s ashes (@spiderIy) May 14, 2018

What part of “Black Panther” changed the most from the script to what we saw?

The adventure outside of Wakanda used to be much longer. After they went to Korea, they went a couple of other places. T’Challa, Nakia and Okoye [went] and sort of explored the theme of what it means to be African and African-American in the world a bit more. We just had to pare back honestly because of the amount of time we knew the film would take even with just what you saw on screen.

There were definitely some great story ideas that we had to leave on the table and hopefully we get to revisit someday, just to keep the story as focused as possible on T’Challa and Killmonger. I think there are even sequences we boarded that were super cool that we didn’t have time for, and that’s a good sign on my end when you have too much story.

Kendrick Lamar said he wanted to be a villain in the sequel. I mean, what do you think?

[Laughs] That would be amazing. I love Kendrick Lamar, and his music is such a big part of the film. Yeah, I think if it’s right, it’s right. We can do a lot worse than Kendrick Lamar in one of our films.

There was a rumor Beyoncé was secretly on one of Kendrick Lamar’s tracks. Can we finally put that to rest?

You can finally put that to rest. That is not true.

Why do you go to that wide shot at the end when Killmonger dies?

One thing we talked a lot about was the notion of legacy and what it means to be African-American and be so disconnected to the place you are from. That wide shot and that scene with T’Challa and Killmonger at the end was really about Killmonger appreciating this place that he almost felt like he was never going to go to and seeing the sunset that his father promised him years before and passing on almost peacefully, as violent as that final act was. Sort of being reunited with his ancestry in that final moment and pulling back that wide to get the peace of that, the restfulness of that, even though it is him saying goodbye.

We thought that was really interesting. Wakanda is a beautiful place and for him to be at rest there was sort of fitting, even though he is the villain. Even though his message was wrong, it is time for him to be at rest.

I was kind of pulling for Killmonger to make it through.

A lot of people were, which I think is the sign of a great villain ― someone you can identify with, who has a real point of view that is not “I want to take over the world” or “I want all the money in the world,” but is about something thematic.

Again, that is something that Ryan Coogler pitched. That is something he should get full credit for, and I think is partially why the film resonates so much. You can see both sides. For the first time, what I thought was interesting is the notion that Killmonger actually changes T’Challa. The notion that the hero learns from the villain and changes because of the interaction with him is really powerful, and I don’t think something that we have done.

With T’Challa gone, everyone’s already speculating about Shuri taking over as Black Panther. What do you think?

That’s what I think is so great about comics and the Marvel cinematic universe. As you know, the notion of Black Panther is a mantle almost as much as the character, so there’s a lot of ways to explore great ideas for a “Panther” sequel that won’t invalidate what happened in “Infinity War,” and that gets us excited, just the breadth of stories you can tell, which is great.

This interview was lightly edited for length and clarity.Far-right provocateur Laura Loomer was kicked out of the federal courthouse in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday. Laura Loomer

ORLANDO, Fla. — A far-right provocateur on Thursday was escorted from the federal courthouse where the Pulse nightclub shooter’s widow, Noor Salman, awaits a jury’s verdict on charges of aiding the mass shooting.

Laura Loomer’s media credentials were revoked the previous day after she harassed the defendant’s family outside the courthouse with questions about Muslims, jihad and Easter. She returned on Thursday and was removed by a U.S. marshal.

Salman, the 31-year-old widow of Pulse gunman Omar Mateen, is charged with aiding and abetting the attack and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to the FBI. She has pleaded not guilty, and maintains she was in the dark about her husband’s plans. Her lawyers say she was another of his victims, not his co-conspirator. The jury is currently deliberating.

After closing arguments on Wednesday, Salman’s family stood outside the federal courthouse to address the media. A reporter asked what Salman will do if she is found not guilty.

“She will return to California to be with her son,” replied Susan Clary, the family spokesperson. Referring to Salman’s son, the spokesperson added: “He was asking if she was going to be home to color Easter eggs. I’m not sure whether that’s quite possible ― we can be hopeful about that.”

“You said her son wants to color Easter eggs ― but isn’t Noor Salman Muslim? Why is she celebrating Easter?” Loomer asked.

“We believe in all religions,” Salman’s cousin, Susan Adieh, said.

Loomer continued pushing. “Do most Muslims color Easter eggs?” she asked.

“I’m a Muslim and my kids, they color Easter eggs,” Adieh replied.

As the family walked across the street and into the parking lot, Loomer followed, recording with her phone. She repeatedly asked them if jihad means an act of Islamic terrorism. Clary, the family spokesperson, said they weren’t making any more comments.

“She stuck her phone in their faces,” Clary said of Loomer.

An email from the court later in the day said a reporter had lost their media credentials and was banned from the courthouse after engaging “in highly inappropriate behavior with the Defendant’s family members outside the courthouse.”

I was just escorted our w/ force from the Orlando federal court house by a US Marshall as I was sitting in the press room waiting for a verdict in the #NoorSalman trial.



They said the judge has issued a court order, BANNING ME from the courthouse for the duration of the trIal. pic.twitter.com/A7tazISMXz — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) March 29, 2018

Loomer, who previously worked for conservative activist James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, is best known for interrupting a New York production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” last year that featured a President Donald Trump-like character who was assassinated. Loomer has a documented history of preaching anti-Muslim hate speech. Just last year, Loomer, who calls herself a “proud Islamophobe,” photographed random hijab-wearing women in New York and tweeted that Muslims were “out in full force”

She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In tweets about the trial, Loomer called Salman an “ISIS widow” and a “Real Housewife of ISIS.”

There is zero evidence that Salman was radicalized, a fact not disputed by prosecutors. Investigators who scoured through her internet history, phone and social media accounts found nothing to suggest she shared her husband’s extremist views.

Clary said Salman’s family was shaken by Loomer’s provocation, and canceled a planned interview with the BBC Thursday morning.

“There’s enough pressure already to have a loved one charged in federal court,” Clary said. “On top of that, many people in this community think that because Noor was married to a terrorist that she is a terrorist, and they’ve spent the last month in Orlando trying to show people that she had nothing to do with it.”

Many of Salman’s supporters worry that her prosecution is rooted in “gendered Islamophobia and patriarchy.” On the last day of trial testimony, more than 80 domestic violence and civil rights groups released a statement, asking for the charges to be dropped.

“She is being prosecuted under the guise of guilt by association as a Muslim woman married to a Muslim man who committed mass violence,” they wrote.

If convicted, Salman faces up to life in prison.A “Friends” reboot isn’t on the cards anytime soon — or ever, per various members of the hit sitcom’s cast and crew.

But what if Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe really did end up returning to TV screens in this politically heightened age? On Wednesday, BuzzFeed editor David Mack posed a question that many “Friends” fans were likely too afraid to ask:

ok if they reboot Friends and try to make it topical which one of them voted for trump — David Mack (@davidmackau) March 28, 2018

The query came after Tuesday’s successful reboot of of the sitcom “Roseanne,” complete with its Trump-supporting main character Roseanne Conner — who is portrayed by real-life Trump voter Roseanne Barr.

Mack’s post stirred quite the debate, with hundreds of people on Twitter putting forward theories of how the six Central Perk-loving “Friends” leads would have cast their ballots in the 2016 presidential election.

Chandler- didn't vote; sez he did

Monica- Hill, obvs

Phoebe-Stein, Oobvs (b/c vaccines)

Rachel- didn't vote, got busy & gets to polls 5 mins too late, lol

Joey- thinks both r mean, votes John McClane in protest

ROSS IS TRUMP VOTER, straight lies about it. Reason: Hil's voice — Katharine Clark Gray (@KatieGonzo) March 28, 2018

Ross voted for Trump

Monica & Chandler voted 3rd party

Rachel & Phoebe voted for Hillary

Joey slept through the election and didn’t vote — Beyoncé biter we WILL find u (@tribranchvo) March 28, 2018

Ross for Hillary (science)

Chandler for Trump (jobs)

Monica Jill Stein to not anger these two

Rachel didn't vote cuz she forgot

Phoebe for Trump (Angry Berner)

Joey for Hillary (trying to get a chick) — Juan G. Andujar (@rajudnajuan) March 28, 2018

Would they vote for Trump?



❌Ross (anti-Semitism/LGBTQ/science)

❌Monica (anti-Semitism)

❌Chandler (anti-LGBTQ)

❌Phoebe (anti-environment).

❌Joey (we saw how he reacted to his dad's affair, or any harassment of sisters)



✔️Rachel (because of her dad) — ErikHitoshi (@TheOlsgaard) March 28, 2018

Ross and Joey voted Bernie

Monica voted Trump

Rachel and Phoebe voted Hilary

Chandler pretended to vote Trump to please Monica but actually voted For Hilary. — Rock in Peace King of Pop, Chester Bennington (@TonyMackSays) March 29, 2018

Rachel, most definitely! Her job consists of pleasing the rich by being their personal shopper. If the rich benefit, she benefits. She'd probably be even hawking the Ivanka Trump line at Bloomingdale's. Thus, she's most definitely a Trump voter. — What's in a name? 🤷 (@k0ol1) March 29, 2018

I can't believe some of these people saying Ross. He is a fact checker which is the total opposite of a Trump voter — broadband bloods (@brookcty) March 28, 2018

Right.. I basically hate Ross but he's such a stickler for science, and the literal meaning of exactly what people say, he couldn't reconcile that with Trump plus he has a science job.

I hate Ross and here I am, defending a fake person on Twitter — Jenny S. (@ncsujen) March 29, 2018

Joey...by accident. And somehow his fans, for whatever acting gig he currently has, find out and it’s a running gag of people throwing food items at him on the streets of NY. — GeekFilter 🖖 (@GeekFilter) March 28, 2018

As the above sample shows, people were pretty conflicted.

They analyzed “Friends” plot lines, with some suggesting Rachel’s moneyed background would make her a Trump voter, and Ross’ scientific credentials would lead him to vote against.

Most people agreed on one thing, however: that Phoebe, with her concern for the environment, would have voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

Phoebe 100% voted for Stein — Chris (32 weeks til midterm elections) (@OccupyNachos) March 28, 2018

Phoebe's a Stein voter. The only question is whether she did it because she's a Berner or because she really believes that Jill was the best choice. — Shay (@shay_rika) March 29, 2018

Phoebe Jill Stein seems totally right. — Kelly Scaletta (@KellyScaletta) March 29, 2018

As the debate escalated, someone put forward the idea that none of the “Friends” characters would have voted:

None of them voted. They were all busy. It's meant to be a funny episode where they all get caught up doing frustrating tasks they can't get out of but it actually proves how self-involved all the friends really are. — madeleine hindes (@madeleinelily) March 28, 2018

“The One Where No One Voted,” perhaps?

Someone even imagined such an episode:

AdvertisementThe official trailer for the second season of “Westworld” arrived on Thursday, backed by a haunting rendition of Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box.”

The wild west theme park where you can live out all your greatest (and worst) fantasies was a chaotic bloodbath at the end of Season One. Many of the bots, or “hosts,” in the park came to realize they were being forced to entertain the degenerate whims of high-paying human visitors.

When we left off, host Maeve, played by Thandie Newton, nearly escapes the park but stays to find her daughter. Ed Harris’ “Man in Black” character was, as many fans predicted, revealed to be Jimmi Simpson’s character William as an older man. And Westworld’s original host, Dolores Abernathy, played by Evan Rachel Wood, killed the park’s co-creator, played by Anthony Hopkins, as she continued to dig into the meaning of her own, very messed up existence.

By the looks of this trailer, we’re going to see more of “Shogun World,” hinted at in last season’s finale, and possibly the real world outside of the park.Jeb! I love everything about my father.

In a story deeply reported by BuzzFeed, Robyn Byrd and Katie Rice say that Kricfalusi befriended each of them in the 1990s under the guise of mentoring their animation careers.

In hindsight, the two women allege that Kricfalusi, who was in his 40s at the time, was much more interested in grooming them to be his sexual partners.

“I believed, as a 16-year-old dating him, ‘Oh, the world’s against us. It shouldn’t be wrong for him to date me. We’re cool and rebellious because we’re breaking the rules of society,’” Byrd told BuzzFeed, adding that Kricfalusi said their 25-year age difference was “romantic.”

Tony Mora, then an animator at Kricfalusi’s studio Spumco, said he thought the relationship was odd, especially after Kricfalusi showed him a drawing he’d made of a dog ejaculating on a naked Byrd.

Mora also said Kricfalusi showed him pictures of Byrd ― who was 20 at the time ― performing oral sex.

Rice said she never actually had sex with Kricfalusi, but that he sexually harassed her in all sorts of bizarre ways, including “telling me that his friend’s advice to ‘get’ me was to just rape me one day.”

Kricfalusi alluded to his “friendship” with Rice in a video extra for a “Ren & Stimpy” DVD that can be seen below.

“I was at her 15th birthday party. We’ll tell you that backstory a little bit later,” he said with a grin.

An attorney for Kricfalusi told BuzzFeed that “the 1990s were a time of mental and emotional fragility for Mr. Kricfalusi” and that he had a 16-year-old girlfriend back then.

The lawyer also said that the animator, now 62, has struggled for years with what was eventually diagnosed as mental illness in 2008:

To that point, for nearly three decades he had relied primarily on alcohol to self-medicate. Since that time he has worked feverishly on his mental health issues, and has been successful in stabilizing his life over the last decade. This achievement has allowed John the opportunity to grow and mature in ways he’d never had a chance at before.

Both Byrd and Rice expressed strong feelings about how Kricfalusi’s actions damaged them.

“He ruined a good bit of my childhood and my early adulthood, gave me PTSD, and forced me to change careers, putting my life 10 years or more behind,” Byrd said.

Rice noted that Kricfalusi made her “a better artist,” but said she still wished she hadn’t worked with him.

“I wish I were a worse artist now and I didn’t have all this bullshit to deal with,” she said.This week a senior editor at the Wall Street Journal attempted to take a graphic offline because the facts it contained were not politically palatable.
