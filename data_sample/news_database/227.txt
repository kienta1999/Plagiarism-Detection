PYEONGCHANG, South Korea ― This year’s Winter Olympics has seen some of the most outspoken out gay athletes in history, many of whom have become media superstars for their performances on ice and snow but also for their deft handling of the public’s affection.

For Gus Kenworthy, his second Olympics has been as much a story about his performance as his newfound comfort with himself. Speaking to reporters at Canada’s Pride House in the Olympic Village, the 26-year-old skier told HuffPost that, despite missing the podium this time around, he felt he would leave these Games with his “head held higher” than his last showing four years ago.

“The last thing in the world you want is to have regrets,” Kenworthy said at the Pride House, which first launched at the Games in 2010. “For me getting to be out at this Games has been the most rewarding thing. But getting to leave here knowing that I actually brought myself to the Games, and I was true to myself and I gave it my all, I think I’m leaving with my head held higher than I did last time with a medal when I wasn’t being honest about who I was.”

Kenworthy won a silver medal during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, but he didn’t come out until a year later in an interview with ESPN. Coverage of Kenworthy has often centered on his sexuality, but the mantle is one he’s carried with grace to become one of the biggest celebrities of this year’s Games.

A quick kiss he shared with his boyfriend, actor Matthew Wilkas, before his qualifying run last weekend was broadcast by NBC to millions of viewers and spread like wildfire around social media. Kenworthy described the kiss as “so insignificant in the moment ... just a little kiss of good luck before my run.” Be he seemed to appreciate the momentum the broadcast carried.

“It just so happened that it was being filmed ... during the Olympics, beamed to television sets all over the world, and to parts of the world where it’s not OK, where it’s not accepted, including the country that we’re in right now,” Kenworthy said. “I think it was a really powerful statement in a way, but it was also not even intended to be. It was not something that had any premeditation to it.”

Another out athlete, Canadian figure skater Eric Radford, became the first openly gay man to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. He described his own coming out as a weight lifted, which allowed him to “express myself to a larger degree than I had before.”

“I didn’t quite realize it until after I came out, but when I did finally come out, I felt sort of a weight being lifted off my shoulders when I was on the ice performing,” Radford told HuffPost. “I felt a difference in how I just felt comfortable to express myself to a larger degree than I had before. When you accept yourself and you take pride in being yourself, you feel lighter, you feel lighter in all aspects of your life.”

Other out athletes have also quickly become household names across the U.S., including figure skater Adam Rippon, who has, appropriately, dubbed himself “America’s sweetheart.”President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday unveiled a sweeping new lineup of sanctions against North Korea, promising to target 28 vessels and 27 shipping companies, plus one individual, in an effort to further isolate the rogue regime.

North Korea’s shipping industry is “a primary means by which North Korea evades sanctions to fund its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs,” the U.S. Department of the Treasury said in an advisory Friday. “As such, the United States will continue targeting persons, wherever located, who facilitate North Korea’s illicit shipping practices.”

The pronouncement came just hours after Ivanka Trump, on a visit to South Korea timed with the end of the 2018 Winter Olympics, dined with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. She used the trip as an opportunity to reinforce the Trump administration’s “commitment to our maximum-pressure campaign to ensure that the Korean Peninsula is denuclearized,” according to a pool report.

Vice President Mike Pence reportedly planned to meet with North Korean officials during his visit to Pyeongchang for the Olympics, but the gathering was called off after he used the trip to criticize the regime.

Speaking Friday from the White House, in front of photos that he said showed fuel-to-fuel transfers benefiting North Korea, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the administration plans to do everything in its power to curtail the activity.

“Those who trade with North Korea do so at their own peril,” Mnuchin said.

Pyongyang has tested several ballistic missiles in recent months, putting them on display during a massive military parade earlier this month. President Trump’s strategy has consisted of outlandish and bellicose threats of military action directed at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, even bragging that his “nuclear button” is bigger and more powerful than Kim’s. Trump has also demanded that China step up and use its bargaining power with the reclusive regime to call for denuclearization.

The United Nations Security Council adopted a round of sanctions against North Korea in December, targeting exports of gasoline, diesel and refined oil to the country.

“We imposed, today, the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before,” Trump said Friday in remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland. “Hopefully, something positive can happen. We will see.”TONIGHT: Senator Marco Rubio faced a tough crowd at @CNN's town hall, but one of his gun control suggestions brought them to their feet. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/CchPRDr0vF — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 23, 2018

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is getting credit for showing up to a CNN “town hall” event on gun control, where he was clearly not an audience favorite Wednesday night.

But “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert said Thursday that it shouldn’t work that way.

“OK, here’s the thing: Just showing up isn’t that impressive,” Colbert pointed out. “He works for those people!”

Then he delivered the perfect analogy.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) proclaimed the GOP “happily” the party of Homer Simpson (and Bart, Maggie and Marge) in an interview Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Twitter was in stitches.

Only daughter Lisa from the long-running series “The Simpsons” is a Democrat, Cruz insisted. “I think the Democrats are the party of Lisa Simpson and Republicans are happily the party of Homer and Bart and Maggie and Marge,” Cruz said at the CPAC gathering in National Harbor, Maryland.

The animated series often spoofs Republicans, the Trump administration and conservative issues (and attacked Cruz in an episode). Lisa Simpson, 8, is the sanest, brainiest character of the pack (and a vegetarian). Cruz is a huge fan of the show and does impressions of the characters — though many on Twitter are convinced he is missing the point entirely.

“Simpsons” screenwriter and producer Al Jean immediately hit back at Cruz, saying the senator needs baby Maggie’s pacifier. He quipped that even cranky billionaire character Charles Montgomery Burns might be ready to switch to the Democrats. (Maggie accidentally shoots Burns with his own gun in an episode.)

.@TheSimpsons Ted Cruz says Maggie Simpson would vote for him.

I think Ted's the one who could use a pacifier in his mouth. — Al Jean (@AlJean) February 22, 2018

.@TheSimpsons The way things are going even Mr. Burns is thinking of becoming a Democrat. — Al Jean (@AlJean) February 22, 2018

Former “Simpsons” show runner Bill Oakley backed up Jean. He said “no way” would Maggie vote GOP, Bart is a Libertarian and Marge loves Jimmy Carter. Homer might be Republican because the “joke” is he’s “poorly informed and reactionary in the extreme.”

So many things wrong with this:

1) Maggie = No way

2) Bart = Libertarian

3) Marge = Well known fan of Jimmy Carter and John Anderson

4) Homer = He may be Republican because the joke with Homer, as everyone knows, is that he is poorly-informed and reactionary in the extreme https://t.co/jdspX4b7gq — 🇺🇸Bill Oakley🇺🇸 (@thatbilloakley) February 22, 2018

Cruz made the comment during an interview with Ben Domenech, founder of The Federalist, who compared the gun control debate to a “Simpsons” episode. In “The Cartridge Family” doofus patriarch Homer waves around a handgun and tell his 10-year-old son, Bart, that he can use it to scare a security guard after he cleans up his room. Lisa complains that the right to bear arms is a relic of Revolutionary War days.

Lisa wins the presidency in one episode from the future and has to deal with a budget crisis left behind by Donald Trump.

Ironically George H.W. Bush slammed the lack of family values in “The Simpsons” and said America needed to be more like “The Waltons” and less like “The Simpsons.” Jean quipped to the Daily Beast: “Make up your minds!”

Here’s a sample of what else Twitter had to say:

Ted Cruz: Dems are the party of Lisa Simpson



Lisa is the only intelligent character in the family. So R the dumb characters Republican?

Cruz went on in the interview to argue against stricter gun control laws and said current laws should be enforced. He also said he believes teachers should be allowed to have guns in the classroom.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON — After spending its first year working feverishly to lift up the fossil fuel industry and introducing a budget that would gut funding for renewable energy programs, the Trump administration maintains that it isn’t playing favorites when it comes to powering America.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry spoke about the ongoing push for so-called “energy dominance” during a panel discussion Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference. They stressed that the administration favors and all-of-the-above strategy.

“That’s the type of energy policy that President Trump wants to see,” Perry said. “Where we’re using our resources, we’re using American innovation and we’re not sitting there and just saying we’re going to regulate our way into nirvana, because that is a fallacy.”

“If you’re going to have energy on public lands, produce it — wind, solar — and I’m all of the above,” said Zinke, drawing an “amen” from Perry. “To me it doesn’t matter. As long as it’s made in America, I’m good with it.”

The familiar comments come just weeks after the Trump administration unveiled its 2019 budget proposal, which called for a more than 65 percent cut in funding for the Energy Department’s office on renewable energy and efficiency. The budget also called for a more than 19 percent increase for Energy’s fossil energy research and development office.

Last month, an Energy Department official told those gathered for a coal conference in West Virginia that he was “here to help,” as S&P Global reported.

“I went to Washington, D.C., for one purpose and that was to help create coal jobs in the United States,” said Doug Matheney, special adviser in the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy. “That’s my total purpose for being there. I’m not a researcher, I’m not a scientist, I’m an advocate for the coal industry.”

In January, President Donald Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported solar panels, which analysts warn could result in job losses and a spike in the cost of solar panels. Solar companies created one in 50 new jobs in the United Staes in 2016. The Government Accountability Office also accused the White House of illegally withholding $91 million in funding to Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, an experimental energy research program responsible for “holy grail” breakthroughs in battery storage technology.

Zinke said Friday that getting rid of punitive and adversarial government regulations will drive innovation.

“We are enormously clever people,” he said. “And allowing us to innovate is what happened in fracking, in energy and batteries. There’s no one more clever than Americans are, so our regulatory framework has to reflect that.”

But the regulatory rollbacks have almost exclusively been giveaways to fossil fuel companies. Trump signed an executive order to roll back Obama-era policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and said he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate accord ― the international agreement to cut carbon emissions to ward off the worst effects of global climate change.

The administration also green-lighted the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines and pushed a proposal designed by coal baron and Trump ally Bob Murray to bail out coal and nuclear power plants with a plan that would add $10.8 billion in ratepayer costs.

Trump touted his fossil fuel achievements during his own speech Friday at CPAC, making no mention of renewables.

“We’ve ended the war on American energy — we were in war,” he said. “And we’ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, one of our great natural resources.” He called the Paris accord “totally disastrous” and “wealth knocking-out.”Lebanon became the first Arab country to hold a gay pride week last year.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The organizer of Beirut Pride said he was detained overnight by Lebanese authorities who released him only when he signed a pledge to cancel the week’s remaining events.

Lebanon last year became the first Arab country to hold a gay pride week, though the opening event was canceled because of safety concerns after threats of violence.

This year’s pride week began on May 12 and was due to run until May 20.

Lebanon is widely seen as more socially liberal than most other Arab countries, but lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people say they are still discriminated against by state and society.

In a statement on the Beirut Pride website, organizer Hadi Damien said that security services turned up late on Tuesday at a public reading of a theater play. Damien said he was taken to a police station overnight and questioned.

Damien said he was asked to sign a pledge promising to cancel upcoming events and in return he would be released.

The Interior Ministry said it was unable to provide immediate comment.

Damien said he was told that if he refused to sign the pledge, he would be referred to the investigation judge for interrogation on the basis of articles pertaining to the incitement to immorality and to the breach of public morality for coordinating the activities.

On legal advice, Damien signed the pledge, he said in the statement.

Lebanon’s laws prohibit “unnatural” sex, without giving further definition, which has been used to criminalize gay sex. Last year a Lebanese judge said that same-sex relations do not contradict laws of nature, a move welcomed by rights activists.

Damien said the public prosecution had received an Arabic version of the Beirut Pride program that was “completely distorted, making Beirut Pride appear like events of debauchery and disrespect of general law,” while using derogatory terms to refer to LGBT individuals.

Ghenwa Samhat, executive director of Lebanese LGBT rights organization Helem, said that many rights organizations in Lebanon experience such pressures.

“These things are not new to us,” Samhat said.

But in the 20 years since the LGBT rights movement began in Lebanon, progress has been made.

“People can express themselves in public places, there are placers friendly to LGBTQ+, where they face no problems,” she said.SEOUL/WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The United States is due to announce its largest package of sanctions against North Korea to pressure the reclusive country into giving up its nuclear and missile programs, as South Korea readies itself for further talks with its leaders.

Tougher sanctions may jeopardize the latest detente between the two Koreas, illustrated by the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics in the South, amid preparations for talks about a possible summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

A senior U.S. administration official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, called the new penalties “the largest package of new sanctions against the North Korea regime,” without giving details.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence had hinted at such a plan two weeks ago during a stop in Tokyo that preceded his visit to South Korea for the Pyeongchang Olympics.

North Korea last year conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States. It defends the weapons programs as essential to deter U.S. aggression.

But it has been more than two months since its last missile test.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he wants to boost the “warm climate of reconciliation and dialog” with South Korea, which hosts 28,500 U.S. troops, after a high-level delegation, including his sister, returned from the Olympics.

In an extension of that rapprochement, the North agreed on Friday to hold working-level talks on Tuesday for the Pyeongchang Winter Paralympics on the North’s side of the border village of Panmunjom.

The new U.S. sanctions will be announced while Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is visiting South Korea. She had dinner with Moon after a closed-door meeting with the president on Friday and will attend the Games’ closing ceremony.

“I thank you for hosting us all here tonight as we reaffirm our bonds of friendship, of cooperation, of partnership and reaffirm our commitment to our maximum pressure campaign to ensure that the Korean peninsula is denuclearised,” she told Moon before heading inside the dinner venue at the Blue House.

Moon expressed his gratitude towards President Donald Trump, saying ongoing talks with North Korea were thanks to Trump’s “strong support.”

Ivanka Trump’s visit coincides with that of a sanctioned North Korean official, Kim Yong Chol, blamed for the deadly 2010 sinking of a South Korean navy ship that killed 46 sailors. His delegation will attend the closing ceremony and also meet Moon.

The Blue House has said there are no official opportunities for U.S. and North Korean officials to meet.

“RIGHT PERSON”

Kim Yong Chol is the vice-chairman of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee and was previously chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a top North Korean military intelligence agency which South Korea blamed for the sinking of its navy corvette, the Cheonan.

North Korea has denied any involvement.

Seoul said it approved the pending visit by Kim Yong Chol in the pursuit of peace and asked for public understanding in the face of opposition protests.

“Under current difficult circumstances, we have decided to focus on whether peace on the Korean peninsula and improvement in inter-Korean relations can be derived from dialog with (the visiting North Korean officials), not on their past or who they are,” said Unification Ministry Baik Tae-hyun in a media briefing.

A South Korean lawmaker briefed by the country’s spy agency said on Friday that Kim Yong Chol was the “right person” for inter-Korean and denuclearisation talks.

“Kim Yong Chol is the top official regarding inter-Korean relations and he is being accepted (here) as the right person to discuss various issues like easing military tension, improving inter-Korean ties and denuclearisation,” said Kang Seok-ho to reporters.

Kim Yong Chol currently heads the United Front Department, the North’s office responsible for handling inter-Korean affairs.

PROTESTS AGAINST NORTH KOREA DELEGATION

South Korea’s decision on Thursday to allow in Kim Yong Chol, currently sanctioned by the United States and South Korea, sparked protest from family members of the dead sailors and opposition parties.

Some 70 members of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party staged a protest in front of the Blue House on Friday.

“President Moon’s decision to accept the North’s facade of peace is a serious issue and it will go down in history as a crime eternal,” said the party in a statement.

A group of family members of those killed in the Cheonan sinking has said it will hold a press conference on Saturday.

Acknowledging public angst over Kim Yong Chol’s pending visit, Baik said the South’s stance that the Cheonan sinking was instigated by the North has not changed.

“However, what’s important are efforts to create actual peace on the Korean peninsula so these kind of provocations don’t occur again,” said Baik, adding the government would make “various efforts” to assuage the public’s concerns.

Many have been angered at the North’s participation at the Games, which they say has been a reward for bad behavior with no quid pro quo from Pyongyang.Amnesty International slammed President Donald Trump for “hate-filled” rhetoric that it says is fueling the deterioration of human rights around the world.

“The specters of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs, and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times,” Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said in a statement.

Trump’s move to restrict travel into the U.S. from six Muslim countries was “transparently hateful,” and “set a dangerous precedent” for other governments, said the report, “State of the World Human Rights 2017/18.”

“President Trump wasted little time in putting his anti-rights rhetoric of discrimination and xenophobia into action, threatening a major rollback on justice and freedoms ― including by signing a series of repressive executive orders that threatened the human rights of millions, at home and abroad,” said the report. It also pointed to new restrictions on women’s access to reproductive health services, cutbacks on health care, repeal of protections for LGBTQ workers, and Trump’s equivocation on white supremacy.

In a pointed dig at Trump, the report also criticized world leaders who cry “fake news” in attacking the media. It criticized the “weak and inconsistent” response of social media companies to abuse against women and minorities.

The 409-page report examined human rights in 159 countries. Among the most egregious violations were abuses in the civil war in Syria and the suffering of more than 655,000 Rohingya who have fled persecution in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Other hard-hit nations included Yemen, Turkey and Venezuela.

The report criticized China’s intolerance and punishment of critics, and blasted Putin’s continued crackdown on free speech, and persecution of critics and the LGBTQ community.

France, meanwhile, cracked down on protests, and Poland threatened the independence of the judiciary. Hungry detained asylum seekers, contravening EU law.

The developments show what happens when the “politics of demonization become mainstream,” the report said.

People are rising up to demand better treatment, the report noted. It hailed the Women’s March in the U.S. and the growing #MeToo movement that has brought new urgency to addressing the issues of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

Shetty, at a news conference Wednesday before the report was released, pointed to the new activism in the wake of the Florida mass shooting that killed 17 people last week.

“There’s no better example of that than what we’ve seen with the kids in this country standing up against gun violence in the last few days,” Shetty said.Period cramps can’t stop this Olympian.

Team USA figure skater Mirai Nagasu recently spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about how she deals with her period during competition. She said she’s really not too bothered by a little blood.

“I had my period on the way to the games,” she said. “It’s really not that big of a deal. You just stick a tampon up there. Periods can induce cramps for me, which I find exercise helps.”

Nagasu, who recently made history as the first American woman to land a triple axel at the Olympics, added that there’s always risk of a little leakage, but she can’t let that stop her: “You just have to pretend like it never happened.”

She’s not the first Olympian to get candid about competing while bleeding. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui told a reporter she was on her period while competing.

“My period came last night and I’m really tired right now,” she said at the time, bent over from menstrual cramps. “But this isn’t an excuse, I still did not swim as well as I should have.” Women are actual (bleeding) superheroes.NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. ― The National Rifle Association usually maintains a large presence at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual political confab that draws thousands of conservative activists from across the country.

Some speculated, though, that the nation’s most powerful gun lobby would lower its visibility at this year’s CPAC, which began Thursday, given that a gunman armed with an assault-style rifle murdered 17 people last week at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

Whenever a mass shooting occurs, for example, the NRA goes quiet. And no officials from the gun lobby appeared on a publicly released schedule of CPAC speakers online ― a curious omission for an organization that pays for top billing at the gathering.

But after NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch was jeered by thousands of people over gun control at a CNN-sponsored town hall on Wednesday in Florida, she and the top NRA official not only appeared at CPAC Thursday, but they went on the attack ― blasting Democrats, the media, and the FBI over its failure to act on tips that may have stopped the shooter in Parkland.

“The shameful politicization of tragedy — it’s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement” - Wayne LaPierre, NRA's CEO, on those pushing for stricter gun laws.

“Each and every member of the National Rifle Association mourns the loss of the innocent,” NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said in a speech that was carried live by all three major cable news channels. But he quickly added that “opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain.”

LaPierre warned that growing calls from students for stricter gun laws would lead to a European-style “socialist wave” that would strip law-abiding citizens of their firearms.

Referring to politicians who back stricter gun laws, he said, “They hide behind labels like Democrat, left-wing, and progressive to make their socialist agenda more palatable, and that is terrifying.”

“The shameful politicization of tragedy — it’s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement,” he said.

Those pushing for more gun control in the wake of the Parkland massacre, he said, “want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security, the failure of family, the failure of America’s mental health system, and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI.”

He also took a clear swipe at the FBI over the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, saying, “What is hard to understand is why no one at the FBI stood up and called B.S. on its rogue leadership. I mean, really, where was the systemic resistance?”

“Many in legacy media love mass shootings” - Dana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman.

Loesch took aim at a different target in her speech.

“Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” Loesch claimed to a standing ovation. “I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold.”

Her comments echoed a video that NRA-TV released Wednesday, which slammed the mainstream media for being the “casting call for the next mass shooting.”

In a sign of the NRA’s status among conservatives, the group received two top speaking slots ― LaPierre and Loesch addressed attendees immediately prior to Vice President Mike Pence.

The gun lobby’s outsized influence also was evident in the halls of Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, the massive complex that has hosted CPAC in recent years and where conservative stars like Ben Shapiro and Sebastian Gorka mix and mingle with selfie-seeking students and other activists. The NRA occupies the largest space among exhibitors at the event. It even offers a range simulator where attendees can practice shooting firearms.

But while the NRA officials resisted the prospect of additional laws regulating firearms, congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump were entertaining other ideas ― a sign that political pressure for bigger changes is building in the wake of the Parkland shooting.

Trump on Thursday met with state and local officials at the White House to discuss solutions to address gun violence. The president reiterated his support for raising the age when Americans can buy assault weapons such as the AR-15. The 19-year-old charged in the Parkland shooting was able to purchase an AR-15 rifle in Florida.

“It should all be at 21,” Trump said at an event at the White House. “And the NRA will back it.”

“They’re very close to me. I’m close to them. The NRA wants to do the right thing,” Trump claimed. “I’ve spoken to them often in the last two days. It’s not a battle — I think the NRA wants to do the right thing.”

Raising the minimum age for purchasing assault weapons could gain momentum in Congress. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Pat Roberts of Kansas have expressed interest in the proposal this week.

“Certainly nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,” Roberts said Thursday.

Some CPAC attendees who support gun rights agreed.

“I think raising the age is not a bad thing, it’s a good thing,” Marie Zare, a New York commercial real estate broker, said.

Zare, who recently obtained a gun permit for the first time, said she would also support arming some teachers in schools, another of Trump’s proposals.phongphan5922 via Getty Images

While the stock market has fallen recently, it is still up since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. But despite Trump’s best efforts, most Americans don’t even know that.

Just 40 percent of the public knows — or acknowledges — that the market is up from a year ago, with 18 percent saying that it’s currently about the same, and 23 percent that it’s lower, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey taken earlier this month. The rest aren’t sure.

Americans who view the stock market as relevant to their own finances are likelier to have the correct answer, as are wealthier Americans and those with college degrees.

But there’s also a political effect: Although two-thirds of Trump voters correctly say that the stock market has risen, just 35 percent of Hillary Clinton voters say the same.

HuffPost

Those results tie into a larger pattern in which views of the economy are filtered through a distinctly partisan lens. Trump voters don’t realize that 2017 didn’t outpace 2016 for job creation. And polling during Barack Obama’s presidency found that, when Obama’s name was mentioned, Republicans grew more likely to say the economy, and their own finances, had declined, while Democrats shied away from noting a rise in income inequality.

It’s possible that like Obama before him, Trump generates sufficiently polarized feelings that rather than views of the economy shaping Americans’ views of Trump’s presidency, their views of his presidency are instead shaping their perspective on objective facts about the economy ― or at least the way they describe it to pollsters. That’s especially true in cases involving specific statistics, like the performance of the stock market or the unemployment rate, which many people may not have a personal sense for or any reason to commit to memory. But it’s also true of the way people perceive broader trends. Merely days after Trump was elected, Gallup found, Republicans’ ratings of the current state of the economy soared, while Democrats’ plummeted ― despite the fact that Trump was still months from taking office, let alone crafting policies that would shape the nation’s economy.

And the latest HuffPost/YouGov survey finds those divides persisting. Eighty-four percent of Trump voters, but just 37 percent of Clinton voters and a third of everyone else, pronounce themselves satisfied with the current state of the economy, a wider gap than between the richest and poorest Americans, or between those working full-time jobs and those currently unemployed. Nearly half of Trump voters, but just 5 percent of Clinton voters and 15 percent of non-voters and third party voters, think the stock market will continue to climb during the next year.

Although the tendency to view economics through a partisan lens didn’t start under Trump, it perhaps ties into the unusual difficulty he saw throughout most of his first year in converting the strength of the economy into support for his work as president. Traditionally, strong economic numbers are a pretty good gauge of presidential approval, but Trump has consistently underperformed his economic indicators, failing to win much support beyond his own party.

One reason may have simply been that, in his first months in office, most people didn’t think Trump bore responsibility for the state of the economy. But at least when it comes to the stock market, Americans give Trump more credit than Obama for the performance of the stock market. Thirty-seven percent of Americans hand Trump responsibility for the stock market’s performance, while 12 percent say it’s mostly due to Obama. Another third say it’s “just the regular ups and downs of the market,” with the remainder unsure.

Nearly 70 percent of Trump’s supporters name the current president as responsible for the market’s performance. In contrast, just 16 percent of Clinton voters ― largely, those who believed the stock market was doing poorly ― think that Trump is responsible.

The public is divided over how much the performance of the markets actually matter to the nation. About a third said the stock market is a good indicator of the economy, about a third that it isn’t and the remaining third that they don’t know. Americans are also divided over how much the stock market matters to them personally, with 42 percent saying it matters somewhat or a lot to their personal finances, and 45 percent that it matters not much or not at all.

The splits are both financial and political. Two-thirds of Americans in households making $100,000 or more annually say that the stock market affects their finances at least somewhat, while half of those making $50,000 to $100,000, and a third of those making less than $50,000, say the same. A 52 percent majority of those in the highest-earning group, but just 28 percent of the lowest earners, think the stock market reflects the overall economy.

Trump voters are only slightly likelier than Clinton voters, 53 percent to 46 percent, to say the markets have some bearing on their own finances. But they’re about twice as likely as Clinton voters, 51 percent to 25 percent, to consider the stock market a good economic indicator.

Jay Inslee of Washington, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said Friday that he didn’t expect the DGA to break with its policy of staying neutral in gubernatorial primaries.

“I don’t see a likelihood that we will change our historic pattern of allowing people to make a choice of a Democratic candidate. It’s been quite successful,” Inslee said at a Friday news conference alongside Democratic Govs. Tom Wolf (Pa.) and Dan Malloy (Conn.). The governors were announcing a $20 million investment in Democratic gubernatorial bids aimed at electing candidates who can help reverse GOP gerrymandering.

“We have very competitive primaries with very highly qualified candidates. And we think that’s actually a healthy thing,” Inslee added.

But the assembled Democratic governors did not categorically rule out publicly opposing or endorsing a candidate in a Democratic primary.

“If there’s a nuisance candidate and it’s clearly intended to be a nuisance candidate, that’s a different decision than when it’s a viable primary,” Malloy said.

The comments by Inslee and Malloy follow the controversy that has erupted over the involvement of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect House Democrats, in contentious primary races.

The DCCC was criticized Thursday night for denouncing the candidacy of Laura Moser, a progressive running for Texas’ 7th Congressional District seat. The only other candidate the DCCC has disparaged on its website is Rick Saccone, the Republican running in a March 13 special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th District.

For progressive activists in the Democratic Party base, the negative comments about Moser, which include calling her a “Washington insider” and questioning her devotion to Texas, reflect a troubling trend in which party leaders ― and outside groups closely tied to them, such as EMILY’s List ― try to stifle non-conformist candidates based on their supposed lack of general election viability. In practice however, critics lament, the establishment favorites often fare more poorly against Republicans than maverick candidates with grassroots followings.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which elects Senate Democrats, has also meddled in Democratic primaries. For example, in March 2016, the DSCC endorsed Katie McGinty over Joe Sestak for Pennsylvania Senate. McGinty went on to lose by a larger margin than Hillary Clinton did in the state.

A spokesman for the DSCC did not immediately respond to a question about whether it still reserves the right to back or oppose candidates in the primary.

Inslee and Malloy argued Friday that staying neutral in primaries is ultimately better for the party’s general election prospects.

“I don’t think Democrats are as afraid of primaries as some people think we are,” Malloy said. “Testing our candidates in some situations is the right thing to do. I got elected through a primary.”

The two governors both claimed that the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Virginia between Ralph Northam and Tom Perriello boosted turnout in the general election. Northam became governor.We're *so* excited. Frederick M. Brown via Getty Images

Tiffany Haddish is making history left and right.

The “Girls Trip” actress announced on Thursday that she will be hosting the 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards in Los Angeles on Monday, June 18. Haddish, who made history last November by becoming the first black female stand-up comedian to host “Saturday Night Live,” is making history again as the first black woman to host the award show. The last female host was Amy Schumer in 2015.

Haddish announced the news in a video on Instagram. “It’s gonna be off the chain! Because you know why? I’m hosting!” Haddish says in the video. “And you know what that means ― it’s gonna be hilarious.”

MTV released a statement shortly after Haddish’s announcement, writing that the actress, comedian and author is “quickly establishing herself as one of the most sought-after actresses and comedic talents in television and film.”

A post shared by Tiffany Haddish (@tiffanyhaddish) on Feb 22, 2018 at 9:59am PST

Haddish, who many believe should have been an Oscar contender, has been on fire as of late.

After her hilarious acting in “Girls Trip,” she released a New York Times best-seller titled The Last Black Unicorn. She recently made waves as the face of Groupon, appearing in the brand’s 2018 Super Bowl ad. The actress is also starring in the upcoming TBS sitcom “The Last O.G.” alongside Tracy Morgan.

Queer artist, stylist and icon Judy Blame died this week at the age of 58. Best known for his work with Boy George, Bjork, Kylie Minogue and Neneh Cherry, the famed tastemaker was beloved by innovative artists and contemporaries, some of whom paid tribute to him on social media when they heard the news.

A cultural tastemaker whose influence began in the 1980s New Romantic era, Blame (née Chris Barnes) has created punk DIY aesthetics for artists for decades. He was a fan of silverware, chains, keys, buttons and safety pins and would often say, “If you don’t have it; make it.”

“It was a big age to experiment,” he told Interview. “To go out to nightclubs, we didn’t have much money, so I started making jewelry to change my outfit every week.”

He ran away from home (the Devonshire countryside) and spent a few years in Manchester.

“Manchester had a brilliant punk scene,” he told 023c in 2003. “There were a lot of bands, a lot of graphic people, a lot of creative people experimenting. We couldn’t really afford the Seditionaries clothes or whatever, so we would do the jumble sale, buy a suit, throw a bucket of paint over it, cut it up, join it back together with safety pins – it was much more homemade. It was better for me.”

“He was always unapologetic; openly gay and unwilling to closet himself no matter who his clients were.”

Eventually, he found himself in London, becoming part an influential collective, The House of Beauty and Culture. Along with androgynous model Scarlett Cannon and the rest of The Blitz Kids, Blame came to run a popular night, Cha-Cha Club, at London’s gay bar Heaven, where he became a staple of the nightlife scene.

Soon after, he started styling Boy George, and helped to steer the art and fashion direction for i-D magazine. He famously styled Bjork for her “Debut” album cover, and worked with artists like Massive Attack, Kylie Minogue, Duran Duran and frequent collaborator Neneh Cherry. He was always unapologetic; openly gay and unwilling to closet himself no matter who his clients were.

“The business is very homophobic,” Blame told Lucy Brien, author of the book She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul. “Most people see me as a Queen Bitch, don’t mess with him. I promote the image, otherwise they just think you’re a nancy, and a lot of men feel intimidated.”

“Once Judy traveled to Iceland with me under the guise of doing wardrobe. I saw Judy at the side of the stage before I went on, he was wearing high heels and a monocle,” George said in 2016. “Judy is such an important creative force and being sober and clear-headed serves him and us because we can see how utterly genius he is. He is a game changer; he is ‘Ziggy Stylist.’ He can place a safety pin on a jacket and make it radiate cool. He’s a juxtaposer and a fashion humorist; he has this innate sense of absurdity. I have a ton of his creations and I’m keeping them!”

“The most generous thing Judy Blame gave me as a shy insecure beginner, was that I was enough and that my own taste and character should simply be enforced,” Bjork said. “Judy is not just a stylist but someone who sees the whole picture and the potential of what people and situations could become. I remember witnessing him switching roles very easily and simply watching a shoot, and whatever it needed he selflessly became that. Like a true catalyst. And often it wasn’t the garment at all…”

In 2016, London’s ICA held a retrospective of Blame’s work, which included pieces from his earlier pieces to the work he did with and for Comme des Garçons, Leigh Bowery, Helmut Lang, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Kim Jones for Louis Vuitton, Gareth Pugh, and Christopher Shannon. He had an innate way of queering style; of integrating punk into high-fashion with an eye for the beautiful absurd. He made the ’80s and ’90s more colorful, his influence felt by new generations and those still to come. He was a fan of genderfuckery, of idiosyncrasy, and of reinvention.

In a previously unpublished interview just published by i-D, Blame spoke about the retrospective and how he felt about seeing his life’s work culled together.

“It makes a difference to others, not to me. If you look at the work, and what I’ve tried to do throughout my career, I’ve never put boundaries around myself,” he says. “So yes, I work in fashion, from styling, to making things, to catwalks, to working with designers. I’ve never bordered myself in. But it means something to others, it gives a different audience access to what I do — the art crowd. But it didn’t change the way I think about the work, because at my age, the work just flows out of me, and I try to turn it into something. I don’t separate things, it’s one thing that comes out of me.”

Judy Blame’s life is difficult to sum up, as he was not only prolific but incredibly quotable. He shared so much with friends and the public at large, and his presence will be missed by those who didn’t even know they knew him.

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva has tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug, the Russian bobsleigh federation said in a statement on Friday.

The federation said in a post on its official Facebook page that the athlete had tested positive on Feb. 18, five days after a previous doping test returned a negative result for her.

When you enter the gates of Magic Kingdom, you pass under a sign that says “Here You Leave Today And Enter The World Of Yesterday, Tomorrow And Fantasy.”

No one does immersive world building as well as Disney, and when I’m at Disneyland I feel accepted and safe in ways I don’t usually experience out in the world. Disney is a special place for my partner and I; a place where I can be my authentic weird queer self, wearing mouse ears and my “I’m celebrating my dreams coming true” button that Disney gifted me the first day ― not to mention our free upgrade to a royal princess room and watching the fireworks over Cinderella’s castle. All of this got me thinking about how important Disney and its magic is not just to me and my family, but also to so many other queer folks.

Why is it that so many queers love Disney? I promise we aren’t all just duped by capitalism, nor are we clueless victims of childhood nostalgia. Growing up, I enjoyed Disney as much as the next kid of the ’90s, but it wasn’t until adulthood that it became so important to me. There is something special and magical about Disney stories and the immersive world building they create in their parks that lends itself to LGBTQs.

“My experience with Disney parks as an adult has also been super queer,” says Melanie Alatras a genderqueer tenderqueer living in Portland. “Going for Gay Days Anaheim has been delightful. Last year, my sweetie and I happened upon meeting the Evil Queen [from “Snow White”], who was mean to us and made our super Disney-appropriate kinky dreams come true.”

Disney theme parks are one of the few places where my queer family goes to vacation where even as visibly queer folks. I feel not just safe but truly embraced as my little self. I’ve had my own share of very queer interactions with Disney characters in the parks. One of my favorite memories was meeting Chip & Dale at Disney World a few years ago. The Chipmunks spent an extra long time with me and my partner, taking photos and signing our autograph book. Then Dale took my rainbow Mickey bracelet off my hand and put it on his own nose. I’m pretty sure that was Dale coming out to me. There was also the time where Captain Hook held my face and offered to pierce me with his hook ― so kinky.

“Disney’s animated movies and characters gave many LGBTQs a window to understand themselves.”

For some LGBTQ people, loving Disney is about remembering the ways in which the stories helped them through challenging times. Growing up in rural southern Oklahoma, Ari, a pansexual, polyamorous, non-binary person tells INTO, “the transformative power of love in nearly every film was one of the few things that got me through my adolescent and young adult years.”

“Even now,” Ari continues, “I find myself picking up ‘Mulan’ [or] ‘Hercules’ ― and though those characters aren’t transgender, they do change. First for someone else, then for themselves. I’ve ventured into anime and other animated genres, but the classics never lose their shine.”

Disney’s animated movies and characters gave many LGBTQs a window to understand themselves.

“Ariel [from ‘The Little Mermaid’] gave me some of my first trans inklings,” says Rebecca (last name withheld), a trans lesbian from Virginia.

For other LGBTQ Disney lovers, Disney has central to building a kind of life that they never experienced as children.

“It’s an indulgence of an innocence I don’t remember having in childhood,” says Liz Hart, a queer Disney fan in Oregon. “I do think it can be judged as silly or tacky or uncool by a lot of the LGBTQ community, though, which makes me sad.”

Hart says she identifies with the themes in Disney films.

“Like not having both/any parents, being brave when I don’t want to, and believing in myself, as well as loving to sing all the time like some butchy Snow White,” Hart says. “But when I’m at a Disney park I have no fear, I always have a smile, and the outside world is dead to me.”

Disney recently delighted LGBTQ fans with the brief but powerful inclusion of gay character Lefou in last year’s live action release of “Beauty & The Beast.” I cried the first time I saw it in the theater, and the audience cheered when Lefou danced with another man at the end of the film. I haven’t met Lefou in the parks yet, but I hope to someday.

There are so many LGBTQ people who feel a deep connection to Disney since 1991 there has been an annual large LGBTQ meet-up in the parks called Gay Days. During Gay Days, attendees are encouraged to wear red shirts, and many include rainbow mickeys or other queer coded images. Although Gay Days is not officially sponsored by Disney, they are considered unofficially official because characters and cast members are aware of what the red shirts mean, and are known for paying special attention to LGBTQ visitors during Gay Days.

It’s worth noting Disney also sells many rainbow/pride souvenirs available in the parks year round. That kind of celebration adds an integral sense of safety that many LGBTQ people find within Disneyland and World.

“Disney is my safe haven,” says Nat Le Brun. “It’s happy and magical and, as a Little, gives me somewhere to dive right in and feel that beauty of innocence that I never had as a child. As a non-binary Aspie physically disabled lesbian in a very neurotypical heteronormative world it helps me break down barriers.”

“I visit Disneyland a fair amount and I love seeing the baby queers there with their chosen families,” says Rizzo, a Mexican, agender queer femme in the Bay Area. “It is a sacred space where we can be who we are in all our flamboyant queerness and feel like nothing bad will happen. I have seen princesses even treat queers a little more special, cooing over their magical green hair or their pretty clothing. And queers beam, and I have held friends as they cried because, unlike so many other people in their lives, a princess recognized their queer magic and accepted it.”In an attempt to end inequality in the justice system, Manhattan’s district attorney has vowed to stop prosecuting minor marijuana cases.

District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced the new policy Tuesday, promising to decline to prosecute marijuana possession or smoking cases. His decision, which takes effect on Aug. 1., comes after the DA’s office spent six months analyzing places in the United States where marijuana has been decriminalized.

“The dual mission of the Manhattan D.A.’s Office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,” Vance said in a press release. “The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.”

The Manhattan DA’s office is working with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York police commissioner to establish when exceptions to the new policy might be necessary.

De Blasio hinted at the policy change during a conference earlier Tuesday, announcing that the New York Police Department would “overhaul” its policies on enforcing marijuana cases in the next 30 days.

I'm announcing today that the NYPD will overhaul its marijuana enforcement policies in the next 30 days. We must end unnecessary arrests and end disparity in enforcement. — Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) May 15, 2018

Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez also asserted his stance on marijuana cases Tuesday by highlighting a pilot program launched three months ago by his office.

As a part of the pilot program, the Brooklyn DA’s office, according to Gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute “some instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.”

“I believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,” Gonzalez said. “Since 2014, the Brooklyn DA’s Office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does not adversely affect public safety.”

Tuesday’s announcements suggest that New York ― a state currently exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana altogether, as other states have ― is starting to more forcefully tackle the disproportionate rates at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

A New York Times analysis published Sunday revealed that in New York City, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years.

The rates were even worse in Manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people.

The Manhattan DA’s office findings echoed the Times’ research.

Noting the racial disparity of marijuana arrests, the Manhattan DA’s office said Tuesday that “large numbers of New Yorkers become further alienated from law enforcement and removed from community participation at an enormous cost to the criminal justice system, for virtually no punitive, rehabilitative or deterrent purpose.”St. Louis Police officers Joseph Rushmore / For HuffPost

WASHINGTON ― A journalist has filed a lawsuit against the city of St. Louis and its officers, saying police assaulted him during his arrest at a demonstration where they rounded up protesters en masse in an unconstitutional crackdown last year.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Mike Faulk, 32, was one of the many people the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department arrested during a protest in downtown St. Louis following a not guilty verdict in a criminal case against a former officer who shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith back in 2011. That night, St. Louis police officers chanted that the streets belonged to them, and the head of the police department declared they “owned” the night.

The lawsuit, filed on Friday, alleged that police violated Faulk’s rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendments.

“Mr. Faulk’s unlawful arrest and assault by the SLMPD resulted in Mr. Faulk spending 13 hours in the St. Louis City jail and has caused continuing psychological and professional distress,” his attorneys said in the lawsuit.

The American Civil Liberties Union had also filed a suit on behalf of several clients over the tactics police employed. It also obtained a preliminary injunction from a federal judge who found that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in proving police violated their rights protected by the First and Fourth amendments. U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry said in a November ruling that the evidence illustrated that St. Louis Metropolitan Police officers “exercised their discretion in an arbitrary and retaliatory fashion to punish protesters for voicing criticism of police or recording police conduct.”

This lawsuit was filed on Faulk’s behalf by attorney David Nelson as well as lawyers with ArchCity Defenders, an St. Louis organization, which has done extensive work to fix the fractured and troubled court system in the region.

Faulk, according to the suit, was “raised with a tremendous respect for law enforcement and the justice system,” as his mother served in as district attorney in Alabama. Faulk had “previously covered mass demonstrations in the U.S., Nicaragua, and Honduras” but had never been arrested.

That changed in downtown St. Louis. The suit alleges that officers used their full weight to tackle Faulk to the ground and that he sustained injuries to his neck, shoulders, hips and legs.

“One of the Defendant Doe Police Officers... placed his boot onto Mr. Faulk’s head and used his weight to press Mr. Faulk’s head into the asphalt of the street. Despite cries of pain from Mr. Faulk, the officer continued to press Mr. Faulk’s head against the ground,” lawyers said in the lawsuit.

Faulk was then directly pepper sprayed in the face, they said, and the “excruciating pain” made it impossible for him to see for two hours.

The lawsuit alleges that Faulk saw officers giving high-fives and smoking cigars. “We arrested more than 100 of you clowns tonight,” one officer reportedly said.

The Post-Dispatch, according to the lawsuit prohibited Faulk from reporting on the protests or on any police departments.

“Mr. Faulk now believes that it is unlikely that he can continue his journalistic career in St. Louis because editors concerned about a perceived conflict of interest will not permit him to report on the broad scope of governmental issues for which he was hired. Further, he is significantly less likely to cover protests in the future for fear of assault by police,” according to the lawsuit.

Faulk, like other arrestees, is still facing a pending “failure to disperse” charge. The Post-Dispatch has called on prosecutors to drop the charges.
