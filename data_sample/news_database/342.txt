House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Sunday he wasn’t planning on leaving Congress any time soon, but he also didn’t disclose whether he will serve another term in the House of Representatives.

There has been speculation Ryan could soon step aside as speaker, but his office has strongly dismissed those rumors. When CBS host John Dickerson asked Ryan if he would remain for another term should House Republicans retain control of Congress’ lower chamber in November, he declined to answer.

“I’m not gonna share my thinking with you before I even talk to my wife,” Ryan said in an interview on CBS’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday. “We’re doing fine, I have no plans of going anywhere anytime soon, but that’s something my wife and I always decide in late spring of the election year.”President Donald Trump suggested Sunday that Republican senators should use their majority to bypass Democrats and pass a long-term budget, effectively ending the government shutdown.

Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.’s! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2018

Trump has steadfastly blamed Democrats for the shutdown that began Friday night after Congress was unable to agree on short-term funding for the federal government, despite his party’s majority grip on the House and Senate.

In his tweet Sunday, Trump pushed for an end to a Senate filibuster currently blocking a vote on the budget. It normally takes a supermajority of 60 senators out of the full 100 to end a filibuster and pass legislation. But Trump suggested Republicans override the opposing Democrats by using the “nuclear option,” which would allow a simple majority of 51 senators to end the filibuster and pass a long-term budget.

The nuclear option has been used just two times in the history of the Senate. In 2013, Senate Democrats used it to eliminate filibusters on executive branch and federal judicial appointments outside of the Supreme Court. In 2017, Trump encouraged Senate Republicans to use it to end filibusters on Supreme Court appointments as well, effectively advancing Justice Neil Gorsuch’s appointment to the bench.

During an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the government shutdown proves the Senate should kill the filibuster rule all together.

“We’ve been critical of that 60-vote rule since the president took office,” Mulvaney said. “I think what the president did this morning was try to shed some light on the fact that if ordinary rules prevailed, the majority ruled in the Senate, the government would be open today.”

But the Senate has long been held up as the “world’s greatest deliberative body” and many of its members, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.,) worry ending the filibuster rule would threaten its integrity.

“I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers,” Durbin said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

“We have to acknowledge a respect for the minority and that’s what the Senate tries to do in its composition and in its procedure,” he continued.Deployed U.S. servicemen and women aren’t going without the National Football League during the government shutdown.

On Saturday, reports surfaced that the American Forces Network would be unable to broadcast the league’s conference championship games on Sunday because it was considered one of many non-essential government programs to be shut down after Congress failed to reach a budget deal. The news upset many, and the push began to reverse the network’s closure.

AFN Director Col. Dave Honchul tweeted on Sunday morning that “we’ve been given limited services and have brought back two channels ― AFN News and AFN Sports.”

It gives me great pleasure to announce that we've been given limited services and have brought back two channels -- AFN News and AFN Sports. I thank you for your patience. - Col Dave Honchul, Director, AFN — AFN Broadcasting (@AFNtelevision) January 21, 2018

While the network’s staff would normally be furloughed during the shutdown, the AFN’s television and radio broadcasts have been deemed “essential” services.

The Department of Defense determined that despite the shutdown, “the operational necessity of television and radio broadcasts constitutes them as essential activities,” Dana W. White, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement to HuffPost. “We will continue to find solutions to support our troops at home and abroad. Congress must come to a resolution, support our troops and pass a budget soon.”

A few companies offered to help find solutions for the deployed troops over the weekend. The NFL stepped in on Saturday to offer free NFL Game Pass streaming accounts to USO facilities worldwide.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that she was “glad our brave men and women” in the armed services would be able to watch the games.

Sanders has consistently defended President Donald Trump’s barrage of criticism of NFL players who have protested racial injustices during the national anthem. Trump called on fans to boycott games at a September rally in Alabama, and continued to denounce the league for months after.WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, rejected President Donald Trump’s call to get rid of the filibuster to let the GOP pass legislation without any help from Democrats.

As the government heads into day two of its first shutdown since 2013, Trump tweeted Sunday morning that an easy way to end the ordeal would be for Senate Republicans to just change the chamber’s rules. Budget legislation currently needs 60 votes to pass in the 100-seat Senate ― which Republicans control with 51 members.

Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.

Trump has made this suggestion before, and senators in his party have always rebuffed it ― as they did again Sunday.

“Now, we all know in the Senate the minority has the power to filibuster,” Kentucky’s McConnell said on the floor Sunday afternoon. “I support that right from an institutional point of view, but the question is, when do you use it?”

Other GOP senators also made clear they have no desire to change the rules simply because the president wants them to.

“Power to the Polls” kicked off at 10 a.m. local time in Sam Boyd Stadium, about 10 miles east of the Las Vegas Strip. Over 4,000 people planned to attend the event, according to its Facebook page. The line-up of speakers included Cher, civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), and Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards.

“The Women’s March fueled a feminist revolution,” Richards said. “White women, listen up. We’ve got to do better. ... It is not up to women of color to save this country from itself. That’s on all of us.”

“Last year, we dared to hope for a better, brighter, more inclusive world,” she continued. “And this year, we’re going to go out and build it.”

Event organizers chose to host “Power to the Polls” in Nevada for several reasons, including its high-profile Senate race ― incumbent Dean Heller is rated by many analysts as the most vulnerable Republican senator seeking re-election this year. A couple of the state’s House races also are expected to be competitive.

“Power to the Polls” followed hundreds of sister marches on Saturday, which brought thousands of protesters to cities nationwide, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Demonstrations continued on Sunday in several U.S. cities and over a dozen other countries.

After this weekend’s anniversary events, the Women’s March founders will begin a national tour of 10 battleground states to encourage Americans to take political action. They’ll partner with local progressive groups to host town halls, candidate trainings, rallies and voter registration events ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

“The national voter registration tour will target swing states to register new voters, engage impacted communities, harness our collective energy to advocate for policies and candidates that reflect our values, and collaborate with our partners to elect more women and progressives candidates to office,” according to the event’s website.

Organizers and participants shared photos and videos from the event on Twitter:

The stunning statement came in a brief telephone interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. Eric was in Mar-a-Lago filling in for his dad at $100,000-a-couple festivities to celebrate the president’s first year in office. Donald Trump stayed behind in Washington after talks broke down among senators Friday night over a short-term funding agreement to keep the government operating.

Democrats were seeking a deal to protect undocumented DACA immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Trump was seeking full funding for a wall on the Mexican border and an increased military budget. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) complained Saturday that dealing with Trump was like “negotiating with Jello.”

“Honestly, I think it’s a good thing for us, Judge, because people see through it,” Trump’s second son told Pirro. He claimed Democrats refused to reach an agreement simply to sabotage his father.

“The only reason [Democrats] want to shut down government is to distract and to stop his momentum,” Eric Trump said. “My father has had incredible momentum. He’s gotten more done in one year than arguably any president in history. How do [Democrats] divert from that message? ... They obstruct, they distract, they try to place blame.”

He called his father the “hardest working person I’ve ever met in my life. He has the Democrats absolutely terrified.”

The president plugged his son’s appearance on Fox News in a tweet, then retweeted quotes by Eric praising the president. Trump did not tweet the comment about a government shutdown being “good for us.”

The quote joins a list of startling remarks by Eric Trump. Just days ago he defended his father against charges of racism, telling “Fox & Friends” that his dad couldn’t possibly be racist because he only “sees one color: green.”

Republicans have tried to place the blame for a shutdown on the Democrats, calling it a “Schumer shutdown.”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― The federal government is currently shut down, but a couple of thorns in the side of President Donald Trump are still up and operating.

Congress was unable to pass a spending bill late Friday night, shutting down everything but what is considered the “essential” parts of the federal government. Social Security checks are still being processed, the military is still working (although troops won’t get paid until afterward) and air traffic controllers are still helping keep the skies clear.

Meanwhile, much of the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will stop ― right at the height of the flu season ― and about 800,000 federal employees will be furloughed until Congress resolves the issue.

And one thing that is still going: Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

The Justice Department confirmed this week that employees in Mueller’s office are exempt from the shutdown and can continue their work. His office is not funded through the regular congressional appropriations process.

So the probe, which Trump desperately wants shut down, is going on even as other government functions cease.

Similarly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ― one of conservatives’ least favorite agencies ― continues operations during a shutdown. The agency gets its money from the Federal Reserve, not Congress, even though many Republicans have argued it should, so that they can exert more control over the agency.

For years, Republicans have tried to block the CFPB, which was first proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) when she was still in academia. Rich Cordray, who served as CFPB chair under President Barack Obama, recently stepped down to run for governor in Ohio. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney is the interim head.

As a congressman, Mulvaney called the bureau a “joke ... in a sad, sick kind of way.” And in his most recent budget request, Mulvaney asked for zero dollars for the agency, making clear where the Trump administration stands on the bureau set up to protect consumers.President Donald Trump has said he will only help undocumented young people he put in jeopardy if he gets a border wall and massive changes to legal immigration policy. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

WASHINGTON ― It only took a government shutdown for President Donald Trump to return to his original campaign message: Undocumented immigrants are dangerous and out to get Americans.

Trump’s campaign released an ad on Saturday that pinned murders committed by undocumented immigrants directly on Democrats who are pushing for relief for so-called Dreamers, young people who came to the U.S. as children.

“President Trump is right: Build the wall. Deport criminals. Stop illegal immigration now,” a voiceover says. “Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.”

The ad shows House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before cutting to video of an undocumented immigrant on trial for killing two police officers.

All three lawmakers are advocates of immigration reform and oppose Trump’s border wall, but they aren’t open borders advocates or defenders of murder; the bills they’ve pushed exempt violent criminals from protections and include border security measures. Schumer even said he offered Trump funding for his wall on Friday, but that the president declined the deal.

But calling Democrats “complicit” in murder fit in with the White House’s messaging on the government shutdown, which happened when the Senate failed to pass a short-term government funding bill by the end of Friday. Most of the Senate Democratic caucus, plus four Republicans, voted against the bill, many of them saying they would not support funding without a fix for the 700,000 undocumented young people Trump put at risk of deportation by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

While Trump and the White House have occasionally referred to those young people, often called Dreamers, in fairly sympathetic terms, they’re now characterizing them as “unlawful immigrants” whom Democrats insist on helping.

It’s a return to form for Trump, who launched his campaign by claiming that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border, has called for a U.S.-Mexico border wall and has highlighted crimes committed by people without legal status in the country.

While some undocumented immigrants do commit crimes separate from immigration, numerous studies have disputed the idea that immigrants are bringing more crime into the country.

Trump and his administration have also repeatedly attacked Democrats for their immigration stances. As part of a campaign against so-called “sanctuary cities,” a term for jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with deportation efforts to some degree, the administration has floated the idea of criminally prosecuting local officials.WASHINGTON ― A bipartisan group of centrist senators met Sunday to work out a potential compromise that would fund the government until Feb. 8, contingent on a promise to hold a vote on an immigration bill before then.

In exchange for more Democratic votes to reopen the government, GOP leadership would need to offer some sort of commitment to help the so-called “Dreamers” in coming weeks, according to several senators who attended the meeting in the office of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Capitol Hill.

It’s not clear, however, whether enough Democrats would accept a simple verbal commitment from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that the Senate would consider an immigration bill at some point in the future. He already pledged to do so last month, for example.

“There’s been a lot of promises made to different senators that have not been followed through on by the majority leader, so I would be very leery of anything that wasn’t extremely, extremely clear and detailed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oreg.) said.

President Donald Trump necessitated a legislative fix for Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ― when he ended former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting them at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief. The program expires in early March, putting pressure on Congress to reach a solution to protect 700,000 young people from deportation.

The bipartisan group of roughly 20 senators presented the terms of the potential deal to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who spoke about it privately later. The group included Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.)

There’s no deal at this time, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. McConnell on Sunday night delayed a vote on a three-week stop-gap measure to fund the government, moving it from about 1 a.m. Monday to noon on Monday. He also upped the stakes to pressure those who had previously opposed the deal, saying on the Senate floor that he intended to hold a vote on an immigration bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8, should the government reopen.

Murkowski said McConnell was “receptive” to the deal worked out by the moderate senators, but that it was ultimately up to him and Schumer to come to an agreement on funding the government.

“I think it was important for him to hear the direction that we had gained from these broader groups,” Murkowski said.

The White House has said that the issue of immigration should not be considered until government funding is approved. House Republican leaders also rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote until Democrats vote to reopen the government.

During a Sunday interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) dismissed a bipartisan immigration framework brokered by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) as an “end run” around existing negotiations.

In a sign the two sides were no closer to reaching an agreement, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) also poured cold water over the prospect of committing to a vote on an immigration bill before Feb. 8.

“We’re more than happy to have a vote on it well before the deadline,” Cornyn said of a legislative fix on DACA. “Turning the agenda over to Democrats who just shut down the government makes no sense to me. It just seems like it encourages bad behavior.”

Asked if he thinks the government will still be shut down on Monday, Cornyn added, “Right now, yeah. I do.”Viola Davis told attendees of the Women’s March in Los Angeles, California, to know that time’s up on overlooking women of color in mainstream feminist movements.

The “How To Get Away With Murder” actress gave a powerful Saturday speech in which she began with a history lesson in Jim Crow laws and the black, Latinx and Native Americans they oppressed.

“And the reason why these Jim Crow laws were in place have stifled my rights and your rights is because we fell asleep,” she said. “We fall asleep when we’re moving ahead and we don’t look to the left and right and see that we’re not including people ... Because really, at the end of the day, we only move forward when it doesn’t cost us anything. But I’m here today saying that no one and nothing can be great unless it costs you something.”

The Oscar-winning actress went on to talk about the #MeToo movement and the nameless girls and boys who disproportionately fall victim to sexual harassment but aren’t able to use their voices.

“When I raise my hand, I am aware of all the women who are still in silence. The women who are faceless,” she said. “The women who don’t have the money and don’t have the constitution and who don’t have the confidence and who don’t have the images in our media that gives them a sense of self-worth enough to break their silence that is rooted in the shame of assault, that’s rooted in the stigma of assault.”

Davis highlighted that black women who have spoken out against sexual harassment, from Fannie Lou Hamer to Tarana Burke, did so at a price.

“Nothing and no one can be great without a cost. I am always introduced as an award-winning actor, but my testimony is one of poverty, of one being assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. I know that every single day when I think of that, I know the trauma of those events are still with me today ... That’s what allows me to listen to the women who still sit in silence.”

She left the attendees with a simple request: that they not just clap because the messages sound good, but that they actively seek progress for all.Melania Trump's tweet shows a view of the crowd. Melania Trump/Twitter

Twitter users have been poring over photos of a recent White House event honoring military spouses and moms, wondering why there appeared to be no male spouses and few people of color.

Wednesday’s gathering was held as President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at expanding government job opportunities for military spouses.

Photos from the event, and one posted on Ivanka Trump’s Twitter page featuring a “listening session” with military spouses last year, show an audience overwhelmingly dominated by white women. The first daughter also posted a photo featuring members of the Air Force Officers’ Spouses’ Club at an April luncheon where she spoke. Those spouses, too, were overwhelmingly white and female.

Racial and ethnic minority groups made up 40 percent of Defense Department active-duty military members in 2015, up from 25 percent in 1990, according to the Pew Research Center.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jim Johannson, assistant executive director for USA Hockey and the general manager of the 2018 American Olympic team without NHL players, has died at the age of 53.

USA Hockey announced that Johannson passed away in his sleep early Sunday morning at his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Full statement from USOC CEO @ScottBlackmun: pic.twitter.com/9iN9SlFY75 — U.S. Olympic News (@USOlympicNews) January 21, 2018

“We are beyond shocked and profoundly saddened,” USA Hockey executive director Pat Kelleher said in a statement. “As accomplished as Jim was in hockey, he was the absolute best, most humble, kind and caring person you could ever hope to meet. His impact on our sport and more importantly the people and players in our sport have been immeasurable. Our condolences go out to his entire family, but especially to his loving wife Abby and their young daughter Ellie.”

Johannson was with USA Hockey since 2000 in various roles. During his time, Team USA won 64 medals (34 gold, 19 silver, 11 bronze) in international tournaments.

He played college hockey at Wisconsin (1982-86), helping the Badgers win an NCAA title his freshman year. He played for the United States in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, scoring two goals. He was drafted by the Hartford Whalers in the seventh round in 1982 but didn’t make it to the NHL, playing in the International Hockey League from 1987 to 1994.

Johannson helped assemble the 2018 men’s team, which will be using non-NHL players for the first time since the 1994 Olympics. Tony Granato, one of Johannson’s teammates on the 1988 team, is the coach of this year’s U.S. Olympic team for the Games starting Feb. 9 in South Korea.

“Jim’s positive influence was enormous and will be felt for generations to come,” said Jim Smith, president of USA Hockey. “He was widely respected across the world and his genuine nature helped advance our sport in so many ways. Today, we are a medal contender every time we put a team on the ice for international competition, and he played a major role in helping us get to that point. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his entire family. It’s a sad day for all of us.”Mo’Nique wants folks to boycott Netflix after claiming the platform offered her much less than white and male comedians.

She called out the streaming service for offering her $500,000 for a comedy special when Amy Schumer, Chris Rock, Dave Chapelle and others received millions more.

A post shared by Mo'nique (@therealmoworldwide) on Jan 19, 2018 at 5:54am PST

“I am asking that you stand with me and boycott Netflix for gender bias and color bias,” she said in an Instagram video posted on Friday. “I was offered a $500,000 deal last week to do a comedy special. However, Amy Schumer was offered $11 million; Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle, $20 million. Then Amy Schumer went back and renegotiated 2 more million dollars because she said, ‘I shouldn’t get what the men are getting; they’re legends. However, I should get more,’ and Netflix agreed.”

The Oscar-winning actress said executives told her that they believed their offer is “what Mo’Nique will bring.”

“And then Netflix said, ‘By the way, we believe Mo’Nique is a legend, too,’” she continued. “Why shouldn’t I get what the legends are getting?”

Many people on social media offered their support to Mo’Nique, including comedian Wanda Sykes, who claimed to have had a pay disparity experience with Netflix, too.

“@MoWorldWide, thank you for speaking out,” Sykes tweeted on Sunday. ”@Netflix offered me less than half of your $500K. I was offended but found another home.”

A Netflix spokesperson told Variety that the company doesn’t “comment on contract negotiations.”

Mo’Nique, whose 2007 standup show “I Could’ve Been Your Cellmate” is currently airing on Netflix, has been outspoken in the past about discrimination issues in Hollywood. The actress also claimed that she was “blackballed” by filmmaker Lee Daniels from the industry because she didn’t join in the awards campaign for his 2009 movie “Precious.”NEW YORK ― Marsha Annon and Yong Lee didn’t attend the 2017 Women’s March on Washington. Annon, 44, had never been to a protest in her life before Saturday. But she and Lee, 42, decided to take their 7-year-old daughter to the 2018 Women’s March in New York City, joining more than 200,000 marchers locally and hundreds of thousands more around the world.

“It’s time for change,” said Annon, who told HuffPost that it was #MeToo, specifically the Aziz Ansari story, that pushed her to march. “We need to stop making excuses, and I don’t want my daughter to grow up in a world where she feels pressured to do things that she’s uncomfortable doing.”

The day after President Donald Trump was sworn in last year, women and men across the country took to the streets, making the first Women’s March the largest single-day protest in U.S. history. A year later, on the day of a government shutdown, the energy and rage are still there, bolstered by the #MeToo movement and anger at an administration that has been actively hostile to the rights of women and other marginalized groups.

In New York, the march spanned more than 20 blocks and two avenues. Marchers of all ages, genders and backgrounds carried signs with slogans like “Grab him by the midterms,” “Harasshole,” “I miss science,” “Stop tearing families apart,” “Nasty women from shithole countries,” “Together we rise,” and “Fuck this shit.”

Despite a year that several women described to HuffPost as “hard” and “draining,” marchers seemed prepared to call their representatives and protest in the streets for the next three years.

“After marching many times, I would march next year and the year after that, and I would continue marching,” said Tessa Cahill, 11, who marched in D.C. with her family in 2017.

Though the themes of the 2018 march remained largely the same as last year’s, many women pointed to the #MeToo movement, which kicked off in earnest this past October, when asked why they were marching again.

“I feel optimistic, especially with so many women coming out in the #MeToo movement [and] in Time’s Up,” Danielle Sabalvaro, 26, told HuffPost. “Enough is enough at this point ― especially after this past year. So I think we have a lot of momentum coming into this year.”

Nikki Vargas, 30, said she had protested and marched before Trump was elected, but was especially energized this past year by #MeToo and her identity as a Colombian immigrant.

“This march is even different from the last one because of the #MeToo movement and the spotlight on sexual assault victims,” Vargas told HuffPost. “There’s a lot more rage and a lot more anger in this march, and I think we’re going to see a lot of women out there defending those who didn’t have a voice before.”

Another clear difference between this march and the one in 2017 was an effort to work for inclusiveness and intersectionality from day one. The original march, which grew out of two Facebook events created by white women, drew criticism for not initially doing so.

The founders of the Women’s March changed the name of the event from the “Million Women’s March” ― the name of a 1997 black women’s march ― brought seasoned organizers Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory and Carmen Perez on as national co-chairs, and say they have since spent a lot of time discussing and reflecting on white privilege and the problems with white feminism.

“I think it was important for all of us to talk about the ubiquity of white privilege and how we all had been basically skating on this privilege without really naming it or addressing it for a very long time,” said Bob Bland, a co-founder of the march. “We learned about the history and the ways we were causing harm and trauma to communities of color, and we centered women of color in leadership and became intentional as white women about holding space.”

Many women brought signs to the march that emphasized inclusivity. Veronica Pazmino, 28, in New York with an indigenous women’s group from Mexico, said she wore red to honor indigenous women.

“I just really wanted to show solidarity and stand with all my sisters here today, all native sisters, all trans sisters,” she told HuffPost. “And I really feel like it’s important to stand together, be inclusive, not exclusive. This is about all groups of women, not just certain groups of women. Be intersectional and not be like, oh, this is only for certain groups and not the others.”

Majella Mark, 31, carried a sign that nodded to “pro-life feminists,” despite the fact that she supports abortion rights and that feminism has traditionally shunned the anti-abortion community. “There’s women who really are dedicated to gender equality, and their perspective is just different, and that’s OK,” she said.

The march still drew some criticism this year, and some women of color chose not to attend, citing lack of intersectionality and other reasons.

But Bland said she is encouraged by the movement’s evolution.

“The miracle of this year is people putting away any past differences ― or more accurately, talking about them ― and having the courageous conversations that needed to be had with each other,” she said.

“I would say our greatest victories are ahead of us. The true promise of the Women’s March hasn’t yet been met.” - Bob Bland, Women's March Co-Founder and National Co-Chair

One year into Trump’s presidency, demonstrators see the Women’s March as a jumping off point rather than an end goal. And with the midterm elections just months away, that’s where many of the marchers plan to direct their energy. That’s also where the Women’s March organization has directed its efforts, via the Power to the Polls campaign, which kicks off on Sunday in Las Vegas.

“It’s a marathon fight, not a sprint,” said Marianna Martinelli, 35. “Now it’s 2018, we’ve got our eyes on November and trying to support candidates that are gonna be able to make a change in D.C. So I think we know that it’s gonna be the long haul. It’s not guns blazing ― we’ve gotta keep the pace, keep fighting.”

“It’s wonderful to see this kind of turnout,” echoed Sydney Crawford, 83, who has been marching since the 1960s when she fought for civil rights alongside Martin Luther King Jr. “I was with a group in Virginia, and we took 12 seats in the state legislature and got the governorship. People came out and voted, and it was really inspirational.”

Bland shares the optimism of the New York marchers.

“I would say our greatest victories are ahead of us,” she said. “The true promise of the Women’s March hasn’t yet been met.”Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that Democrats were to blame for the shutdown of the federal government, claiming the party was “holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration.”

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) was not having any of it.

Duckworth, an Army veteran who lost both her legs in the line of duty, minced no words on the Senate floor as she lambasted the president’s tweet on Saturday. Calling him a “five-deferment draft dodger,” Duckworth described Trump’s comments as the “latest example of him failing to show leadership to take responsibility for leading this nation.”

“Does he even know that there are service members who are in harm’s way right now, watching him, looking for their commander in chief to show leadership, rather than to try to deflect blame?” Duckworth asked. “Or that his own Pentagon says that ... the short-term funding plans he seems intent on pushing is (sic) actually harmful to not just the military, but to our national security?”

“I spent my entire adult life looking out for the well-being, the training, the equipping of the troops for whom I was responsible,” she continued. “Sadly, this is something the current occupant of the Oval Office does not seem to care to do, and I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger.”

The senator ― a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who served in the Iraq War ― went on to criticize Trump for his “baiting” of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: if you cared about our military, you’d stop baiting [Kim] into a war that could put 85,000 American troops and millions of innocent civilians in danger,” Duckworth said. She added that if Trump “truly cared” about servicemen and women, he’d “stop hiding behind his Twitter account, stop blaming everyone else, and tell his party ... to do their job.”

In her speech, the senator urged her colleagues to work together to get to a full budget, saying lawmakers should follow in the footsteps of “our troops.”

“We can compromise. We can do this together,” she said. “Our troops know how to work together. They stand shoulder to shoulder when they protect and defend this country. We surely, in these chambers, can do the same. Let’s stop blaming each other and let’s get to work.”Beck Bennett popped up on “Saturday Night Live” to play a libidinous version of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to take another crack at convincing us how “not fat the president is.”

Lampooning Jackson’s recent press conference and his stellar review of a healthy president, Bennett gushed that Donald Trump weighs in at a “very svelte 239 pounds” with a “gorgeous 44-inch Coke-bottle waist” and “legs that ... seem to go on forever.”

“It’s my expert medical opinion that the president’s got a rockin’ bod with the perfect amount of cushion for the pushin’— and if I could, I would.”

“Reporter” Cecily Strong noted that people are skeptical about Trump’s perfect health report because they’ve “taken one look” at the president. Kate McKinnon asked: “How broke that brain?” Bennett assured her that Trump passed his cognitive exam with “flying colors, almost no hints” (and he “crushed the Tide Pod Challenge.”) The doc conceded, however, that the test isn’t given to judge intelligence, but to “make sure someone’s not severely brain damaged.”

Colin Jost noted later in “Weekend Update” that the cognitive exam included drawing a clock. The “last president to fail this test,” said Jost, was “Lincoln after the play.”“Saturday Night Live” chameleon Kate McKinnon pulled off yet another dead-on impression of a Washington personality, this time conjuring up a barely-contained, gleeful Robert Mueller.

The “Weekend Update” sketch featured McKinnon as the long-faced, toothpick-chewing special counsel who’s so excited about getting the goods on the White House crew. But “Mueller” strains not to spill the beans about his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Asked by Colin Jost how the investigation is going, McKinnon’s Mueller battles not to say anything too revealing, hemming, hawing and smiling wickedly, until she says: “Yeah, we good.”

But McKinnon is dying to say so much more.

“I mean,” she adds, squirming. “You just wait ... you’ll see. Situation’s under control. You gotta remember I have actual footage ... I want to tell you so bad, I can’t. ... It’s gonna be fun ... oh man ... Don Jr. he wrote in his Venmo description, ‘Russia ...’”

“Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, don’t do this,” she talks herself down.

“Mueller” gets serious when Jost asks about the possibility that the special counsel could be fired by the president. “It’s a little late for that,” the former G-man responds. “The cat’s already out of the bag. And the bag’s full of … how do I say this ... Michael Flynn’s wiretaps.”

The self-satisfied ’“Mueller” adds: “Colin, you gotta understand: The guy didn’t leave me a trail of bread crumbs. He left me full loaves ... seven-grain loaves straight from Panera Bread. I’m having a blast.”Rapper Cardi B attempted to defend her fiancé, Offset, from criticism that his lyrics are homophobic, but her words missed the mark.

Migos member Offset was featured on YFN Lucci’s new song “Boss Life,” where he delivers a line that goes: “I cannot vibe with queers.” Even though the song was released in December, criticism grew this week, and Offset’s Thursday apology argued that he didn’t “mean someone’s who is gay.”

Cardi B defended that point in a video on Sunday, saying she’s never seen her fiancé act differently with members of the LGBTQ community.

“It has a different vocabulary on the dictionary,” Cardi said in her video. “Now if that’s a word that you guys said is a bad word for gays, I’ve never even heard that word in the first place. Why don’t y’all educate people? A lot of people are not aware about what’s wrong or right in the LGBTQ community.”

Despite her well intentions, Cardi B’s argument that it’s the duty of marginalized people to educate others on their community is problematic.

incase you missed it, here is cardi b committing career suicide (part 1.) pic.twitter.com/zYgSsuw8C9 — tًroy (@toynamedtroy) January 21, 2018

Cardi continued to say that she thought she was making a “perfect point” and that others would just want to argue.

“What is the point of the debate and this, this and that?” she said in her video. “You’re not educated, and that’s what’s important, to educate. Period.”

Different communities have tried to push across the point that it is not their duty to educate those in the majority about their struggles for years now. Director Ava DuVernay possibly said it best in a Los Angeles Magazine interview in 2016, where she argued that the onus isn’t on the marginalized “because we didn’t build the problem.”

“If I’m forward-thinking and know that there is inequity, I should not need the transgender woman to take time out of her experience to educate me,” DuVernay told the Los Angeles Magazine.

There is nothing wrong with the word “queer” when used in certain contexts. It is a term reclaimed by many in the LGBTQ community in order to describe their identity. But there also exists a painful history of people using “queer” in a derogatory manner ― and Offset’s lyric seems, to many, to play into that negative historical use of this term.

AdvertisementJust days after the House passed its version of the federal tax law slashing corporate tax rates, House Speaker Paul Ryan collected nearly $500,000 in campaign contributions from billionaire energy mogul Charles Koch and his wife, according to a recent campaign donor report.

Koch and his brother David spent millions of dollars to get the tax law passed and are spending millions more in a public relations campaign in an attempt to boost support for the law, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Koch Industries, one of the largest private corporations in the nation, operates refineries and manufactures a variety of products. The new tax law — which slices corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent, slashes estate taxes and includes a special deduction for oil and gas investors — is expected to save the Koch brothers and their businesses billions of dollars in taxes.

Just 13 days after the tax law was passed, Charles Koch and his wife, Elizabeth, donated nearly $500,000 to Ryan’s joint fundraising committee, according to a campaign finance report filed Thursday.

Five other donors, including billionaire businessmen Jeffery Hildebrand and William Parfet, each contributed $100,000 in the last quarter of 2017, according to the records.

“It looks like House Speaker Ryan is quickly being rewarded for passing this legislation that overwhelmingly benefits the Kochs and billionaires like them,” Adam Smith, spokesman for campaign finance reform nonprofit Every Voice, told the International Business Times, which first reported the Koch contributions.

The Koch donations were paid into Team Ryan, which raises money for the speaker, the National Republican Congressional Committee and a PAC run by Ryan. On the same day, Charles and Elizabeth Koch also each donated $237,000 to the NRCC.

The Koch brothers, worth an estimated $100 billion together, have become the gorillas of dark money contributions distorting American democracy since the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which opened the door to unlimited campaign contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to outside groups. The brothers are using their massive wealth to push a political agenda that’s the “most hard-line libertarian philosophy” in America, according to Jane Mayer, author of Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.

Ryan reportedly has indicated to confidants that he won’t run again when his term is up this year, according to Politico, though he hasn’t made an official announcement. If he doesn’t run, his contributions would be redirected.Tennessee antifa mobilizing tomorrow to meet Nazis planning to protest the Women's March in Knoxville. https://t.co/WUs0kr7Px6 Here's video of Corey Lemley of @NashvilleARA telling me last October about the dangers anti-fascists face when confronting fascism and racism. pic.twitter.com/XA5oehXws0 — Luke O'Brien (@lukeobrien) January 21, 2018

MURFREESBORO, Tenn. ― We spotted our tail not long after the neo-Nazi rally ended: a black GMC Sierra pickup with tinted windows and silver trim. In my rear-view mirror, I could see the outlines of two men in the cab: big dudes with military haircuts and bull necks ― not-fucking-around types.

I turned left slowly. So did the pickup. At the end of the next block, I turned right. The pickup did too.

“Is that truck with you guys?” I asked Corey Lemley, an anti-fascist activist sitting in the passenger seat of my rental car. Lemley turned to look out the back window.

“Nope.”

It was the last weekend of October, and I’d come to middle Tennessee to cover a pair of “White Lives Matter” rallies thrown by several of the white supremacist groups responsible for the deadly carnage in Charlottesville in August. The League of the South, a Southern separatist group, had taken the lead in organizing the rallies, with support from other groups, including Matt Heimbach’s Traditionalist Worker Party, a neo-Nazi outfit.

Heimbach’s Nazis are returning to Tennessee to protest the Women’s March taking place in Knoxville on Sunday. The Nazis plan to attach themselves to a competing anti-abortion “March for Life” rally. How this will pan out for the fascists is anyone’s guess, but back in October, things didn’t go well for them in the Volunteer State. Heimbach’s crew started a fight with a biracial couple in a Brentwood pub. And their two rallies only put a spotlight on the weakness of their movement and the strength of their opposition. The second event, in Murfreesboro, was a total flop. Heimbach’s Nazis bailed, scared off by hundreds of counter-demonstrators who descended on Murfreesboro’s main square.

I’d been standing with those counter-demonstrators at the end of the rally when the crowd parted for a black-clad column of activists marching from the square ― Lemley’s crew, 50 militant anti-fascists, some of them members of Nashville Anti-Racist Action. (Many of the people in Lemley’s network will mobilize again to confront Heimbach anew.) People gawked and took photos. The ARA had a different air about them. They were ready to throw down. They were ready to go. Many had strips of tape across their chests with “Heather” written on them in tribute to Heather Heyer, the anti-fascist killed in Charlottesville when a car plowed into a crowd. A white supremacist has been charged with murder in the case.

“Murfreesboro, we got your back!” shouted one ARA member, as Lemley and the troop made their way down the street. His fellow antifa roared in response, “We got your back! We got your back!”

I’d interviewed Lemley a few days earlier over the phone. He was the local antifa front man, in part because he’d been organizing publicly in the Nashville area for months after white supremacists doxed him. We’d arranged to do a post-rally interview, this one on camera, and Lemley gave me the address of a safe house where I could pick him up to drive him to a HuffPost video team.

But when I’d arrived in my Ford Fusion Hybrid ― which, notably, allows a motorist to trade engine performance for efficiency with the push of an “EcoSelect” button ― I saw multiple police cruisers circling ominously through the quiet neighborhood. Vehicles with tinted windows idled at intersections. I would later learn that a drone had hovered over the safe house before the rally.

The GMC, though, was a more pressing concern. As soon as Lemley and another ARA member got into my car, the black pickup had appeared, right behind us, not even feigning subtlety after we doubled back on a side street.

“They’re definitely following us,” I said.

I stamped on the pedal of the Fusion and made a quick turn at a stop sign, then another one at a light. The GMC sped up and stayed on us. How was this possible? Murfreesboro was crawling with cops. Where were they now? And who was on our tail? This wasn’t Heimbach’s style.

I swung abruptly across traffic and pulled into a driveway across the street, leaving no way for the GMC to follow. The men in the pickup would have to make a move now. They drove past us and stopped. It looked like they were about to get out.

Lemley reached into a backpack at his feet.

“If they want it, they can get it,” he said.

He pulled out a .40 caliber Sig Sauer P226.

The gun chk-chkd as he chambered a round.

I’d been talking to antifa for months, hearing about the risks they took to fight fascism in America. Last April, somebody put a quarter stick of dynamite in Lemley’s mailbox and blew it to bits. In August, he’d been on the front lines in Charlottesville, part of an antifa defensive unit that fought off a battalion of League of the South racists who charged with weapons and shields at a group of clergy. (“Antifa saved my life twice,” said Rev. Seth Wispelwey, a local minister.)

The danger didn’t seem real until you experienced it. And the shock had less to do with the potential for bloodshed in America than the realization that organized political violence isn’t some distant, foreign problem. And that forces within our own country have stoked it.

Over the last year, far-right propagandists such as Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec have hyped antifa hysteria on social media, using the most garish images and examples of antifa dust-ups with racists and fascists to demonize the entirety of the left, as well as centrist liberals, the media and anyone who might challenge President Donald Trump’s MAGA agenda. Around the time I was in Murfreesboro, one of these operatives, Jeff Giesea, a Stanford University graduate and Peter Thiel associate who has, according to several of my sources, acted as a paymaster for far-right extremists online, tweeted that I, too, was antifa, then lied about it when I challenged him.

For conservatives, antifa are a convenient bogeyman, a faceless “commie” mob that allows the political right to engage in “both sides” rhetoric and distract from dangerous elements in the Republican base. There are reasons beyond gun sales that political organizations such as the National Rifle Association fearmonger about anti-fascists and invoke anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about George Soros mailing them checks. These lies, which create an easy out-group to hate, have permeated the minds of many on the right.

But I’d spent long hours getting to know antifa, and although they tended to be ardent personalities, their motivation was simple: to combat fascism, racism, misogyny, intolerance and inequality. Their tactics could, at times, be worrisome, and their anarchist and anti-capitalist views occasionally prompted a few of them to break the window of a Starbucks. As a result, they were vilified as a threat to the system in a way that violent white supremacist and fascist organizations, which routinely commit acts of domestic terrorism, were not.

Lemley and I watched the pickup across the street, waiting to see if someone would emerge. After the Murfreesboro rally ended, I’d been approached by a strange young man ― frail, well-groomed and painfully awkward in the manner of an internet goblin. Based on the questions he asked me about antifa, I made him as an alt-right spotter from the other camp. His eyes warily tracked the ARA activists as they left the town square. The alt-right tried to keep tabs on antifa. But this kind of aggressive pursuit felt off for them. It felt military.

“They could be militia,” I said to Lemley, referring to the far-right Three Percenter groups that often show up at Nazi rallies and stand with their backs to the fascists and long guns pointed at anti-fascists, seemingly looking for an excuse to shoot.

I reversed the Fusion out of the driveway and sped away in the direction we’d come. The truck did a U-turn and barreled after us. What happened next is hazy, but I remember pulling up to a red light, the GMC two vehicles behind us, then cutting in front of an entire lane of traffic when the light changed to get to the on-ramp of a highway. The truck did the same maneuver in a far more dangerous fashion, forcing cars to veer out of its way.

I called the HuffPost video producer and asked for her team’s location. My plan was to screech to a halt in front of a running video camera, which would likely scare away our pursuers. The producer told me she was in a park, with police nearby. The park was five miles outside town.

As we lashed through traffic, I watched the truck try to keep up in my rear-view mirror. At one point, the GMC swerved across double yellow lines into oncoming traffic. Lemley’s cell phone had died, and I was driving with one hand and navigating Google maps on my phone with the other. Even worse, the Fusion’s EcoBoost button seemed stuck. I kept jabbing at it to get more speed, but failed to detect a horsepower upgrade.

Where were the cops?

I tried to shake the truck by turning off the highway briefly and cutting through a bank’s parking lot and back onto the highway. The truck roared after us, but I managed to weave through several cars and make another turn onto a side street. The GMC was gone. The driver must have missed us. We’d lost them.

And we hadn’t been the only ones followed. Lemley later learned that around six other trucks had tailed anti-fascist vehicles after the rally. It had been a coordinated operation. A member of Nashville ARA who goes by Julez described to me how trucks had circled the safe house late into the night.

“The people who do this work with us are not scared of these people,” Julez said. “But it’s unnerving to go into this space with a bunch of guys like that who just want to fucking kill people.”

Julez told me he’d gotten a good look at one of the men in the trucks. He said the man had a patch on his shirt.

“It said Smyrna SWAT team,” Julez told me.

I struggled to process that information. Smyrna was a town a few miles north of Murfreesboro on the way to Nashville. And the Smyrna Police Department had indeed sent its SWAT team to Murfreesboro, according to Sgt. Bobby Gibson, the department’s SWAT team commander. But Gibson told me on Sunday that his officers had been staged away from the rally as a support unit and never left that location.

“We don’t even have a vehicle that matches that description,” Gibson said. “There was nobody from our police department following anybody.”

Gibson didn’t think it was implausible that militia members could have been chasing us. “There was a lot of activity from those groups prior to and after this event.”

Besides, he added, if law enforcement has a reason to stop you, they’re going to stop you. “And from what you described, you gave them grounds to stop you.”
