David Buckel, a prominent LGBTQ civil rights attorney, fatally set himself on fire at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York, early Saturday morning.

He was 60 years old.

In a suicide note left near his body, Buckel said he had used “fossil fuel” to ignite the fire and wanted his death to symbolize what humans are doing to Earth, the New York Daily News reported. Buckel emailed copies of the note to several news organizations, including the New York Times.

“Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water and weather,” Buckel wrote in his note, according to the Times’ copy of the note. “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”

Buckel worked with several environmental groups, including doing volunteer work with the Added Value Red Hook Community Farm and acting as the senior organics recovery coordinator for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s NYC Compost Project.

But his more prominent achievements came in his work as a civil rights lawyer.

Buckel was a senior counsel and director of the Marriage Project for Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ advocacy group. He argued in many landmark cases involving LGBTQ youth, including a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America and its former ban on gay members.

Camilla Taylor, director of Lambda Legal, said in a statement to HuffPost that their organization will honor Buckel’s life by “continuing to fight for equality.”

“The news of David’s death is heartbreaking,” Taylor said.

“David was a brilliant legal visionary. David helped create Lambda Legal’s focus on LGBT youth,” Taylor continued, detailing Buckel’s work on a case that led a federal court to rule that schools “have an obligation to prevent anti-gay bullying.”

She added: “His thoughtful and engaging advocacy broke through many stubborn misconceptions and showed it was possible and necessary for our movement to speak up for bullied, ostracized LGBT young people.”

One of Buckel’s most high-profile cases involved the gang rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old transgender man who was killed as a result of a hate crime in Nebraska.

Buckel worked with Teena’s mom, JoAnn Brandon, in a lawsuit against Richardson County, accusing Sheriff Charles B. Laux of failing to protect Teena from his rapists, who killed him after he reported the rape. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in Brandon’s favor.

Teena’s life was later adapted into the 1999 film, “Boys Don’t Cry.” Hilary Swank, who starred in the film, won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for her portrayal of Teena.

Early Saturday morning, people at Prospect Park noticed Buckel’s body before first responders arrived on the scene.

Irene Ryjova, a 44-year-old woman who was rollerblading in the park early Saturday, told the New York Post she saw the body lying on the floor “like someone would lie on the sand at the beach.”

In his suicide note, Buckel recalled the Tibetan monk protesters who have set themselves on fire in protest of the Chinese occupation in Tibet, according to the New York Daily News.

“This is not new, as many have chose to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see,” Buckel reportedly wrote.

“Here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded actions, and help others give a voice to our home, and Earth is heard.”Americans haven’t heard a peep from Jared Kushner, whom President Donald Trump tapped to be his point man on Middle East peace. His disappearing act is now particularly remarkable in the wake of U.S. military action in Syria.

“Where is Jared?” host Joy Reid mockingly asked Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy.” “Jared’s job was to solve all the Middle East problems. He’s besties with the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. He’s pitching loan ideas to Qatar.”

“Who cares?” shot back panelist and national security expert Malcom Nance, adding that Kushner is “not a player.” Even more troubling, Nance said, is America’s barely-there Middle East diplomacy resources.

“We don’t have an ambassador in Egypt, in Saudi Arabia, in Qatar, three of the strongest American allies in the region,” MSNBC host Ayman Mohyeldin pointed out. “In addition to ... that we do not have a secretary of state. So you don’t even have the diplomatic foot soldiers who are waking up in capitals of Arab cities today and saying to the governments, ‘Here are the next steps. Here’s what we need from you, here’s what we can offer to you to get on board with this.’”

There’s a “diplomatic vacuum,” he added. “You’re asking what happens in terms of the message we’re sending? We’re not sending any messages.”

Nance said America’s default diplomats are Defense Secretary James Mattis and his department. “They are actually speaking and doing diplomacy with a hammer. And if that’s the case, then we’re going to be fighting these wars a very long time,” he warned.

Trump put Kushner in charge of Middle East peace right from the start of his presidency. “If you can’t produce Middle East peace, nobody can,” Trump said to him on the eve of his inauguration.

Kushner was stripped of his top security clearance in February amid continuing entanglements between governments and his business interests.

In 2017, Kushner’s father pressed the Qatari finance minister for an investment in a troubled Kushner Companies property. Weeks after Charles Kushner was turned down, Jared Kushner backed a puzzling, controversial blockade of Qatar initiated by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Kushner has also been criticized for his close personal ties with Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has reportedly boasted to friends that he has the president’s son-in-law “in his pocket.” And shortly before Kushner’s first diplomatic mission to Israel last year, an Israeli insurer invested some $30 million in the Kushner company.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted a photo Saturday of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at a briefing on Syria, saying “Last night the president put our adversaries on notice.”

One small glitch: Pence, who is sitting next to Trump in the accompanying photo, couldn’t have possibly been at a Friday briefing. Pence was in Peru Friday.

Twitter went nuts. Walter Shaub, former head of the office of government ethics, responded: “Fascinating tweet in which Sarah Sanders reveals that Mike Pence was simultaneously in Peru and Washington. If this new capability doesn’t scare our enemies, nothing will.” He added the hashtag: #QuantumEntanglementMike.

On Sunday, Huckabee Sanders clarified that while the Syria missile strikes were Friday, and her Saturday tweet referred to “last night,” the photo accompanying the tweet was actually taken Thursday.

Huckabee Sanders insisted in her explanation that she had “said that.” She also told Politico that her original tweet was “not misleading at all.”

Huckabee Sanders apparently had little choice but to explain, given the avalanche of responses after her initial tweet:

That is an incredible photo Sarah given that Pence was in Peru. — Molly Knight (@molly_knight) April 15, 2018

#QuantumEntanglementMike It's the only explanation that makes sense except for that she's lying. — Carina Hilbert (@CarinaHilbert) April 15, 2018

Pence was in Peru...but the pic "from last night" that she posted has him in it. As usual - she's lying. — samslackey (@samslackey) April 15, 2018

Look carefully at this picture. @POTUS seems really confused. And wasn't Vice President Pence in Peru at the time?

Beyoncé made history this weekend at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival ― and her fans were having a collective meltdown.

“Coachella, thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline,” Beyoncé told the crowd during a historic performance Saturday at the iconic music festival in Indio, California.

Queen Bey’s highly anticipated set drew thousands of attendees and included a Destiny’s Child reunion, as well as cameos by her husband Jay-Z and her sister Solange.

The two-hour set featured some of Beyoncé’s biggest hits, including “Formation” and “Sorry” from her most recent album “Lemonade.” She was accompanied by a marching band, drumline and choir. See the full set list here.

Beyoncé was slated to headline Coachella in 2017, but ultimately pulled out of the event due to her pregnancy. She gave birth to twins Rumi and Sir in June. The “Irreplaceable” singer vowed to take the stage in 2018 ― and judging by the flood of posts on Twitter and Instagram, the wait was well worth it.

Barbara Bush is in failing health and will not seek additional medical treatment, according to a statement issued by her spokesman on Sunday.

The former first lady has reportedly been battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure.

“Following a recent series of hospitalizations, and after consulting her family and doctors, Mrs. Bush, now age 92, has decided not to seek additional medical treatment and will instead focus on comfort care,” Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the office of former President George H. W. Bush, said in the statement.

“It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of failing health, worrying not for herself ― thanks to her abiding faith ― but for others,” McGrath said. “She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving.”

She was hospitalized in Houston on Jan. 18, 2017, for bronchitis. Her husband was hospitalized the same day for shortness of breath, prompting his doctor to excuse him from President Donald Trump’s inauguration two days later.

Bush and her husband, 93, married in January 1945. They had six children, including former President George W. Bush, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a daughter, Robin, who died of leukemia at age 3.Colin Jost and I wrote Lobster Diner in 2010. Simon Rich, Marika Sawyer and I wrote Switcheroo in 2009. Neither went past the table.

A post shared by John Mulaney (@johnmulaney) on Apr 15, 2018 at 3:23am PDT“Hi, it’s Helen,” I heard when I picked up the phone Friday afternoon, her pleasant voice a welcome replacement for a publicist’s typical humdrum introduction. I immediately understood this conversation would be between myself and Ms. Helen Hunt, who could navigate my questions herself, thank you very much.

For over four decades, Hunt has affected audiences with her warm smile and natural charisma, appearing in everything from the late 1970s sci-fi series “The Bionic Woman” to Louis C.K.’s controversial and critically panned “I Love You, Daddy” last year. She won multiple Emmys for her role as Jamie Buchman in the long-running ’90s TV series “Mad About You” and took home an Oscar for “As Good As It Gets” in ’97. She starred in the films “What Women Want,” “Pay It Forward,” “Cast Away” and “Bobby,” to name just a few, before taking a step off screen to focus on writing and directing. Her two projects, “Then She Found Me” and “Ride,” solidified Hunt as a blossoming filmmaker, giving her the opportunity to direct episodes of television series’ like “Revenge,” “House of Lies,” “Feud,” “This Is Us” and “Splitting Up Together.”

But, at 54, Hunt seems eager to get back on our screens and uncover the kinds of roles she’s long been craving. As an actress who’s witnessed decades of Hollywood ups and downs, she has strong opinions about her industry and the parts she wants to inhabit in it.

Currently, she can be seen in “The Miracle Season,” based on the true story of Iowa City’s West High School 2011-12 volleyball team. The squad, after the tragic death of its star player, attempts to conjure up the strength to make it to the state championship alongside tough-love coach Kathy Bresnahan (Hunt). On the phone, sans publicist, we spoke about the movie, the changes she’s experienced in her ever-changing workplace and, of course, those “Mad About You” revival contracts.

You’re a busy woman these days.

I suddenly got busy after not being busy!

I can’t start this conversation off without mentioning the supposed deals you and Paul Reiser closed for a “Mad About You” reboot. Is it a go?

We closed this thing with Sony, who is our studio, which means that’s great, but there’s nowhere to do it yet. I read somewhere, “They’re being coy.” There’s no being coy, nobody’s bought it yet, you know what I’m saying? I mean, at all. [There’s] nothing I’m even hiding. So our enthusiasm is clear, but we don’t have any home for it yet. And we don’t know if we will or if we’ll have one that everybody likes. Seems like it is marching steadily toward “I hope it happens.”

The show is now going to be run by a spectacular writer, Peter Tolan from “Rescue Me” and “Murphy Brown,” with me and Paul by his side. Danny Jacobson (the show’s co-creator) will come back and consult, and that’s great. But we’re really excited that we have Paul and me as the guardians of what it was, and Peter Tolan with new, fresh, smart enthusiasm, who’s going to be doing a lot of the writing. The cocktail of what it was and something brand new is what has made me excited about it. I can’t think of anyone better than Peter Tolan to be that kind of new breath-of-life into it. He’s a big element. His sensibility combined with our comfy-with-each-other thing is exciting to me.

To come back with a different spin on it, a different showrunner and possibly a new network must be thrilling.

Yes. I honestly can’t high-five yet because no one may want to buy it or, more possibly, how ever those deals get made might not ever get made. But the prospect of doing it went from seeming absurd to seeming really exciting. I’ve always been interested with this show: What is it like to love someone over time? That’s been the thing that hooked me into doing it in the first place. It’s one thing to love somebody after a year and it’s another thing to love somebody after seven years. To check in on what’s the grace and the grit of loving someone after 20 years? That’s a pretty terrific prospect, and with a great new writer and my dear friend who I love acting with. If it happens, I’d be super excited, but I don’t know if it’s going to happen.

I really hope it does, especially with the many platforms out there now aside from the networks who could be interested.

Right, right. That’s in the hands of who knows what, but I’m open to any place that’s interested in the things we’re interested in.

You and Paul were, in a way, trailblazers for successful TV stars ― even earning yourself huge pay raises in the final season of “Mad About You.” (They each got a $750k raise, to $1 million an episode.)

Those days are gone [laughs].

But we see these stars now, like Ellen Pompeo, for instance, making a ton of money to remain on hit shows while fighting for what they deserve. Do you see yourself as a pioneer in that world?

It would be hard for me to use that word, but I was very aware that I had, thanks to Paul, been invited into an incredibly generous job in every way. Luckily, I knew enough, even in Season 2 and 3, to say to myself once a day, “This isn’t going to last forever, remember that.” Getting to work on 11-page scenes with a scene partner you love working with about something you care about [is amazing]. We didn’t have jerks on the show. There was nobody that made it a drag. It was a particularly lovely group, and Paul and I have remained really great friends, so coming back to all of that would be like, “You’re kidding?”

“I never want to mention parts I've turned down. The roles I’ve succeeded in, many of them were turned down by other people so I don’t want to put my sticky fingers on someone else’s work.” - Helen Hunt

Even though we see a lot of solid roles for women and female-led shows and films, they’re still hard to come by. Are you excited to have the chance to maybe reprise Jamie Buchman and then take on even more roles?

Yes. I’m about to go work on something that just so happens would be great. I’m very fired up about my acting at the moment and excited about possibilities that are in front of me and behind me with this movie that’s out, which I’m really proud of.

Yes, let’s talk “The Miracle Season.” After taking a few years to focus on directing, what about this character, coach Kathy Bresnahan, resonated with you?

I had worked with the director Sean McNamara before on “Soul Surfer,” so I knew he was a lovely guy and a terrific filmmaker. That’s step one. And I knew that there was a wonderful part in there and I just went ahead and started working on it, and I had the help of the real woman I played. It wasn’t until I was standing on the volleyball court dressed like her, surrounded by these 20-something-year-old women that I thought, “Oh my God. I’m standing exactly where I should be.” In a circle of women, reminding them and myself what their value is. That they can remind themselves of what that value is rather than looking to somebody else, a man in particular, to give it to them. That I could be encouraging and loving with them and still be a fierce leader.

It wasn’t until I was playing the part that I realized that. And then, when the movie came out, I went, not only am I standing in a circle of women, which is where I like to be, but I’m standing in a circle of women at a time when that’s, I think, the hope of how to work through this. I have never had an experience of partnering with women around my work or in my friendships when there has been anything other than fierce solidarity. Whatever that myth is about women being competitive with each other, I have never experienced it.

We’re now in these Me Too and Time’s Up movements. Do you find that this film fits nicely within this particular moment?

I do. I mean, there’s a lot of other stories to tell: There’s anger to write about and healing ― or the impossibility of healing to write about. A lot is going to come out of this forever. I heard [the writer and activist] Alice Walker speak once and she said the most important thing [she’d] done in [her] life was be in a circle with other women and talk. So when I look at the clips from this movie or watch this movie, there they are; standing in a circle, reminding each other and fortifying each other. There’s no movie I’d rather be in today.

It’s a true story about this slightly unlikeable, tough coach who happens to be a woman. That’s a role we usually see played by men, so what was the experience portraying Kathy like for you?

I love sports movies. I mean, I wanted to be Kurt Russell in “Miracle” then, so this was my chance. It was a dream come true. I made a sports movie called “Ride” and I did “Soul Surfer,” so this is a genre that I adore and this one had this giant piece of heartbreak and soul in the middle of it. It made it the perfect movie for me.

Having a young daughter and being in a movie like “Miracle Season,” are you excited for her to see it. Well, has she seen any of your iconic roles? “Twister,” I hope!

She has not seen “Twister.” I suggested it actually and it hasn’t been on the top of her list. She’s not only seen “Miracle Season,” she’s in “Miracle Season.” She has two scenes at the beginning that I had nothing to do with ― she auditioned and she got the part. She’s the younger sister of Erin Moriarty’s love interest. Being on the set surrounded by these wonderful actors-turned-volleyball-players and volleyball-players-turned-actors, they all just treated her like they were her aunties and it was a pretty amazing summer we spent.

Could you see her getting into the business? You started young, so…

Yeah! It will be utterly and totally up to her.

Over this press cycle, you’ve talked about your fear of “sucking” as an actor.

[Laughs] It’s just more a motivator. I didn’t see how healing the movie might be to be in or what it might mean to people at the time it came out, I was just busy doing my work. There’s a famous line from a play where an actress says, “You have no idea what it feels like to be acting when you know it’s bad.” And I quote that to young actors a lot and say, “That’s what makes you do a lot of homework before you start a film.” Do I know who this person is? Do I know what my part in the story is? Am I serving what the writer wrote? Just to avoid feeling like you’re not doing a good job.

Looking at past roles that maybe could’ve happened for you, I stumbled across a rumor that you were considered for “Basic Instinct” [before Sharon Stone was cast].

I don’t ever remember being talked about for “Basic Instinct” for one second.

Were there any roles you turned down because you felt you couldn’t serve a character or honor the storyteller’s work?

There are. I never want to mention parts I’ve turned down. The roles I’ve succeeded in, many of them were turned down by other people, so I don’t want to put my sticky fingers on someone else’s work. But I certainly turned movies down and regretted it; I turned movies down and said, “Thank God! Why did I agonize for three weeks?” You just make the best decisions you can, you know?

You went on to win Emmys for “Mad About You” and an Oscar for “As Good As It Gets.” Then you appeared in movies like “What Women Want.” When you look back on that movie, for example, do you still feel like it would have the same success today?

I don’t know, they’re remaking it, I think? That’s what I heard. But the movies I look back on that are the most meaningful to me are probably the two that I wrote and directed, just because they came from the very deepest parts of me ― one is called “Then She Found Me” and the other was called “Ride.” And then I was in this movie “The Sessions” a handful of years ago and I feel really proud of that movie. I would like it if younger people saw that movie because in this time of being flooded with sexualized violence and porn, you can’t go anywhere now without seeing it or hearing about it. This was a movie about healthy sex, healthy sexuality and I think it was kind of singular and shocking in a quiet way. I’m very proud to leave that behind ― not that I’m going anywhere soon, but I’m proud that that’s something I was in and helped to make.

A beautiful movie which got an enormous response at Sundance in 2012.

It did, that was wild.

Were you expecting that kind of reception for the movie and your role in it, which earned you an Oscar nomination?

No, no, no. I had no idea, but I did sit down and there were, whatever there are, 2,000 people in that auditorium or something, and I had never been to Sundance and right before it started I was like, “I’m about to be vulnerable in every way in front of all of these people.” It was a very quiet screening but there was laughing, which was good, and when it was over, they stood up and they didn’t stop. And I said, “Whoa, this has made some sort of impact on people.” That was really exciting. I can tell when I read something ― especially when I watch something, even one episode of a show I otherwise like ― it will have that sick, frankly, feel to it that deals with sex. So to have a movie that was this intimate, and only feel its honest approach and desire to show what sex can be, I thought was quite remarkable in front of 2,000 people.

“I’ve never been comfortable saying, “I’m more of a comedic actress than a dramatic actress! I prefer this screen over that screen!” I just want to be a part of telling good stories.” - Helen Hunt

It was ahead of the curve we’re seeing now with filmmakers taking bigger risks with their female leads. Women not just playing stereotypes. How does it feel now versus a decade or so ago in terms of the treatment of women in Hollywood and the roles you’re being presented with?

It’s never been one thing. I can’t say now’s the time when it’s great. Certainly, there’s great parts on television for women for sure, but I don’t know how to say this time is different from before in terms of parts. It’s just all about writers. You just have to nurture and pay [laughs] writers because everybody, men included, are searching for a story and a good writer, and when it comes along, hope they’re smart enough to grab it.

Is that why you decided to write, direct and produce your own movies? To make the content you wanted to see?

Yeah. Also, writing is step one and discovering the courage to do that was something I wanted to try. When you direct something you wrote, it’s more like getting another chance to rewrite it. You’re rewriting it with the production design, the music and how you’re photographing it. I guess I wanted to experience getting as close to the bone as possible with creating a story.

And starring in it. Do you always have yourself in mind for these characters?

No, I think it’s, in general, a really bad idea [laughs], in terms of people taking the movie seriously and in terms of enjoying the job of writing and directing it. In these cases [“Then She Found Me,” “Ride”], both practically and creatively, it ended up being the right move. But I don’t recommend it necessarily.

I imagine it’s difficult to direct yourself.

It is definitely difficult. It’s also terrific, because on a small movie where time is an issue, you have one person who sees the movie the way you do and is willing to work long hours and change in the van and do whatever it takes to get the movie made. It sets a tone for we’re all going to dig in and get this movie made, even with the amount of time and money that we have. But it’s a very different experience; very immersive, to say the least.

Women directors, in general, have to push even harder to helm projects and fight for budgets. Are you seeing more female directors get a chance to make movies in the men’s club?

It’s all about money. People have to hire women, #JustHire. Hire women, people of color, women of color ― that is how this is changing and it will stop changing if people stop doing that. The pressure that people are feeling to hire not only white men has to remain in order for things to change.

You’ve been directing a lot in the television world with “Feud,” “This Is Us” and “Splitting Up Together,” among other shows. Have you seen a shift there in terms of female directors?

We’ll see at the end of the year when the directors guild tells us how many [there are]. It was a year or two ago we thought it was getting better and it got like 1 percent worse, so let’s hope. That’s my takeaway too; it seems like there’s more diversity in terms of directors on TV. One thing we all can do ― almost every time I direct I have a mentee with me, a woman, usually. Ryan Murphy really has been doing it for a few years now. He has a mentee program where every time you direct you have a woman or a person of color following you around. He really is in it for the long haul in helping to make sure they’re actually hired to direct. He deserves a ton of credit, I think.

He definitely pushed this before anyone else.

And the way he’s pushing it is, again, with money. He’s hiring people.

At the Oscars this year, Frances McDormand brought up the inclusion rider, which requires a certain level of diversity among a film’s cast and crew.

I think it’s fantastic. It comes back to the same thing: hire people.

Are you going to focus on directing as you have been doing or are we going to see you more on screen this year?

At the moment I have some acting and some directing on my plate, so I’m really excited about that. And some writing! I’m working hard and enjoying never having to choose between those things. I’ve never been comfortable saying, “I’m more of a comedic actress than a dramatic actress! I prefer this screen over that screen!” I just want to be a part of telling good stories, and today I’m getting to do that. That’s great news.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump’s latest Twitter rant was so lengthy that Seth Meyers felt compelled to tweak it in order to save viewers’ time.

On Monday’s broadcast of “Late Night,” Meyers said it would take “too long to have someone read” Trump’s six Sunday morning tweets that claimed the FBI spied on his election campaign. So, he sped up the reading.

“Don’t worry about not being able to follow that. It actually makes less sense at normal speed,” said Meyers. “By the way, Twitter, did I ever thank you for raising the character limit? I didn’t? Good.”

“Also, it’s not fair that a president who won’t read a two-page press briefing makes us read a six-part Twitter rant,” he added. “This rant is so long, it technically qualifies as a mini-series. Look for it streaming this summer on Net-Dicks.”Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing regarding the company's use and protection of user data on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018.

By David Ingram

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Concern about Facebook Inc’s respect for data privacy is widening to include the information it collects about non-users, after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the world’s largest social network tracks people whether they have accounts or not.

Privacy concerns have swamped Facebook since it acknowledged last month that information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, a firm that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 electoral campaign among its clients.

Zuckerberg said on Wednesday under questioning by U.S. Representative Ben Luján that, for security reasons, Facebook also collects “data of people who have not signed up for Facebook.”

Lawmakers and privacy advocates immediately protested the practice, with many saying Facebook needed to develop a way for non-users to find out what the company knows about them.

“We’ve got to fix that,” Representative Luján, a Democrat, told Zuckerberg, calling for such disclosure, a move that would have unclear effects on the company’s ability to target ads. Zuckerberg did not respond. On Friday Facebook said it had no plans to build such a tool.

Critics said that Zuckerberg has not said enough about the extent and use of the data. “It’s not clear what Facebook is doing with that information,” said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington advocacy group.

COOKIES EVERYWHERE

Facebook gets some data on non-users from people on its network, such as when a user uploads email addresses of friends. Other information comes from “cookies,” small files stored via a browser and used by Facebook and others to track people on the internet, sometimes to target them with ads.

“This kind of data collection is fundamental to how the internet works,” Facebook said in a statement to Reuters.

Asked if people could opt out, Facebook added, “There are basic things you can do to limit the use of this information for advertising, like using browser or device settings to delete cookies. This would apply to other services beyond Facebook because, as mentioned, it is standard to how the internet works.”

Facebook often installs cookies on non-users’ browsers if they visit sites with Facebook”like” and “share” buttons, whether or not a person pushes a button. Facebook said it uses browsing data to create analytics reports, including about traffic to a site.

The company said it does not use the data to target ads, except those inviting people to join Facebook.

TARGETING FACEBOOK

Advocates and lawmakers say they are singling out Facebook because of its size, rivaled outside China only by Alphabet Inc’s Google, and because they allege Zuckerberg was not forthcoming about the extent and reasons for the tracking.

“He’s either deliberately misunderstanding some of the questions, or he’s not clear about what’s actually happening inside Facebook’s operation,” said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Zuckerberg, for instance, said the collection was done for security purposes, without explaining further or saying whether it was also used for measurement or analytics, Gillmor said, adding that Facebook had a business incentive to use the non-user data to target ads.

Facebook declined to comment on why Zuckerberg referred to security only.

Gillmor said Facebook could build databases on non-users by combining web browsing history with uploaded contacts. Facebook said on Friday that it does not do so.

The ACLU is pushing U.S. lawmakers to enact broad privacy legislation including a requirement for consent prior to data collection.

The first regulatory challenge to Facebook’s practices for non-users may come next month when a new European Union law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect and requires notice and consent prior to data collection.

At a minimum, “Facebook is going to have to think about ways to structure their technology to give that proper notice,” said Woodrow Hartzog, a Northeastern University professor of law and computer science.

Facebook said in its statement on Friday, “Our products and services comply with applicable law and will comply with GDPR.”

The social network would be wise to recognize at least a right to know, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor.

“If I’m not a Facebook user, I ought to have a right to know what data Facebook has about me,” Froomkin said.The face-off was a twisted take on the film “Meet the Parents” when De Niro’s character gets to know his soon-to-be son-in-law, Greg Focker, played by Stiller.

Once again, Stiller, this time playing President Donald Trump’s attorney, is strapped to a polygraph.

“I’ll start with some easy ones: How did ya like the pee pee tape?” De Niro asks. He quickly adds, “I’m kidding! We’ll get to that later.”

“Are you a lawyer?” Mueller then probes.

“Ish,” says Stiller. As for threatening people as part of his work, “Cohen” admits: “Let’s just say I’ve cut a lot of letters out of a lot of magazines.”

“Cohen” accuses “Mueller” of launching personal-attack witch hunts against the Trump family.

De Niro insists that investigators try to keep a dispassionate distance by using code names for the family. Trump’s code name used to be “Putin’s little bitch,” now it’s “Stormy’s little bitch,” he explains. Ivanka’s is “girlfriend,” and Jared Kusher is “other girlfriend.” Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are referred to as the “two Fredos,” and Cohen is “dead man walking.”

Then Mueller takes off the gloves: “You listen to me, you little weasel ... You broke the law and now we’re going to catch all you little Fockers, you got that?”

Stiller’s Cohen has lots to hide. At the start of the cold open, he admits to Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon) and Mike Pence (Beck Bennett): “I’m Donald Trump’s lawyer. I got a whole hard drive that’s just labeled ‘yikes!’”McKinnon’s Ingraham complains to Colin Jost on “Weekend Update” about attacks on her for “trolling a traumatized teen,” referring to mocking Parkland, Florida, shooting survivor David Hogg for not getting into all the colleges he applied to.

The “totalitarian left can attack me all they want,” she says. “But I will continue to defend the First Amendment. That’s my right to bully people without being bullied in return.”

Our “country’s so divided now, and I’m an important part of that,” she oozes, admitting that she’s been “spewing venom for decades.”

McKinnon boasts about new sponsors she has concocted for her program to make up for the several that dropped her show after attacking Hogg. They include “Carl’s Sr. — leftover Carl’s Jr. food ground to mush for old people,” “Lady Bump Stock — the lightweight bump stock for delicate hands” and “Cream Soda, the soda for whites.”

“What do you want me to say? I’m getting ‘pwned’ by teenagers!” says McKinnon. “I don’t understand anything anymore.”Hassan al-Kontar, a citizen of war-ravaged Syria, says he’s been stranded in a Malaysian airport for almost 40 days.

He fled Syria about a decade ago to avoid military service and fears he’ll be arrested or forced to fight for President Bashar Assad’s forces if he returns home.

After recently being refused entry into several countries, the 36-year-old has made a corner of Kuala Lumpur International Airport his temporary home. He’s been showering in public restrooms and relying on the generosity of airline and airport staff for food and supplies.

As news of his plight went viral this week, Kontar has described the deep desperation and frustration he feels about his situation — but also how the support of strangers around the world has kept his spirits buoyed.

“They brighten my soul, my mind, my heart for the rest of my life,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Friday of people online who have started a GoFundMe campaign to support him. “This is humanity at the highest level.”

Kontar, a former insurance salesman, said he’s been in limbo since at least 2006, when he first left Syria to avoid serving in the military. He initially went to the United Arab Emirates illegally, he told CBC, where he worked under the table and lived in his car.

He said he eventually got a work permit, but it was revoked last year because of the Syrian civil war, which entered its eighth year in March. He was deported to Malaysia, a country that allows Syrian citizens to enter without a visa for up to 90 days.

Kontar said he overstayed his visit in Malaysia, where he spent months raising money to buy a plane ticket to Ecuador, a nation that also allows Syrian nationals to enter visa-free and where he has family.

He said, however, that he was turned away at the last minute from a Turkish Airlines flight to Ecuador. It’s unclear why the airline refused to board him. Turkish Airlines has not responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Kontar said he then attempted to travel to Cambodia but was turned away by immigration officials there. He flew back to Malaysia and tried to re-enter the country, but was also refused.

He has since been living in Terminal 2 of KLIA, surviving off his fast-dwindling savings and sharing the details of his ordeal through video diaries on Twitter.

“I’m desperate for help. I can’t live in this airport any longer, the uncertainty is driving me crazy,” he told the BBC. “It feels like my life hit a new low.”

Kontar says he hopes to find a lasting solution — one that will allow him to legally find a home where he can work and just “relax” for the first time in years.

“It’s exhausting. I’m tired from this. I cannot take it anymore,” he told CBC.

He stressed that returning to Syria is “out of the question” at this point.

“I am afraid of being deported to Syria, not because I’m a coward, not because I don’t know how to fight, but because I don’t believe in fighting,” he told Reuters. “I don’t want to be a killing machine, destroying my own home and harming my own people.”

In an effort to draw attention to his plight, Kontar has been tweeting at global news outlets and political leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He’s also attempted to reach out to actor Tom Hanks, who in 2004 played a man who was trapped in New York City’s John F. Kennedy Airport in the film “The Terminal.”

The movie was inspired by the true story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who lived in the departure lounge of Charles De Gaulle Airport in France for almost 18 years.

Several news outlets picked up Kontar’s story this week, attracting the attention of human rights groups and the Malaysian government.

The U.N. refugee agency in Malaysia told Reuters it had reached out to Kontar “and the authorities” this week, but said it could not comment on individual cases.

Malaysia’s deputy home minister told local news outlets that his ministry had been made aware of Kontar’s situation and was considering issuing him a “special pass” under the country’s Syrian refugee program, which would allow him to stay in the country temporarily. Kontar would have to be “vetted first,” the minister added.

The minister did not indicate when the vetting process might be initiated.People take to the streets in Budapest to oppose the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on April 14. Bernadett Szabo / Reuters

Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through Hungary’s capital of Budapest on Saturday to protest Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government, as critics warn the country could slide further into illiberalism.

Orbán’s radical right, nationalist Fidesz party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections last Sunday. With a two-thirds majority in the legislature, Fidesz now has the power to make changes to the country’s constitution.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticized the election for “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing.”

The campaign saw Orbán rail against migration and push the idea that unseen “foreign interests” were seeking to undermine the government. The prime minister also made Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros a focal point of the campaign, claiming that Soros was conspiring to bring hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country and putting up anti-Soros posters around the country.

Opponents fear that Fidesz’s parliamentary majority will allow Orbán to accelerate his attacks on democratic institutions and civil society, including pushing through so-called “Stop Soros” laws that would put harsh restrictions on non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International.

In the week since the election, a pro-government magazine owned by one of Orbán’s allies has published a list of 200 people it accused of being agents for Soros. The roster included journalists, human rights workers and university professors.

A major opposition newspaper and an English language independent news site both announced they were shutting down just days after the vote. Orbán and his allies control most of the country’s media, and the closings only add to the prime minister’s grip on how Hungarians receive their information.

As the election results came in last Sunday night, there were no major protests but instead acknowledgments of defeat and resignations from opposition parties. Only a small crowd of young people gathered in front of Parliament to demonstrate against Orbán, before moving on to hold a sit-in at a major Budapest intersection under the lights of police cars. The effort petered out as the night dragged on.

But less than a week later, Hungarians came out in droves Saturday to voice their opposition to the government. Crowds of protesters moved through the streets of Budapest, holding anti-Orbán signs and waving Hungarian flags. The demonstration was one of the largest in Hungary in recent years.BEIRUT (Reuters) - A huge blast was heard in a Syrian government-controlled area in a rural region south of Aleppo, the Britain-based war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Saturday.

The Observatory said the cause of the explosion was unknown, as well as its target.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to deliver remarks on Friday evening about Syria, the New York Times reported, citing an administration official.“President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons,” he added. “Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force of stability and peace.”

After the strikes were launched, the Russian Embassy in Washington issued a warning to the U.S.

“Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences,” Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said in a statement.

“Insulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible,” Antonov added. “The U.S. ― the possessor of the biggest arsenal of chemical weapons ― has no moral right to blame other countries.”John Krasinski’s film directorial debut, “A Quiet Place,” has been anything but silent at the box office .

The fourth-grader at Rosehill Elementary School in Lenexa, Kansas, told FOX 4 that he was playing around with a friend in a lunch line when the unidentified teacher intercepted and pushed the two children apart, assuming they were fighting.

“She told me when you turn 16 and the police shoot you, the only person you can be mad at is yourself,” he said.

Malachi said the comment made him cry. His father was shot and killed in Kansas City when he was just an infant.

Mahogany Foster, Malachi’s mother, said she was outraged when her son told her about the incident, and she pulled him out of Rosehill Elementary two days later.

“That was a low blow, and that was something personal,” she said of the teacher’s comment. “You shouldn’t say it to any child.”

Foster said the district assistant superintendent told her the teacher had been put on leave. But a representative for Shawnee Mission School District told FOX 4 that due to federal law, it cannot discuss any disciplinary actions against the teacher.

Rosehill Elementary School did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

One Twitter user shared Malachi’s story online on Monday, writing, “I don’t think people talk about the cruel things people in positions of authority say to Black children enough.”

“Black children face this type of stuff from the home to classroom and it’s extremely harmful. This teacher deserves to be fired.”

The post prompted many other people of color to share their experiences with racism in school.

I'll never forget when I was in the 5th grade my class went on a field trip and we were in a dark room. My white teacher said "I can't see any of my black kids." At the time I didn't realize how racist that comment was till I was in High School. — 🌼 (@purposezen81) May 22, 2018

(@PettyNegr0) May 22, 2018The U.S., U.K. and France have defended their decision to launch coordinated strikes on the Syrian regime Friday night, calling it a necessary move to stop the use of chemical weapons by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran.

“Could not have had a better result,” U.S. President Donald Trump said of the “perfectly executed” strikes in a tweet Saturday morning. “Mission Accomplished!”

In a statement Friday night, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Syrian government of “using weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.”

“The persistent pattern of behavior must be stopped,” May said, referring to the regime’s suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma last week.

“Not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons,” she said, “but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons.”

May added that Britain has “sought to use every possible diplomatic channel” to stop the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, “but our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted.”

“We would have preferred an alternative path,” May said. “But on this occasion, there is none.”

French President Emmanuel Macron declared that France’s “red line has been crossed” after last week’s chemical attack. In a statement, he echoed May’s call for the end of chemical weapons.

“Our response is limited to the Syrian regime’s capabilities to produce and use chemical weapons,” Macron said. “We cannot tolerate the normalization of the use of chemical weapons, which is a direct threat to the security of the Syrian people and our collective security.”

An ‘Act Of Aggression’

Assad denounced the strikes against Syria and said it made his regime even more determined to “fight and crush” terrorism.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded by calling Trump, May and Macron “criminals” in a speech cited by Iranian TV, according to Reuters.

“U.S., allies will not gain any achievements from crimes in Syria. Attacking Syria is a crime. U.S. president, U.K. prime minister and the president of France are criminals,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday described the strikes as an “act of aggression” that would have a “destructive influence on the entire system of international relations.” At the Kremlin’s request, world powers will hold an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to address the incident. ‘Where Were You Until Today?’

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he supported the strikes in a statement issued an hour after Trump’s announcement.

“Canada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime’s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people,” Trudeau said. “We will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.”‎

Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, said the joint attack on the “chemical weapons facilities and capabilities ... will reduce the regime’s ability” to launch further chemical attacks.

“Those responsible must be held accountable,” he tweeted.

The Jordanian government stressed the need for diplomacy to bring an end to the Syrian crisis.

“The continuation of violence will only bring more violence, death, destruction and more displacement that the Syrian people are only being the victims off,” spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said in a statement Saturday. “The political solution preserves the unity of the Syrian people, and brings back security and stability to it.”

In a similar response, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim called for “a global peace against the massacre in Eastern Ghouta and Douma.”

“For seven years, people have been slaughtered in Syria ― brutality is going on. You remembered your humanity when [the Syrian regime] used chemicals?” he asked. “Where were you until today?”

The Coordinated Operation

Trump on Friday night announced that a coordinated attack on the Syrian regime, launched with British and French allies, was underway.

“The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons,” he said. “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.”

The U.S., France and Britain have accused the Russian-backed Syrian government of launching a chemical attack in the then rebel-held town of Douma last week. The attack left about 70 people dead.

The Syrian state has denied that its forces launched a chemical attack and accused rebels of fabricating reports of the attack in order to drum up international support for its fight against the regime.

In his address to the American people, Trump singled out Iran and Russia for supporting the Syrian regime and partially blamed the countries for the chemical attack.

“I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime,” Trump said. “To Iran and to Russia I ask: What kind of nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children?”

“President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons,” Trump continued.

“Assad’s recent attack and today’s response are the direct result of Russia’s failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force of stability and peace.”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Syrian facilities in response to Syrian President Bashar Assad’s reported use of chemical weapons against civilians fulfills Trump’s promise of being tougher than President Barack Obama.

But it’s unlikely to have much impact beyond that ― and will likely be historically judged as a failure on Trump’s own terms.

Trump’s military response alongside France and the U.K. is ostensibly an attempt to deter Assad’s murderous behavior and demonstrate American toughness to Assad’s patrons, Iran and Russia. It won’t serve either of those goals.

With Trump broadcasting his intentions for days, Assad has already relocated the air force that carried out the attack last weekend, according to military experts at the Institute for the Study of War. His forces have also reportedly evacuated personnel from some Syrian government buildings where military systems like chemical weapons are being developed. Those troops and resources have been moved to central locations that the U.S. and its allies won’t be able to target without prompting a larger confrontation with Russia and Iran.

Pentagon officials told The New York Times that even if Syrian aircraft cannot be hit, the U.S. could damage airfields and make it impossible to use them for future similar attacks. On Friday night, officials said the U.S., France and Britain hit a research site, a command post and a store of chemical weapons. But such facilities are easily rebuilt. After the U.S. struck Assad’s Shayrat airfield in retaliation for a chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun last year, the base was back up and running within hours.

Since then, Assad has continued to take territory from the rebels ― often using brutal tactics including mass starvation and indiscriminate attacks with especially deadly “barrel bombs.”

“The strikes will reaffirm President Trump’s commitment to deterring chemical weapons use but will not solve the Syria problem,” Jennifer Cafarella, the senior intelligence planner at the Institute for the Study of War, wrote on Thursday. “They are unlikely to alter the overall trajectory of the Syrian civil war and will not prevent Assad from continuing to slaughter his rebelling population with conventional munitions.”

“[The strikes] are unlikely to alter the overall trajectory of the Syrian civil war and will not prevent Assad from continuing to slaughter his rebelling population.” - Jennifer Cafarella, Institute for the Study of War

Already in a comfortable position, Assad has no reason for a major change in behavior unless that’s essential for the survival of his regime. Though Trump hit Damascus on Friday night and suggested there might be further strikes, he has not yet directly threatened the government’s survival.

Trump administration officials, including new national security adviser John Bolton, have separately spoken of using U.S. policy in Syria to challenge Russia and Iran, rival nations that have expanded their reach there while helping Assad fight the insurgency. But the strikes are unlikely to bring the Trump administration closer to that goal, either.

With Trump still not announcing a broader policy for Syria, the U.S. remains a far less credible player there than any members of the pro-Assad coalition. “Russia is far more of an ally to Damascus than the U.S. is to the so-called rebels or even Kurds,” Kamal Alam, a visiting fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told HuffPost.

Trump has eroded the confidence of America’s allies in the country ― most notably the Kurd-dominated force responsible for the triumph over ISIS. The Trump administration allowed Turkey to take over a Kurdish enclave in northwestern Syria earlier this year, and Trump spoke of fully withdrawing the thousands of Americans currently stationed in Kurd-controlled regions. One-off hits on Assad targets mean little for the relationship between Washington and the most powerful Kurdish militia, the YPG, experts say.

“A strike might marginally reassure some Kurds made nervous by Trump’s announcement that the U.S. would leave Syria, as it would demonstrate that he’s willing to use force and indicate some limited commitment, but the effect would likely be minimal,” Max Hoffman, an analyst at the Center for American Progress, told HuffPost.

Kurdish leaders “say publicly that they have frequent reassurances from U.S. military commanders, but they know Trump is ambivalent and they know the U.S. history towards Kurdish (and other) proxies, so of course they’re nervous,” he added.

For now, anyone affected by Trump’s decisions ― including Syrians, millions of whom have cheered a strike regardless of the consequences because of their desperation for some accountability for Assad ― would have trouble planning for the long run. U.S. officials say they don’t even know if they can continue civilian reconstruction work intended to help prevent local anger and a resurgence of ISIS.

Washington realized how little the strike would mean before it even took place. And so even the gain Trump perhaps cared most about ― applause ― now seems like a reach.

Tellingly, supporters of last year’s strike ― people like Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the powerful ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee ― have been focusing on the problems with Trump’s leadership rather than with Assad’s culpability as they did last year.

“The President’s erratic tweets referencing Syria have left both our allies and our adversaries confused about his policy. These tweets have also made very clear that the President has no strategy for how to combat Assad’s atrocities against his own people,” Smith said in a Friday statement.
