President Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Defense to present plans for a reduction of U.S. troops in South Korea, The New York Times reported Thursday.

The move comes just weeks before the president is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and days after the two Koreas held a summit at the Demilitarized Zone, where they laid the foundation for a formal end to the Korean War and discussed ways to denuclearize the peninsula.

The Times, citing unnamed sources briefed on the order, said Trump has been determined to reduce the number of troops in South Korea, citing the cost and the fact that their presence has done little to quash North Korea’s antagonistic nuclear weapon program. It’s unclear if Trump would push for a full or partial reduction in troop numbers, but a full reduction is unlikely.

The U.S. currently has 28,500 troops stationed in the country, and South Korea, a longtime ally, pays nearly $890 million a year in expenses, or about half the total cost. That deal expires at the end of this year, and Trump hopes to convince Seoul to foot more of the bill.

South Korea on Friday denied the Times’ report, saying a “key” official of the U.S. National Security Council told the country’s national security chief, Chung Eui-yong, that the news was false, Bloomberg and Reuters reported.

The White House on Friday issued a statement from National Security Adviser John Bolton calling the report “utter nonsense.”

Earlier this week, South Korea said that, regardless of the outcome of peace negotiations with the North, the country wanted U.S. troops to remain in the country. The comment came after a prominent adviser to President Moon Jae-in wrote that it would be “difficult to justify” the presence of U.S. forces were the conflict with Kim to end.

“U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are an issue regarding the alliance between South Korea and the United States,” Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for Seoul’s Blue House, said in a statement responding to the adviser, Moon Chung-in. “It has nothing to do with signing peace treaties.”

North Korean analysts questioned the validity of Trump’s order shortly after the Times report. Experts have long said the presence of U.S. soldiers and civilians so close to North Korea has long served as a deterrent to a physical conflict.

“It’s not the nuclear umbrella that keeps [the Republic of Korea] safe. It’s the 30,000 American soldiers and their families living there that do,” Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, wrote on Twitter. “It is literally the blood oath of the American people to South Korea. They value the alliance so much, that they put their lives (and their family’s lives) on the line.”

Kim Jong Un is going to lead Trump right where Trump’s instinct wants to go. We may literally get a deal of some sorts if troops and extended deterrence to South Korea are on the table. And it’s not “a concession” for Trump...he wants to go there anyway.

Kim has long demanded the U.S. place its troop presence on the negotiating table as part of any discussions to give up its nuclear weapons, but officials have long rejected such calls. However, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appeared to say the issue might be open to discussion.

“That’s part of the issues that we’ll be discussing in negotiations with our allies first, and of course with North Korea,” Mattis said last week. “For right now, we just have to go along with process, have the negotiations and not try to make preconditions or presumptions about how it’s going to go.”Since I inherited my “Late Night” show in 1993, TV has changed exponentially. I’d like to think I have evolved with many of these changes, but now it’s time to take the next leap. A half-hour show will give me the time to do a higher percentage of the comedy in, and out, of the studio that I love and that seems to resonate in this new digital world. It’s still going to be me hosting a very silly show, but I want segments on my half-hour program to link to digital content, deepening the experience for my younger fans, and confusing my older ones.Krysta Montoya

A teen was able to make one hell of a statement by using a clever loophole — and a little help from Shonda Rhimes.

Krysta Montoya, an 18-year-old from Albuquerque, New Mexico, confused the student body at Valley High School with her cryptic senior quote in the school’s 2018 yearbook.

“Grey’s Anatomy Season 5, Episode 6, 39:40,” the quote said.

Montoya told HuffPost that “most people didn’t understand it” and she got sick of explaining what it meant. So, on Monday, she decided to clear everything up on Twitter.

Just because everyone keeps asking me what my quote is. Here ya go. pic.twitter.com/tOKSh79viE — Krysta Ann🌻 (@krystaataa) April 30, 2018

The senior, who is set to graduate from high school later this month, was referencing a moment in Season 5, Episode 6 of “Grey’s Anatomy” in which the character Erica Hahn says, “I am so, so, so gay.”

The scene takes place about 3 minutes and 18 seconds into the episode, with 39:40 remaining.

“I just loved it,” Montoya told HuffPost. “I was watching ‘Grey’s’ and I saw it and I took a screenshot, so I kept it in my camera roll ever since.”

The school administration “would not let me post that,” she said, so she relayed her message secretly instead.

Montoya stressed the importance of being able to express herself this way.

The high school senior said she’s been out since her freshmen year. But because she never dated anyone in middle school, and only experienced her first kiss in high school after dating another girl, people thought she was just going through a phase.

“I feel like people were like, ‘How would you know if you’re gay if you haven’t even tried dating a boy?’”

Those kinds of questions caused her a lot of pain, she said.

"What better way to prove them wrong?" Montoya said. Krysta Montoya

“I felt insecure ― even at times I doubted if I was a lesbian,” she told HuffPost.

Yet, through the support of her parents and a teacher who “taught me so much about being confident and to not be afraid of who you are,” by her senior year Montoya knew exactly who she was.

“Some people even said I’d be with a boy by senior year,” she said. “So what better way to prove them wrong by making my senior quote, ‘I’m so, so, so gay?’”

And being able to use a quote from “Grey’s Anatomy” made everything even more satisfying.Kris Jenner on Friday broke her silence about son-in-law Kanye West’s recent antics.

“You know, Kanye has a lot of love for all of you, all of his fans, and everybody who’s been there to support him forever,” Jenner said in an online preview of Friday’s broadcast of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

West sparked anger this week with his pro-President Donald Trump tweets and comments about slavery being “a choice.” But Jenner, whose daughter Kim Kardashian is married to West, told host Ellen DeGeneres that the rapper would “explain himself in his own way.”

Jenner also urged people to remember that West “always does things with really good intentions.”

“So I’m gonna let him explain himself when the time’s ready, and I just keep rolling on,” she added.

West continues to face backlash for suggesting during a TMZ interview that people who endured slavery did so out of choice. “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah said West’s comments would allow racists to justify their hate, and CNN host Don Lemon called it the musician’s “most shocking claim of all.”

AdvertisementSometimes it feels like we already know everything about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, given her transformation into the pop culture icon known as “the Notorious RBG.” The documentary “RBG,” premiering Friday, is one of two movies about her being released this year. (Another television project was announced this week, a miniseries that will chronicle her and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the first two women on the high court.)

Further proving her cultural ubiquity, “RBG,” directed by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, features footage from her many speaking engagements in recent years, employing recurrent punchlines and anecdotes. The justice has extensively discussed her storied career fighting gender discrimination, her late husband, Marty, championing her work, her “odd couple” friendship with conservative Justice Antonin Scalia — and, on the lighter side, her famous fitness regimen.

In that way, much of the documentary, a celebratory and endearing portrait of the feminist pioneer, covers familiar territory. But it manages to sidestep “the easy narrative” of Ginsburg as a “badass” by illustrating the “paradox” of how she “still feels more comfortable in the world of words and text than in the world of fame and notoriety,” as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick wrote earlier this week.

Part of that paradox emerges in the through-line connecting Ginsburg’s entire legal career, that true and lasting change is slow, often happening in stops and starts, two steps forward, one step back.

In addition to her approach to the law, this also comes through in Ginsburg’s personality. Despite her ebullient public persona, her family, friends and colleagues often describe her in the film’s interviews as “reserved,” “quiet” and “timid.” Yet, as NPR’s Nina Totenberg recounts, Ginsburg could be “a performer” and rise to the occasion when it mattered, like during her Supreme Court confirmation process.

For the most part, as depicted in the documentary, Ginsburg let her reputation precede her, through hard work and having every possible legal strategy at the ready, in order to outmaneuver her opponents. It’s inspirational when so often women in the public eye get derided for being overprepared.

“RBG” deepens viewers’ legal knowledge by documenting her years at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, introducing the audience to some of the plaintiffs she represented.

During these cases, instead of getting frustrated by male judges who ridiculed her and could not seem to grasp the scope of gender discrimination, Ginsburg patiently educated them on legal history, seeing these moments of animosity “always as an opportunity to teach,” as she says in the film.

“One of the things I tried to plant in their minds was, think about how you would want the world to be for your daughters and granddaughters,” she recalls.

According to the film, she was focused on changing the system from within, smartly recognizing that the best strategy was to build a bulletproof legal doctrine through each gender discrimination case that she took on.

“I said, it’s too soon,” she said during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1993, recounting one of her earlier cases. “My expectation, to be candid, was that I would repeat that argument maybe half a dozen times. I didn’t expect it to happen in one fell swoop. I think generally in our society, real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.”

The approach may have appeared “conservative,” as Kathleen Peratis, a former director of the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, says in the film. But eventually it paid off.

Similarly, Ginsburg had criticized the landmark Roe v. Wade decision establishing a woman’s right to an abortion because she feared, rightly, that a sweeping ruling would galvanize activism against abortion. Instead, she argued for individual state laws, which some legislatures were already on their way to passing.

While watching Ginsburg’s career unfold in the documentary, it is hard not to think of the current moment, with the Me Too and Time’s Up movements already generating forms of backlash. While change has happened, it is still slow.

There are reminders of this throughout the documentary, when Ginsburg is shown in rooms full of men, arguing cases before panels of male judges, facing questions at her confirmation hearing before a Senate committee. Today, men still outnumber women in countless positions of power.

And yet, when asked about the current moment, Ginsburg seems clear-eyed.

“When I see women appearing every place in numbers, I’m less worried about a backlash than I might have been 20 years ago,” she said at the documentary’s Sundance Film Festival premiere in January, arguing that now “the law is on the side of women, or men, who encounter harassment, and that’s a good thing.”

In some ways, the law still favors perpetrators, and the work of her generation certainly remains unfinished. But Ginsburg’s confidence that permanent change is possible comes from the perspective of someone who has seen it all and has done what women often do — put our heads down and do the work.It’s been well-established that no one can bend it like David Beckham, but who knew no one could hug quite like him either?

The former footballer rang in his 43rd birthday on Wednesday with a surprise appearance from his oldest son, Brooklyn. The family was out celebrating at a London restaurant when the 19-year-old snuck up behind his father in a video shared on both David and wife Victoria Beckham’s Instagram accounts.

David became instantly emotional, tearing up as his son pulled him in for a sweet embrace.

“What are you doing here?” a clearly overwhelmed David said in the video after giving him a kiss on the cheek. “I missed you so much.”

A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) on May 2, 2018 at 2:25pm PDT

“Best birthday surprise, my big boy coming home,” the father of four captioned the post.

The family’s other members, daughter Harper Seven and younger sons Romeo and Cruz, who all reside in London, were also in attendance. Brooklyn, meanwhile, lives in New York where he studies photography at The Parsons School of Design.

In the video, Harper can be heard reacting to her big brother’s birthday surprise, exclaiming, “I didn’t know Brooklyn was coming.”

The Spice Girl singer also shared a family photo from the big day of her husband and the three younger children posing sweetly together.

“Happy birthday to the best daddy!! X we all love u so much!!! So many kisses from us all xxxx we miss u @brooklynbeckham X,” she wrote, signaling that perhaps she didn’t even know the 19-year-old would soon crash the festivities.

Victoria often gives updates about the Beckham brood on her social media, recently hinting that one of her sons might be following in her musical footsteps sometime soon.

In a video shared earlier this week, 13-year-old Cruz channels his inner Justin Bieber by belts out an unknown track for his mom.

“And I miss you, girl, like sunlight misses the moon,” Cruz sang. “And I pray that I’ll be back inside your arms one day soon.”

A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Apr 30, 2018 at 12:36am PDTA former federal prosecutor, Giuliani said he was the president’s new chief counsel in the Russia investigation but that he would also keep an eye on a U.S. inquiry into a $130,000 hush payment by longtime Trump attorney Michael Cohen to a porn star who said she had a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.

Giuliani said he wanted any Trump interview with Mueller to be limited in time and scope, suggesting for only 2-1/2 hours and not under oath.

In addition to the Russia questions, Giuliani said investigators could ask about possible obstruction of justice related to Trump’s firing a year ago of then-FBI Director James Comey.

The two sides have been negotiating the terms of a possible interview for months, including topics Mueller might pursue as part of a nearly year-old inquiry into possible collusion between Moscow and Trump’s presidential campaign.

The Kremlin has denied assertions by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election. Trump has denied any collusion and has described the investigation as a political witch hunt.

Giuliani, who joined Trump’s legal team last month, said they were trying to figure out whether it was a good idea for Trump to voluntarily submit to an interview.

“Are they trying to trap him?” Giuliani asked. He said Trump’s legal team expected to make a decision in two or three weeks. “We want to get it over with,” he said.

Giuliani said Trump had used retainer fees starting in 2017 to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 Cohen paid the porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the closing weeks of the November 2016 election.

Trump wrote in a tweet on Thursday that Cohen was not paid using campaign funds. The payment was part of a “private agreement” that involved money that had “nothing to do with the campaign,” Trump said.

He said the payment was aimed at stopping “false and extortionist accusations” Daniels made about a sexual encounter with Trump. Trump acknowledged a non-disclosure agreement with her to secure her silence. He denied they had an affair.

The president had previously told reporters he did not know about the payment Cohen made to Daniels.

The investigation of Cohen is an offshoot of Mueller’s probe.

The claim of repayment is significant because a payment by Cohen could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. Trump as candidate would have been permitted to make unlimited personal contributions to his own campaign.

But several experts pointed out an undisclosed campaign loan is also a violation of federal election law.

“It is hardly an improvement to claim that what was claimed as a gift is now a secret loan from your lawyer to pay hush money to a porn star,” said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University Law School Professor who has frequently expressed skepticism about the legal case against the president.Seth Meyers mocked Fox News host Sean Hannity for getting a genuine news scoop on his show and not knowing what to do with it.

On Wednesday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani gave a bombshell interview to Hannity and admitted that President Donald Trump had repaid his personal attorney Michael Cohen for the $130,000 settlement made with porn star Stormy Daniels.

“You know Hannity can’t believe he accidentally made news on his show,” Meyers quipped on Thursday’s broadcast of “Late Night.”

Meyers also noted that Hannity appeared unsure about how to deal with the revelation.

“Sean Hannity is the only guy who would say, ‘Dear God, what have I done?’ when what he has done is journalism,” Meyers added.Samantha Bee pulled no punches as she broke down why the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency should be shut down.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Full Frontal,” Bee joked that ICE’s job application was “just a single question asking if the real hero of ’Schindler’s List’ was the girl shouting ‘Goodbye Jews.’”

“If that criticism of ICE makes you sad, here’s a proposal,” Bee continued. “Let’s shut it the fuck down. I’m serious. It’s awful. And we don’t actually need it. You know, I’m a liberal. I don’t usually advocate for smaller government, but in this case, as I say to my barista every morning, there should be one less ICE.”

Bee explained how ICE was set up following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks “when Islamophobia was as rampant as tube tops and Rudy Giuliani.”

But “by putting the anti-terrorism people in charge of immigration, the government signaled that immigrants are a threat,” Bee said, even though “ICE’s own figures show most immigrants in detention pose no threat to the public.”

Previously:

Colton Haynes and Jeff Leatham have ended their relationship after six months of marriage, US Weekly and TMZ reported Friday.

It’s not clear whether they plan to file for divorce.

Haynes posted a cryptic music video to his social media accounts Thursday that some people are interpreting as a reference to the split.

“I don’t like when you’re staying out all night and never answer your phone, I follow you around the world just to be left alone, and man, it sucks,” the “Teen Wolf” star sings in the video, which can be viewed below. “I said I loved you despite the cheating drama. ... Maybe in the future, you’ll come around.”

A representative for Haynes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Leatham, who works as an artistic director for Four Seasons Hotels, hasn’t been featured on Haynes’ Instagram for a while. The last photo of the couple to appear on the actor’s account is dated Jan. 21. Haynes also dropped his hyphenated married name, Haynes-Leatham, from his Instagram handle; Leatham’s account does not appear to have changed.

If confirmed, the breakup will mark the end of a whirlwind romance for the couple. The two men tied the knot in Palm Springs, California, in October in a ceremony officiated by Kris Jenner.

They got engaged in March 2017, a few weeks after Haynes confirmed they were dating.

President Donald Trump lashed out at NBC News after the outlet walked back its report that federal investigators wiretapped the phone lines of his longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen as part of their investigations into him.

NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite “sources” which are constantly wrong. Problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don’t exist, they are fabricated, fiction! NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2018

NBC News first reported on the alleged wiretapping Thursday, citing two people familiar with the legal proceedings related to Cohen. Cohen is under investigation for a $130,000 payment he made to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who claims she had an affair with Trump. ABC News later confirmed the report.

But hours later, NBC issued a correction on air, citing three senior U.S. officials to say Cohen was not wiretapped. ABC, which posted a similar report on Thursday, also corrected its report. Federal officials were actually reportedly monitoring Cohen using a device known as a pen register, which logs phone numbers or Internet addresses that have been contacted.

The fumbled report came the day after Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s newest attorney, told Fox News that Trump repaid Cohen the $130,000 paid to Daniels, allegedly to keep her from speaking out about the affair. The news directly contradicts statements Trump made last month, when he said he had no knowledge of Cohen’s payments to the actress.On his show Thursday, Jimmy Kimmel poked fun at the “extreme cut out” jeans making news for their barely-there construction and out-there $168 price.

“We don’t have to talk about this unbelievable victory — wasn’t it unbelievable? So we don’t have to say it again. But it’s going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate,” Trump boasted, standing in front of beaming House members.

Since Obamacare’s passage in 2010, Republicans had made repealing it their central campaign promise. If the country handed control of Congress and the White House to the GOP, they would finally dismantle it.

In 2016, they got their wish. But they still couldn’t get the job done. The Senate never passed the House repeal legislation. Public opinion swung in favor of the law, and many of the House members who took the tough vote to advance repeal now find themselves on the defensive at home.

The uneasiness the GOP feels with Obamacare repeal is borne out by the money candidates and other groups are spending on TV ads. In the past, Republicans walloped Democrats on the air with ads mentioning Obamacare, according to an analysis by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.

But in the 2018 cycle, the numbers aren’t quite as stark. Conservatives are still spending more on anti-Obamacare ads ― and airing more spots on the issue ― but Democrats aren’t nearly as far behind as in the past.

Republicans are spending far less on anti-Obamacare ads during this cycle. Kantar/CMAG data for HuffPost

It’s not just that Republicans are less interested in talking about the issue ― it’s also that Democrats are finally feeling emboldened.

“We see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms,” said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “The Republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.”

For the first time in an election cycle since Obamacare’s passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. Democrats now have a sizable advantage over the GOP on the issue, and candidates frequently bring up their support for Obamacare while meeting with voters.

Twenty-three million fewer Americans would have had insurance under legislation that the House Republicans narrowly passed, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Even though outright repeal appears to be off the table, there are still efforts to undermine the law. The big GOP tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don’t get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise.“Anyone who hasn’t received the extensive training provided to law enforcement officers will likely be mentally unprepared to take a life, especially the life of a student assailant,” Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association for School Resource Officers, said in a statement.

Claim: Chicago’s strict gun laws are evidence that gun control doesn’t work.

“We all know what’s going on in Chicago, but Chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country,” Trump said Friday.

Trump and others in the pro-gun crowd have long held up crime rates in Chicago as evidence that gun control doesn’t work. Although both Illinois and its largest city do have strong gun laws, Chicago is a short drive from both Wisconsin and Indiana, where laws are significantly weaker. Studies have found that most of the guns used in crimes in Chicago come from out of state, with many coming from much farther away.

Beyond that, Trump’s comments ignore the fact that homicides and shootings in Chicago have actually been on the decline for more than a year. In 2017, Chicago had the ninth-highest homicide rate of any U.S. city.

Claim: The Bataclan massacre might’ve been prevented if more Parisians had guns.

“Paris, France, has the toughest gun laws in the world,” said Trump, going on to explain how a small group of terrorists armed with AK-47s “brutally killed” more than 130 people in the French capital in 2015.

“If one employee or just one patron had a gun … the terrorists would have fled or been shot, and it would’ve been a whole different story.”

This is another of Trump’s favorite talking points, which he’s been using since the November 2015 Bataclan massacre.

Putting aside for a second the absolute chaos that might have ensued if an arena full of armed concertgoers had decided to open fire on their assailants in the pitch dark, Trump is also leaving out some broader context.

With its strong gun laws, the overall firearm death rate in France is about one-quarter of what it is in the U.S. Although violent crime is not unheard of in Paris, the city experiences just a fraction of the homicides that an American city of a comparable population does. Gun homicides also appear to be primarily an issue among rival criminal gangs.

Claim: Criminals will use knives if they can’t use guns ― just look at London.

“I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle, is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,” said Trump. “Yes, that’s right, they don’t have guns, they have knives, and instead there’s blood all over the floors of this hospital.”

We’re not really sure what Trump’s point is here. If he’s noting that all violence is not gun violence, then sure. But the fact that Londoners are making it to hospitals to receive care is significant. Knives tend to be less lethal than guns, and it’s far easier to injure or kill larger numbers of people, often indiscriminately or unintentionally, by shooting than it is by stabbing.

A recent study in the U.S. found that more gunshot victims are dying before reaching the emergency room than they were a decade ago, even as trauma care has improved. One theory for this trend is an increasing “intensity” of violence, suggesting people may be getting shot more times, at closer range, with higher-caliber rounds, or simply while farther from the nearest hospital.

There’s no saying how much worse the problem would be in London if it were as easy to get a gun there as it is in the U.S.So to be clear you have NO problems with Muslims Hindus or any of the thousands of other religions practising their religion in your country.

The “Late Show” also released a clip of the interview edited to make it look like Giuliani was reacting to his own comments:Here, the 2017 Kentucky Derby competitors race on. When it comes to naming these thoroughbreds, there are several guidelines. Eclipse Sportswire via Getty Images

Free Drop Billy. Lone Sailor. Good Magic. Instilled Regard.

If you guessed those were the names of some of the horses competing in this year’s Kentucky Derby, you’d be right. If you also thought that those words seem like they belong in a game of Mad Libs, you wouldn’t be wrong. That’s because officially naming a thoroughbred comes with some interesting limitations.

The names of the Kentucky Derby contenders are often the highlight of the competition. And if you’ve ever wondered how the heck someone came up with a horse name like that, then you’re in luck. We’re here to provide some background.

The Kentucky Derby is reserved for 3-year-old thoroughbreds. The Jockey Club, the breed registry for thoroughbred horses in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, is the organization responsible for approving thoroughbred names.

Although owners can get creative with their selection, it’s common to name a horse after its pedigree, including something involving the name of the horse’s dam (female parent), sire (male parent) or a combination of the names. Some owners also turn to favorite pastimes or words as well as pop culture for inspiration.

Then, there are the rules.

As stated on the Jockey Club site, names aren’t eligible if they are more than 18 letters (the Jockey Club seems to work like Twitter, as spaces and punctuation count as letters) or are made up of only initials or only numbers (if you want to use a number above 30, it has to be spelled out, which might make you max out your character limit). Names also can’t end in “filly,” “colt,” “stud,” “mare,” “stallion” or related terms.

As for jockeys who also might be pop culture junkies, the Jockey Club won’t approve names of living people unless it has written permission. It won’t accept names of those who have died “unless approval is granted by The Jockey Club based upon a satisfactory written explanation submitted to the Registrar.” In addition, names “clearly having commercial, artistic or creative significance” won’t get you anywhere (think movies, songs, etc.).

In a more obvious rule, the Jockey Club will not give the OK for names with “vulgar or obscene meaning” or names that could be offensive “to religious, political or ethnic groups.” In 2007, Slate revealed that some scandalous names (like On Your Knees) had made it to the registry, and Rick Bailey, registrar of the Jockey Club, admitted some “questionable names might have slipped by” because of the high number of submissions.

Did we mention names already in use are out of the picture? The Jockey Club does regularly put out a list of “released” names, though, or names from horses more than 10 years old that haven’t been used for breeding or racing in the last five years. In December 2017, the Jockey Club released 42,659 names.

These are just a handful of the rules. There are more guidelines about referencing racetracks in names and trying to give your horse what the Jockey Club considers a “permanent name,” typically designated for horses who win major races or large financial prizes. If the Jockey Club rejects a name, the most common reason is because it’s already been taken.

The names might not seem to make sense on the surface, but there are fun stories about the Kentucky Derby horses’ names every year. Aside from horses like Magnum Moon and Good Magic that have names associated with their pedigree, there’s also Bolt D’Oro, a nod to Olympic champion Usain Bolt.

Travelers flying through London’s Heathrow Airport had some route options they might not have expected.

In honor of the unofficial fan holiday celebrating the “Star Wars” franchise ― May 4, as in “May the Fourth be with you” ― Europe’s busiest airport put up a gag departure screen showing flights to some of the galaxy’s most famous destinations.

Whoever conceived of this certainly knows their way around the “Star Wars” universe. Destinations include Luke Skywalker’s home planet of Tatooine, Chewbacca’s native Kashyyyk, and even the frigid ice planet Hoth, for which the display advises, “Awaiting clearance of snow from runway at destination.”

Heathrow’s Twitter account also had fun posting some fun “Star Wars”-themed photos and videos.

Kim Reynolds (R) on Friday signed a law that would effectively ban abortions at six weeks of pregnancy, the nation’s strictest abortion legislation to date, setting up a legal battle with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

The Republican-controlled state legislature passed the legislation, known as the “fetal heartbeat” bill, earlier this week, part of a wave of GOP-backed abortion restrictions introduced at the state level in recent years.

The law requires women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound, banning the procedure if a fetal heartbeat is detected — typically at about six weeks into a pregnancy. It includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.

Medical professionals say that the law is far too stringent, as some women do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks.

Earlier Friday, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU announced that they plan to sue Reynolds over the law’s constitutionality.

“I believe that all innocent life is precious and sacred,” Reynolds said at the Iowa State Capitol, where protesters could be heard during the bill signing.

“If death is determined when a heart stops beating, then doesn’t a beating heart indicate life?”

She acknowledged that the bill may not go into effect, pending a legal challenge. But Reynolds, who has described herself as staunchly pro-life, said: “I’m not going to back down from who I am or what I believe in.”

Similar bans in other states have failed to take effect due to legal challenges.

Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision, affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion until the third trimester, and the court later held that the right existed until fetal viability — typically at 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans and anti-abortion activists see Iowa’s law as an opportunity to chip away at the landmark ruling, and potentially take the legal battle to the Supreme Court.

“This bill will be the vehicle that will ultimately provide change and provide the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade,” state Sen. Rick Bertrand (R) said earlier this week. “There’s nothing hidden here about the agenda.”

Several dozen states have either passed or considered abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies policies on reproductive rights. Some states have also aimed to ban specific methods for abortions.

This story has been updated with comments from Reynolds.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt arrives to testify before a Senate panel on May 16. XXSTRINGERXX xxxxx / Reuters

In 1999, Scott Pruitt, then an Oklahoma state senator, introduced a bill to grant men “property rights” over unborn fetuses, requiring women to obtain the would-be father’s permission before aborting a pregnancy.

Pruitt, now the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, submitted the legislation again in 2005.

The bill, which did not pass either time, faded from Pruitt’s political legacy. But the legislation merits new examination as the EPA chief faces down an avalanche of corruption accusations. As HuffPost previously reported, Pruitt’s support from right-wing evangelical Christians, a group that largely opposes abortion, has helped him keep his job amid calls from droves of Democrats and a handful of Republicans to fire the administrator.

And while his current role atop the EPA does not give him any official control over abortion policy, he has appeared alongside President Donald Trump in meetings with evangelical leaders, and his draconian history on the issue is of a piece with the administration. In one of Trump’s first acts after taking office, he reinstated and expanded the Reagan-era “global gag rule,” withholding federal funding from charities and aid organizations that counsel women on family planning options that include abortion. Last week, the White House proposed a new “domestic gag rule” that would strip Planned Parenthood of funding.

“It’s not surprising that another member of Trump’s inner circle is hostile to women,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, a senior director at the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which opposes Pruitt and supports abortion rights. “But framing a fetus as a man’s property is a new low.”

American Bridge resurfaced the legislation and shared it with HuffPost. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

Pruitt has spent his 15 months at the EPA pushing to keep government out of the private sector. He’s sought to radically deregulate the fossil fuel and chemical industries, clear the way for companies to produce more asthma-triggering pollution, allow deadly chemicals to remain on the market, and revise restrictions on teenage workers handling dangerous pesticides.

By contrast, the bill from his time as a state legislator stated that “it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” referring to a “fetus” as “property” that has been “jointly created by both father and mother.”

The legislation would have barred doctors from performing abortions without signed statements of permission from the father, or evidence that the man could not be located “after diligent effort.” If the pregnancy resulted from rape, the woman would be required to show “such assault has been reported to a law enforcement agency having the requisite jurisdiction.”

Doctors who performed the procedure without that documentation would have risked losing their medical licenses, been “civilly liable to the father of the aborted child for any damages caused thereby,” and had to pay punitive fines of $5,000.

In a statement to The Associated Press in 1999, Pruitt said a pregnant woman who were to obtain an abortion without meeting the bill’s criteria would face legal consequences. “She’ll be held accountable for it,” Pruitt said.

Pruitt also sought to restrict abortion in other ways. In 2001, when the Legislature was considering a bill to require that pregnant minors show parental permission before obtaining an abortion, he introduced an amendment to define a “fetus” as “any individual human organism from fertilization until birth.”

“He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property.” - Leslie McGorman, NARAL Pro-Choice America

The timing of the bills came nearly a decade after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which it ruled that provisions requiring a woman to obtain her husband’s permission for an abortion were unconstitutional.

“He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property and also doesn’t believe in the intellectual concept that women should have agency over their own reproductive choices,” said Leslie McGorman, deputy director at the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Frankly there’s not a whole lot more to tell except that he is the guy who his record indicates he is.”

“He carries that lack of concern for the greater good throughout all of the things he’s done in his career,” she added, referring to his rollback of environmental safeguards.

Until 2017, Pruitt served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that has said “a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband. Around the time he first introduced the abortion bill, in 1999, Pruitt served on the board of the MEND Medical Clinic and Pregnancy Resource Center. Its current executive director, Forrest Cowan, has said unwed mothers have been “failed” by a “boyfriend, who values his own selfish gratification over responsibility, and her father, who should have had her back.”

Pruitt’s crusade against abortion rights continued after he left the state Senate to become Oklahoma’s attorney general. When a district court found a law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion to be unconstitutional, Pruitt appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. After losing there, he unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.President Donald Trump addressed the National Rifle Association’s annual convention on Friday and profusely thanked Kanye West for doubling his African-American polling numbers.

“Kanye West must have some power,” Trump said. “I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week. Thank you, Kanye, thank you.”

Trump went on to say that he initially thought the increase “must be a mistake” and that even “the pollsters thought that was a mistake.”

Pres. Trump claims he doubled his support among African-Americans in past week.

The polling numbers Trump was referring to were likely from a Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked respondents, “Do you approve or disapprove about the way Donald Trump is handling his job as President?” Filtered for black male respondents, the poll does show Trump’s approval increasing from about 11 to about 22 percent. For black people overall, the increase was from about 9 to about 17 percent.

It’s worth noting that polls by YouGov/Economist and SurveyMonkey did not reveal much of a shift in black Americans’ opinions of Trump between April 19 and May 1.

Many on social media couldn’t help but comment on Trump’s remarks.

Trump’s praise for West at the convention isn’t particularly surprising. He’s been effusive about the rapper since West’s tweetstorm last week in which he lauded the president and shared a snapshot of a MAGA hat.

Trump thanked West at the time with a quote-tweet, and also tweeted about the “Famous” singer two days later, crediting West with performing “a great service” to the black community.

During a game called “Spill the Royal Tea,” Cohen asked Chopra a series of loaded questions about Markle and her upcoming royal wedding to Prince Harry, which Chopra will be attending on May 19.

“I don’t want to get you in trouble with the royal family,” Cohen said to Chopra. “I’m just going to ask you a question about Meghan and Harry’s wedding and … if you can’t answer the question, I’ll guess the answer based on your facial expression.”

So, when Cohen asked Chopra if Meghan had cried when she found her wedding dress, the former Miss World responded a little like this:

Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen

Her broad smile prompted both Cohen and fellow guest actor Sebastian Stan to say, “Yes!”

During the segment, the audience learned a few other interesting tidbits. Chopra said she’s never met Prince Harry, hasn’t gotten the couple a wedding gift yet and is attracted to redheads. The actress said the color is “kind of my thing.”

Yet, one of the biggest bombshells came in the form of another nonverbal response.

When Chopra was asked if Markle was a “bridezilla,” the actress reacted like this:

We’re sure Markle loved that response.President Donald Trump on Thursday marked the National Day of Prayer by signing an executive order creating a new office aimed at giving churches and other faith-based organizations a stronger political voice. But some LGBTQ advocates fear this administration could use the new order as ammunition to target their communities.

The order, entitled the “Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative,” will form a “faith initiative,” headed by a yet-to-be-appointed advisor. This advisor will alert the administration to “any failures of the executive branch to comply with religious liberty protections under law,” according to a press release.

“This office will also help ensure that faith-based organizations have equal access to government funding and the equal right to exercise their deeply held beliefs,” Trump said Thursday.

Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, created similar versions of this office during their respective tenures. Trump’s order, however, sparked concern among a number of LGBTQ advocacy groups. Many fear that it may encourage discrimination against LGBTQ people in the name of religion.

Lambda Legal, a national legal nonprofit focused on LGBTQ issues that is based in New York, warned of the potential “weaponization” of religious freedom in a series of tweets Thursday.

President @realDonaldTrump has promised "executive action" today.



"The faith initiative will recognize the vital role of faith in our communities... this office will also help make sure that faith based orgs have access to gov't funding." Yikes, y'all. — Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) May 3, 2018

Freedom of religion is absolutely a core value of our nation. What we're concerned about is the weaponization of that right. Weaponization that allows for and encourages discrimination and harm. Religious freedom is NOT freedom to discriminate. #LGBTQ — Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) May 3, 2018

Rachel Laser, president of the watchdog group Americans United for Separation of Church and State, echoed these sentiments, saying that Trump’s efforts would be used “to divide and discriminate.”

“Our government should protect religious freedom, not use it as a sword to harm others,” she said in a press release. “Today’s order is one more attempt by Trump, cheered by his Evangelical Advisory Board, to redefine religious freedom to mean the freedom to discriminate against those who do not share your religious beliefs.”

According to GLAAD’s Vice President of Programs Zeke Stokes, the move “would not be alarming, except for the anti-LGBTQ extremists and organizations who have the president’s loyalty and his ear.”

“GLAAD will be monitoring closely to see who is tapped to lead this initiative,” he told HuffPost in a Friday email, “and you can bet we will hold that person accountable and this initiative accountable just as we have this entire Administration since its beginning.”

The American Civil Liberties Union also expressed concern, saying the Trump administration has a history of using the law to impose certain beliefs on others or to discriminate.

The Constitution does not give any of us the right to impose our beliefs on others, or to discriminate.



That's exactly what the Trump administration has a history of doing. https://t.co/zQ4cAtacnd — ACLU (@ACLU) May 3, 2018

The exact implications of the executive order on the LGBTQ community are unclear. But the aforementioned groups’ worry may not be unfounded: The White House press release announcing the order stressed the Trump administration’s support of “baker Jack Phillips’s right to operate his bakery in accordance with his religious beliefs.”

Later this spring, the Supreme Court is set to rule on the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. This decision will determine whether Phillips was illegally discriminating against a same-sex couple when he refused to create a cake for their wedding ceremony.Rudy Giuliani put it all out on the table this week. And now, after days of confusion and speculation that he may have exposed President Donald Trump to new legal jeopardy, he’s gathering it all back in.

In remarks to the media Friday, Trump contradicted statements the former New York City mayor made earlier in the week regarding a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election.

“He just started yesterday,” Trump said of Giuliani, who started as the lead attorney regarding issues related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation in late April. “He’ll get his facts straight.”

On Wednesday, Giuliani made waves when he told Fox News the president had in fact repaid his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, for the funds. Trump had previously denied all knowledge of the payment.

Trump seemed to initially confirm Giuliani’s statements in a series of tweets on Thursday morning.

As of Friday, though, Trump’s explanation is apparently that Giuliani didn’t know what he was talking about.

“When Rudy made the statements ― he’s great ― but Rudy had just started and he wasn’t totally familiar with everything,” Trump said. “And Rudy ― we love Rudy ― he’s a special guy. What he really understands is this is a witch hunt.”

“But when he made certain statements, he just started yesterday,” the president went on. “So that’s it.”

“It’s actually very simple,“ Trump added. “I say, you know what, learn before you speak. It’s a lot easier.”

In a statement released Friday afternoon, Giuliani capitulated to the President’s version of the Daniels payment.

“First: There is no campaign violation,” he said. “The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President’s family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.

“Second: My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President’s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.”

In a spot posted online Thursday, the former coal CEO repeated the derogatory term “China people” in a swipe against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

“Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people,” Blankenship said in the ad, reportedly set to air on TV in West Virginia starting Friday.

“While doing so, Mitch has gotten rich,” continued Blankenship, who served time in prison for safety violations that contributed to the fatal 2010 Upper Big Branch mining disaster. “In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars,” he added.

Check out the ad here:

What in the world did I just watch pic.twitter.com/4eudpGAxp0 — Liam Donovan (@LPDonovan) May 3, 2018

Blankenship, whose own fiancée reportedly was born in China, caught heat earlier this week after suggesting in a radio interview that McConnell may have a conflict of interest when it comes to foreign relations because his father-in-law — shipping company chairman James Chao — “is a wealthy Chinaperson.”

Blankenship on Tuesday defended his use of the term, which was used to dehumanize Chinese immigrants arriving in the U.S. in the 19th century.

“I don’t see this insinuation by the press that there’s something racist about saying a ‘Chinaperson,’” he said during a primary debate. “Some people are Korean persons, and some of them are African persons. That’s not any slander there.”

Stephen Colbert ridiculed Blankenship’s earlier campaign ad, in which he called McConnell “Cocaine Mitch,” on Thursday’s “Late Show.”:

People on Twitter ripped Blankenship’s inclusion of the “China people” term in his latest ad:
