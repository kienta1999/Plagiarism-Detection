O’Neill joins a chorus of military veterans who say the parade would be a bad idea.

“This parade would not only waste millions of taxpayer dollars, it would also cost our military precious time and resources,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said in a statement.

Trump reportedly wanted a parade after seeing one in France.

WASHINGTON ― For months, immigrant rights activists believed their best chance to help young undocumented people was to get Democrats to insist on protections for them in a must-pass spending legislation.

That strategy, however, is now dead. And their best hope going forward may be to rely on the goodwill of Republicans. Instead of forcing the GOP to swallow a bill to help undocumented youths, they need the GOP to instead decide they truly want one.

On Friday, Congress approved another government funding bill without any action on so-called Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. It was the third time they had done so.

Dreamers and their allies now turn their attention to Republicans, whom they’re hoping they can persuade to help them for a number of reasons.

That could be because they care about Dreamers, whose lives would be thrown into chaos if Congress does nothing. It could be because they think it’s good policy. Or it could be because they don’t want to suffer political damage caused by an inevitable string of news stories about young people who came to the U.S. as children being detained and deported once they begin to lose protections at a rate of about 1,000 per day starting in early March.

“The image of America deporting fellow Americans is not something this country or the Republican Party want to see unfolding every night on the national and local news,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), a top champion of Dreamer relief, said in a statement on Friday.

The Senate is set to begin floor debate next week on a bill to provide relief for Dreamers, 700,000 of whom will lose Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival work permits and deportation protections over the next two years because President Donald Trump rescinded the program.

Thousands of DACA recipients have already lost their protections, but the number of expirations each day will balloon after a March 5 “deadline” set by Trump for Congress to act. Some recipients are applying to renew their protections after a court order that temporarily reopened the program, but that could take months or be blocked, so losing relief is a real and frightening possibility.

That’s why immigration advocates haven’t given up hope, even though they condemned Democrats and Republicans for voting on government funding without a Dreamer fix. Todd Schulte, president of the pro-reform FWD.us, said the country is “almost certainly heading into incredibly cruel and chaotic times” that only Congress can stop.

“So I remain pretty confident of getting something done here,” he said. “I don’t know the exact timing, but the reason is that the consequences of failure are incredibly severe.”

It’s still going to be tricky.

Trump is demanding a slate of highly controversial policy changes, including slashing legal immigration, bulking up border security and restricting access for asylum, in exchange for protections for the Dreamers he claims he wants to help.

His proposals will now be tested in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would allow for an open process to let all senators submit their ideas and then see what can get enough approval to pass. It’s “both terrifying and a great opportunity,” as Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-reform group National Immigration Forum, put it.

“There is no option of giving up.” - Greisa Martinez Rosas of United We Dream

Some of Trump’s framework will likely fall apart. He wants to dramatically cut legal immigration pathways ― the diversity lottery and types of family-based migration ― without replacing them with something else, which some Republicans oppose, as do most Democrats. Funding for his border wall might be difficult to swing, although the White House’s broad definition for what constitutes a “wall” makes it easier for Democrats to stomach.

But then the Senate will have to figure out what can pass, with supporters for a narrow bill up against people who want to drag in other issues, potentially as poison pills to kill it.

The Dream Act, the preferred bill of immigrant advocates to grant a path to citizenship to Dreamers, has bipartisan support, but not enough. A large group of senators is working on their own approach that they have yet to unveil. As a fallback, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a co-sponsor of the Dream Act, said this week that he is preparing a bill that would extend DACA protections on a temporary basis, along with some border security measures.

If the Senate pulls off a bill, it could still die in the House. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said he wants to get something done, with the caveat that he wants a bill the president will sign ― which could mean blocking bills that a majority of the chamber supports based on a prediction that Trump would veto them. Ryan might also insist on the informal Hastert Rule, a tradition of allowing votes only if a bill can pass with a majority of Republicans.

It’s not clear what route the House will take. A bill from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and other GOP members to reshape immigration policy and enforcement ― without a path to citizenship for Dreamers ― faces heavy opposition.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Ryan to offer the same open process in the lower chamber that McConnell is holding in the Senate. If he did, potentially breaking the Hastert Rule, one of them would likely pass ― either the Dream Act, a Republican alternative put forward by Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) or a bipartisan bill from Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.). Or, perhaps, whatever bill the Senate approves.

Then there’s the president. Although he’s said he supports action for Dreamers, his White House spends far more time emphasizing the dangers of both legal and undocumented immigrants, indicating his top priority is keeping people out of the U.S. rather protecting young people’s ability to remain.

Still, even Trump might want to avoid the bad publicity of DACA recipients losing their protections in massive numbers, or be convinced it’s worth compromising to get his wall.

McConnell, Ryan and Trump are in the driver’s seat now more than they were before. That’s frightening given their past and current stances, said Mayra Macias, political director of Latino Victory Project, which promotes Latinos in politics and pro-reform candidates.

“We want to be hopeful and also really hope that we’re wrong about Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and this administration and hope that they will stick to their word and have a substantive conversation about what immigration reform looks like,” she said.

Pressure will be on Democrats, too, to not compromise and approve measures that would hurt other immigrants in order to save Dreamers. Undocumented immigrant activists say they don’t want to be used as bargaining chips for Trump’s proposals to block off legal immigration channels or anything that could put the rest of the undocumented community in danger.

Even though they feel betrayed by Democrats who did not use their leverage on government funding to get Dreamer protections and wary of Republicans who voice support but don’t act, undocumented youth will keep pushing lawmakers. They don’t have any other choice, Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director of the undocumented youth organization United We Dream, said on a call with reporters.The 2018 Winter Olympics are here, and that means superfan Leslie Jones is taking over Twitter.

Feb 9 (Reuters) - United States bobsledder Steven Holcomb’s untimely death last year shocked the fraternity and brought them closer, members of the team said on Friday.

Holcomb, 37, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York in May.

“We’ve become more than a team, we’ve become a brotherhood that I haven’t seen in the past 10 years in the sport. It’s just how we all came together,” Nick Cunningham, who will compete in two-man and four-man events, said on Friday.

“We’re all suffering together and the best way to honor Holcomb’s legacy is to carry it on, to always be that threat on the hill, always put in that work and honor him by what we’re doing behind the scenes,” he added.

Steven Langton, who won gold along with Holcomb in the 2012 World Championships in Lake Placid, said the team was sporting rubber bracelets to honor his legacy.

“It’s just a simple rubber band but it’s something that you never have to take off and it’s a way to remember our friend and brother. Most of us in some capacity got into this sport of bobsled because of Steve, had success because of Steve.”

Langton won a bronze medal with Holcomb in the two-man event in the Sochi Olympics before it was re-designated silvers after the Russian team was disqualified following a doping scandal.

“I’d like to say this year has been really hard for everyone,” Samuel McGuffie added. “I owe a lot of my success now to Holcomb. He’ll be greatly missed from now until eternity.”

Carlo Valdes, who joined the U.S. team in 2014, said he had talked extensively with Holcomb ahead of the Pyeongchang Games.The Olympics opening ceremony will kick off Friday evening in Pyeongchang, South Korea, launching the highly anticipated Winter Games. People from all around the world will look on as more than 2,000 athletes from 92 countries compete for their national pride.

Here’s a look at the games by the numbers:

Bigger Than Ever Before

You know that little tidbit about the 92 countries competing in this year’s Olympics? Well, that’s a record. There are six new countries appearing in this year’s games: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.

The 2018 Winter Olympics will have more than 100 medal events. The International Olympic Committee added four new events this year: curling mixed doubles, speedskating mass start, snowboarding big air, and alpine skiing team event.

Team USA is the biggest it’s ever been before, too. Actually, it’s bigger than any Winter Olympic team in history. There are 242 U.S. athletes on the roster for 2018, beating its previous record of 222 competitors at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

Olympic-Sized Price Tags

Hosting an international sporting event is no cheap endeavor. The 2018 Winter Olympics will cost the South Korean government an estimated $13 billion dollars. Of course, the event itself typically makes enormous revenue, between ticket sales, licensing deals, incoming tourism and international sponsorships.

Surprisingly, $13 billion is downright affordable in comparison to the most expensive games in history. The last Winter Games, in Sochi, Russia, cost nearly $22 billion, even though the anticipated budget was originally around $5 billion. That number jumps to $55 billion after including the post-game costs of maintaining the Olympic stadium.

Who Has More Medals?

Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen is representing her country this year with the most medals going into the game. Bjørgen will enter the Olympics with 10 medals: six gold, three silver, and one bronze.

She has a chance to beat her countryman, biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen, for the title of most decorated Winter Olympic athlete in the history of the games. (Team USA’s 28-time medalist, Michael Phelps, is still the most decorated Olympian of all time, though.)

Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number

This year’s youngest Olympian is China’s Wu Meng, a 15-year-old halfpipe skier. Team USA’s youngest athlete, 17-year-old figure skater Vincent Zhou, is only slightly older than Wu, but both are significantly older than gymnast Dimitrios Loundras. Loundras was only 10 years old when he won the bronze for Greece in 1896 in Athens.

Canadian curler Cheryl Bernard, 51, will be the oldest athlete entering the games. If Bernard, a team alternate, doesn’t actually compete in the games, then 49-year-old Finnish curler Tomi Rantamaeki will take the honor.

In addition to the curlers, this year’s Team USA hockey players will be a bit older than usual. The National Hockey League instituted a rule that none of its active players will be allowed to compete in this year’s Winter Olympics.Grandmaster Robert Hess gives former Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel a chess lesson outside the Chess Club and Scholastic Center in St. Louis on August 13, 2017. BILL GREENBLATT via Getty Images

When John Urschel retired from the NFL last year after just 3 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, it made headlines. In recent years, several young players, including Chris Borland of the 49ers, have bowed out of the sport early due to growing concerns over the potential for long-term brain damage, but Urschel’s motivation was different: he just didn’t have time for football anymore. He was getting a PhD in math at MIT.

The idea of a 300-pound offensive lineman trading in his helmet for a protractor obviously generated a lot of interest, as well as a lot of bad math/football puns. Now, Urschel has quietly set himself a new goal: he wants to become a chess master.

You might think someone who spends his days studying Laplacian eigenvectors would pick a hobby that’s a little more restful on the brain. But for Urschel, the appeal of math and the appeal of chess are very similar. “As a mathematician, I really like to understand the structure of things,” he says. “[Chess] is very mathematical to me. You’re playing a game, you’re faced with some position, you’re trying to figure out the way to proceed, and you don’t really know in most cases if I play this move or that move, if that’s winning, if it’s losing, if it’s drawing... It doesn’t feel that much different from being faced with a mathematical problem and trying to reason your way through.”

Urschel has set himself the goal of earning the National Master title, which is awarded by the US Chess Federation to players who reach a certain rating level. While the “NM” title falls well below the prestigious Grandmaster title given out by FIDE (the International Chess Federation) it’s still a heavy lift for someone who’s getting a PhD and raising a child at the same time. Nevertheless, Urschel thinks he can do it. So does Daniel Rensch, Vice President of Chess.com, the most popular online chess site. “I would be surprised if he doesn’t make master in the next five years,” he says.

The two met sometime last year, when Urschel reached out to Rensch on Twitter. Rensch is an International Master (the second-highest title bestowed by FIDE), and was one of the top junior players in his youth. “[Urschel] said he was a big fan of Chesscenter, which is a show that we do, a monthly sports-style recap of all the biggest stories in chess,” recalls Rensch. “At first I was like, ‘who’s this?’ Then I click and I’m like, ‘oh crap, this is an NFL star.’ And then I found out John is one of the most interesting people on the planet.”

Intrigued by the idea of an ex-NFL player who wanted to become a chess master, Rensch made himself Urschel’s unofficial mentor. Nowadays you can often see them together on Chess.com’s youtube channel, like in this video where Rensch gives Urschel a calculation lesson:

In July, Chess.com organized a “celebrity chess match” between Urschel and Shaun Hutchinson, or “Hutch”, a popular eSports streamer and commentator who dabbles in chess. “At the time our ratings on Chess.com were comparable,” says Urschel. “It seemed like a cool thing to do.”

After losing the first game, Urschel surged to a blowout victory by winning the next eleven in a row ― but he’s charitable to his vanquished foe. “I won but I want to stress that the score did not represent our talent levels,” he told me. “He very much went on tilt, as people do. People go on tilt, things happen.”

After I spoke to Urschel on the phone for this article, I challenged him to a quick game on Chess.com. He accepted. It was a tense game, with both sides holding the advantage at various points. Urschel managed his clock better than me and I lost on time in the endgame (in timed games, the first player whose clock runs out loses). I showed our game to Daniel Rensch to see if he had any thoughts. After offering me some tips on my own play, he turned to Urschel’s. Get ready for some chess jargon.

“I think John’s biggest mistake was that after e5 on move 19 he should’ve played d5,” he told me. “If he responds with d5 there he’s got a really strong passed pawn in the center, and it leaves your bishop on f6 blocked by your own e-pawn. John has a tendency to like trading pieces, because he really likes the endgame, but it means he can misplay some middlegame space advantages. I’ve worked with him on this.”

Getting to master level means meticulously identifying and ironing out those weaknesses, one by one. “I think it’s totally realistic that he can make master in 3 to 4 years,” says Rensch. “In that way I am both his biggest cheerleader and his biggest critic. Because I do push him to challenge his own weaknesses and not to be comfortable. John loves the game, he loves the scientific aspects of it, and he’s willing to work hard. But whether he’s able to fully embrace the gamesmanship aspect of it will be a big determining factor. I think John is already on the way to having a master-level understanding of the game. But he’s not there yet.”

In 2015, after Chris Borland’s retirement due to concerns over football-related brain damage, Urschel published a piece in the Players’ Tribune defending his decision to keep playing the game. “Objectively, I shouldn’t,” he admitted. So why not quit? “I love hitting people,” he said simply. For Urschel, there was just no replacing the rush of physically dominating another player.Ronald Martinez via Getty Images

The man knows how to make an entrance.

Pita Taufatofua, whose oiled torso wowed the world at the opening ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics, returned to the Olympic stage in the same fashion at Friday’s opening ceremony for the Winter Games.

It was below freezing in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as Taufatofua strutted through the stadium like it was, well, a day at the beach.

Taufatofua made these Games as a cross-country skier by qualifying in mostly dry-land roller events. He’s not a contender ― just as he wasn’t when he lost in the first round in taekwondo in Rio ― but, man, he just struck gold in the kick-off event again.

Media outlets are heavily scrutinizing the director’s past behavior towards women on set in light of Uma Thurman’s recent allegations of inappropriate behavior.

In the DVD bonus footage for the 2007 film “Grindhouse” — which consists of the Tarantino-directed film “Death Proof” and the Robert Rodriguez-directed “Planet Terror” that Fergie starred in — the singer and actress recalled Tarantino getting a little too into his character as a zombie.

“We kept having to redo the scene because he was getting so into being this creature that he was making all these noises,” Fergie said (in the video above). “And he was blaming it on the other guys, but really Quentin was making all the noise.”

Jezebel resurfaced the clip Thursday just days after the director faced criticism in the wake of Thurman’s interview with the New York Times in which the actress revealed that a stunt from the 2003 film “Kill Bill” left her with permanent damage to her neck and knees. Thurman also alleged that Tarantino choked and spit on her during the filming of the movie.

In the companion footage, Tarantino can be seen running behind Fergie and then tackling her with other actors who are playing zombies.

“So I’m doing the scene, right,” Fergie continued. “And he starts biting me!”

After Tarantino pushes Fergie to the ground in the behind-the-scenes footage, she can be heard laughing and saying: “You fucker, get off me.”

“It wasn’t that bad,” Rodriguez said in an interview that follows the footage. “It wasn’t like a bite, she wasn’t bleeding or anything. Certainly you felt some teeth on flesh. But it happens, people get into their role.”

During the next scene in the clip, Fergie shows a bruise from Tarantino’s bite and says: “Quentin fucking bit me. And by the end of this shoot, I will bite him back.”

Actress Rose McGowan, who also was in the double feature, wrote about Tarantino’s questionable behavior on the set of “Death Proof” and “Planet Terror” in her memoir “Brave,” according to the Telegraph.

“McGowan writes that for all the praise Tarantino receives for depicting strong female characters in his films, he also ‘beats the s—- out of them for his enjoyment,’” according to an excerpt from the article.

And although actress Diane Kruger recently defended Tarantino, she did tell Parade in 2009 that the director insisted on choking her himself for her character’s death scene in “Inglourious Basterds.” According to Kruger, Tarantino wanted to use his own hands for a close-up shot of the strangling scene instead of Christoph Waltz, the actor whose character was supposed to kill her in the movie.The New York Daily News used its front page on Tuesday to tear into President Donald Trump and White House senior adviser ― and first daughter ― Ivanka Trump:

“@TeamUSA dishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer,” Davis wrote on Thursday. “No problem. I can wait until 2022.”

Davis, who was the first black athlete to win individual gold at a Winter Olympics at the 2006 Turin Games also captioned his post with the #BlackHistoryMonth2018 hashtag.

The coin toss followed a 4-4 tie between Davis and Hamlin after athletes from the U.S. Olympic Committee’s eight different sports federations involved in the Winter Games cast their votes. No evidence was offered to suggest that the toss was altered or weighted in any way.

In the wake of the allegations, which surfaced Thursday in a Politico article, Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia said she will take an “immediate unpaid leave” from her position in the state Assembly.

Two men have accused Garcia of sexually harassing and groping them.

Daniel Fierro, a former staffer to Democratic Assemblyman Ian Calderon, said that in 2014 Garcia cornered him after an Assembly softball game in Sacramento and grabbed his buttocks and attempted to touch his crotch.

Another man, a Sacramento lobbyist who remained anonymous, said Garcia sexually propositioned him and attempted to grab his crotch during a political fundraiser in May 2017.

Both men said the assemblywoman appeared to be heavily intoxicated when the alleged incidents occurred.

Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Democrat, said the Assembly is taking the men’s claims seriously and has hired an outside firm to investigate the allegations.

“I trust that while the investigation proceeds Assemblymember Garcia will respond appropriately and in a way that fortifies the Legislature’s effort to create a new climate,” Rendon said in a statement. “As in other cases, while the investigation moves forward, I am also asking Assembly Human Resources to reach out to Assemblymember Garcia’s staff to ensure they feel safe in their work environment.”

Garcia, who chairs the Legislative Women’s Caucus and has spoken out about her own experiences of sexual harassment in the state Capitol, has categorically denied the allegations.

“Upon reflection of the details alleged, I am certain I did not engage in the behavior I am accused of,” she said in a statement. “However, as I’ve said before, any claims about sexual harassment must be taken seriously, and I believe elected officials should be held to a higher standard of accountability.”

Garcia said she had decided to voluntarily take an unpaid leave of absence from the Assembly and her committee assignments, noting that she didn’t wish to be “a distraction or in any way influence the process of this investigation.”

“I implore the Assembly Rules Committee to conduct a thorough and expeditious investigation, and I look forward to getting back to work on behalf of my constituents and for the betterment of California,” Garcia added.

The allegations against Garcia emerged in the wake of a nationwide movement to call out sexual harassment and abuse by people in positions of power. In California, legislators have aimed to move quickly to respond to sexual harassment allegations after dozens of female legislators and political consultants released an open letter last year about abuses at the state Capitol.PARK CITY, Utah ― Gloria Allred is no longer just a crusading lawyer: She’s now a Hollywood headliner, having splashed around last month’s Sundance Film Festival, where her documentary, “Seeing Allred,” premiered ahead of its Feb. 9 Netflix release.

There, in addition to speaking at the Women’s March rally, she was subjected to the sort of press junket all too familiar to movie stars ― the kind where she was seated in a nondescript condo suite for hours while a parade of journalists, one after the next, sat before her with their allotted 20 minutes’ worth of questions.

Gloria Allred at one of her press conferences in "Seeing Allred." Netflix

I was one of those journalists, and let me tell you this: Gloria Allred knows her talking points. No matter the query, her answers tended to contain well-packaged legal advice and testimony about her commitment to helping women “speak out about injustices they have felt in their lives.”

Allred’s chief message during my time with her was to urge survivors of sexual assault and harassment to seek an attorney’s counsel before contacting the media or logging an allegation on Twitter. And it appears she knows a handful of women who’ve done exactly that.

In fact, Allred said she’s currently representing clients with allegations against “high-profile figures” who have yet to be exposed by the #MeToo movement.

Gloria Allred in "Seeing Allred." Netflix

Despite her misgivings about social media, Allred did acknowledge that the court of public opinion has made an impact. “Many wrongdoers are facing very serious consequences, even though there is no civil lawsuit filed or criminal case brought against them, and there may never be,” she said. “They’re facing consequences to their careers, and they’re on the defensive. They’ve always been on the offensive, but now suddenly there’s a power shift, and they’re on the defensive.”

“[Women are] feeling very empowered,” she added, “and a lot of the men in Hollywood are shaking in their boots and saying, ‘Oh my god, am I going to be next?’ And many of them are, because I’m contacting many of them and their names are not in the news.”

Unsurprisingly, Allred didn’t elaborate further, except to say these individuals “may be surprised because they may have underestimated the commitment of their victim to [take action].”

Such action forms the backbone of “Seeing Allred,” directed by Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman, who last collaborated on the World War II documentary “Above and Beyond.” The film shows Allred at work, tracing her roots as an activist, her own rape and subsequent abortion, and her eminent role in recent cases against Bill Cosby, President Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein.

“Allred” also touches on her daughter Lisa Bloom’s legal career. Bloom defended three women who accused now-disgraced Fox News heavyweight Bill O’Reilly of sexual harassment. But she also briefly advised Weinstein and reportedly tried to discredit a journalist pursuing a story about former Amazon Studios chief Roy Price, which left some questioning Bloom’s commitment to ousting alleged wrongdoers.

When I asked Allred about Bloom’s work, Allred insisted that she and her daughter don’t talk about cases or the broader movement. “I haven’t discussed #MeToo with either my daughter or my granddaughter,” she said before changing the subject to quote a speech she’d delivered at a dinner during Sundance.

Naturally, “Seeing Allred” is an especially timely documentary, given the continuing cycle of #MeToo-related news. But Allred said she agreed to participate in the film “months before we even knew the Bill Cosby story would break, before President Trump [was] elected by the Electoral College, before Harvey Weinstein.” As she tells it, it took the directors two years to persuade her to commit to the project.

“It just worked out because they were able to cover so many issues that I’ve been working on for 42 years,” she said, “and in a way that they could understand what I’m doing, why I’m doing it and how important it is that persons who are victims, or believe that they are, speak up.”By Keisha N.

Black History Month is an opportunity to reflect on the historical contributions of black people in the United States. Too often, however, this history focuses on black men, sidelining black women and diminishing their contributions.

This is true in mainstream narratives of black nationalist movements in the United States. These narratives almost always highlight the experiences of a handful of black nationalist men, including Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan.

Contrary to popular conceptions, women were also instrumental to the spread and articulation of black nationalism – the political view that people of African descent constitute a separate group on the basis of their distinct culture, shared history and experiences.

As I demonstrate in my new book, Set the World on Fire, black nationalist movements would have all but disappeared were it not for women. What’s more, these women laid the groundwork for the generation of black activists who came of age during the civil rights-black power era. In the 1960s, many black activists – including Ella Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer, Robert F. Williams, Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael – drew on these women’s ideas and political strategies.

So, let’s use this Black History Month to begin to set the record straight.

The Universal Negro Improvement Association

In 1914, when the Jamaican black nationalist Marcus Garvey launched the Universal Negro Improvement Association, Amy Ashwood – who later became his first wife – was the organization’s first secretary and co-founder.

Her efforts were invaluable to the success of the association, which became the most influential black nationalist organization of the 20th century. The organzation’s earliest meetings were held at the home of Ashwood’s parents. When the organization’s headquarters relocated from Jamaica to Harlem, Ashwood was actively engaged in its affairs.

In addition to serving as general secretary in the New York office, Ashwood helped to popularize the Negro World, the organization’s official newspaper. She also contributed to the financial growth of the organization, relying on her parents’ money to meet some of the growing expenses.

In 1922, months after Garvey’s divorce from Amy Ashwood, Amy Jacquesbecame Garvey’s new wife – a position she used to leverage her involvement and leadership in the organization. During these years, she helped to popularize and preserve her husband’s ideas. When her husband was imprisoned in 1925 and later deported – on trumped-up charges of mail fraud orchestrated by the FBI – Amy Jacques Garvey oversaw the organization’s day-to-day activities.

In the aftermath of Garvey’s 1927 deportation, women helped to popularize black nationalist politics. With limited financial resources and resistance from the FBI, these women asserted their political power in various cities across the United States.

The Peace Movement of Ethiopia

During the Great Depression, Chicago was one of the key cities where black nationalist women organized. In 1932, Mittie Maude Lena Gordon, a former member of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, established an organization called the Peace Movement of Ethiopia which became the largest black nationalist organization established by a woman in the United States. At its peak, the organization attracted an estimated 300,000 supporters in Chicago and across the country.

“No history of black nationalism is complete without acknowledging women’s significant contributions.”

In 1933, Gordon initiated a nationwide emigration campaign, utilizing her widespread political networks in Chicago and across the Midwest. With the assistance of other black nationalist activists, she collected signatures for a pro-emigration petition. In August of that year, she mailed the petition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt with approximately 400,000 signatures of black Americans willing to leave the country. Drawing inspiration from FDR’s New Deal programs, Gordon requested federal support for those who desired to relocate to West Africa in hopes of securing a better life.

Gordon’s attempt to secure federal support failed. Yet she drew an even larger following of supporters who were inspired by her bold move. Many of these new members were women. Black women found in her organization a space of empowerment and opportunity. They occupied a number of visible leadership roles, working alongside the organization’s female founder.

Celia Jane Allen, a black woman from Mississippi who had relocated to Chicago, was one of these women. In the mid-1930s, she became an active member of the Peace Movement of Ethiopia. Embracing Gordon’s vision for unifying black people in the U.S. and abroad, Allen took on a leadership role in the organization. In 1937, she became one of the national organizers. From the late 1930s to the mid-1940s, Allen traveled extensively throughout the South, visiting local homes and churches to recruit new members and advocate the relocation to West Africa. By the end of World War II, she was successful in getting thousands of black southerners to join the movement and embrace black nationalist ideas.

Today, these women’s stories are largely absent in popular accounts of black nationalism. More often than not, the assumption is that men exclusively established and led black nationalist organizations. This could not be farther from the truth. As these few examples reveal, women were key players in black nationalist movements, and their efforts helped to keep black nationalist ideas alive in U.S. politics. No history of black nationalism is complete without acknowledging women’s significant contributions.The 2018 Winter Games kicked off Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with an opening spectacle for the ages, complete with dancing, drones, fireworks and even a little diplomacy.

Transmitting an overriding message of peace and harmony, the dazzling variety of routines showcased Korean culture, and parts of it were set to a Korean pop music soundtrack.

Technology took a front seat in the ceremony. with the creative use of elements like more than 1,200 drones lighting up the sky to depict athletes in action.

The Olympic flame was lit toward the end of the opening ceremony, declaring the Winter Games officially open.

Check out some of the opening ceremony highlights:Boston University hockey player Jordan Greenway will make history in Pyeongchang, South Korea, becoming the first African-American ever to be selected for the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team.

Breaking that 98-year color barrier, which began in the 1920 Winter Games in Antwerp, Belgium, when men’s ice hockey was first included, is a significant achievement, but Greenway tells NBC Sports that he is just “another kid going to play in the Olympics.”

Greenway says he’s happy to be first and hopes it will inspire young minorities to give hockey a shot.

“I don’t think a lot of African-Americans play hockey at a high level,” said Greenway. “I’m just trying to get more and more of those kids to try and go out and do something different.”

At 14, Greenway began playing at Shattuck-St. Mary’s prep school in Faribault, Minnesota, known for its hockey program.

It’s only his second Netflix special, but David Letterman’s new edition of (deep breath now) “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman” already seems to be straining for effect. The guest this time is George Clooney. It starts with the two of them standing outside an In-N-Out Burger joint in Los Angeles, munching burgers and fries — you know, just a couple of regular guys, you’re supposed to think. That is, until an In-N-Out employee comes out to give them chocolate milkshakes and they look at him as if this worker was a Martian. The most these two wealthy showbiz fellows can summon in his presence is the idea that maybe one of them should have given the guy a tip. That’s how celebrities look at you or me: Maybe we should give this person a few bucks.

Cut to the interview proper. Clooney comes out onstage, he and Letterman sit down in chairs, Clooney does the obligatory joke about Letterman’s beard, referring to “this Soggy Bottom Boys thing you’ve got going,” and they ramble on the subject of Clooney’s childhood, with a fair amount of Letterman’s childhood thrown into the bargain. It’s nothing you haven’t heard if you’ve ever seen Clooney profiled, or read a Letterman interview, but here’s the thing: To each other, this is all new material, because Clooney and Letterman live inside their separate fame bubbles, so Letterman’s never heard the Clooney stories about all the bad TV acting gigs he had before “ER” made him a star, and Clooney hasn’t heard Letterman talk about how his mom was emotionally withholding. Basically, watching all this on Netflix, you’re waiting for them to get these niceties out of the way to dig down a bit deeper.

Unfortunately, the deeper stuff is also the most tedious stuff. Once the conversation has taken us up to Clooney’s marriage to human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, the show cuts to a filmed segment of a visit to Clooney’s boyhood home in Lexington, Ky. There, his dad, former broadcaster Nick Clooney, introduces Letterman to Hazim Avdal, whose chyron reads, “Iraqi refugee sponsored by the Clooneys.” Yes, the elder Clooneys have taken in a nice young man at the bidding of George and Amal, who works with people whose families have been affected by genocidal war. It’s a pleasant enough interlude — until they’re all walking down a leafy Kentucky street chatting and Letterman mock-yells at a guy riding on lawn mower. Except it’s not really a mock yell; he really does want the guy to shut off his motor so they can keep filming. Again: rich and powerful person meets ordinary citizen as alien presence.

The hour is genial enough, with Clooney professing extravagant love for Amal: “I had met someone for whom I would absolutely trade my life for … her life meant more to me than my life, and I’d never had that experience before.” George talks about the twins he and Amal have, and Letterman chimes in with more tales of parenthood. Clooney starts asking Letterman questions about his childhood, and when he says, “People don’t know much about you and people are interested in how you became David Letterman,” we’re back to that “Celebrities, they’re not like us” stuff again, because we have to sit through stuff we already know about Letterman’s Midwestern childhood and his early days as a weatherman and comedian.

As I say: affable enough. But if you find yourself getting bored, I’ll give you a Netflix tip: Give “Babylon Berlin” a shot. It’s a German crime series — I’m only one episode in, but it seems interesting.

“My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman” is streaming now on Netflix.

AdvertisementWhite House chief of staff John Kelly expressed his willingness to resign over his handling of the domestic abuse allegations against staff secretary Rob Porter this week, The New York Times and ABC News reported on Friday, citing anonymous sources within the West Wing.

President Donald Trump has floated several potential replacements for Kelly to aides, sources told ABC. Reportedly on his list are House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney and businessman Tom Barrack.

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on Friday denied the reports that Kelly had offered to resign. Kelly also denied the reports.

Porter resigned on Wednesday after his two ex-wives alleged that he physically, mentally and emotionally abused them over the course of their marriages. His second ex-wife received a protective order against him in 2010, which prevented Porter from receiving a full security clearance at the White House. Porter has denied the allegations against him.

Kelly reportedly knew about the protective order against Porter well before the staff secretary resigned. It’s unknown whether Kelly took any action when he first became aware of the allegations, but on Wednesday, he reportedly urged Porter not to resign and wrote a glowing review of the alleged abuser.

“Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can’t say enough good things about him,” Kelly said in a statement. “He is a friend, a confidante, and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.”

Kelly was also criticized for letting White House communications director Hope Hicks, who has reportedly been romantically involved with Porter, help draft his statement.

In a second statement released later on Wednesday, Kelly said that he was “shocked” by the domestic abuse reports but that he would “stand by” his praise of Porter.

“I was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter,” Kelly said. “There is no place for domestic violence in our society. I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff, and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation.”

Since Trump appointed him chief of staff in July, Kelly has been viewed as a disciplined and stabilizing force within the White House and someone whose word could be trusted. Kelly took over from former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who lasted just six months on the job.

Porter had been instrumental in Kelly’s ability to reduce much of the chaos that defined the Trump White House’s first months, a factor that may have played into his reluctance to lose the secretary.

As staff secretary, Porter determined what material made it to Trump’s desk and, under Kelly’s supervision, who was granted a meeting with the president.

But some say the authority Kelly commanded has been damaged by his public statements about Porter and by reports that Porter stayed as long as he did in the White House only at Kelly’s urging.

Kelly also reportedly instructed White House aides to communicate a different version of events than what public record shows, to make it appear that “he took immediate and direct action,” The Washington Post reported Friday.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department’s third-ranking official, Rachel Brand, plans to step down after just nine months on the job, the New York Times reported on Friday, at a time when President Donald Trump has taken aim at senior law enforcement officials.

Brand was next in line of succession to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the ongoing probe.

Rosenstein oversees Mueller’s investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the matter last year.

Brand’s resignation is the latest sign of turmoil at U.S. law enforcement agencies, which have come under sustained attack by Trump and his Republican allies in recent months. The Times reported that Brand will resign, citing two people briefed on her decision.

News of her departure comes a week after Trump approved the release of a previously classified memo written by Republican lawmakers that portrayed the Russia investigation, initially handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and now headed by Mueller, as a product of political bias against Trump at the Justice Department and FBI.

Trump also has criticized Sessions for recusing himself.

On Feb. 2, just hours before Trump approved the release of the Republican memo, Sessions offered praise for Rosenstein, the department’s No. 2 official, and Brand, saying they “represent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.”

Neither Brand nor a Justice Department spokesman could be immediately reached for comment.A new Netflix documentary about Donald Trump characterizes him as a “P.T Barnum” carnival barker who hyped his reputation despite failed businesses and capitalized on an image as a powerful deal-maker on “The Apprentice” to launch himself into the White House.

Director Fisher Stevens told HuffPost that Trump is still leaving victims in his wake, just as he did in business, like so much “road kill.”

And his behavior is the same: “lying and creating false scenarios,” said Stevens, who produced the Oscar-winning 2009 documentary “The Cove,” about dolphin slaughter in Japan.

Trump was “pretty down and out,” after a series of bankruptcies, said Fisher. ”‘The Apprentice’ gave Trump a new life. He keeps bouncing back. You can punch him, and he comes back.”

“The Confidence Man” is part of a new Netflix series called “Dirty Money.” The Trump segment examines his life before he became president, focusing on his business deals, bankruptcies, business partners and the popular reality show about him that its creators considered a “scam.” The documentary does not cast a favorable light.

Trump biographer Tim O’Brien calls him a “P.T. Barnum” who continually hyped his own inflated image of himself. Trump declared bankruptcies several times, leaving investors, contractors and banks holding the bag, while declaring his incredible success, O’Brien noted.

Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey — touted as the “eighth wonder of the world” in ads — went bankrupt even though Trump’s father, Fred Trump, gave him a hand by buying $3 million in chips — and not using them — in a quiet loan, according to Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell. The Taj was a “financial disaster,” thanks to Trump, O’Donnell says in the film.

But Trump blamed Taj CEO Stephen Hyde and COO Mark Etess, who had been killed in a helicopter crash. When O’Donnell complained, he said Trump replied, “What does it matter? They’re dead.” The documentary notes that Trump’s other two casinos in Atlantic City, the Trump Castle and the Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel, also went broke.

Throughout the 1990s for Trump, business was scarce and loans were tough to get from U.S. banks because of his bankruptcies. He made the rounds of talk shows and pitched McDonald’s burgers and Kentucky Fried Chicken in commercials. He eventually hit on the idea of selling his name to mark projects built by others around the world and began doing business with “some of the sketchiest people in the sketchiest countries,” New Yorker writer Adam Davidson explains in the documentary. Some associates were “unbelievably corrupt,” including a key investor suspected of laundering money for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Trump International Hotel and Tower in Baku, Azerbaijan, Davidson adds.

In 2004, Trump became the star of “The Apprentice.”

The reality TV show’s creators remade the offices of the Trump Organization for “The Apprentice,” giving it what they considered a “tongue-in-cheek” look, they note in the documentary. The offices included a boardroom set reminiscent of the one from the movie “Network,” where crazed TV anchor Howard Beale, played by Peter Finch, is lectured by the head of his company that “the world is a business.”

“How funny to have this washed-up, five-time-bankruptcy guy who lives in a golden palace that other people are paying for” as the star of the show, says “Apprentice” supervising editor Jonathon Braun in the documentary. “We just didn’t know how many people would look at that and say, ‘That’s cool. That’s real.’”

When people saw the “Apprentice” Trump as the real thing, “We all sort of rose up and said, ‘Now wait a minute, people, what we did, that was a scam. That was an entertainment,’” said series producer Bill Pruitt.

Davidson suggests that the Trump presidency could be the “great con ... the great grift ... all part of the 45-year showbiz project known as the Trump Organization.”

Stevens said his hope is that “The Confidence Man” convinces people to get “motivated” to change things.

“The fossil fuel industry is running the country now,” he told HuffPost. “Trump doesn’t care about the environment. I worry about the next generation. I’m concerned for my children.”

“Confidence Man” is one of six episodes of “Dirty Money” on Netflix, developed by Academy Award winner Alex Gibney and his Jigsaw Productions. Gibney was the director of the ultimate documentary examination of the Enron scam: “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.” Gibney told The Guardian earlier this week that Trump “was an absolutely terrible businessman. You look at the trail of slime he left behind and just shake your head and wonder.”The death of a black man in police custody in Louisiana has been ruled a homicide by asphyxiation, a coroner said Monday.

Keeven Robinson, 22, died Thursday at a Jefferson Parish hospital following a car chase with deputies who said he was a suspect in a narcotics investigation.

Robinson left his vehicle following the chase and jumped several fences before he was caught by four Jefferson Parish police officers, all of them white. A struggle ensued. Robinson was taken into custody and later died.

During a Monday press conference, Jefferson Parish coroner Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich announced that Robinson’s death had been ruled a homicide. Robinson died due to compressional asphyxia from injuries to his neck, Cvitanovich said.

“This initial medical classification does not take into account whether the homicide was an intentional act, accidental act, or an act incidental to a law enforcement action,” Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said in a statement. He added that the FBI’s civil rights task force is also looking into the matter.

Following the news that Robinson’s death had been ruled a homicide, more than 100 marchers took to the streets in a New Orleans suburb to demand justice.

Gaylor Spiller, president of the West Jefferson Parish chapter of the NAACP, said Robinson’s family will seek an independent autopsy.

“I like the fact that Sheriff Lopinto stepped up to plate, and he’s doing his part,” Spiller said, according to WDSU. “He knows that the NAACP will be on his trail.”

The four officers involved in the death have been reassigned. Their identities have not been made public.TONIGHT: Fresh off her stint in the Trump White House, Omarosa Manigault-Newman joins the CBS​ family and immediately stirs up controversy as a contestant on #CelebrityBigBrother ​. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/vAnaa5EJIZ

The opening ceremony, which took place Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, featured several songs from notable K-pop artists as teams circled the stadium.

Olympians were greeted with the sounds of BTS’ “DNA (Remix),” Big Bang’s “Fantastic Baby,” and Twice’s “Likey,” among others. Even Team USA arrived at the ceremony to Psy’s iconic 2012 hit “Gangnam Style.”

Seriously, though, with fire songs like “DNA” playing on an international stage, who could blame them for being so pumped?

The ceremony actually included songs from throughout Korean history going back to the 1950s. The parade of Olympians started off with “Hand In Hand” by Koreana, which was the official theme song from the Seoul Olympics back in 1988. The North and South Korean teams concluded the parade, marching under one flag to folk song “Arirang.” K-pop band EXO will be performing at the closing ceremony on Feb. 25.

The opening event, which promoted peace and harmony, was chock full of other awe-inspiring elements as well, including fireworks, dancers performing a segment titled “The Land of Peace,” and stunning light installations. At one point, more than 1,200 drones lit up the sky to depict athletes in action.Rain Pryor at the 30th annual Lucille Lortel Awards on May 10, 2015. Michael Stewart via Getty Images

Jennifer Pryor Lee, Pryor’s widow, later confirmed the claim. She said the late comedian had been open about his bisexuality and wrote about his sexual relationships in his diaries, which she plans to publish later this year. She also told TMZ that she thought Pryor would have been amused by Jones’ comment about him and Brando.

Now Pryor’s daughter, Rain Pryor, is weighing in on Jones’ and Lee Pryor’s comments, saying that her father never slept with Brando.

“Daddy did NOT have relations with Brando,” she wrote Thursday in one of two Facebook posts about the subject.

In another post, Rain Pryor completely dismisses Jones’ interview.

“All you who touted Faux News and preach about wanting blacks to be represented in a great light and then posted Q’s interview are irrelevant and full of your own BS,” she wrote. “Q, was once a brilliant music producer who is losing his mind, and decided to garner publicity for himself with a sensationalized interview.”

She also delegitimizes Lee Pryor’s comments about the comedian’s sexuality.

“Then on top of it all, my dad’s so called widow validated it, because she needs to keep legitimizing herself and tarnish our dad even after he’s dead. She hated Q and Daddy,” Rain Pryor wrote.

But she also wrote candidly about her father’s fluid sexuality.

“My dad was very open with his life, so much so that news of his relationship with a trans woman in the early 70s and 80s wasn’t really newsworthy nor notable,” she wrote. “As a child I knew her, not as the trans person in our home, but the lady whom everyone accepted. So much acceptance I did not know she was Trans until recently.”

Pryor Lee told Vulture that many of her husband’s sexual encounters with men were one-night stands, and that that was probably what had happened with Brando after a night of partying.

“Knowing Richard, it was a one-off thing,” she said.

Rain Pryor and Lee Pryor have a contentious relationship, largely because Lee Pryor has ownership over her late husband’s estate. There was a lot of friction between the two women when Lee Pryor attempted to make a biopic about Pryor’s life in 2015.

Rain Pryor has also been open about her contempt for her stepmother. In 2004, she blasted Lee Pryor for the way she tended to her ailing father, who died a year later after a long battle with multiple sclerosis.
