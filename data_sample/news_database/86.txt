By Michael Ollove

A couple of years ago, the health insurance exchange in Minnesota – MNsure – was in deep trouble. Health insurance premiums for individual policies had shot up by as much as 67 percent, among the steepest increases in the country. Insurers were abandoning the market, leaving 116,000 Minnesotans with scant choices.

The Minnesota Legislature offered a solution: a $271 million, publicly funded reinsurance pool that would help health insurance companies pay the most expensive medical claims, thereby lowering overall insurance premiums. The hope was that backstopping the insurers would stabilize the market and halt the rocket-like rise in premiums.

So far, so very good. In its first year, the reinsurance pool has performed even better than expected. According to the Urban Institute, 2018 premiums offered on MNsure not only didn’t increase, they fell by 15 percent.

Minnesota’s peers are paying attention. The Gopher State is one of four states trying to calm roiling health insurance markets by creating state reinsurance pools – even as actions by Congress and the Trump administration continue to create uncertainty in the health insurance industry.

Maryland became the latest to do so when Republican Gov. Larry Hogan last week signed a bill creating a reinsurance pool financed in part in the next year by a $380 million tax on health insurers. Another six states are taking steps to launch their own reinsurance programs.

Reinsurance has long had a place in the private insurance market.

Essentially, it entails insurance companies taking out their own insurance to protect themselves when they are hit by an unexpectedly high claim, “like when somebody needs a heart transplant or a liver transplant or something else where costs are over, say, $100,000,” said Brad Herring, a health economist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.

A public health reinsurance plan works the same way, except the state reimburses insurers for claims that climb above a certain set figure, depending on the plan.

In Minnesota’s reinsurance program, health insurers are eligible for reimbursements from the state for claims between $50,000 and $250,000. The insurers are responsible for amounts over $250,000.

Allison O’Toole, MNsure’s CEO, said Minnesota acted in response to soaring premium increases and the departure of insurers such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest seller of individual policies in Minnesota at the time. No insurers have left the Minnesota market since the reinsurance pool launched.

“We were taking it on the chin. We were really in crisis,” O’Toole said. “This has provided immediate and positive results.”

Alaska, which created a reinsurance pool in 2016, also saw a year-to-year decrease in premiums. A third state, Oregon, authorized the creation of a reinsurance program last fall, but that action came after the premiums had already been set for 2018.

But the fix in Minnesota is temporary. The Legislature ponied up about quarter of a billion dollars for two years, with a roughly equivalent amount expected to come from the federal government. But, O’Toole says, that state support won’t last.

“Minnesota had a significant budget reserve a year ago, so we had money for it,” O’Toole said. “We won’t have that going forward.”

That is why O’Toole and many other state officials want the federal government to help fill state reinsurance pools.

Health policy analysts say the situation has only grown more pressing in recent months.

In December, Congress eliminated the so-called individual mandate as part of the new tax law, meaning that healthy people – who would pay premiums but be unlikely to need expensive care – can now opt out of insurance. And the Trump administration scrapped federal subsidies that were worth about $7 billion a year to insurance companies. Analysts say those actions are likely to lead to higher premiums for those remaining on the individual market and increased financial pressure on insurers.

There were two bipartisan bills in the Senate – one cosponsored by Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, and the other by Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democrat Patty Murray of Washington – that would have sent $5 billion a year to the states to finance their reinsurance pools. But neither was incorporated into the spending bill that Trump signed last month.

Avalere, a health policy research firm, estimated that the measure pushed by Collins and Nelson would have reduced 2019 premiums by 4 percent and increased enrollment in Affordable Care Act plans by 180,000. Not surprisingly, the bill had the strong support of the health insurance industry.

Although the Senate bills had considerable bipartisan support, there was significant opposition too. “This bailout approach is wrong and should be abandoned,” a report published last month by the conservative Heritage Foundation said. “It is fiscally imprudent and unnecessary.” It is the ACA’s “radical regulatory overreach,” that has caused chaos in the health insurance market, the report says.

At the same time, many left-leaning analysts say public reinsurance is yet another cumbersome solution to a fractured health care system that should be replaced by a single-payer model.

The Affordable Care Act set up a federal reinsurance pool to compensate insurers for taking on high-risk beneficiaries (who, under ACA provisions, could not be charged higher premiums than anyone else). The law set aside $20 billion, funded largely by a tax on insurers, for the years 2014 through 2016. After that, the pool disappeared, and the determination of congressional Republicans to repeal the ACA made renewal of the program a political impossibility.

States that want to establish their own reinsurance pools with some federal money must apply for a waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to depart from some provisions of the ACA while still providing comprehensive, affordable health coverage.

In their applications to create reinsurance pools, states have argued that by reducing premiums, they will save the federal government money because it will have to pay less in tax credits for low-income policyholders.

Alaska created its reinsurance pool with $55 million from a tax on insurers, but it subsequently applied for and received a federal waiver, which is expected to bring in about $58 million in federal money. The state is hoping that because its individual insurance market is so small – about 23,000 people – the federal contribution will negate the need for it to put state money into the pool.

Oregon has committed $1.1 billion in state money, also raised through a tax on insurers, over 10 years and is hoping to receive $356 million in federal money during that period.

In February Wisconsin enacted a $200 million law that, should the federal government grant a waiver, will funnel $30 million to $50 million in state money into a reinsurance pool with the federal government picking up the rest. Democrats joined Republicans in favor of the bill in both houses. The main opposition came from the progressive group, Citizen Action of Wisconsin, which called the reinsurance plan a bailout for insurance companies.

In Colorado, an early analysis projected that if the state had spent $177 million to create a reinsurance pool in 2018 and received $119 million in federal money, premiums would have declined by 21 percent. Colorado lawmakers are working on a reinsurance pool proposal.

But some financially strapped states simply don’t have the money to set up reinsurance pools. In 2018, Minnesota’s pool will total $271 million: $140 million in state money and $131 million in federal dollars. Minnesota had to provide all the money up front, and the federal government will pay its share during the course of the year

“The movie was about relational aggression among women,” Fey told Variety. “But now that behavior has really metastasized across our society, and you see it everywhere. You see it in people being horrible to each other on social media. So if anything, it’s gone wider.”

Fey worked with lyricist Nell Benjamin and director Casey Nicholaw to create “Mean Girls” for the stage. The musical’s composer is Jeff Richmond, who also happens to be Fey’s husband.

Richmond said social media elements had to be added, because otherwise “you would immediately know that [the story] was not of the present.”Tammy Duckworth has become the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office.

The Illinois Democrat gave birth to a girl on Monday. The proud mom and Iraq War veteran announced the historic and joyful news on Twitter, along with revealing her newborn’s name: Maile Pearl.

Duckworth, who turned 50 last month, had her first daughter, Abigail, in 2014 while she was representing a Chicago-area House district. The Purple Heart recipient, who lost both her legs and partial use of her right arm while deployed as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot, is one of only 10 women to have given birth while in Congress.

She’s also among the handful of Asian-American women in Congress.

Duckworth’s husband, Bryan Bowlsby, is an Army cyber warrant officer. His great-aunt also served in the Army, and like her newborn was named Pearl.

“Pearl Bowlsbey Johnson was Bryan’s great Aunt, an Army Officer & a nurse who served during the Second World War,” Duckworth tweeted. “He spent many summer months with her while growing up, we feel her presence still and are grateful for her service to our nation during the most challenging of times.”

Duckworth, who attended the University of Hawaii, credited the late former Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii) with helping her and her husband name both of their daughters.

Akaka’s died at age 93 last week, but Duckworth said his help with her children’s names means “he will always be with us.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was among those celebrating Maile’s birth on Twitter, and she promised that “your mommy and many of her friends are doing their very best to make this a better world for you.”

Warren has already sought to deliver on that promise, vowing to help fight Senate rules that bar senators from voting or sponsoring legislation while on maternity leave.

Duckworth told Politico in February that she couldn’t “technically take maternity leave” because she didn’t want to lose her voting or sponsorship privileges. She said she planned to take 12 weeks of paid leave, but was working out how to do so and not lose those privileges.

Senate rules also prohibit lawmakers from bringing their child onto the Senate floor. “If I have to vote, and I’m breastfeeding my child, especially during my maternity leave period, what do I do? Leave her sitting outside?” Duckworth said to Politico.

Duckworth announced her pregnancy in January, opening up about the challenges of getting pregnant. She described it on Monday as a “decades-long journey to complete our family.”

As for the historic milestone for women in office, she previously told The Chicago Tribune: “It’s about damn time.”

“I can’t believe it took until 2018. It says something about the inequality of representation that exists in our country,” she said.John Oliver says EPA chief Scott Pruitt’s big spending on security might be needed after all.

Some of Pruitt’s much-criticized $832,000 security tab for the first quarter included protection during a trip to Disneyland. On Sunday’s broadcast of “Last Week Tonight,” Oliver said that expense could actually be legit.

“If anyone needs security at Disneyland, it’s Scott Pruitt ― a man who even Mickey and Minnie Mouse would tell to go fuck himself,” Oliver said. ”‘Space Mountain’s going to be underwater in 10 years, you son of a bitch!’”WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit will balloon over the next few years mainly because of deep tax cuts approved in December by Republicans in the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.

Despite stronger-than-predicted economic growth ahead, the CBO said the deficit will grow to $804 billion in fiscal 2018, which ends on Sept. 30, up from $665 billion in fiscal 2017. The deficit is how much Washington’s spending exceeds its revenues.

CBO forecast 3.3 percent growth in 2018 in gross domestic product, a broad measure of the economy, and 2.4 percent GDP growth in 2019.

In the next few years, deficits will “grow substantially” before stabilizing in 2023, resulting in a projected cumulative deficit of $11.7 trillion for 2018-2027, the CBO said.A reporter was grabbed and shoved by a security guard at the EPA headquarters in Washington on Tuesday while trying to attend a meeting on water contaminants. Reporters from multiple organizations were barred from attending.

The meeting took place after recently discovered emails from the agency showed that the White House and the EPA hoped to block a federal study on a water-contamination crisis after a Trump aide said it would cause a “public relations nightmare.”

The scandal led to Tuesday morning’s hearing, with Pruitt set to address what he now calls a “national priority.”

But reporters from The Associated Press, CNN and the environmental news organization E&E were barred from the meeting, the outlets said.

When an AP reporter attempted to pass through a security checkpoint inside the building, she was grabbed by the shoulders by a security guard and shoved out of the building, the AP reported. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox told the reporters they had not been invited and there was no space for them.

“She was not invited,” he told NBC News. “We provided them with a livestream.”

He alleged that a reporter threatened negative coverage if she wasn’t invited.

“It is particularly distressing that any journalist trying to cover an event in the public interest would be forcibly removed,” AP’s Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said in a statement.

Pruitt reportedly said he flies first or business class only because of security concerns. Leahy mocked him during the Senate hearing.A guest on Fox News demonstrated Monday that he wanted to reach a particular viewer: President Donald Trump.

Bassam Rifai, the public relations chairman of the Syrian American Council, a nonprofit advocating for secular democracy in Syria, interrupted his interview to speak directly to the president.

Specifically, Rifai wants Trump to bomb the Middle Eastern country’s air force in retaliation for the reported chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians in eastern Ghouta this weekend.

Rifai probably figured it’s easier to reach Trump through Fox than by navigating the White House bureaucracy for face time.

“President Trump, I’m speaking to you directly,” Rifai said about three minutes into his interview. “Do not take the same mistake that President Obama had made. The action that you had taken ... to take out the air base there, that was important, that was strong — that was a very strong message.”

“What we need to do right now is to take out Assad’s air force. If we ground all of his air force, we won’t have the capability to attack Syrians by the air anymore.”

There’s no word on whether Trump saw the segment, but the president has said he will decide within the next two days how to respond to the attack in Syria.

The complete segment is below:

WASHINGTON ― John Bolton began his first day as President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser ahead of schedule after a top aide to Bolton’s predecessor departed over the weekend in an apparent crackdown on suspected “leakers.”

National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton announced his exit for a lecturing and writing job at a small Christian college on Sunday, a day before Bolton started as head of the council.

Bolton insisted on the departure in a lunch meeting last week with Trump’s previous national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, according to a Republican close to the White House. Other changes are likely to follow, the source said, with Bolton expected to purge staff in order to bring in others more loyal to him, as well as to carry out a top priority for Trump: ridding the NSC of those suspected of “leaking” information to the news media.

Anton, the source added, was the likeliest source of one of the most humiliating leaks for Trump in recent weeks: the disclosure to The Washington Post that Trump had specifically been warned, in all capital letters, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” Vladimir Putin on securing another term as Russia’s president. That warning came prior to a phone call with the Russian leader following an election that was widely criticized as illegitimate. Trump congratulated him anyway.

Anton could not be reached for comment. Queries to his White House email address and phone number went unanswered.

The White House disputed the idea that Anton’s departure was a condition of Bolton taking the job or even that Bolton had wanted him gone by the time he began his job on Monday.

A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Anton’s resignation was based on a “reasonable” assumption that Bolton would want to bring in his own team at the NSC. Anton, the official said, had been looking for a new job for some months, starting about the time Trump began making clear that he was unhappy with McMaster.

The official even more emphatically denied that Anton leaked the now-infamous “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” instruction, calling that allegation “definitely not true.”

Bolton, 69, is now the third national security adviser to serve under Trump since the president took office 15 months ago. The first, retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn, left after a month because of his lies to federal investigators in the Russia probe. He has since pleaded guilty.

McMaster, who plans to retire from the Army this summer, lasted a year, but his traditional foreign policy views that included a hard line against Russian expansionism clashed with Trump’s more Putin-friendly approach.

Bolton last served in government as United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush. A veteran of the State and Justice departments, Bolton became known for his readiness to undermine co-workers who disagreed with his interventionist foreign policy views. The animosity was such that fellow State Department officials testified against Bolton at his confirmation hearing for the ambassadorship. Bolton did not win Senate confirmation and took the job in a recess appointment.

Bolton had been considered for a Trump administration position during the transition, but ultimately did not join then. One of the reasons, reportedly, was that Trump did not like Bolton’s large, bushy mustache. But in the past year, Bolton has been among the loudest pro-Trump voices on Fox News, which Trump frequently watches and on which he bases many of his policy views.Billionaire Diane Hendricks (above) is supporting Leah Vukmir in Wisconsin's GOP Senate primary.

Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate contest has quietly become one of the top races of the 2018 cycle, with conservative interests throwing millions into defeating Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). So far, groups connected to Illinois-based billionaire Dick Uihlein have dominated the airwaves on behalf of Republican candidate Kevin Nicholson.

But last week, another billionaire’s money went on the air in the heated GOP primary.

Wisconsin Next PAC is out with a new ad supporting state Sen. Leah Vukmir ― the first pro-Vukmir ad run by a super PAC. The spot plays up her association with Gov. Scott Walker (R).

Wisconsin Next PAC has received $500,000 from billionaire businesswoman Diane Hendricks, who is also backing Vukmir. It’s also received $25,000 from an employee of ABC Supply, the roofing distributor that Hendricks chairs.

The super PAC is spending $575,000 to run the ad statewide on television and another $50,000 for digital spots.

Vukmir has the support of much of the GOP establishment in Wisconsin, including Walker. Nicholson is a less traditional candidate. Previously, he was best known politically for chairing the College Democrats of America and speaking at the 2000 Democratic convention. Since then, the Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran has moved to the right and picked up support from the Club for Growth, a group that promotes fiscal conservative policies.

Baldwin is already facing more outside spending by conservative groups than all other Democratic senators on the ballot this year combined. Republicans see the progressive Democrat as a prime target in a state that Trump won in 2016. With Walker up for re-election in November as well, they’re hoping that GOP voters turn out to counter the energy on the left.

Republicans in Wisconsin have received some warning signs. In January, Democrat Patty Schachtner won a state Senate seat in a district that Trump won by 17 points. Republicans had held the seat since 2001.

And last week, for the first time in 23 years, a liberal candidate won an open Supreme Court seat in the state.Fleetwood Mac has always been about an amazing collection of songs that are performed with a unique blend of talents.

He's supposed to get congressional approval for that, though. NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump said on Monday he is not ruling out missile strikes against the government of President Bashar al-Assad in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria.

If he does take military action, he’ll be doing so without constitutionally required approval by Congress.

It’s Congress’ job to authorize any sustained U.S. military action. The problem is that lawmakers have been largely ignoring this mandate since 2001, when they passed a sweeping authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, allowing President George W. Bush to attack anyone connected to al Qaeda, anywhere, at any time.

That AUMF never expired. For years, President Barack Obama stretched its limits by arguing it allowed him to take military action against the Islamic State, since the terror group is an offshoot of al Qaeda. Now, if Trump were to argue he could use the Iraq War-era authorization to bomb Syrian government targets, he would have to make the case that it’s related to al Qaeda, which it is not.

The prospect of Trump unilaterally taking military action is troubling to lawmakers in both parties who say that it’s time to finally get rid of the 2001 AUMF and pass a new one with more narrowly tailored limits on scope, duration and costs of military action. They say the old AUMF is effectively a blank check for endless war.

“The use of chemical weapons absolutely requires a response from the United States,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said in a statement. “But if that response is going to include military force, the president of the United States should come to Congress and ask for authorization before military force is used.”

“President Trump has to come to Congress for approval if he wants to take further U.S. military action,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in a statement. “A year since the administration’s last airstrikes in Syria, we know there is a secret memo that details how the Trump administration views its power to take military action without consulting Congress. It’s past time for the administration to share its Syria strategy with the public and release that memo before it’s used to justify more airstrikes or new wars.”

Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) tweeted about it, too.

If President Trump is considering military action in Syria, he needs to come to Congress first. Congress, not the White House, is responsible for debating and authorizing war. Speaker Ryan needs to allow us to have this debate before this conflict escalates any further. https://t.co/YFxoREeG4J — Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) April 9, 2018

A mix of rank-and-file lawmakers has been urging party leaders for years to get moving on a new AUMF, but nothing has happened. Most members of Congress simply don’t want to take a tough vote on authorizing war.

It would incredibly difficult to justify using the 2001 AUMF for military action against the Assad government. The Trump administration hasn’t even tried to do it. When Trump directed strikes on a Syrian government airbase in April 2017 ― the first-ever direct military strike by the U.S. against Assad’s regime ― the administration claimed he had that authority under his presidential powers because it was limited military action, not because of the Iraq War-era AUMF.

A fresh round of missile strikes in Syria makes this something different than a limited single engagement. And lawyers at the nonpartisan Protect Democracy say it would likely lead to larger and ongoing conflicts, which sounds a lot more like a war than a surgical attack.

That’s what’s at the heart of lawmakers’ concerns with Trump acting without first getting their approval.

“Before President Trump even considers taking the United States down a path of unilateral military action, the American people need answers. What does this administration hope to accomplish? What’s the end game?” asked Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). “Are we moving from fighting ISIS to fighting Assad outright? Or are we withdrawing our troops and airpower from the region? In the space of a few days, the president has said both.”

Trump said Monday that he’ll make his decision in the next 24 to 48 hours on how to respond to the latest suspected use of chemical weapons by Assad, which reportedly killed at least 49 people in a Damascus suburb.Kevin Lamarque / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) says he has no regrets about his vote last year to confirm embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt.

“The decision has been made. It’s been good for West Virginia, as far as [he] helped my state,” Manchin told HuffPost on Monday. “I agree with some of his decisions. We’ve had a good working relationship.”

Still, Manchin said that his confirmation vote “doesn’t excuse anybody for not being accountable and held responsible for how they operate their office.”

Manchin, who is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election this cycle, said he wanted to see the results of a White House investigation into Pruitt’s conduct before considering whether to join many others in his party and call for the EPA chief to step down.

While saying the question of whether Pruitt should step aside “hasn’t been brought to my attention,” he added that “I understand the White House is reviewing it now. So they should give us a report on it.”

Manchin joined Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota as the only two Democratic senators voting for Pruitt’s confirmation, which passed on a 52-46 vote in February 2017.

Pruitt faces scrutiny over a number of potential ethical violations ― including his use government-funded flights, unapproved raises for his top staff, and a $50-a-night sweetheart deal to rent a room in a luxury Capitol Hill townhouse linked to a fossil fuel industry lobbying firm.

A few Republican lawmakers have joined the chorus calling on Pruitt to resign. But most conservatives enthusiastically support the EPA administrator and view him as one of President Donald Trump’s most effective cabinet members, citing his moves to roll a number of Obama administration environmental regulations.April 9 (Reuters) - The goofy voice behind the “I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs” call for breakfast cereal fell silent Sunday, as comedian and voice actor Chuck McCann died, his publicist said.

“His work was legendary,” said his publicist Edward Lozzi. “What baby boomer doesn’t know cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs?”

The Brooklyn, New York, native died of congestive heart failure at a Los Angeles hospital at age 83, Lozzi said.

Showbusiness was in his blood, Lozzi said. He practically grew up in an orchestra pit where his father was a big band leader at New York’s Roxy Theatre. His grandfather also performed in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show.

Through his family, McCann was exposed to some of the best comedians of the 1930s and 1940s and he would have his classmates in stitches imitating them at school, Lozzi said.

He got his professional start in local radio and television doing voices, puppetry work and standup comedy. McCann later starred in scores of children’s television programs such as “Lunch with Soupy Sales” and “The Captain Kangaroo Show” and “Rootie Kazootie,” Lozzi said.

McCann later moved to Los Angeles and worked as a character actor on shows including; “Little House on the Prairie,” “Bonanza,” and “Columbo.”

But he is best known for voicing the hungry bird Sonny for General Mills cereal.

“We all grew up with him,” Lozzi said. “He was a pioneer.”

He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Fanning, and two daughters.

Fans, friends and colleagues took to Twitter to share tributes to McCann:

If you follow Trump on Twitter, then you know his affinity for tweeting about Fox News. He frequently responds to various things said about him on the network.

Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. "Spied on before nomination." The real story. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2017

There was even a period in February when one-third of his 57 tweets in the week were reportedly inspired by Fox News or mentioned the cable channel directly.

While it is true that Fox News is the most-watched cable news network, Trump’s Twitter following, a whopping 50 million people, far surpasses that of Fox News watchers, a problematic fact that raises red flags for many.

Particularly, it has caused concern among some White House aides. Many have been “convinced that Trump puts more stock in what he sees on TV than in his own aides’ advice,” so they “regularly phone prominent commentators and news hosts to provide talking points on everything from tax policy to Syria in hopes of influencing Trump,” according to a report by The Associated Press.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Sunday that signals from President Donald Trump that he was close to withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria have “emboldened” Bashar Assad as he reportedly launched a suspected chemical attack on his civilians.

“President Trump last week signaled to the world that the United States would prematurely withdraw from Syria,” the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a statement. “Bashar Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers have heard him, and emboldened by American inaction, Assad has reportedly launched another chemical attack against innocent men, women and children, this time in Douma.”

The Syria attack came on the heels of Trump’s declaration last week at a press conference: “I want to get out; I want to bring our troops back home.” He said that keeping troops in Syria is “very costly for our country, and it helps other countries a hell of a lot more than it helps us.”

The president also told his advisers last month he wanted an early exit from Syria against the wishes of U.S. military officials, Reuters reported. He also ordered $200 million for Syrian recovery efforts frozen.

McCain called on Trump to now take decisive action against the Assad regime.

“It’s not too late to stop Assad’s impunity and begin to rewrite this terrible chapter,” he said.

Dozens of people, including several children, choked to death Saturday after the attack in the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma.

At least 49 people and as many as 70 were reported killed. Rescue workers found adults and small children dead in their homes with white foam coming from their mouths and noses, according to The New York Times. Survivors were streaming into a local clinic for treatment Sunday.

Europe and the U.S. condemned Assad and Syrian allies Russia and Iran. Trump called Assad an “animal,” and vowed there would be a “big price to pay.” He also blamed Barack Obama for not taking a harder stance against Assad.

Yahoo Lifestyle’s Diversity in Beauty Awards (the DIBs) highlights and celebrates personalities, brands, and products that embody inclusiveness and innovation. Fenty Beauty was a 2018 winner.

Rihanna is an award-winning musician who made the world fall in love with radio hits such as “Umbrella,” “We Found Love,” and “Wild Thoughts.” She is also a fashion muse for designer brands, including Dior and Puma. While there is no doubt that these successes play into the self-proclaimed bad gal’s superstar status, in 2017 it was the debut of her cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty, that truly changed the game.

On Sept. 8 in Brooklyn, N.Y., Rihanna unveiled Fenty Beauty to a room full of beauty editors, bloggers, influencers, makeup artists, and industry experts. The range included a primer, highlighters, blotting powder, lip gloss, makeup brushes — and last, but certainly far from least — 40 foundation shades, ranging from very fair to very deep.

“After years of experimenting with the best-of-the-best in beauty — and still seeing a void in the industry for products that performed across all skin types and tones, she launched a makeup line ‘so that women everywhere would be included,’” the brand shared in an official statement. In addition to her loyal fanbase, aka the Rihanna Navy, people around the globe were excited about seeing what they felt was one key element missing from the beauty world: makeup representation for all.

The products were available for purchase at mega beauty haven Sephora and department store giant JCPenney, and Fenty Beauty items sold like ice pops on a scorching hot summer day. In its first month, Fenty Beauty earned $72 million in media value (revenue received from social media), according to WWD. Riri managed to beat out other popular brands with her outstanding reach, including reality star Kylie Jenner’s popular namesake line, Kylie Cosmetics.

“I believe Rihanna is an icon across the board — fashion, music, and beauty — so not only were her fans super-excited but people into beauty products were also hyped,” celebrity makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff told Yahoo Lifestyle. “The marketing and promotion on social media with makeup artists and models, as well as real women, also was just genius.”

Digging deeper into the numbers, it actually doesn’t come as much of a surprise that Rihanna knows how to bring in the big bucks. In fact, in 2016, she was listed as one of the most marketable celebrities, beating out Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Khloé Kardashian, based on research conducted by the NPD Group. The same study also revealed that fans of Rihanna are 3.7 times as likely to purchase from the 30-year-old megastar as they are from other stars. With all the success Rihanna has already seen with other brands — such as Puma and Chopard — the marketability of Fenty Beauty was almost a no-brainer.

Of all the products Fenty Beauty has to offer, the most talked about had to be the Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation. Available in 40 shades, it is an oil-free formula that can easily build from medium to full coverage. An added bonus: It’s made with climate-adaptive technology to give your complexion a shine-free look that wears like second skin.

Editorial makeup artist Justine Purdue told Yahoo Lifestyle that the foundations also offer a wide range of “undertone variations.” Just a few short days after the official launch of Fenty Beauty, a tweet of a beauty display at Sephora showing nearly all the darker foundations missing went viral. The caption read, “The dark Fenty Beauty foundations are sold out everywhere! This is for all the makeup brands who think the dark shades won’t sell.”

As Allure reported, certain beauty brands have made the statement that darker shades won’t sell. However, Fenty Beauty’s inclusive range of foundations proved that notion false. Another important statistic to point out is that in 2013, African-Americans had at least $1.3 trillion of total buying power, with black women specifically shelling out $7.5 billion annually on beauty products — 80 percent more on cosmetics than non-black consumers.

When it comes to creating formulations for skin of color, co-founder and chief innovation officer of Cover FX Victor Casale — who was also former founding partner, chief chemist, and managing director of MAC Cosmetics — told Yahoo Lifestyle, “The most difficult thing when I’m formulating dark shades is finding models and skin tones that I can bring into the lab to verify the shades. But I have done that. I’ve set up color verification labs in universities and colleges where I send my team.” He also points out how diverse the shade range can be within deeper skin tones. “There’s a new shade born every day,” he said.

In addition to the vast range of complexions among people of color, a 2015 Cosmopolitan article highlighted that the process of formulating these foundations properly can be quite complex. Balanda Atis, a scientist with L’Oréal USA (which owns L’Oréal Paris and Lancôme), explained: “While brands might succeed in making darker shades, they didn’t always get the undertones or the depth right.”

She continued, “Typically, there are four pigments used to create one shade: white, yellow, red, and black. To create deeper hues, some chemists mix in too much black pigment, which can leave skin looking bruised.”

“For a caramel hue, there may be too much red or yellow, which can leave skin looking orange,” added Atis. “Sometimes, chemists add titanium dioxide, a pigment used in many cosmetics to add coverage. Result: an ashy finish. So even when dark shades are available, many of them haven’t been very good.”

While Fenty Beauty foundations launched during a year when there was a louder cry for inclusivity, especially within the beauty industry, there are a select number of brands — such as Black Opal, IMAN Cosmetics and Fashion Fair — that have catered to women of color since their inception, in addition to modern-day prestige picks from Make Up For Ever, NARS and Lancôme.

Reflecting back on the beginning stages of IMAN Cosmetics, Desiree Reid, the general manager of Impala Inc., explained why supermodel Iman was charged up to create foundations for women with deeper skin tones similar to her own.

“When Iman started modeling, she had to mix her own makeup — the artists on set never had her exact shade,” Reid said. “Iman knew if she was experiencing this, then everyday women were feeling just as frustrated. There was a huge hole in the market. General market brands had two or three ‘dark’ shades at the end of their lines, so women with skin of color had very little options to address their skin tones. This was what influenced Iman’s decision to create IMAN Cosmetics.”

Reid added, “Most women with skin of color express the same frustration about makeup not matching their skin tones. That’s why the IMAN range is designed for all women with skin of color. The problem with most brands is not that skin of color is difficult to match; it’s that most brands don’t have experience with the nuances of skin of color. A brown foundation is not just a beige foundation with black pigment added to it.”

Other brands are continuing to make sure extensive testing is part of the process of creating new foundations as well. Manami Kuwamura, the executive director of complexion/skincare marketing and product development at NARS, spoke to Yahoo Lifestyle about the process of creating their latest Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation, which has 33 rich hues that cover a wide spectrum of complexions.

“It took over 100 different submissions and two years in development to perfect our new Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation, which launched this December,” said Kuwamura. “Our goal was to defy the common expectation that long-wear foundations mean a matte finish. We challenged our chemists to create a formula using the serum base that delivered the highest amount of hydration with long wear capabilities.”

Make Up For Ever’s general manager for the Americas, Laure de Metz, also spoke to the overall importance of inclusivity of the brand she represents, as well as others across the industry such as Fenty Beauty. “Inclusivity is finally a major topic of conversation in the makeup industry, and as a brand that values diversity, universality, and self-confidence, we’re thrilled that more brands are creating foundations for a wide range of skin tones,” she said. “There are several brands that come to mind, but it’s exciting to see both new brands like Fenty and Huda Beauty, as well as heritage brands like Lancôme and Estée Lauder, doing such a great job of creating shades for all skin tones.”

Tracking back to the epic success of the foundations of Fenty Beauty, it almost goes without saying that Rihanna isn’t done yet. Shortly after the initial launch, a holiday collection came out and people were ready to skip paying a month’s rent for it. Not too long after that, red-lip lovers were overjoyed to rock Stunna Lip Paint — a highly pigmented red some of our staff consider one of the best red lipsticks of all time. Then, Mattemoiselle Plush Matte Lipsticks dropped back in December with 14 universal shades that included a deep rouge cleverly named PMS, as well as a true navy blue called Clapback that blew up all over social media.

The beloved brand has marketing down to a science. In December, a fun face filter was launched to allow shoppers to try on Killawatt Trophy Wife. Then, on Rihanna’s 30th birthday (Feb. 20), a limited-edition version of the highlighter was released. Additionally, muses such as model Duckie Thot and recording artist SZA have strategically been included in all the Fenty promo fun. The brand also highlights the creativity of fans with the viral hashtag campaign #FentyFaceFriday, where they repost individuals of diverse backgrounds rocking Riri’s signature makeup line.

Rihanna knows how to handle negative backlash about her brand, too. When a Twitter user suggested she “invite a trans girl to the group” for Fenty Beauty campaigns, this was the beauty mogul’s response: “I’ve had the pleasure of working with many gifted trans women throughout the years, but I don’t go around doing trans castings! Just like I don’t do straight non-trans women castings! I respect all women, and whether they’re trans or not is none of my business!”

Rihanna launched her latest products, the Beach, Please! Summer 2018 Collection, on April 6. This unique group of products includes two shimmering Body Lava Luminizers, a Face & Body Kabuki Brush, and a Fairy Bomb Glittering Pom Pom to give fans a sparkling, sun-kissed glow from head to toe.

There seems to be a pattern of optimal greatness here, and it’s crystal clear why Fenty Beauty was also awarded “Invention of the Year” by Time in 2017. “I never could have anticipated the emotional connection that women are having with the products and the brand as a whole,” Rihanna shared with the publication in an interview. “Some are finding their shade of foundation for the first time, getting emotional at the counter. That’s something I will never get over.”

Will Rihanna be the new queen of the cosmetics industry? After the phenomenal first few months Fenty Beauty has had, we can bet she has more extraordinary tricks up her sleeve that will continue to push boundaries, ignite colossal levels of black girl magic and continually shake up the beauty industry.

Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle:Legendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov delivered a one-two punch Monday against Russian President Vladimir Putin — and Donald Trump — as he warned of the very serious threat to American democracy that the Kremlin “dictator” continues to pose to America.

“Trump has more Russian connections than Aeroflot,” Kasparov said, referring to the Russian airline in a speech Monday at the Common Good Forum in New York. “I believe in coincidences, but I also believe in the KGB.”

The Russian dissident and human rights activist also accused Trump on MSNBC Monday of “trying to divert” the investigation of Russian interference into the U.S. presidential election to “minor details.” Trump’s “attempts to move away from the core of this investigation into some foolish stories just demonstrates that he is quite desperate, and that he wants to control this process by tweeting and by shouting,” Kasparov added.

Trump’s new fury has been directed at his latest claim that the FBI planted a mole in his campaign, and he ordered the Justice Department to investigate. Last year, he claimed that the Obama administration had ordered the FBI to wiretap meetings in Trump Tower. There is no evidence that happened.

Trump is more outraged about the FBI investigating Russian interference in his campaign & the election than he is about the interference. Personal interest over national security. https://t.co/QTaD0WQDPv — Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) May 20, 2018

Kasparov suspects that serious secrets about Putin and Trump’s relationship have yet to emerge. It’s suspicious, said Kasparov, that while Trump is “not shy of criticizing anybody or anything, from NATO to Meryl Streep, [he] always refrains from saying one negative word about Vladimir Putin.”

Trump has criticized: Republicans, Democrats, the Pope, US elections, CIA, FBI, NATO, Meryl Streep.

Trump hasn't criticized: Vladimir Putin. — Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) January 9, 2017

Kasparov said at the Common Good Forum that he warned years ago — and will continue to do so — that Russia would try to interfere in elections.

“Putin will attack again, here and elsewhere,” said Kasparov, who pointed out that Putin and his operatives are masters at disinformation. America’s experience now with incendiary fake news campaigns is “nothing new for us in Russia,” he said, according to Yahoo News.

He underscored his belief that Putin is “a dictator,” and Russia’s leaders and oligarchs are corrupt.

“Every country has its own mafia,” he said. “In Russia, the mafia has its own country.”

He said Americans can only defend themselves against a Kremlin onslaught if they fight for values they believe in, like truth and democracy.

AdvertisementCohen has maintained that Trump was unaware of the arrangement.

The White House has denied the affair. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he never knew about Cohen’s payment, which has drawn scrutiny over the possibility that it could have violated campaign finance laws.

Reports surfaced in March that special counsel Robert Mueller was examining documents pertaining to incidents involving Cohen. Stephen Ryan, Cohen’s lawyer, confirmed to the Times on Monday that the search warrant for the FBI raid stemmed from a referral by Mueller, though it reportedly was not directly related to the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference.

Trump has repeatedly called Mueller’s Russia probe a “hoax” and a “witch hunt,” leading to speculation over whether the president would consider firing the special counsel or otherwise halting the investigation.

On Monday, the president again blasted Mueller’s investigation as “a disgrace” and called the FBI raid of Cohen’s office “a whole new level of unfairness.”

When asked at a military leadership meeting whether he would fire Mueller, Trump responded: “We’ll see what happens ... Many people have said you should fire him.”

On Tuesday morning, Trump resumed his Twitter attacks, blasting the investigation as “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!” and claiming “attorney–client privilege is dead!”A reported chemical attack this weekend has once again thrust into view the Syrian government’s continued assault on civilians. But while President Donald Trump has condemned the attack, he’s the one responsible for denying a safe haven in the United States to the Syrian refugees most in need.

Ahead of a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Trump used the word “atrocious” to describe the attack near Damascus that left at least 49 people dead, and said his administration will be making a decision on how to respond within the next 24 to 48 hours.

“If it’s the Russians, if it’s Syria, if it’s Iran, if it’s all of them together, we’ll figure it out,” he said, referring to parties he believes may have had a role in the attack. “We cannot allow atrocities like that. ... Everybody’s going to pay a price.”

A similar chemical attack one year ago similarly incensed Trump, prompting him to order a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime.

His outrage doesn’t erase the fact that more than 5.6 million Syrians are now registered as refugees. The vast majority are languishing in camps or informal settlements in neighboring countries like Turkey, where more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees are living, and Lebanon, which hosts almost 1 million.

The U.S. has historically been the global leader in legal pathways to refugee resettlement. Atrocities in Syria prompted President Barack Obama during his last year in office to increase the U.S. refugee resettlement cap from 70,000 per fiscal year to 110,000.

Although Trump’s latest iteration of a travel ban is still under court review, he capped the refugee resettlement quota at 45,000 in October, the lowest in U.S. history. So far this year, the U.S. has resettled 10,876 refugees, according to State Department data. Only 44 of them are Syrian. At this time last year, four times as many refugees had been resettled, 5,935 of whom were Syrian.

Tens of thousands of refugees are already stuck in the resettlement pipeline awaiting an answer from the U.S. government, refugee resettlement agencies have estimated. The administration’s decision in January to impose stricter vetting measures, which will likely slow down processing time, doesn’t help.

“What can you do?” Lisa adds, looking at her bedside photo of Apu.

“Some things will be dealt with at a later date,” Marge adds.

“If at all,” Lisa says.

Comedian Hari Kondabolu, who starred in and co-produced the Apu documentary, took his disappointment in the new episode to Twitter.

This is sad. https://t.co/lYFH5LguEJ — Hari Kondabolu (@harikondabolu) April 9, 2018The White House on Monday stood by its claim that millions of votes were cast illegally in the 2016 election, despite continuing to offer no evidence to support it.

President Donald Trump, who has long blamed voter fraud for him losing the popular vote, convened a commission to investigate the issue last May. The panel only publicly met twice and was unable to unearth anything to support the president’s claims.

Still, Trump renewed focus on voter fraud last week, when he said millions of people vote multiple times in California.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn’t back away from the claim when she was asked about it on Monday.

“The president still strongly feels that there was a large amount of voter fraud and attempted to do a thorough review of it, but a lot of the states didn’t want to cooperate and participate,” she said. “We certainly know that there were a large number of incidents reported, but we can’t be sure exactly how much because we weren’t able to conduct the full review that the president wanted because a number of states did not want to cooperate and refused to participate.”

Sanders was referring to the commission asking states to turn over information about voters last summer. Some states said they couldn’t turn over the data the commission wanted ― including last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, dates of birth and political affiliation ― under state law. Others simply refused to provide the information, although some were later required by state law to hand over some of the data.

“The people who continue to hang onto that warped belief system are delusional and refuse to appreciate the hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants who work in elections throughout this nation.” - Alan King, a probate judge who served on the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity

Trump disbanded the panel in January, citing litigation costs as the commission faced multiple lawsuits accusing it of violating federal transparency and administrative laws.

Alan King (D), a probate judge in Jefferson County, Alabama, who served on the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, criticized Sanders’ comments.

“A fringe ideology of people unfortunately still believe that garbage,” he said in an email. “The people who continue to hang onto that warped belief system are delusional and refuse to appreciate the hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants who work in elections throughout this nation. I feel sorry for people who continue to espouse such a stupid and ludicrous belief.”

The White House has previously highlighted a 2012 Pew study that found 24 million voter records were invalid and said 3 million people were registered in more than one state. It is not illegal to be registered in more than one state, and the study did not say millions of people voted illegally.

The Trump administration has also publicly pointed to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who was the vice chair of the voter fraud commission, to back up claims about illegal voting.

Kobach has supported Trump, relying on a study that says 11.3 percent of noncitizens reported voting in 2008. Kobach has applied that percentage to an estimate of 28 million noncitizens living in the United States to say that more than 3 million noncitizens could have voted illegally in 2016. However, an author of that study was placed under oath in a federal case in Kansas last month and said he could not support Trump’s claim that illegal votes cost him the popular vote.

A Justice Department investigation of voter fraud from 2002 until 2007 did not turn up much. Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, found just 31 credible instances of voter impersonation between 2000 and 2014. In a 2017 working paper, researchers suggested that just 0.02 percent of 2012 votes were double votes.
