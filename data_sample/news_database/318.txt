Bears and bears. Tight ends and tight ends. Double entendres abound in sports, with terms and situations that can be viewed through a homoerotic lens. Cartoonist Dylan Edwards explores these issues in a book of cartoons called “The Outfield.”

For eight years, “The Outfield” ran as a series on Outsports and was consistently among our most popular pages. One of my all-time favorites — “Is Barry Zito gay?” — was published in 2002 and I said at the time that “I thought the cartoon perfectly captured the stereotypes gays and straights have about sexual orientation.”

Edwards has compiled his Outsports cartoons, along with some others, in “The Outfield,” which is available for purchase. Edwards, who identifies as a “queer trans guy,” explains the idea behind the cartoon series.

“I would often riff on the homoerotic subtext that’s already present in sports, or otherwise look for a queer point of view by injecting drag, bear culture, leather culture, etc. Various team rivalries also came up a lot, often in a relationship context (mixed Red Sox/Yankees marriages, for example). There are a few current (for the time) events comics around gay marriage and various sports stars either coming out or saying something homophobic and I’d comment on it.

“If there’s a unifying theme, it’s about poking holes in the myth that queer men don’t or shouldn’t like sports, while at the same time subverting some of the hypermasculine framing of a lot of sports culture.”

I always found his cartoons fresh and funny and I think LGBT sports fans would agree.

More than 100 interfaith demonstrators gathered in New York City on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s first executive order on immigration, which included a ban on travel for residents from several Muslim-majority countries.

People gathered in the city’s Washington Square Park to voice their continued disapproval of the president’s order, which sparked nationwide protests, including at New York’s airports and public spaces.

After listening to a leader sing out the Islamic call to prayer, interfaith allies linked hands to form a human chain of protection around Muslims as they knelt down in the public space for Friday prayers.

The Rev. Dr. Chloe Breyer, executive director of the Interfaith Center of New York, told HuffPost she hoped the action provided a feeling of safety and security for the worshippers, many of whom were students from nearby New York University.

“It’s practically important and symbolically important to stand with people of different faith traditions,” Breyer said. “It’s what we should do as Americans.”

The rally at the square on Friday was an echo of what took place in the same location last January, when up to a thousand protesters gathered the night before the first travel ban was issued to voice frustration with Trump’s plans.

The president issued the order on immigration on Jan. 27, 2017, but was forced to issue two revised versions after court challenges. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the third version of the ban. All three iterations placed restrictions on citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries.

A watered-down version of the ban went into effect in June and expired in October. Trump also drastically cut America’s refugee admissions quota to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year ― the lowest it’s ever been.

Tamara Ilias, a Syrian refugee who spoke at Friday’s rally, told HuffPost she was shocked when she first heard about the travel ban. After fleeing civil war in Syria, she said her family lived in Lebanon for one year, waiting to be reunited with relatives in New York. The Lebanese government places restrictions on Syrian refugees’ ability to live and work in the country. She said her four children were unable to attend school, like many other refugee kids in Lebanon.

With the help of Catholic Charities’ refugee resettlement program, Ilias and her family were able to resettle in New York last May.

Now, she’s speaking up for the many others waiting in limbo in Lebanon.

“There are many people like me,” Ilias told HuffPost. “I’m lucky, I’m here. But many people are waiting, many people need help. Many people have families, have kids. It’s not easy, it’s so hard.”

Trump’s drastic cuts to refugee admissions came at a time when an unprecedented 65 million people are displaced worldwide, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.

Although he said the initial fervor around protesting the travel ban has died down since last January, Awawdeh hopes Friday’s rally shows that there’s much work left to do.

“The Trump administration didn’t just go after the Muslims. They were the first targets,” Awawdeh said. “This is going to continue to be a fight and a struggle.”Twitter went bonkers Friday when Ivanka Trump’s company touted its “convertible” jewelry line, which features elements that can be switched out. Followers wanted to know if the pieces could convert to handcuffs and ankle monitors should special counsel Robert Mueller come calling with questions about the 2016 presidential campaign.

Tweets also slammed the first daughter’s use of foreign factories to make her company’s products, despite dad Donald Trump’s relentless insistence on “America first” for manufacturing and jobs.

It was also an opportunity for some to simply take on Ivanka Trump’s politics, with one tweet inquiring if the jewelry had converted her to a woman who doesn’t care about women’s rights. One suggested pairing the jewelry with Complicit, “Saturday Night Live’s” parody of an Ivanka Trump perfume.

Like her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a White House adviser, Ivanka Trump has stepped aside from running her company, but she remains the owner and continues to support the business from her White House platform.

DUBAI (Reuters) - President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that Iran would remain committed to the 2015 nuclear deal if its interests were protected, while his foreign minister hoped the pact could be redesigned without Washington as a member.

The U.S. withdrawal from the accord on Tuesday was a “violation of morals”, Rouhani said in remarks carried by state television.

“If the remaining five countries continue to abide by the agreement, Iran will remain in the deal despite the will of America,” he said.

President Donald Trump’s pullout has upset European allies, cast uncertainty over global oil supplies and raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East.

It has also highlighted divisions among Iran’s political elite.

Rouhani made similarly conciliatory comments on Tuesday, and on Saturday, foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif began a tour of other signatory nations in an attempt to save the deal.

Zarif said in Beijing on Sunday: “We hope that with this visit to China and other countries we will be able to construct a clear future design for the comprehensive agreement.”

China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Zarif’s tour would improve understanding of Iran’s position and help Tehran protect its legitimate interests.

“China is willing to maintain communication and coordination with all relevant parties, including Iran, and take an objective, fair and responsible attitude to continue to safeguard the ...agreement,” Wang said.

Rouhani has said Iran will stay committed to the deal, which China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany also signed, provided those powers ensured Iran was protected from sanctions.

The three European states have recommitted to the agreement, but senior cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said on Friday that Europe was not to be trusted.

On Sunday, the head of the Assembly of Experts, a group of clerics responsible for choosing Iran’s supreme leader, said Rouhani should apologise for not having obtained guarantees from world powers for the agreement.

“It is necessary for the president to honestly and openly apologise to the people over the damages caused by the nuclear accord,” Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a top conservative, said in a statement carried by state media.

The head of the elite Revolutionary Guards also warned against relying on foreign powers.

“America’s exit aims to break the Iranian people’s resistance, which is not new ... but today’s problem is not U.S. sanctions, it’s that some officials look towards outside rather than looking at domestic potentials,” Guards commander General Mohammad Ali Jafari said, the state news agency IRNA reported.

On Wednesday, Jafari cast doubt on European nations’ ability to save the accord.

With the deal opposed by hardliners at home, some analysts say the pragmatic Rouhani may now be a lame duck leader.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was hopeful that the United States and Europe could agree on how to deal with Iran, after Trump threatened to sanction European companies that continue doing business there.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Pompeo said the United States was not aiming at Europe when it withdrew from the deal.

“I’m hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works, that really protects the world from Iranian bad behaviour, not just their nuclear programme, but their missiles and their malign behaviour as well,” he said

White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said sanctions could be imposed on European companies.

It’s possible. It depends on the conduct of other governments,” Bolton said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Tom Izzo, the head basketball coach for the MSU Spartans, watches the game against the University of Wisconsin at East Lansing's Breslin Center on Friday. Rey Del Rio via Getty Images

In a show of support for the courageous survivors who were abused by sports doctor Larry Nassar, students flooded the stands with teal at Michigan State University’s basketball game Friday night.

The sea-colored supporters covered the Breslin Student Events Center’s student section, also known as the Izzone, for coach Tom Izzo. Teal is the official color of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, which occurs in April, according to the National Violence Resource Center.

After dozens of women delivered emotional statements in court, Nassar, 54, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for child sexual abuse this week.

Some students channeled Raisman’s fierce words to Nassar ― “You are nothing” ― by printing the statement on their apparel.

A post shared by Micah Peel (@micahpeeeel) on Jan 26, 2018 at 7:03pm PST

Raisman, who revealed in November that she was also a victim, expressed her disgust with Nassar last week in court.

“Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” the Olympic gymnast told the doctor.

“The tables have turned, Larry. We are here, and we are not going anywhere.”

In the wake of Nassar’s sentencing, MSU has faced its own firestorm of criticism. The university’s president, Lou Anna Simon, and athletic director, Mark Hollis, have succumbed to the pressure and resigned this week.

Nassar’s victims blame Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics for enabling the doctor to treat athletes even after allegations of abuse were reported.

Over the course of two decades, eight young women say they told at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives about Nassar’s sexual abuse, yet university officials did nothing to stop him, The Detroit News reported last week.

Simon told Detroit News that she learned about abuse compliants against Nassar in 2014, when a Title IX complaint and police report were filed.Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is slated to provide her own nationally televised response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Waters will deliver her remarks on the BET program “Angela Rye’s State of the Union,” according to a report by BuzzFeed News.

Waters’ speech is not part of the Democratic Party’s official response to the president, which is due to be delivered by Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.).

It is nonetheless likely to make a splash thanks to Waters’ large internet following. Waters ― or “Auntie Maxine,” as she is affectionately known ― has become a viral sensation thanks to her fierce and colorful denunciations of Trump and her confrontations with administration officials.

Waters, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, famously grilled Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about an unanswered letter during a July hearing. Dissatisfied with Mnuchin’s explanations, Waters repeatedly interrupted him to inform him that she was “reclaiming my time” ― a refrain that has since become an internet meme and feminist rallying cry.Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman on Friday called on the U.S. Olympic Committee to first complete a full independent investigation into USA Gymnastics before the sport’s governing body elects new leaders.

Raisman tweeted her statement to the USOC in response to their letter to USAG on Thursday, in which they called for the entire board of directors to resign or else the sport’s governing body would lose their certification.

On Friday, USAG said it would comply with the USOC’s request to have all members of the board’s remaining 18 members resign. USAG chairman Paul Parilla, vice chairman Jay Binder and treasurer Bitsy Kelley resigned Monday.

In the Thursday letter, USOC CEO Scott Blackmun gave the USAG a list of steps it must take to reform the organization, including electing an interim board by the end of next month and cooperating in an independent investigation.

Raisman, however, believes that the investigation should be completed ― and all the people who enabled Larry Nassar’s abuse ousted ― before new members are elected to the board.

“I feel very strongly that unless and until an independent investigation is competed, we cannot be sure (1) we know the full extent of the problem, (2) that all the people who contributed to the problem have been removed and replaced, and (3) that the changes will effectively address the problem,” Raisman said in the statement.

The gymnast insisted that Nassar had more victims who haven’t yet spoken out and said that it was necessary to uncover any USAG staff or board members who may have “fostered” Nassar’s actions.

“What possible reason could there be for not making it a priority to know these things,” Raisman asked. “If we don’t investigate, it’s possible an individual who enabled Nassar could be appointed to the board OR the board could have the difficult task of overseeing staff that enabled Nassar.”

My response to the USOC & Scott Blackmun pic.twitter.com/6Z5l6JrzCm — Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) January 27, 2018

Raisman offered the USOC her own set of requirements, asking Blackmun to ensure the investigation operates “with complete independence” and requesting that the investigation’s findings be made public at the same time it’s delivered to the USOC and USAG.

Raisman, who was one of more than a hundred women who were molested by Nassar, has become one of the most vocal proponents to demand public accountability from the individuals and organizations who enabled Nassar’s rampant abuse.

During an interview with the “Today” show on Thursday, Raisman criticized USAG and the USOC for prioritizing winning over athletes’ safety.

Nassar “did not have a medical license in Texas, which is where we went to the ranch and trained,” Raisman said on the show. “It’s a national team training center and the Olympic training center ... so what does that say about USA Gymnastics and United States Olympic Committee? Whether they knew or didn’t know, that’s a big problem and we need to investigate how this happened.”It feels like just yesterday that a collective revolt surged in opposition to the signing of President Donald Trump’s first travel ban, enacted one year ago Saturday. To those it has affected directly, however, the last year has felt like a lifetime ― one in which a fresh start in the United States represented their last resort.

Trump enacted three different travel bans in 2017. All three banned travel from citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. The first two also suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days.

Implemented for a few days, sometimes a few weeks or months, the three bans were all in some form temporarily dismantled in federal court, with the latest version heading to the Supreme Court. In June, a watered-down version of the ban did go into effect, keeping people out unless they could prove a “bona-fide relationship” to a U.S. person or entity. That expired in October, when the Trump administration also slashed the annual resettlement quota from 110,000 to 45,000, the lowest it’s ever been in U.S. history.

These repeated attempts to shut out the needy, along with the chaos that’s ensued, have cast a long-lasting shadow on the resettlement program. They’ve left tens of thousands of the world’s most vulnerable people fighting for survival in foreign lands they’re not welcome in.

“They don’t really have other options for safety,” said Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for Church World Service’s Immigration and Refugee program.

Niloufar Cheteian, 27, an Iranian Kurdish refugee, fled to Turkey in 2012 in an attempt to escape persecution as an ethnic minority. In 2015, she found out that the U.S. would be interviewing her as part of its refugee resettlement program. She did two rounds of preliminary interviews, but then abruptly received notice about 10 months ago that her case had been denied, she told HuffPost. She appealed, and it was denied again.

Officials refused to offer an explanation as to why, even though her case closely resembles that of other Iranian refugees who have successfully been resettled in America (including her sister and brother-in-law).

She can’t go back to Iran, she said, because she faces detention and torture as a non-Persian. She also fears repercussions from her recent divorce, explaining that her ex-husband’s family has threatened to harm her should they split up.

Yet she conceded that the situation is Turkey is equally hopeless. She hides out in the home she shares with other Iranian and Syrian refugees, afraid of emerging in public because gangs of young men have beaten her numerous times in the street, leaving her with scars on her chest.

“To be a woman, to be a refugee, to be a Kurd are very serious crimes here,” she said.

Niloufar Cheteian

Cheteian no longer has a source of income aside from remittances from her U.S.-based family members. Like many other refugees living in Turkey, she had been working under the table for a textile manufacturing company until her employer stopped paying her.

“I kept asking and begging him but he denied that I worked for him,” she said.

Facing a total impasse, Cheteian considered paying a smuggler to send her onto the shores of Greece in a rubber dinghy ― a journey more than 1 million people have taken since 2015, but one that thousands didn’t survive. The cost, plus stories of friends who perished at sea, stopped her.

“The refugees here say I should have at least $13,000 if I want to safely arrive in Germany or other counties,” she noted. “Even if I go to European countries I am not sure that they would accept me and recognize my case since many refugees have been deported in recent months.”

Two other refugees HuffPost spoke with also mused about attempting the crossing into Greece, including Abbas Mohammed, 26, an Iranian LGBTQ refugee whose name was changed in this article because of security concerns. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services canceled his second resettlement interview on multiple occasions following the first travel ban. He hasn’t heard back from the agency since last August.

“No country is taking me, I have no way to go forward and no way to go back. I am an international orphan.”

“If USCIS officers don’t come [to Turkey] earlier than November I have to go [to Europe] because the weather will be worse after that,” he had said in July. “Right now one smuggler has agreed to take me there for $200.”

He conceded, though, that it was a “dead end” solution. “Borders are closed and there is not any way for us to leave here,” he said. He wondered if he’d have to resort to prostitution to continue supporting himself while he holds out hope for an eventual response from the U.S. As of this week, Mohammed remains in Turkey.

Both Cheteian and Mohammed also said they’ve contemplated suicide.

“No country is taking me, I have no way to go forward and no way to go back,” Cheteian said. “I am an international orphan.”

Kamal Hazbawi, 41, another Iranian refugee, is facing a deportation order from Turkish authorities. He expects to be tortured or executed if they send him back to Iran, he said, and the U.S. halted his resettlement process last July.

He said he emailed the U.S. officers he’d already communicated with on Wednesday about his pending deportation. They responded, but told him there was nothing they could do.

“I don’t know what to do. I’m really stressed and confused,” he said. The order to deport only affects him, meaning he’d be leaving his wife and three young children behind if he gets taken away.

More than 3.7 million refugees ― mainly Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans, Iranians and Somalis ― currently languish in Turkey, according to European Union statistics. Another 18.8 million people are refugees worldwide, more than half of whom are under the age of 18.

The U.S. once exerted global leadership over the legal resettlement process, taking in more refugees through the resettlement pipeline than any other country. While the numbers always represented a mere drop in the bucket, it’s a legacy, tied to the ethos of the country’s founding that many hold dear.

“We have always led on the issue of refugees, we’ve done that because it is part of who we are as Americans,” Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador and dean and executive professor at the George Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University, said on a press call. “It’s right there on the Statue of Liberty. Virtually all of us came here from somewhere else.”

Even though the quota for this fiscal year is 45,000, the administration has only resettled a little over 6,000 refugees since the start of October, according to State Department data.

“We’re already well into the second quarter,” Smyers said. “That’s less than half the amount of refugees we’d have to be resettling to keep pace with that 45,000 number.”

The International Rescue Committee predicts that only 15,000 people will get resettled by the end of the fiscal year ― a 72 percent drop from the year before.

Smyers added that she wouldn’t be surprised if a new ban is in the cards. The third ban, proclaimed on Oct. 24, expired last week (even though it had been enjoined in federal court anyway).Sir Ian McKellen commemorated the 30th anniversary of his publicly coming out with a statement on the power of being open about who you are.

“I’ve never met a gay person who who regretted coming out — including myself,” the renowned actor wrote on Twitter. “Life at last begins to make sense, when you are open and honest.”

I’ve never met a gay person who regretted coming out – including myself. Life at last begins to make sense, when you are open and honest. Today is the 30th anniversary of the BBC radio discussion when I publically said I was gay. So I’m celebrating! — Ian McKellen (@IanMcKellen) January 27, 2018

The 78-year-old English actor, who is an LGBTQ activist and founder of Stonewall UK, has previously talked about growing up in a time when being gay was illegal and highly stigmatized.

“Gay people, homosexuals, conducted their lives as secretly as possible,” he said in a short film earlier this year. “There was nobody who was out ― nobody.”

McKellen addressed his sexuality to the media in 1988, at the age of 49. It happened during a discussion over legislation that made “promoting homosexuality” in schools illegal.

“I was so appalled by this when I heard of it, I joined in groups vocally explaining why this was an unjust law, and in a debate on BBC radio, I came out and said I was gay,” he told ET Online.

His public announcement then came during the AIDS crisis — a time of extreme stigma and prejudice against gay men.

McKellen has said many times that he regrets not coming out publicly sooner.

“What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor,” he told HuffPost in 2015. “I think up to that point, I had been using acting as a disguise — somewhere where I could express my emotions, and draw attention to myself in a way that I didn’t particularly want to do in real life. Acting became not about disguise, but about telling the truth.”Winter may come again ... in April 2019?

“Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams — a.k.a. Arya Stark in HBO’s epic fantasy drama ― appears to have inadvertently revealed when the show will return to television screens for its eighth and final season.

“We wrap in December and we air our first episode in April (2019),” she said in an interview that British newspaper Metro shared online Wednesday.

HBO had already confirmed the show would conclude in 2019, but had not offered up details of exactly when. “We have announced 2019,” a spokesperson told HuffPost via email on Saturday morning. “Nothing more specific than that at this time.”Michigan State University’s top two coaches said they have no plans to quit their jobs despite a damning ESPN “Outside the Lines” report that claimed the school mishandled complaints of sexual abuse and violence against women involving its athletic department.

Mark Dantonio and Tom Izzo ― head coaches of MSU’s football and basketball teams, respectively ― sought Friday night to tamp down rumors of their departures following the ESPN report.

The school’s sexual abuse scandal began with accusations of serial assault of female gymnasts by former MSU doctor Larry Nassar, who was sentenced earlier this week to a lengthy prison term on seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct. MSU President Lou Anna Simon and Athletic Director Mark Hollis bowed to pressure to resign amid criticisms that school officials mishandled complaints of sexual abuse by Nassar years before he was formally charged in 2016.

But the scope of the scandal is widening. According to the ESPN report, MSU has attempted to shield people in its football and basketball programs accused of sexual abuse and violence against women in order to maintain the school’s reputation. ESPN said it found a “pattern of widespread denial, inaction and information suppression” in MSU’s response to sexual assault complaints involving the school’s athletic department.

At least 16 members of the football team have been accused of sexual assault or violence against women since Dantonio became head coach in 2007, ESPN reported, based on interviews and public records.

Dantonio called claims that he mishandled such accusations “completely false.” At a brief press conference, he said that “every incident reported in that article was documented by either police or the Michigan State Title IX office” that deals with gender equality issues.

He added: “I have always worked with the proper authorities when dealing with the cases of sexual assault.”

Rumors that he would be resigning are “absolutely false,” Dantonio also said.

The ESPN report said Dantonio appeared to make a false statement to reporters last spring when he referred to abuse complaints made against football players in 2017 as “new ground for us.”

The coach began his Friday remarks by addressing the scores of young women abused by Nassar. “It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear their stories and the pain and suffering they went through,” he said.

Izzo, asked about the ESPN report following a MSU basketball game, said he hadn’t had enough time to think about it.

“We will cooperate with any investigation going forward,” he said. “That’s about all I have to say about it.”

Asked about the resignation rumors, Izzo said, “I’m not going anywhere, in my mind.”

He added: “I’m definitely not retiring. And there’s a lot of things that happened today that are part of life. I’m gonna worry about my team, I’m gonna worry about the survivors, I’m gonna worry about what I do.”

In one incident detailed in the ESPN report, a student basketball coach, Travis Walton, was allowed to continue working after he was charged with assaulting a woman at a bar. Walton allegedly became agitated when the women asked him to leave her table, where she and a group were commemorating a deceased friend.

Later, a woman went to then-Athletic Director Hollis to accuse Walton and two MSU basketball players of raping her. According to ESPN, the student coach was dismissed from his job, but the players stayed on the team and in school.

The woman did not pursue her allegation with police, ESPN reported.

Sources told the outlet that abuse complaints involving members of MSU’s athletic department were often handled internally, sometimes even by coaches.

The Nassar case, which affected several of the country’s finest women gymnasts, raised sharp questions over MSU’s ability to process abuse complaints. Young women and girls reported the now-disgraced physician multiple times over decades, but he was not stopped.

A Lansing State Journal report published Friday accused the university of withholding information about an investigation it conducted into Nassar’s behavior following a 2014 complaint because it could open the school to lawsuits.

MSU is currently under investigation by the NCAA and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette.

The NCAA, however, faced criticisms of its own when The Athletic outlet reported on Friday that the group’s president, Mark Emmert, was told about more than three dozen sexual assault reports made against MSU athletes, but did nothing about it.New York Daily News Managing Editor Rob Moore was suspended Friday amid a sexual harassment investigation and reports that he punished employees who complained about him to the newspaper’s human relations department.

Sources in the newsroom confirmed Moore’s suspension, which followed a HuffPost report that detailed his aggressive and inappropriate management tactics, corroborated by more than 20 current and former staffers. NPR reported last week that a harassment complaint had been filed against Moore in December.

Earlier this week, the Daily News’ new corporate parent, Tronc, launched an investigation into Moore after NPR asked the company about a sexual harassment complaint lodged against him in December. He’d reportedly just been interviewed to become the newspaper’s new editor-in-chief.

Alexander “Doc” Jones, who edits the paper’s Sunday edition, was led out of the newsroom on Thursday and suspended over separate allegations of sexual harassment. The complaints against Jones included multiple claims that he forcibly kissed some of his employees, former staffers said.Sometimes a thing described to you is no match for experiencing the thing firsthand.

“A fucking turd would have been better as a president,” the Detroit rapper said in a new interview that Billboard magazine published on Thursday.

Eminem has repeatedly criticized Trump, those who voted him into power and some of their divisive views ― via the album artwork for new record “Revival,” the song “Untouchable” and his blistering cypher at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards.

But he’s not overly concerned about his political stance costing him their support.

“At the end of the day, if I did lose half my fan base, then so be it, because I feel like I stood up for what was right and I’m on the right side of this,” Eminem told Billboard.

In the interview, Eminem also responded to accusations of hypocrisy regarding his sometimes misogynistic and homophobic song lyrics. “A lot of shit is said in jest, it’s tongue-in-cheek” to “get a reaction out of people,” he said.

AdvertisementA somber Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wants President Donald Trump’s administration to issue a formal apology to his colleague and good friend, GOP Sen. John McCain, over a recent insult mocking the Arizonian’s health status.

In an interview with CBS’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday, Graham called the barb directed at McCain during a meeting last week of White House staffers “disgusting,” and he voiced his dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s response.

Reports surfaced that White House aide Kelly Sadler joked that McCain was “dying anyway” during a discussion of the senator’s announcement that he was opposed to Trump’s nomination of Gina Haspel to head the CIA. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, came out against Haspel’s nomination due to her controversial involvement in the CIA’s now-defunct torture program. McCain, 81, is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn’t deny that Sadler made the remark; instead, she lambasted leaks about private White House meetings

Graham said he wished “somebody from the White House would tell the country, ‘That was inappropriate, that’s not who we are in the Trump administration. And John McCain can be criticized for any political decision he’s ever made or any vote he’s ever cast, but he’s an American hero.’”

He added, “I think most Americans would like to see the Trump administration do better in situations like this.”

CNN reported Sunday that Sadler has told McCain’s daughter, Meghan, that she would apologize publicly for her comment. But Sadler, who also apologized to Meghan in a private phone call, had not made any public mea culpa as of late Sunday afternoon.

Graham did not go so far as to say Trump himself should apologize. But he added that if someone working for him made such a remark, he would issue an apology on behalf of the office.

Meghan McCain publicly scolded Sadler last week.

“I don’t understand the kind of environment you’re working in where that would be acceptable and you could come into work the next day and still have a job,” Meghan said Friday on “The View.”President Donald Trump seldom “likes” other account’s tweets on Twitter, so it becomes newsworthy when he does.

Particularly when he “likes” this Wall Street Journal report on the sexual misconduct allegations made against his “great friend” Steve Wynn, the billionaire Las Vegas casino owner and RNC finance chair who dozens of former employees have accused of sexual harassment and abuse.

RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel issued a brief statement to HuffPost on Wynn’s resignation.

“Today I accepted Steve Wynn’s resignation as Republican National Committee finance chair,” she said. Picked by President Donald Trump, Wynn served in his position for just one year.

On Friday, The Wall Street Journal published sexual harassment accusations against Wynn stemming from interviews with dozens of current and former employees who said they had experienced or witnessed abuse by the billionaire. His actions allegedly ranged from unwanted touching to soliciting sex acts from women who worked in service jobs at his establishments.

In one case, Wynn reached a $7.5 million settlement with a woman who gave him a manicure in 2005. She filed a report saying he tried to pressure her into sex.

Wynn vehemently denied the accusations and issued a statement that, in part, blamed his ex-wife for spreading the story. She is currently suing Wynn over stock shares.

“The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” Wynn, 76, said in the statement.

“We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits,” Wynn said. “It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.”

The casino owner threw his support behind Trump in the 2016 election, donating around $833,000 to Republican funds, according to Forbes. The RNC has not said whether it will return Wynn’s money. The organization previously called on the Democratic National Committee to return the donations it had received from alleged sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the suicide blast, a week after they claimed an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in which more than 20 people were killed.

An interior ministry spokesman blamed the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban which Afghan and Western officials consider to be behind many of the biggest attacks on urban targets in Afghanistan.

As medical teams struggled to handle the casualties pouring in, some of the wounded were laid out in the open, with intravenous drips set up next to them in hospital gardens.

“It’s a massacre,” said Dejan Panic, coordinator in Afghanistan for the Italian aid group Emergency, which runs a nearby trauma hospital that treated dozens of wounded.

Hours after the blast, a health ministry spokesman said the casualty toll had risen to at least 95 killed and 158 wounded.

The latest attack will add pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his U.S. allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centers.

“Today’s attack is nothing short of an atrocity, and those who have organized and enabled it must be brought to justice and held to account,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement.

The United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces and increased its air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups, aiming to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table.

However, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions they have been weakened by the new strategy, and the past week has shown their capacity to mount deadly, high-profile attacks is undiminished, even in the heavily protected center of Kabul.

The U.S.-led international force in Afghanistan vowed its support for the Afghan government and armed forces in their “difficult and dangerous work,” adding that none of its members had been killed or wounded in the blast.

AMBULANCE AT CHECKPOINT

Saturday is a working day in Afghanistan and the streets were full when the blast went off at around lunchtime in a busy part of the city close to shops and markets and near a number of foreign embassies and government buildings.

Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was nearby when the explosion occurred, said an ambulance approached the checkpoint and blew up. The target was apparently an interior ministry building but the victims were mainly people who happened to be in the street.

Buildings hundreds of meters away were shaken by the force of the blast, which left torn bodies strewn on the street amid piles of rubble, debris and wrecked cars.

The casualty toll is the worst since 150 people were killed in a truck bomb explosion last May near the German embassy, an attack that prompted a major reinforcement of security aimed at preventing similar vehicle-borne attacks.

With much of central Kabul now a heavily fortified zone of high concrete blast walls and police checkpoints, there were angry questions about how the bomber had been able to get through and set off the blast.

“Officials must be held responsible,” said former deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi.

People helped walking-wounded away as ambulances with sirens wailing inched their way through the traffic-clogged streets of the city center.

“I was sitting in the office when the explosion went off,” said Alam, an office worker whose head was badly cut in the blast.

“All the windows shattered, the building collapsed and everything came down.”

The Swedish and Dutch embassies as well as the European Union mission and an Indian consular office are also nearby but there were no reports that any of their staff had been hurt in the attack.Cambodia’s forests are quietly and rapidly disappearing.

As the impoverished country slides deeper into political crisis, corrupt elites continue to siphon off its natural resources through a criminal network in which state officials and Prime Minister Hun Sen’s cronies are allegedly complicit.

The government’s latest efforts to curb illegal logging and deforestation have been hampered by poor law enforcement, high-level corruption and the state’s own crackdown on its environmental critics. And as Phnom Penh grants companies economic land concessions ― or long-term land leases ― to establish rubber and palm oil plantations, local community members have found themselves on a daunting mission to protect what remains of their beloved forests.

An investigative report by U.K.-based NGO Global Witness describes a “multi-million dollar black-market trade” through which loggers are granted safe passage and immunity from penalties to smuggle Cambodian rosewood to China. At the helm of this reported operation is tycoon Try Pheap, an associate of the prime minister. Hun Sen has lashed out against a cascade of damning accusations by local media and watchdogs like Global Witness, once calling the anti-graft organization ignorant, stupid and “crazy.”

But an official probe last year also found that dozens of Cambodian police officers, military personnel and senior state officials accepted bribes to assist Vietnamese timber smugglers. The Environmental Investigation Agency doubled down on these allegations months later, reporting that approximately 300,000 cubic meters of logs had been smuggled out of the country with the help of Cambodian authorities and laundered in Vietnam in less than a year, to the tune of more than $13 million.

These illicit networks have had devastating ramifications in Cambodia, where rural poor and indigenous communities have relied on forested areas as a vital source of income for thousands of years. With one of the highest rates of tree cover loss in the world, the country saw nearly 2 million hectares, or 20 percent of its forests, diminish between 2001 and 2016. Satellite images from NASA show the drastic transformation over time.

Cambodia’s Environment Ministry in Phnom Penh dismissed the data as “incitement” by NASA and an attempt at “confusing the public with the desire to criticize the government.” But analysts point to an alarming trend that places the future of Cambodia’s forest ecosystems ― and the communities who depend of them for their livelihoods ― in jeopardy.

“At the rate Cambodia has been going, it’s losing over 1 percent of its total forest every year. You can’t do that indefinitely,” Nancy Harris, research manager for Global Forest Watch, told HuffPost. “Over the 1990s and 2000s a lot of illegal logging happened and so there’s now very little intact primary forest, compared to what there used to be,” she added. “Right now it’s just sort of the Wild West.”

“This is a country whose natural resources are being rapidly depleted.” - Emma Burnett, Global Witness

Officials at the Environment Ministry, which manages Cambodia’s protected areas, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

“This is a country whose natural resources are being rapidly depleted,” Emma Burnett, a senior campaigner with Global Witness, told HuffPost.

“Rather than the profits from the sale of those resources being channeled through the national treasury and into public services ... they’re being creamed off by high-ranking politicians and their business partners and used to consolidate wealth and power on the part of the regime,” she said.

“Then you have these people on the ground, the Prey Lang community, who are really desperately trying to preserve their livelihoods and their way of life. It’s a bit of a David and Goliath story, really.”

The grassroots movement to protect Cambodian forests has seen activists and journalists killed in recent years. Members of a campaign known as the Prey Lang Community Network try to document and prevent illegal logging and the timber-smuggling trade in the vast Prey Lang Forest, which spans four northern provinces.

Watch the 360 GlobalBeat video below to follow members of the PLCN deep into the forest as they patrol the region for illegal loggers.

Saddled on motorbikes and equipped with smartphones to report offenders, hundreds of PLCN patrollers scour the forests for days at a time, several times each month. Many belong to indigenous minority groups who rely on forest resources, although the government has urged them to become less dependent.

Speaking in 2015 about economic land concession grants, Environment Minister Say Samal said Cambodia was trying to “develop our agriculture industry to create jobs for our people, so hopefully they don’t have to depend on the forests anymore.” Instead, he suggested, they should “depend on something else, like a skill.”

The government has barred the PLCN from conducting independent excursions, but many patrollers reject the ban. The network, which has won several international awards including the UNDP Equator Initiative Prize, describes its process on its website:

When PLCN members encounter loggers during patrols, the first step is to initiate a peaceful dialogue with them. We then check whether they have logging permits. If they do not, which is usually the case, we inform them about the destructive effects of logging on the forest and communities. We then make the loggers sign a contract stating that they will not take part in illegal logging activities in the future. These contracts then form a database of the names and faces of illegal loggers.

“The Prey Lang Community Network are people who love the forest. Our network is not supported by the government, so we work as volunteers,” Phai Bunleang, the defacto PLCN leader for Kratie Province, told an NYU reporting team. “It is difficult to monitor the Prey Lang because it is huge. There are many roads deep inside the forest, and we have limited volunteers.”

Confronting illegal loggers can be an extremely perilous task for the under-resourced and sometimes outnumbered group. In 2016, PLCN activist Phorn Sopheak was attacked with a machete and seriously injured while on patrol.

“They were all young illegal loggers. When they attacked, they chose the person closest to them. Unfortunately, that happened to be me,” she recalled to NYU reporters in March.

In 2012, a military police officer fatally shot environmental investigator Chut Wutty. The activist was showing an illegal logging operation to journalists in southern Cambodia when he was killed.

Even when PLCN patrollers or police make arrests in the forest, they’re often not catching the true culprit, according to Fred Stolle, a senior associate with World Resources Institute.

“They catch the guy with the chainsaw, but he’s just the guy who was hired by the company, and the police don’t go further than that,” Stolle told HuffPost. “It’s very difficult to figure out who is paying people to cut trees, because middlemen use middlemen, and so on.”

Although protecting the Prey Lang is both dangerous and exhausting, Phai Bunleang believes it is a necessary endeavor. He is hopeful, but not optimistic, for more support from the government.

“It’s regrettable when the PLCN works hard as volunteers ― independent and without pay, spending our own money and energy ― that this is still going on,” he said.

But for Cambodia’s forests, time is running out. Experts warn that the rate of deforestation is “massively unsustainable” as timber smuggling networks prevail.On Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time,” the comedian said that if Trump kept on insisting it was true then he had to explain “why the single most consistent thing in his whole life is he loves to pick fights with black people.”

“Of all his myriad insanities, if I had to pick one line for his tombstone it would be, ‘Here Lies Donald Trump: Picked Fights With Black People,’” quipped Maher.

“Think of the list,” he said, before reeling off the names of people that Trump has attacked over the years.

“Is it just a coincidence that he’s perpetually pissed off at the NBA and NFL but golfers and hockey players never seem to bother him?” asked Maher, before lightheartedly suggesting another group of people that Trump may like to aim his anger at instead.This video is not for the faint of heart.

Tom Cruise busted his ankle while filming “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” in London last year, and has now shared frightening slow motion footage (from various angles) of the roof-jumping stunt gone wrong.

“I knew I’d broke it instantly,” Cruise said on Friday’s broadcast of “The Graham Norton Show.”Three civil rights organizations have filed a lawsuit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for rolling back protections for students who report sexual assault.

SurvJustice, which helps university women report assault, joined with Equal Rights Advocates and the Victim Rights Law Center to file the suit, which argues that the changes are discriminatory, violate federal law and are having a “chilling effect” on assault reports. In addition, schools are either not responding to the fewer complaints or not taking action as quickly, according to the suit.

The suit was filed Thursday in the Northern District of California against DeVos, the Department of Education and Candice Jackson, acting assistant secretary for civil rights at the department.

The suit argues that DeVos and Jackson hold “discriminatory stereotypes” about women and are convinced that many who report sexual abuse or assault “misunderstood a harmless romantic advance,” are lying or later regretted a “consensual sexual encounter.”

This “discriminatory mindset not only motivated decision makers at the department, it flows from the top of the Executive Branch,” the complaint adds, referring to President Donald Trump.

DeVos issued a new policy in September increasing protections for those accused of sexual assault in kindergarten through college. She said that the Obama administration hadn’t ensured the rights of the accused and moved to adopt what she termed “fundamental fairness.” Shortly before the changes, DeVos called the 2011 Obama-era policies addressing campus sexual assault “shameful” and “wholly un-American.”

She raised the standard of proof for accusers from a “preponderance of evidence” to “clear and convincing evidence.” The new guidelines also allowed even cases of sexual assault to be settled by mediation.

Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California system, said at the time that changes would “in effect weaken sexual violence protections” and “prompt confusion among campuses.”

Deadspin pointed out that DeVos ditched the Obama policies two days after meeting with the head of Michigan State University. Larry Nassar, a doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State’s athletic department, was sentenced this week to up to 175 years in prison after more than 100 women confronted him in court for sexually assaulting them. He was fired by Michigan State in 2016.

Shortly before the Education Department changes were made, Jackson flippantly dismissed “90 percent” of school sex assault reports in an interview with The New York Times.

They “fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right,’” Jackson told the newspaper. She has also branded the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment as “fake victims.”William Ruckelshaus in 1970. Bettmann via Getty Images

The nation’s first Environmental Protection Agency chief, who returned as administrator in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan, excoriated his own party on Friday, warning that Republicans’ ideological opposition to widely-accepted climate science would prove lethal.

“It’s a threat to the country,” William Ruckelshaus, whom President Richard Nixon appointed in 1970 to lead the newly-created EPA, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview by phone from his home in Seattle. “If you don’t step up and take care of real problems, and don’t do anything about it, lives will be sacrificed.”

“They certainly are killing everything,” he added, noting that President Donald Trump’s assault on climate change policies would be a cornerstone of his legacy.

Ruckelshaus, 85, has emerged over the past year as a fierce critic of current EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

In March, less than a month after Pruitt was sworn into office, Ruckelshaus cautioned the former Oklahoma attorney general against gutting regulations and coddling polluting industries. He compared Pruitt’s zeal for deregulation to Anne Gorsuch, Reagan’s first EPA administrator, whom Ruckelshaus replaced after she resigned and was held in contempt of Congress. On Friday, he again drew parallels between the two.

“They don’t believe in the mission of the agency,” he said, adding that Pruitt is the only EPA administrator he has never met. “Neither one of them did. Anne Gorsuch did not, and I don’t think Pruitt does either. They think we’re over-regulating.”

But he said now, even more than in the early 1980s, Pruitt’s radical view of the agency he leads represents the partisan dogma of the moment. The Republican Party inched toward serious action on climate change in the mid-2000s. John McCain, the GOP presidential nominee in 2008, called for renewable energy investments, caps on greenhouse gas emissions and subsidies for electric cars, though he supported aggressive oil drilling and remained skeptical of joining international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol. During the Obama years, the billionaire brothers behind fossil fuel giant Koch Industries became political kingmakers in the Republican Party, and engineered an ideological shift toward climate change denial.

Even now, Republicans who acknowledge the basic realities of climate science are few and far between, and radical new megadonors, such as Robert and Rebekah Mercer, are funding some of the most fringe climate-denial proponents.

“To a certain extent, the Republican position for years now, really starting with Gorsuch, has been ideologically antagonistic to these kinds of controls over industry,” Ruckelshaus said. “Republicans tend to spend more time on economic impacts of what they’re doing than Democrats, but they were all serious about it, and they didn’t think it was nonsense.”

“Pruitt has already had success ― ideological success ― because he seems to be complying with the wishes of the Republican Party,” he added.

Last week, three former EPA administrators told HuffPost it could take decades for the next agency chief to restore the staffing, reputation and regulatory muscle lost under Pruitt. Carol Browner, who served as administrator under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, said it would take up to 20 or 30 years.

“Pruitt has already had success ― ideological success ― because he seems to be complying with the wishes of the Republican Party.” - William Ruckelshaus, former EPA administrator

When Ruckelshaus returned to the EPA in 1983, employees greeted him with a banner proclaiming: “How do you spell relief? Ruckelshaus,” according to a New York Times report from 1984. He increased the eviscerated budget and revitalized morale, earning him the nickname “Mr. Clean.” Doing the same after Pruitt, and reversing some of his regulatory decisions, could take a matter of years. He said reconsidering rejected pesticide bans, installing advisers who take air pollution science seriously, and reviving climate change regulations akin to the Clean Power Plan that Pruitt proposed repealing would be critical first steps.

Restoring trust in the agency could prove a greater challenge, he said.

“The agency would have to open up completely,” Ruckelshaus said. “Not just surreptitiously reinstating what the Trump administration took away.”

As an example, he pointed to Gina McCarthy, the Obama-era administrator who, in 2014, toured oil-rich states like North Dakota as a “listener and a saleswoman,” saying she had to be “everywhere” because “people have to have a relationship with me.” From his own experience, Ruckelshaus recalled the well-known case of a copper smelter outside Seattle, which blamed its closure on EPA regulations, despite being slated to shut down before new arsenic rules were passed. Ruckelshaus said he countered the company’s claims by going public.

“We had very public hearings, TV cameras were there, and everyone was hearing what was going on,” he said.

To be sure, the toxic legacy of that smelter lives on three decades later, as residents of Tacoma, Washington, still struggle with lead and arsenic exposure. And Ruckelshaus’ calls for more debate on the merits of regulating sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain, delayed clean-up efforts until the next administration.

“I did all that I could,” he said. “I don’t tend to think back on those kinds of assignments and think of the things I didn’t do. But I was not successful in grasping acid rain.”

Yet he warned that climate change poses a much more complex challenge than acid rain ― and one that will become more difficult to deal with as key agencies like the EPA lose scientists researching the problem.

“If your position is, ‘I don’t believe the science, therefore I’m going to get rid of all the scientists studying this, and let’s not mention it in any public announcement,’ that’s just crazy,” Ruckelshaus said. “ What you want to do is more science.”

That, however, may have to wait for the next administration.
