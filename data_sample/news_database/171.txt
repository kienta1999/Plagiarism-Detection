David Francisco just sang his way to Hollywood ― and into Katy Perry’s heart on Monday’s “American Idol.”

Before his audition, Francisco, 25, explained how he moved to Nashville for his music and was hit by a car, paralyzing him below the waist. But he eventually regained some movement in his legs and reconnected with an old friend who became the love of his life.

Francisco’s powerful backstory and solid rendering of “Isn’t She Lovely” on acoustic guitar reduced Perry, a judge, to a puddle of tears. “I’m just losing it,” she said.

Then the contestant heard the words he perhaps wanted to hear most: “You’re going to Hollywood,” meaning he advanced to the next stage in Tinseltown.And Seth Meyers thinks he knows how it will play out.

On Monday’s broadcast of “Late Night,” the comedian suggested how the negotiations between the two leaders will go down ― and Trump may not like it.A GOP member of the House Intelligence Committee is breaking ranks with his fellow Republicans over a contentious report released Monday on Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to the campaign of Donald Trump.

Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) told CNN that “there is evidence” the Russians worked to help Trump.

“I don’t know that necessarily there was a full-fledged campaign to do everything that they could to help elect Donald Trump,” he added. “I think that their goal was chaos.”

The draft report released by his fellow Republicans on Monday claims otherwise, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the election but not with the goal of aiding Trump.

"We've gone completely off the rails, and now we're just basically a political forum for people to leak information to drive the day's news. ... We've lost all credibility" - Rep. Tom Rooney on the Republican decision to end the House Russia investigation https://t.co/6G7SgZbcoT pic.twitter.com/WXWt0Iaquv — CNN (@CNN) March 13, 2018

However, he also justified ending the committee’s investigation.

“We’ve gone completely off the rails, and now we’re just basically a political forum for people to leak information to drive the day’s news,” Rooney said. “We’ve lost all credibility, and we’re going to issue probably two different reports, unfortunately.”

He was referring to the likelihood that the committee’s Democratic members will issue their own report challenging the findings.

“GOP just shut down House Intel investigation, leaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who also sits on the committee, wrote on Twitter.

Rooney, who announced last month that he will not seek reelection, said he hopes the recommendations of the report could help protect this year’s midterm elections.Federal funds will flow to local jurisdictions that want to put more cops in schools under a new plan announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday.

As part of a plan announced in response to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last month, the Justice Department will prioritize grant money to local law enforcement agencies that want to add school resource officers. The Justice Department included the news in a package highlighting recent initiatives aimed at preventing school shootings.

“No child should have to fear going to school or walking the streets of their neighborhood,” Sessions said in a statement. “We are increasing the number of school resource officers, improving background checks and more aggressively prosecuting those who illegally attempt to purchase a firearm, and reviewing and enhancing the way our law enforcement agencies respond to tips from the public.”

The funds would come out of existing grants issued by the Justice Department’s Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) office. But critics say that there’s scant evidence the actions will actually make schools safer, and civil rights leaders fear that additional school resource officers will actually make schools less safe for students of color.

“The decision to funnel more money into the militarization of our schools and policing of young people is really problematic,” Kaitlin Banner, deputy project director at the liberal nonprofit Advancement Project, told HuffPost. When states or the federal government encourage school districts to increase the presence of police in the schools, the officers end up mostly in schools that serve children of color, who bear the brunt of the tougher security policies, she said.

“We’re similarly concerned about bringing more guns and weapons into the school environment,” Banner said.

“The decision to funnel more money into the militarization of our schools and policing of young people is really problematic.” - Kaitlin Banner, Advancement Project

There is no evidence that school cops ― also called school resource officers ― deter school shootings. In 2013, the Congressional Research Service studied the issue as policymakers pressed for more school officers after the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut. The research found that, while school cops can bring a few tangible benefits to schools, they could also have a devastating effect on the lives of vulnerable children by increasing the numbers of school arrests. Overall, the report lamented the lack of rigorous research on how officers affected schools as their hiring drained funding.

Schools with security officers are more likely to see facilities regularly patrolled and have emergency plans in place. But these schools are also more likely to refer students to local law enforcement, even for minor misbehaviors such as vandalism. This means that adolescent transgressions that would have previously been met with a detention or suspension could suddenly involve court appearances and a criminal record.

In some cases, too, students have been subject to police brutality. Previous HuffPost reporting found that school police officers used Tasers on children at least 87 times from 2011 to 2016.



“Sessions’ plan is unacceptable and will harm our children ― especially children of color,” Vanita Gupta, CEO of the Leadership Council on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. “This administration has shown an open hostility to children’s civil rights and this plan takes that to the next level.

“Instead of meaningful solutions that would keep children safe,” said Gupta, former head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, “like increasing safety restrictions and limitations on gun purchases and providing more school counselors, this plan will overpolice children and militarize schools. It must be scrapped.”

When it comes to arming teachers, groups ranging from school cops to teachers unions vehemently reject the idea. Civil rights leaders also worry about what arming teachers will mean for students of color, in addition to their concerns about placing more officers in schools.

“Once again, we are reminded that Attorney General Sessions is a very real danger to children, especially black children, Latino children, Muslim children, immigrant children and children with disabilities,” said Liz King, a senior policy analyst and director of education policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

Actor Alec Baldwin’s feud with President Donald Trump is showing no signs of dying down.

On Monday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” Baldwin took his beef with the president (who he portrays on “Saturday Night Live”) up a notch with a series of amusing questions about Trump’s Twitter habits. The president has used the social media platform for savage criticism of Baldwin’s “SNL” performances.

“Does he have alerts or does he sequester himself for just a period of tweeting?” Baldwin asked host Jimmy Fallon, before imagining Trump tweeting while watching “Fox & Friends” with “a triple order of bacon” in his “boxers and his bathrobe.”STX Entertainment

We’ve had plenty of adult-themed TV shows with puppets, but rarely do we get full-length feature films. Enter Brian Henson’s “The Happytime Murders.” Yes, that Henson family: Brian is the son of legendary puppeteer Jim Henson.

In “Happytime Murders,” one human detective, played by Melissa McCarthy, teams up with a puppet detective, voiced by Bill Barretta, to find out who has been killing puppets from a beloved ’80s television series.

Of course, it was just a trick of perspective. Trump Jr. was in fact talking to a reporter, who was standing behind the rabbit.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette staffer Andrew Rush shared the above image to Twitter.

Trump Jr. also commented on the snap:

AdvertisementLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan used his keynote speech at SXSW 2018 in Austin, Texas, on Monday to take a powerful stand against hate speech online.

Khan, who in 2016 became the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital, read aloud a sample of the Islamophobic abuse he receives via social media every day.

“Kill the Mayor of London and you will be rid of one Muslim terrorist,” one post said. “Deport all Muslims and make London white again,” said another.

Khan told the audience he wasn’t asking for sympathy or wanting to be portrayed as a victim. But he asked: “What happens when young boys and girls from minority backgrounds see this kind of thing on their timelines or experience it themselves?”

“We simply must do more to protect people online,” he added.

Khan later shared video of himself reading the abusive posts:

Khan, who has repeatedly clashed with President Donald Trump, called out social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, for their role in the proliferation of online hate speech.

He said he welcomed that they were “finally developing” the technology to make the process of reporting and removing hate speech “quicker and more effective.”

“But with the skills and resources these companies have at their disposal, I believe it’s possible to go further and faster,” he added.

Should social media companies’ efforts stall, Khan suggested “more countries will start to follow or go further than” Germany, where sites face tough fines if they do not remove banned content within 24 hours.

Khan further chastised governments and lawmakers who have been passively “sitting on their hands while the tech revolution has happened around them.”Conan O’Brien is here to give Fox News a helping hand with its new tagline.

On Monday, GOP lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee said they’d found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.

The GOP panel also said that while Russian intelligence interfered in the election, they didn’t do so to help Trump ― a finding at variance with that of U.S. intelligence agencies.

Trump welcomed the news with this tweet, which he posted in all caps:

ALL CAPS WON'T MAKE IT MORE BELIEVABLE, you freak show.#Maddow https://t.co/rsb8KOGONG — Polly Sigh (@dcpoll) March 13, 2018Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R), pictured here in 2011, speaks during an interview in New York. Bloomberg via Getty Images

Jessica Jernegan joined her fellow teachers to rally at the Oklahoma state Capitol in 2014 and demand more funding for schools. Despite the pleas of an estimated 25,000 protesters, the Republican-dominated legislature had other priorities in mind.

Lawmakers went on to approve, and Gov. Mary Fallin (R) signed, a measure reducing the top personal income tax rate ― one of several tax cuts that left the state struggling to pay for basic services like public education.

“That was really insulting,” recalled Jernegan, a fifth-grade reading teacher in Bixby, which is outside Tulsa. She noted that energy firms have been a prime beneficiary of the state’s tax cuts over the years.

“We feel our state legislature has chosen the oil and gas industry over our kids,” she said.

States like Oklahoma are now dealing with the reckoning, as educators and other public servants revolt against shrinking budgets that have stretched their workloads and left no money for pay raises.

Teachers in Oklahoma have decided to follow in the footsteps of those in West Virginia, where a historic strike this year shut down schools for nine days. They say they’ll walk off the job on April 2 if lawmakers don’t pass legislation boosting money for schools and guaranteeing raises for workers. The success of the West Virginia work stoppage, which secured a 5 percent pay hike, has prompted discussions about walkouts and protests in Arizona and Kentucky as well.

“Teachers and support [staff] are tired. Tired of not being listened to. Tired of not getting raises,” said Alicia Priest, president of the Oklahoma Education Association, the union organizing the walkout. “The state legislature has the power to make a school closure not happen by funding public education.”

The parallels between the funding crises unfolding in West Virginia and Oklahoma are hard to miss.

Both states embarked on a series of bipartisan tax cuts when their local economies appeared to be doing well, with Republican and Democratic leaders alike arguing that they needed to make their states more attractive to businesses. Beginning in 2006, West Virginia gradually reduced its corporate net income tax, phased out its business franchise tax, and eliminated its tax on groceries. Those and other tax cuts have diminished state revenue by an estimated $425 million a year.

CBPP

Oklahoma went on a similar tax-cutting binge starting in 2004. Legislators passed a series of bills gradually reducing the state’s top income tax rate, which applies to the majority of tax filers. They also increased the standard deduction and exempted capital gains from Oklahoma property sales. The cuts to the income tax rate alone have cost the state $1 billion annually, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute.

Many states were forced to cut education funding when tax revenue dried up during the Great Recession. Oklahoma now finds itself in an especially dire budget situation because it continued to cut taxes during the recovery that followed, according to Michael Leachman, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In addition to slashing income taxes, the state also cut the effective rate of its gross production tax on oil and gas firms.

“They sort of maximized the damage that the recession did to their schools and other public services, and as the economy improved, they kept cutting taxes,” Leachman said. “You’re just digging your hole even deeper.”

Just as falling demand for coal helped dry up West Virginia’s coffers, the drop in oil prices eventually hammered Oklahoma. The state has led the nation over the past decade in cuts to its education formula funding, which is the primary way individual districts get state money for schools. Oklahoma has slashed that funding by 28 percent since 2008 when adjusted for inflation, according to CBPP.

The squeezed budget has led to a grave teacher shortage, just like the one in West Virginia. Many Oklahoma schools have dropped to four-day weeks to save money. Each year the state has to certify an increasing number of emergency teachers to fill vacant roles ― it had 1,429 at the start of the current school year, up from 32 just five years ago. Teachers hired in these “emergency” roles do not have to meet the state’s normal minimum requirements to teach in public school.

Bonny Reibert, who teaches fifth- and sixth-grade special education in Tulsa, said she knows of three roles in her school being filled on an emergency basis.

“It’s not a knock on the emergency certified teachers, but the preparedness they lack is evident in the classroom,” Reibert said. “I’ve been teaching 11 years and I’m just now starting to feel comfortable with my ability and my skills. If you’re emergency, you’re an amateur and you need that time.”

The low pay in Oklahoma has made it difficult to retain educators. The state ranked 49th out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay in 2016, according to the National Education Association teachers union. With an average salary of $45,276, it fell just behind West Virginia and was one of five states where average pay had dropped from the previous year. Although teachers can receive modest “step” increases based on length of tenure, the state has not instituted an across-the-board raise in years.

“Good teachers know what they’re worth, and if they can’t feed their families, they’re gonna go someplace they can.” - Beth Wallis, band director

All of Oklahoma’s border states offer higher average salaries. The school district in Dallas, Texas, has taken advantage of the low pay in the Tulsa area by actively recruiting teachers there, Governing magazine reported last year. It distributes flyers that say, “Oklahoma, Join Us!” and advertises starting salaries that are $16,000 higher than those in Oklahoma.

Beth Wallis, a school band director who lives in Tulsa, told HuffPost that a fellow music educator raised his salary from around $32,000 to $50,000 by taking a job across the border in Arkansas.

“Good teachers know what they’re worth, and if they can’t feed their families, they’re gonna go someplace they can,” she said.

After years of tax cuts, it’s especially difficult for Oklahoma to reverse course in order to raise revenue. State law dictates that any legislative effort to raise taxes must be approved by 75 percent of lawmakers in both chambers. Even proposals with strong bipartisan backing haven’t been able to clear such a high bar.

“We’re simply not bringing in the money to fund schools,” said Gene Perry, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Policy Institute think tank. “We even had our Republican governor and many Republicans [in the legislature] saying and admitting that we have a revenue problem, but they don’t have that 75 percent supermajority to do it.”

The threat of a lasting school shutdown could change their calculus. As the success of the West Virginia teacher strike demonstrated, lawmakers can find money when they need to resolve a crisis and reopen schools ― even in a budget-strapped state. Several Oklahoma teachers who spoke to HuffPost said they were inspired by what they saw in Charleston, and that teachers from West Virginia have already reached out to offer advice on a shutdown.

Jernegan said she hopes it won’t come to that, but she’ll be ready if it does.

“I would love to be in my classroom teaching when that shutdown date comes,” Jernegan said. “We feel we’re giving [lawmakers] ample time to get it done. If not, they will be the ones responsible for shutting down our schools.”It seems that even a queen has to fight for equal pay.

Producers of the Netflix series “The Crown” admitted during an INTV conference panel that the show’s lead, Claire Foy, was paid less than Matt Smith, the actor playing her on-screen husband. Foy received an estimated $40,000 per episode for her award-winning portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, while Smith’s salary for playing Prince Philip is unreported.

Producers attributed the pay disparity to Smith’s name recognition after he rose to stardom as the title character on the British television series “Doctor Who.”

The show will not let it happen again, said Suzanne Mackie, creative director of the show’s production company, Left Bank.

“Going forward, no one gets paid more than the Queen,” Mackie said, according to Variety.

But that doesn’t help Foy, who won’t be returning to the show because it jumps forward in time in seasons three and four. “Broadchurch” alum Olivia Coleman will play the queen, and Smith’s replacement has yet to be named.

The 33-year-old Foy won a Golden Globe last year for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth and even earned the appreciation of the queen herself. Smith received no awards for his role on the show.Eduardo Munoz / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Only about half of the people who voted for President Donald Trump say it would be immoral if he had an affair with pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels. The other half say it is not immoral, or they are not sure, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey published Tuesday.

Three-quarters of Trump voters also contend that, even if Daniels’ allegations are true, they are not relevant to Trump’s presidency. In fact, they claim to be barely concerned about a president’s private life at all: Seventy percent say an elected official who has committed an “immoral act” in his or her personal life can still behave ethically and fulfill duties in the public and professional sphere.

Given what other accusations Trump has weathered thus far, an alleged consensual affair with a porn actress more than a decade ago may seem comparably tame. Daniels, an accomplished equestrian whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, claims she had a tryst with Trump starting in 2006, a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to Trump’s son, Barron. (A Playboy model, Karen McDougal, also claims to have had an affair with Trump around that time.) Trump has denied the allegations.

Daniels’ story received fresh attention following news reports that Trump’s attorney arranged a $130,000 payment to Daniels shortly before the 2016 election, which barred her from discussing the alleged sexual encounter. Such a payment, if intended to influence the election, may have run afoul of election laws. Daniels is currently fighting a legal battle to share her story publicly.

Some Trump supporters say the whole story is fake news: Only 20 percent say they find reports of the payment credible, while a mere 11 percent give credence to Daniels’ claim about the affair. Forty percent or more say they haven’t heard enough to weigh in on either question, or that they’re unsure about the allegations.

Comparatively, more than 80 percent of Hillary Clinton voters say they find each report credible. And though Democrats once sought to downplay former President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, 86 percent say that a Trump affair with Daniels would be immoral. Just below a quarter say that elected officials who act immorally in their personal lives can behave ethically in office.

Christian evangelicals, who helped power Trump to victory in 2016, have in recent years become more accepting of politicians who commit “immoral” acts in their personal lives. There are modest signs that Trump’s hold on some white evangelical women may be slipping, according a New York Times report on Sunday. But compared with the rest of the president’s base, his evangelical supporters appear only slightly more concerned about this latest scandal, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey.

About two-thirds of self-described evangelical or “born-again Christians” who voted for Trump say that it would be immoral if Trump had an affair with Daniels, compared to 40 percent of non-evangelical Trump voters. But few evangelical Trump voters say they consider the affair allegations credible, and nearly seven in 10 say that even if true, Daniels’ allegations aren’t relevant to Trump’s presidency.

More than half of all Trump voters don’t hesitate to say the phrase “moral leader” applies to the president very or extremely well.

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

Just weeks after President Donald Trump championed gun restrictions in a rambling televised appearance, he backpedaled on Monday, offering a gun plan that largely hews to the NRA’s orthodoxy and seemingly scraps his proposal to raise the buying age for some guns.

Trump shifted his position on age limits because they don’t have “much political support (to put it mildly),” he tweeted Monday.

But as far as the American public is concerned, Trump is ― to put it mildly ― incorrect. A HuffPost/YouGov poll taken soon after Trump’s initial comments shows that most of the nation, including much of the GOP, was willing to go along with many of the gun control measures he briefly supported.

Nearly 70 percent of the public, including most Republicans, favors raising the age for gun purchases from 18 to 21. About 80 percent of Americans polled favor strengthening background checks. Close to half even approve of Trump’s admonition to “take the guns first, go through due process second” when dealing with mentally ill people who could pose a threat.

Just 8 percent of all Americans polled near the start of the month said Trump was doing too much to pass new gun laws, while 34 percent said he was doing about the right amount, and 37 percent said he wasn’t doing enough. Just 12 percent of Republicans felt the president was going too far.

If Trump had stuck to his initial statements on guns, in other words, he could have done so without significant resistance from either his base or the country at large.

The findings also hint at a stark difference between gun polling today and polling during the Obama administration: Republicans are no longer especially afraid that the president will take their guns.

As former President Barack Obama began charting his course to the presidency, GOP support for gun control plummeted, thanks to rhetoric from the NRA that stoked fears about sweeping gun restrictions but often seemed disproportionate to the reforms Obama actually proposed.

In practice, that meant the mere mention of Obama’s name was enough to torpedo GOP support for otherwise popular gun policies. Near the end of Obama’s presidency, a HuffPost/YouGov poll divided respondents into two groups before asking them about gun proposals. For one group, the poll attributed the proposal to Obama; for the other, it omitted his name. Republicans’ support for background checks was a full 20 points lower when the poll mentioned Obama’s name.

The most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, which set up a similar experiment, found that Republicans’ opinions of several of the policies Trump espoused stayed about the same, whether the poll mentioned his name or not.

Eighty-five percent of Republicans told that Trump favored “strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns” said that they also favored doing so, as did a virtually identical 86 percent of those simply asked their opinion. In the control group, 61 percent of Republicans favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21; in the group with Trump’s name attached, a very similar 65 percent did.

For other questions, Trump’s name seemed to modestly help quell GOP opposition to gun measures. One group of Republicans were told that Trump, speaking about seizing guns from mentally ill people who could pose a threat, had said, “A lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures. Take the guns first, go through due process second.” They agreed, 59 percent to 27 percent. Those who saw the statement without attribution to Trump agreed by a more modest 52 percent to 40 percent.

Remarkably, when told that “President Trump has said former president Barack Obama did not do enough to pass new gun laws,” 48 percent of Republicans agreed. Absent the attribution to Trump, just under 40 percent did.

Democrats asked questions that mentioned Trump’s name were less likely to favor proposals attached to him than those who didn’t see him mentioned. But in both groups, three-quarters or more backed stronger background checks, and 70 percent or more favored raising the age to buy guns.

A 49 percent plurality of Democrats told that Trump had lambasted Obama’s record on guns insisted that Obama had done the right amount to pass new gun laws, with just 23 percent saying he hadn’t done enough. Democrats in the control group were apparently less on the defensive about their former president’s record ― 42 percent said Obama had done too little, and just 36 percent that he’d done the right amount.

Other polling on gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, found that while the rise in support for stricter gun laws wasn’t confined to Republicans, it included them. And in an earlier HuffPost/YouGov poll, 61 percent of Republicans said they viewed new gun restrictions as compatible with their Second Amendment rights, up from 42 percent as recently as last fall.

That movement may only be temporary. It’s certainly not universal ― gun groups like the NRA still hold significant political sway, and their membership reportedly spiked after Parkland, as it has during past shootings. But the latest polling suggests that, had Trump held on to his support for gun restrictions, he may have brought some members of his party along.

Here are some solid jokes (some of which aren’t Harry Potter-related but were too good not to include) that would even make Minerva McGonagall crack a smile:

Harry Potter and the End of a Vivid (yet prolonged) Hallucination pic.twitter.com/YCNFhR7qux — Lauren-A.B. (@urLABness) May 17, 2018When Jesse Tyler Ferguson is asked about the moment he first came out as gay, he immediately points to the time he was caught stealing porn.

“I would occasionally, you know, slip in a gay magazine into a reputable publication and then I would slip it under my shirt and I would exit the store,” the “Modern Family” star said in an interview for “Coming Out Stories,” a new video series produced by People and Entertainment Weekly.

Ferguson’s secret was safe ― that is, until his porn smuggling set off the alarm system at a book store in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Employees took the actor, who was then a freshman in high school, into the store’s back room before a police officer arrived and arrested him.

“My mom and dad had to come to the store, and they showed them the nature of the material that I was stealing, and that’s sort of how I came out,” he said.

Though Ferguson is able to laugh about it in retrospect, he added, “At the time, it was incredibly traumatizing. To have a person of the law actually say, ‘This is a shameful thing that you’ve done’ was really traumatizing.”

Harder, still, was the fact that Ferguson’s father wasn’t accepting of his son’s sexuality at first.

“I think I came out to him three times,” the actor said. His parents, he explained, “wanted my life to be easy. They were just scared that I was making things more difficult for myself.”

Things got better with time, however, and the elder Ferguson “danced at my [2013 wedding, to lawyer Justin Mikita] very happily.”Looks like someone is going to tie a “Just Married” sign to the back of their classic car.

Tom Jackson, a beloved contestant from Netflix’s “Queer Eye” revival, announced on Twitter Monday that he and his ex-wife Abby are going to give marriage another shot.

It’s official, Abby and I are engaged. What a Netflix special the would be. If the Fab 5 planned and attended our wedding!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/4KV4u9Rji4 — Tom Jackson (@TomJack20176306) March 13, 2018

He also posted a photo of the ring.

And despite Jackson blatantly pitching a special to Netflix, he does seem genuinely thankful for the help he got from the Fab 5, inviting each to be part of his wedding party.

Everyone is welcome to come to our wedding 👰. I’m praying that the Fab 5 can find time in their busy schedule to come. I’d love ❤️ for Bobby be best man, and the other 4 be my grooms men. Chandler will be my ring bearer. — Tom Jackson (@TomJack20176306) March 13, 2018

Jackson, who appeared on the first episode of the reboot, stole fans’ hearts with his unwavering devotion to his ex. During his episode, he proclaimed to Antoni Porowski, the show’s resident foodie: “I love Abby more than anything. I want to spend the rest of my life with her.”

At the end of the episode, after Jackson received a makeover, he and Abby went on a date to a classic car show and appeared to be rekindling their romance.

Last week, he announced on Twitter that after a brief breakup the two were back together — and now they’re engaged!Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) did not mince words Monday night when responding to President Donald Trump’s recent attack on her.

“Everybody knows who this bully is,” Waters told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. “This is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him ‘Don the Con Man.’”

Waters was responding to Trump’s insult of her during a political rally in western Pennsylvania on Saturday evening, in which he told a crowd of supporters that the congresswoman is “a very low IQ individual.”

Trump continued to attack Waters, mocking her calls for his impeachment.

Waters said she was not surprised at all by Trump’s Saturday evening comments.President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he had chosen Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel to run the agency while her boss, Mike Pompeo, replaces Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Haspel’s legacy is marked by her involvement in one of the CIA’s most controversial programs ― the torture of terror suspects in the early fight against al Qaeda.

As the head of a clandestine base in Thailand, Haspel oversaw the interrogation of Abd al-Rahim al Nashiri, according to several outlets, including The New York Times and ProPublica. The interrogation reportedly included techniques like waterboarding.

Another suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was also interrogated at the Thailand facility, although sources told those outlets Haspel had not been put in charge of the base yet when he was questioned. Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times in one month ― to the point that doctors once had to revive him ― and lost sight in one eye.

The torture sessions were videotaped, and Haspel also reportedly played a part in the tapes’ destruction in 2005. The CIA has disputed this, saying the decision fell to Haspel’s boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez.

CIA agents tortured terror suspects in black sites across the globe until former President Barack Obama ended the practice via executive order in 2009.

“Ms. Haspel’s background makes her unsuitable to serve as CIA director,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Tuesday. “Her nomination must include total transparency about this background, which I called for more than a year ago when she was appointed deputy director. If Ms. Haspel seeks to serve at the highest levels of U.S. intelligence, the government can no longer cover up disturbing facts from her past.”

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also expressed skepticism about Haspel, given her background. “Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process,” he said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who blocked Haspel’s promotion to acting head of the agency’s clandestine service in 2013 for her involvement in the torture program, refused to make her stance clear on Tuesday.

“Well, I have spent some time with her, we’ve had dinner together, we have talked ... everything I know is, is that she has been a good deputy director of the CIA,” Feinstein said. “I think hopefully the entire organization learned something from the so-called enhanced interrogation program. I think it’s something that can’t be forgotten. And I certainly can never forget it. And I won’t let any director forget it.”

Several congressional Democrats also rejected Haspel’s nomination to deputy director last year.

“I am especially concerned by reports that this individual was involved in the unauthorized destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes, which documented the CIA’s use of torture against two CIA detainees,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said last February. “My colleagues Senators Wyden and Heinrich have stated that classified information details why the newly appointed Deputy Director is ‘unsuitable’ for the position and have requested that this information be declassified. I join their request.”

A CIA spokesperson said the story was wrong but did not comment further.

Haspel’s likely promotion reflects Pompeo’s and Trump’s sympathetic approach to torture. Trump has said he wants to bring back waterboarding. Pompeo said he would consider reinstating it, although he couldn’t imagine that Trump would ask him to.

This post has been updated with statements from Feinstein, McCain and Wyden, as well as comment from the CIA.

Caleb Baca photographed Biden speaking to a homeless person outside of a Washington-area movie theater last week.

The image went viral after being shared on Facebook by D.C. businessman Paul Equale.

“Character is about what you do when no one is watching,” Equale wrote:

“I’m not exactly sure what he gave the homeless man, but he appeared to write something down on a piece of paper inside the movie theater, which he then proceeded to give the homeless man outside,” Baca told FOX 5 in Washington.

The image drew widespread praise on Twitter for Biden, who is reportedly considering a 2020 presidential run:

And this is why, despite his age, @JoeBiden would make a formidable candidate for Democrats.

Bear (@democraticbear) March 12, 2018Lynda Carter on the "Wonder Woman" set on Jan. 22, 1977. ABC Photo Archives via Getty Images

The original “Wonder Woman” actress, Lynda Carter, recently told The Daily Beast she’s still coping with trauma from a sexual abuse she endured years ago.

“He’s already being done in. There’s no advantage in piling on again,” Carter told Tim Teeman in an interview published Monday.

Although Carter refused to divulge the name of her abuser, she said he’s being punished for his crimes ― although “it isn’t enough.” According to Carter, her abuser violated “a lot of people.”

She told The Daily Beast that she had initially researched pursuing legal action, but later came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t help.

“I can’t add anything to it. I wish I could,” Carter said of the justice her abuser has faced. “But there’s nothing legally I could add to it, because I looked into it. I’m just another face in the crowd. I wish I could, and if I could I would.”

Carter said she didn’t want to shift the focus of the conversation to her. “I don’t want it to be about me, it’s not about me. It’s about him being a scumbag,” she said.

Carter said it’s been very powerful watching the Me Too movement unfold ― albeit somewhat triggering.

“I asked my husband if he was surprised by all the #MeToo stories. ‘Yeah, I’m surprised,’ he said,” Carter told The Daily Beast. “Ask any woman, they’re not surprised. It’s been going on for years. It’s not news to us [women], but it is news to you [men]. We’ve been trying to tell you. We’ve been trying to tell you for a long time and you haven’t listened.”

Carter said she experienced sexual harassment on the “Wonder Woman” set, including a cameraman who secretly drilled a hole in her dressing room to watch her change.

“They caught him, fired him, and drummed him out of the business,” she said.

She said that the punishment for her harasser was quite an anomaly at the time, adding later that she rarely reported the workplace harassment and abuse she faced.

“Who are you going to tell? Who you are going to tell except your girlfriends and your circle of friends? You’d say or hear, ‘Stay away from that guy.’ ‘Watch out for this casting director.’ And so you would hear it from other people, other people would hear it from other people. ‘Watch out for so and so,’” Carter said. “That’s how you protected yourself: through the grapevine. We were women’s lib, burn the bra. We weren’t going to take any shit from people. So we felt strong in that, but there were still not a lot of parts for us.”

Carter added that she believes “every woman” in the Bill Cosby case and she believes the 21 women who have come forward with accusations of sexual harassment and assault against President Donald Trump.

“Why would they lie?” she asked. “I believe the women.”Ivanka Trump’s permanent government security clearance seems to be twisting in the wind, like her husband’s. That may be because she continues pulling in $1.5 million a year from the family business, the Trump Organization, even as she travels internationally representing the U.S. as a White House adviser, McClatchy reports.

Her dual role as adviser to the president and private business executive raises red flags concerning conflicts of interest. Ethics experts say the conflict raises the possibility that public policy could be affected by what works best for Trump’s bottom line, or that countries may offer business deals in exchange for access and favored treatment by the U.S. government.

Early in her father’s presidency, the first daughter dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at her father’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on the same day China approved three new trademarks for Ivanka Trump Marks LLC.

Ivanka Trump stepped aside as vice president of companies in the Trump Organization, yet she continues to be an owner. According to her financial disclosure filing, she reported that she receives $1.5 million annually from three companies within the Trump Organization, McClatchy reported. The payments included $800,000 from TTT Consulting, $600,000 from TTT Venture, and $100,000 from T International Reality.

The companies are involved in at least five international projects that are raising ethics concern, according to McClatchy. They include a Chinese government contract to build a road at a Trump development in Dubai, and a plan by another contractor partly owned by the Saudi Arabian government to build a Trump development there.

Donald Trump, along with Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner, have failed to divest themselves from their private businesses, radically breaking with tradition. They have stepped aside from day-to-day management of their companies, but maintain financial ties and refuse to release tax returns that could reveal conflicts of interest.

Kushner was stripped of his top-secret security clearance last month. Ivanka Trump appears to still have an interim clearance, according to McClatchy.

Trump’s eldest son, Donald Jr., who has no formal government job, made $15 million in real estate sales in a Trump Towers project in India, where he planned to deliver a “foreign policy speech” last month alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After critics complained, Trump dropped the policy speech.

The president promised at the start of his term that he would sign no new foreign business deals in office, but his company has.

Ivanka Trump “transitioned from being an active investor and manager to being merely a passive investor,” based on “ethics advice she received,” said a spokesman for an attorney representing Kushner and his wife.

Common Cause has launched a petition calling for Ivanka Trump and Kushner to divest their assets, establish a blind trust or recuse themselves from much of their government work.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday tweeted that he is replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, minutes after The Washington Post first reported that he had ousted Tillerson on Friday. Addressing reporters at the State Department Tuesday afternoon, a sullen Tillerson said that Trump had called him at noon, more than three hours after the president’s tweet.

Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018

The White House said Trump asked Tillerson to step down on Friday so the president could have a “new team in place” for an upcoming meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

But a State Department spokesman told CNN that Tillerson found out about his firing when Trump announced it on Twitter on Tuesday.

According to a statement that followed Trump’s announcement, Tillerson ”had every intention of staying,” the State Department said. “The Secretary did not speak to the President and is unaware of the reason.”

The State Department official who contradicted the White House on Tillerson’s firing was also fired, The Associated Press reported.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he “made that decision by myself” to remove Tillerson, and noted that “Rex, as you know, was not in this country” at the time. He alluded to their disagreements, saying, “we were not thinking the same,” and predicted, “Rex will be happier now.”

Tillerson cut short a trip to Africa, returning to Washington Monday night. Reporters traveling with him said that they had no idea the secretary of state had been fired on Friday.

Trump announced that he plans to nominate Gina Haspel, now deputy CIA director, to replace Pompeo as head of the spy agency.

Most of Trump’s statement focused on Pompeo. He mentioned Tillerson at the end.

“A great deal has been accomplished over the last fourteen months, and I wish him and his family well,” Trump said.

Notably missing from initial Trump administration statements on the secretary of state was anything from Tillerson himself. The ousted secretary of state didn’t make his own statement until Tuesday afternoon, when he announced at the State Department that he would officially exit on March 31.

Other than noting his phone call with the president, Tillerson did not mention or thank Trump in his remarks.

Just a day ago, Tillerson made a statement holding Russia responsible for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, putting him at odds with the White House, which did not single out Russia.

Tillerson’s departure comes amid reports of his disappointment with the turbulent atmosphere in Trump’s White House, as well as mounting criticism of his performance as the country’s leading diplomat and his drastic reduction of civil servant positions at the State Department.

His job security had always seemed precarious, but on Nov. 30, The New York Times reported that the White House was considering forcing out Tillerson and replacing him with Pompeo.

The White House and State Department pushed back on the report, but that day, neither Trump nor White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would definitively say whether the president had confidence in Tillerson.

“He’s here. Rex is here,” Trump told reporters.

“When the president loses confidence in somebody, they’ll no longer be here,” Sanders said at that day’s White House press briefing.

Trump and Tillerson’s relationship has long been filled with tension. Tillerson reportedly considered resigning after Trump’s widely criticized speech to the Boy Scouts of America in July.

On Oct. 4, NBC News reported that Tillerson called Trump “a moron” during a meeting with top officials over the summer.

Following the report, Tillerson held an unusual press conference, in which he showered Trump with praise, affirming that the president is “smart.”

Notably, he did not dispute whether he called Trump “a moron,” leaving that job to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, who claimed that “the secretary does not use that type of language.”

Attacking the reporting as “phony,” Trump later said he appreciated Tillerson’s comments and that he had “total confidence in Rex.”

But less than a week later, he suggested in a Forbes magazine interview that if the story were true, he should “compare IQ tests” with Tillerson.

“And I can tell you who is going to win,” he added.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed Trump’s comment was “a joke” and said that he “never implied that the secretary of state was not incredibly intelligent.”

Trump has repeatedly undermined Tillerson’s diplomatic efforts in attempting to quell North Korea’s nuclear aggression, with the two men often contradicting each other and the president lambasting Tillerson on Twitter.

I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017

Tillerson’s days as secretary of state seemed numbered from the start.

A government outsider lacking diplomatic experience, he arrived at Foggy Bottom after decades at Exxon Mobil Corp., rising from engineer in 1975 to chairman and CEO in 2006, overseeing vast expansion of the company’s operations worldwide.

Trump picked Tillerson for the State Department job after a lengthy public vetting of prominent candidates, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Tillerson faced opposition during his Senate confirmation process, with lawmakers expressing concerns over his lack of experience in government and diplomacy, and strong ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin from years of business in the country.

Even Tillerson himself had been reluctant to accept the position. “I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,” he admitted to the conservative news outlet Independent Journal Review in March.

“My wife told me I’m supposed to do this,” he responded when an aide asked him why he accepted the position anyway.

Once in office, Tillerson sought to reorganize the State Department and prioritize its activities toward business and security. He publicly illustrated the pivot after weeks on the job, opting to skip the presentation of the department’s annual human rights report.

During his tenure, the department faced drastic budget cuts and a crucial leadership vacuum. Amid massive international challenges like North Korea’s nuclear arms race and the war in Syria, Trump proposed cutting the State Department budget by nearly one-third. Dozens of vacancies remained unfilled, including top deputies, because of White House refusal to accept Tillerson’s picks.

Tillerson and the White House also clashed on policy and messaging.

As a diplomatic crisis in Qatar unfolded, Trump directly undermined Tillerson’s calls for calm, expressing support for Saudi Arabia’s economic and diplomatic blockade of the Gulf state, and accusing Qatar of funding terrorism.

In an August interview, Tillerson declined to defend Trump’s support for “America’s values,” telling Fox News that “the president speaks for himself.” The questioning arose during a conversation about Trump’s much criticized response to violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier that month, when counterprotesters clashed with hate groups protesting the planned removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

From the White House, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, often ran a parallel track of diplomacy ― traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories to explore ways to revive peace talks, and interacting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.

Sources told CNN in July that Tillerson was becoming increasingly frustrated with the White House. In late August, Axios reported that Trump was losing patience with his secretary of state, in part because key roles at the department still remained unfilled more than eight months into Trump’s presidency. A State Department spokesperson told Axios that Tillerson was working to fill the vacancies but that the White House was effectively sitting on his recommendations.

Nauert had repeatedly insisted Tillerson was not considering resignation. Asked if a July vacation indicated Tillerson wanted to step away from the spotlight, Nauert said the secretary was “just taking a little time off” after that month’s G-20 summit.

Tillerson, like Trump, wasn’t a fan of reporters’ questions, doing away with the State Department’s daily briefing and limiting media access during his foreign travels.

He said he wasn’t “a big media press-access person,” when he allowed just one journalist ― a reporter from the Independent Journal Review ― to accompany him on a visit to South Korea. The move backfired. American journalists were unable to challenge an embarrassing report in the Korea Herald that the secretary had canceled a dinner with South Korean officials because he was fatigued.

Tillerson is just the latest to step down in the Trump administration. In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign, after he used taxpayer-funded private jets on numerous occasions.

National security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to step down in February following revelations that he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador before Trump’s inauguration.

On May 9, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the presidential election.

Mike Dubke, White House communications director, resigned later in May after months of chaos in the press shop. Press secretary Sean Spicer quit in July, after the president appointed Anthony Scaramucci as the new communications director. Scaramucci resigned after just 10 days, amid a spate of departures that included White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and, less than a month later, chief strategist Steve Bannon.
