USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez was banned from the sport on Tuesday night following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.

Lopez, 44, is accused of sexually assaulting four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997, according to a report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport obtained by NPR. He had a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct” and allegedly used his authority as a coach to “groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes,” the report states.

“Given the number of incidents reported over a span of several years and by multiple reporting parties, most of whom have no reasonable motive to fabricate an allegation ― much less multiple, distinct incidents ― of misconduct, the totality of the circumstances clearly shows a recurrent pattern of behavior on the part of Jean,” reads another part of the report, according to USA Today.

Lopez coached the U.S. Olympic taekwondo team between 2004 and 2016, through four Olympic games. Most notably, he coached his younger brother Steven Lopez, 39, the most decorated and best-known American athlete in the sport. Steven Lopez ― who won two Olympic gold medals, a bronze medal and five world championships ― has separately been accused of rape by two women.

HuffPost reached out to both Jean and Steven Lopez for comment but did not immediately hear back from either. Both men have previously denied all allegations against them.

Jean Lopez also trained two other younger siblings, Diana and Mark Lopez, who competed on the Olympic level as well.

The former coach was declared “permanently ineligible” as of April 3, according to SafeSport’s website. Permanently ineligible is defined by SafeSport as “permanently prohibited from participating in any capacity in any activity or competition authorized by, organized by, or under the auspices of the United States Olympic Committee, the national governing bodies recognized by the USOC, and/or a Local Affiliated Organization of a national governing body recognized by the USOC.”

A spokesperson for SafeSport declined to comment further on Lopez’s ineligibility.

Heidi Gilbert, a former taekwondo fighter who trained under Lopez, told NPR that he had sexually assaulted her after she won a gold medal in the Pan American Games in Ecuador in 2002, when she was 19. Gilbert said Lopez drugged and assaulted her again a year later while the two were in Germany for the World Championships.

“I am relieved and excited that he will no longer be able to coach young athletes or manipulate girls in these kinds of settings,” Gilbert told USA Today, adding that she’s still “highly disappointed” that the process took so long to penalize Lopez.

Another elite taekwondo fighter, Mandy Meloon, filed a formal complaint against Lopez with USA Taekwondo in 2006. According to Meloon, Lopez inappropriately touched her in 1997 when she was underage while the two were traveling internationally for a competition.

Meloon was also in a long-term relationship with Steven Lopez and claims that he physically abused and raped her multiple times.

USA Taekwondo opened an investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Jean and Steven Lopez three years ago, but little was done. Both brothers were allowed to participate in the 2016 Rio Olympics. It wasn’t until the two cases were handed over to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in March of last year that action was taken. SafeSport declined to comment on the current status of Steven Lopez’s case, according to NPR.

Steve McNally, the executive director of USA Taekwondo, declined to comment about the allegations against Jean Lopez. He told HuffPost, “Unfortunately we can’t comment beyond what’s been published on our suspension list at this time. As the decision is still subject to appeal it would be inappropriate to comment further until due process is concluded.”Ji-Sub Jeong and Jessica Prois/HuffPost

Women in China are covertly resisting government crackdowns on discussions over their Me Too movement with a clever workaround.

The phrase “rice bunny” (米兔), pronounced as “mi tu,” has popped up on social media networks after censors removed posts that mentioned sexual harassment or the hashtag #MeToo. While those phrases are heavily monitored, Rice Bunny isn’t.

In addition to the rice and bunny emojis, social media users also use the phrase in popular hashtags #米兔不能忘# (“Rice Bunny Never Forget”) and #米兔在中国# (“Rice Bunny In China”). Social media users have used them in campaigns, forums and various accounts on platforms like Weibo and WeChat to discuss topics such as opportunity inequality, domestic violence and sexual harassment. The new phrase is harder for censors to follow, as “rice” and “bunny” are both common enough words that banning them from a platform would be too difficult.

One recent post on Weibo that uses the hashtags calls on others to stand up to gender inequality, fight discrimination and violence, and criticizes the censoring of feminist messages, according to a HuffPost translation. Another post shows a woman holding a sign that reads, “The fight against sexual harassment is far more important than shopping.”

The feminist movement in China experienced a resurgence in the past few years, particularly among the younger generations, oftentimes drawing influence from Western countries. But the rise of feminism has amplified the country’s complicated relationship with gender equality.

Women in China, particularly from urban areas, have seen considerable job mobility in recent decades in certain industries like tech. Almost 80 percent of companies have women in top positions, according to The Atlantic. To compare, about half of U.S. tech companies employ women in such spots. And in December 2015, the country passed its first legislation against domestic violence ― a landmark law for China.

But much like the slew of other social and political movements, like the 2014 Umbrella Revolution and the pro-democracy protests of 2011, feminism has been met with resistance from the government. In one of the most high-profile cases, Beijing police arrested and detained five gender equality activists, known as the “Feminist Five,” in 2015 for planning to stage protests against sexual harassment.

The #MeToo movement in China was largely inspired by Luo Xixi, a former student who shared an online essay describing being sexually assaulted by Chen Xiaowu, a professor at Beihang University. Chen was quickly fired after Luo’s piece went viral and an investigation found he’d had a history of sexual harassment. Her piece prompted lengthy debates about sexual harassment on Weibo and other online platforms.

Since then, however, popular Weibo accounts #MeToo and Feminist Voices have been suspended several times due to their criticism of gender inequality in Chinese society. Profiles and hashtags on Chinese social media continue to be monitored and frequently taken down. Yet with the shutdown of each profile, new ones under different monikers are launched. The creative Rice Bunny hashtags are just another example of the resilience inside China’s feminist movement.

“Chinese women feel very unequal every day of their lives, and the government cannot make women oblivious to the deep injustice they feel,” Lu Pin, the founding editor of Feminist Voices, told NPR after the account was put on a 30-day ban. “The feminist movement is about building a community to address women’s everyday concerns.”

In the past, activists have used wordplay to both avoid China’s censorship and even criticize it. In 2009, social media users used “grass-mud horse” ― a phrase that’s pronounced similarly to the Chinese words for “fuck your mother” ― to convey opposition to internet censorship. “River crab,” which is pronounced similarly to the Chinese phrase for harmony, became a euphemism for censorship itself. Online users who’d been censored could tell others that their posts had been “harmonized.”Mother’s Day isn’t just about celebrating the woman who gave birth to you.

Carter, 66, was all smiles as the star was unveiled in a ceremony on Tuesday in Los Angeles, where she posed with friends, family and Patty Jenkins, director of the most recent “Wonder Woman” film.

Carter explained how much the honor means to her in an Instagram post.

“It seems impossible that I’ve been in the entertainment industry for 50 years. But I love this business ― I love the creative process, the work, the performing ... all of it,” she wrote, adding a big thank you to her fans. “This is a day I will never forget.”

Carter starred in the 1970s CBS TV series “Wonder Woman” as the fictional Amazon superhero Diana Prince for three seasons.

“I guess if there’s ever a role that was meant for me, it was ‘Wonder Woman’,” Carter told Variety.

Actress Gal Gadot, who played Diana Prince in the 2017 film adaptation of the character, congratulated Carter on her star.

“Congrats my beloved beautiful @RealLyndaCarter for receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,” Gadot wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for your loving kindness shared by the sisterhood of women of wonder.”

Carter, who has long been an advocate for the rights of women and LGBTQ people, recently revealed her own Me Too story about sexual abuse that she endured on the 1970s set of “Wonder Woman.”

“They caught him, fired him, and drummed him out of the business,” she told The Daily Beast of her attacker. “I asked my husband if he was surprised by all the #MeToo stories,” Carter continued. ”‘Yeah, I’m surprised,’ he said. Ask any woman, they’re not surprised. It’s been going on for years. It’s not news to us [women], but it is news to you [men]. We’ve been trying to tell you. We’ve been trying to tell you for a long time and you haven’t listened.” Carter added in the same interview that she believes “every woman” who has accused Bill Cosby, and believes the 21 women who have come forward with accusations of sexual harassment and assault against President Donald Trump.

The three-time Oscar winner will play Mary Louise Wright, the mother of Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgård), who comes to Monterey “concerned for the well-being of her grandchildren.” Her character is also apparently on a “search for answers” about her son’s death, but from the looks of the photo above, she’s got to do some quality iPad-watching in her jammies before she can get any sleuthing done.

This is the second sneak peek of the award-winning HBO series’ next season to be posted to Instagram. In March, Reese Witherspoon posted a picture of her character, Madeline, and Renata (Laura Dern) hanging out in front of Seaside Coffee Shop. It was unclear what their characters were doing, but fingers crossed that they were possibly plotting how to cover up a MURDER.Oh, the joys of motherhood.

Kim Kardashian posted her first-ever photo of her family of five — including their baby girl, Chicago — on Instagram Wednesday. At first glance, it looks like a perfectly nice family photo.

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 4, 2018 at 4:08pm PDT

But, to quote Kardashian’s former fashion muse, the unappreciated philosopher Cher Horowitz from 1995’s “Clueless,” it’s “a full-on Monet.”

The reality star hinted in her caption on Instagram that the picturesque photo was actually a nightmare to take.

“I don’t think you really understand how hard it is to take a good family pic,” the mother of three wrote. “This was all we got before all three kids started crying. I think I cried too.”

On Twitter, the 37-year-old proceeded to point out some photographic evidence of the chaos that came with snapping the pic. For instance, look closely at Kardashian’s 2-year-old son, Saint.

Kardashian offered some behind-the-scenes insight into how she wrangled him for the photo:

In January 2007, Adam Carolla broadcast his radio show, “The Adam Carolla Show,” live from the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Among the various guests that day was none other than our country’s most aggressively online son, Donald Trump Jr., who took the opportunity to talk about his dick, his father’s dick, how the two compare, and just how much of a hardship it is to be surrounded by Playboy Playmates when you have a pregnant wife in tow.

The since-forgotten segment, which appears to have been taken offline but was preserved by the Internet Archive, lasts a little over 13 minutes and covers a number of topics.

Some highlights:

On his predicament

Trump Jr.: Can you believe the hell I’m going through? I’m at the Playboy Mansion with a pregnant wife! It doesn’t get worse than that, does it? Now, I love my wife, but that is rough. And I’m going to pay for these statements later on tonight. I’m gonna pay.

On Melania’s age

Host: Donald, your pregnant wife is chatting up Melania, your stepmother. What is the age gap between those two?

Trump Jr.: Much closer than most would ever guesstimate. Probably about five years, six years.

Host: Which one’s older?

Trump Jr.: My wife.

[crowd boos]

Trump Jr.: No, I’m just kidding.

On coal miners

Host: Question one: Did you always plan to follow in your father’s footsteps, meaning become a billionaire and bone hot chicks?

Trump Jr.: I think the answer to that is an obvious yes. [Sarcastically] No, I wanted to go to work in a coal mine.

On Miss USA

Host: Number two: Did you ever have sex with Miss USA?

Trump Jr.: Which one?

[Hosts shout]

Trump Jr.: I’m just kidding, baby!

On Melania’s hotness:

Host: Are you attracted to your stepmother?

Trump Jr.: I think she’s a very lovely lady.

On his inheritance:

Host: And the last one is: Have you ever thought about killing your dad for his money?

Trump Jr.: Well, you know…

Host: That’s a yes.

On whether he or his dad has the larger penis:

Host: I got one question, Donald Jr.: When you and your pops are in the shower, who’s got the bigger package? You know what I’m saying.

Trump Jr.: You know, and I will get fired for this, but I’m never going to say that I don’t. I will get fired for that. By the way, they’re both pretty substantial I think.

Trump Jr. has most recently been in the news for “liking” a tweet that smeared Parkland massacre survivor David Hogg, and for the fact that his wife, Vanessa Trump, recently filed for divorce.The risk of depression and suicide for transgender youths drops dramatically when they’re allowed to use their chosen name, a new study found.

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin asked 129 transgender young people ages 15 to 21 whether they were able to use their chosen name at work, school, home and with friends for a study published in the Journal for Adolescent Health. The subjects were from various ethnic backgrounds, and were located in three U.S. cities, in the Northeast, Southwest and West Coast.

Kids who could use their chosen name at work, school, home and with friends experienced 71 percent less symptoms of severe depression, 34 percent less reported thoughts of suicide, and a 65-percent reduction in suicidal attempts, compared with peers who could not use their chosen name, the study found.

“Many kids who are transgender have chosen a name that is different than the one that they were given at birth,” co-author Stephen T. Russell, the university’s chair of human development and family science, said in a press release. “We showed that the more contexts or settings where they were able to use their preferred name, the stronger their mental health was.”

Allowing youths to use their chosen name at home, school, work, and with friends also helped affirm their gender identity, Russell said.

The study showed a positive effect on kids who could use their chosen name even in one those places, with a 29-percent decrease in suicidal thoughts, compared with peers who couldn’t use their chosen name.

Suicidal thoughts and attempts are far too common in the transgender community. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute found that 41 percent of transgender individuals attempt to take their own lives at some point, compared with 4.6 percent of the general public.

Additionally, The Williams Institute of UCLA found in 2014 that suicide attempts were highest among young adults aged 18 to 24 ― an age group that overlaps that studied in the new UT Austin research. The Williams study also found that transgender adults thought about suicide 14 times more than those in the general population, and were 22 times more likely to attempt it.

“I’ve been doing research on LGBT youth for almost 20 years now, and even I was surprised by how clear that link was,” Russell said in the press release. He added that it’s not only practical to “support young people in using the name that they choose,” but “it’s respectful and developmentally appropriate.”

The research suggests that allowing transgender people to use their preferred name or pronoun is a simple way to promote better mental health amid a politically charged climate of bathroom laws and bans on transgender troops.

AdvertisementCARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro faced fresh international censure on Monday after re-election in a vote foes denounced as a farce cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation.

The 55-year-old successor to former president Hugo Chavez hailed his win as a victory against “imperialism,” but his main rival refused to recognize the result alleging irregularities.

Thousands of Maduro supporters, many wearing red berets, hugged and danced outside the Miraflores presidential palace as the results came in, under confetti in the yellow, blue and red colors of the Venezuelan national flag.

“The revolution is here to stay!” a jubilant Maduro told the crowd, promising to prioritize economic recovery after five years of recession in the nation of 30 million people.

“Let’s go, Nico!” his supporters chanted until after midnight during party scenes in downtown Caracas.

“We mustn’t cave to any empire, or go running to the International Monetary Fund as Argentina did. The opposition must leave us alone to govern,” said government supporter Ingrid Sequera, 51, wearing a T-shirt with a logo of Chavez’s eyes.

Declaring Sunday’s vote a “sham,” the United States is now threatening sanctions on Venezuela’s all-important oil sector, which is already reeling from falling output, a brain-drain and creaking infrastructure.

The European Union and major Latin Americans repeatedly warned in advance that conditions were unfair.

Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera was scathing about Sunday’s vote. “Venezuela’s elections do not meet minimum standards of true democracy,” he said. “Like most major democratic nations, Chile does not recognize these elections.”

Panama’s government followed suit, quickly saying it would not recognize the result. But fellow leftist-run nations Cuba and El Salvador sent congratulations.

MADURO’S ADVANTAGES

Venezuela’s mainstream opposition boycotted the vote, given that two of its most popular leaders were barred, authorities had banned the coalition and various of its parties from using their names, and the election board is run by Maduro loyalists.

The government used ample state resources during the campaign and pressure was put on state workers to vote.

The election board said Maduro took 5.8 million votes, versus 1.8 million for his chief challenger Henri Falcon, a former governor who broke with the boycott to stand.

Turnout at the election was 46 percent, it said, way down from the 80 percent at the last presidential vote in 2013.

Falcon called for a new vote, complaining about the government’s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called “red spots” close to polling stations nationwide.

Mainly poor Venezuelans were asked to scan state-issued “fatherland cards” at red tents after voting in hope of receiving a “prize” promised by Maduro.

The “fatherland cards” are required to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers.

Maduro now faces a colossal task to turn around Venezuela’s moribund economy and offered no specifics on reforming two decades of state-led policies. The bolivar currency is down 99 percent over the past year and inflation is at an annual 14,000 percent, according to the National Assembly.

Furthermore, Venezuela’s multiple creditors are considering accelerating claims on unpaid foreign debt, while oil major ConocoPhillips has been taking aggressive action to seize state oil company PDVSA’s assets over a 2007 nationalization.

Though increasingly shunned in the West, Maduro can at least count on the support of major powers China and Russia, who have provided billions of dollars’ funding in recent years.

In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed the Venezuelan government and people could handle their own affairs and that everyone should respect the choice of the Venezuelan people.

Asked if China had sent congratulations to Maduro, he said China would “handle this in accordance with diplomatic convention”, but did not elaborate.

Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a strident critic of Maduro, urged isolation of his government and said he supported “all policy options” to return Venezuela to democracy.Hillary Clinton called out President Donald Trump and Fox News over their obsession with her nearly a year and a half after the election.

“When he can’t think of anything to say, Trump starts chanting it and you sit there and you think, ‘Does he think I was elected?’” she said Tuesday. “I said something publicly a few months ago, Fox News is always trying to impeach me, so someone needs to tell them that it doesn’t apply to a private citizen.”

Clinton was speaking at a Wing workspace panel discussion in New York, where she took on a wide range of issues, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and the tone of today’s politics.

“I would hope that we can change the political culture,” she said. “Because I don’t want anybody going through that. I don’t care who you are. I don’t care how much I agree or disagree with you. To be lied about persistently, to be vilified is very harmful.”

But it was her comments about Trump and Fox News that quickly became even more fodder for the network.

“Fox & Friends First” slammed her early Wednesday.

“HILLARY AT IT AGAIN,” read a message on the show’s Twitter feed. “The failed presidential nominee going on yet another post-election rant against President Trump, Putin, & Fox News.”

The show also hit back at her on the air.

“Well it’s been 512 days since Hillary Clinton was historically defeated by President Trump, yet she is still speaking her mind about how she believes America got it all wrong, of course,” snarked co-host Jackie Ibanez on the air.

Later in the morning, “Fox & Friends” also took on Clinton, wondering if her comments would hurt Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections.

Sean Hannity’s website posted a summary of her comments in the afternoon under the headline “HILLARY UNHINGED: Clinton Says FOX NEWS is Trying to ‘IMPEACH’ Her.”

And by evening, “The Five” was still fixated.

“I don’t even know what to say about her anymore. I really don’t,” Jesse Watters said, according to Mediaite. “We’ve run out of things to say about her.”

Maybe they haven’t.He’s back!

Comedian Mike Myers resurrected his Dr. Evil character on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” and announced that he was recently fired by President Donald Trump.

Now that he’s been let loose, however, Dr. Evil is ready to dish some dirt. In fact, he’s claiming to be responsible for all of Trump’s most evil ideas.

“Even deporting dreamers?” host Jimmy Fallon asked.

“No, Jimmy, even I have my limits,” Dr. Evil replied. “I’m evil, but I’m not a monster.”AOL

(Reuters) - Department store chain Sears Holding Corp and Delta Air Lines Inc said on Wednesday some of their customer payment information may have been exposed in a cybersecurity breach at software service provider [ 24]7.ai.

Sears said it was notified of the incident in mid-March and the incident led to unauthorized access to the credit card information of under 100,000 of its customers.

Technology firm [ 24]7.ai, which provides online support services for Delta, Sears and Kmart among other companies, found that a cybersecurity incident affected online customer payment information of its clients, it said.

The incident happened on or after Sept. 26, 2017 and was found and resolved on Oct. 12, the company said.

Personal details related to passport, government identification, security and SkyMiles information were not impacted, Delta said.

The No. 2 U.S. carrier said while a small subset of its customers would have had their information exposed, it cannot be said with certainty if their information was accessed and compromised.Black students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School hold a press conference on March 28, 2018, in Parkland, Florida. ABC News

Black students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are calling out the March for Our Lives movement ― at once commending the teens leading it for their efforts to be inclusive and pushing them to go a step further by sharing the spotlight with their own black peers.

“We’re saying you don’t see much of us at the forefront,” 17-year-old junior Mei-Ling Ho-Shing, who is black, told HuffPost earlier this week.

Still, some black students at the school in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people in February, contend that the student activists haven’t quite practiced this inclusivity in their own backyards, and have not gone far enough to include black teens from their own school, and nearby areas where gun violence is more prevalent, at the center of their movement.

“It hurts, because they went all the way to Chicago to hear these voices when we’re right here,” Ho-Shing said, referring to a gathering last month where March for Our Lives leaders met with teens of color from a Chicago school to discuss gun violence. “We go to school with you every day.”

“David Hogg, we’re proud of him, but he mentioned he was going to use his white privilege to be the voice for black communities, and we’re kind of sitting there like, ‘You know there are Stoneman Douglas students who could be that voice,’” Ho-Shing told HuffPost.

At a press conference last week, around half a dozen black students from the high school, including Ho-Shing, gathered to say that the media and their peers weren’t sufficiently hearing their perspectives.

“We feel like people within the movement have definitely addressed racial disparity, but haven’t adequately taken action to counteract that racial disparity,” Tyah-Amoy Roberts, a junior who also spoke at the press conference, told Refinery29. She noted that March for Our Lives leaders had not invited her to meetings. “They’ve been saying, but they haven’t been doing,” she said.

After last week’s press conference, Ho-Shing said González had reached out to talk, but as of earlier this week, there were still no specific plans to meet, exchange ideas or join forces.

HuffPost reached out to March for Our Lives, but did not receive a response as of this posting.

Black students at Stoneman Douglas have a key perspective to add to the March For Our Lives movement, partly because many of them don’t live in the largely white, affluent and safe area around the school, Ho-Shing noted. In many cases, they have intimate connections, through family and friends, with communities of color that more commonly suffer from gun violence.

“The problem [is] with having the leadership at the forefront having the same experience growing up in a neighborhood that’s safe and wealthy, where gun violence is not,” said Ho-Shing, who lives in the nearby town of Coconut Creek, where the median household income is less than half that of Parkland’s. While she hasn’t experienced gun violence herself, she has family and grew up going to church in nearby North Lauderdale, where it is a significant issue.

“We just want to share the mic,” she added.

Ho-Shing and her peers of color also recognize their own relative privilege as teens attending a school that has gotten significant public attention, as well as resources like therapy dogs and social workers, since the shooting. They are hoping to extend their platform to other black and brown teens in surrounding areas, like Miami’s Liberty City, who face gun violence on a more regular basis.

“We’re unlucky that this happened to us, but ... we’re only experts of Feb. 14, in fourth period,” Ho-Shing said, referring to the time of the Parkland shooting. “Our friends and family at other schools are scared, and maybe only have one social worker. We can’t sit there and listen to that and be OK with it.”

Ho-Shing and others say the news media has played a significant role in elevating the platforms of the largely nonblack leaders of March for Our Lives while leaving out the voices of their black peers. She noted that major news features, like the Time Magazine cover or “60 Minutes” interview, had not included black students.

“You can’t blame them for how big they got,” Ho-Shing said of her now-famous peers. “We’re definitely going to start talking to them, because this is not a divisive thing.”

While Ho-Shing felt it was a shame that black students had needed a press conference to be heard by media and the movement leaders at their school, she was confident her peers would be more inclusive moving forward.There are 11 states with voter registration deadlines in April for the 2018 primaries.

In general, midterm primary elections have less voter turnout than the years where a presidential election is taking place. Midterm participation has regularly dropped in trends that date back to the 1840s, the Pew Research Center reports.

More than twice as many women are running for Congress this year than in 2016, NPR reported in February. And teenage activists have pushed for young voters to drive out politicians supported by the National Rifle Association since the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14.

Websites such as MarchForOurLives.com, and RockTheVote.org are resources that will allow citizens to register to vote and find their polling stations. Other sites such as Headcount.org and Ballotpedia.com give voters more detailed information on state ballots.

And if you live in one of these states, you don’t have much time to get your name on the voting rolls:

Arkansas

Arkansas has 18 state Senate seats up for grabs this year, and voter registration for the primaries will end on Monday, April 23. The voter registration deadline for the November general election is Oct. 9.

The state primaries will be held on May 22, with a statewide runoff election held on June 19 for districts where candidates didn’t obtain a majority. Residents will also vote for their governor and four U.S. House of Representatives seats.

Pennsylvania

State primaries will take place in Pennsylvania on May 15, so all residents who want to take part in the election have to register to vote by April 16.

This year’s primaries are especially vital for Pennslyvania since the state Supreme court forced officials to redraw the state’s congressional map. Judges agreed in a 5-2 decision this January that the previous map, drawn by state Republicans, “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s constitution to give the GOP an electoral advantage.

Pennslyvania voters will have to decide on one U.S. Senate seat and all 18 of the state’s U.S. House of Representative seats. Democrat Conor Lamb, who inched out a win in the state’s 18th congressional district in March’s special election, will be running for the House again in the newly drawn 17th district.

In addition to electing their federal representatives, residents will elect a governor, 25 of their state Senate seats and all 203 of their state House seats.

Pennslyvania allows voters to register and update their current registration here.

West Virginia

The deadline to register to vote in West Virginia’s state primaries is April 17, though residents have until Oct. 16 to sign up for the general election.

Voters will decide on one U.S. Senate seat and three U.S. House of Representative spots. There are also 17 state Senate seats up for grabs, and all 67 districts will have state House of Delegates seats on the ballot this year.

Another important note for West Virginia voters is that the state’s new voter identification law went into effect at the beginning of the year. While all voters should have been mailed a voter ID card, there are several forms of identification that will suffice.

Voters who fail to bring an acceptable ID will still be able to cast a provisional ballot, a spokesperson for the West Virginia Secretary of State office told HuffPost.HuffPost today announced a series of new hires in newsrooms across the globe, as well as news roles for a number of existing staff.

But Hamasaki, who emigrated from China to New York City 20 years ago, says her persona actually embraces multiple Asian cultures.

Hamasaki, a Chinese-American skilled seamstress, dancer and comedian competing for the title of “America’s Next Drag Superstar” on Season 10 of “Drag Race,” told HuffPost her ethnicity is a primary factor in shaping her persona.

“I’m embracing my culture ― the aesthetic and heritage, because I have such huge pride in it,” Hamasaki, who identifies as gender-neutral and whose pronouns are she and her, told HuffPost. “She’s Chinese. She has a Japanese last name. Thai, Korean, Japanese ― I hit on all those cultures with my clothing and act.”

Hamasaki says her mother learned to sew in China and passed the skill on to her. The queen, who moved to New York’s Chinatown at the age of 7, created a number of her own costumes: a pink and purple ombre color-block jumpsuit with a corset belt; a lime green futuristic-looking bodysuit with a train and Lady-Gaga-esque epaulets.

While it’s true Hamasaki has enviable seamstress skills, she says she stays humble and has a good sense of humor about it:

The 27-year-old says her ethnic background greatly influenced her foray into drag. Hamasaki pointed out how queer identity and experience is often stigmatized in Asian communities and said she felt a culture shock after she moved to the U.S., struggling with feeling and looking different.

But as she grew up and into her identity, the only way she felt truly accepted was by going to gay bars.

“Being at gay bars, I finally felt like I wasn’t being judged or criticized. I was able to be very expressive. I was able to be myself.” - Yuhua Hamasaki

“The only way to get in was to dress in drag with a fake ID. Being at gay bars, I finally felt like I wasn’t being judged or criticized,” she said. “I was able to be very expressive. I was able to be myself. I was trying to fit into society and trying to be more confident and more self-determined.”

Hamasaki said she was forced to grow up fast. Her parents didn’t speak English and had to take lower-paying jobs in the U.S. than they had in China. Her father works as an elevator operator and her mother in a laundromat.

“Growing up with parents not speaking English, my sister and I were the adults in the family,” she said. “We had to take care of situations that my parents couldn’t take care of: housing, school, paying the bills.”

But she’s grateful her mother passed down the gift of sewing, among other skills. Now Hamasaki makes costumes for other drag queens, and it’s become a business for her. But sewing isn’t her only talent. She loves doing stand-up and counts Joan Rivers, Lisa Lampanelli and Pat Williams as some of her inspiration.

“I’m funny and witty. I always find humor in stuff that people wouldn’t find. I like intellectual jokes, and I read a lot of books growing up,” Hamasaki said. “Joan Rivers said it best: ‘Heal the wounds of your heart with laughter.’”

In her personal life, Hamasaki said she approaches most things with humor, especially dating. She said she dates as both a man and a woman, and that the differences are stark in terms of what Asian-American men and women experience.

“As a female, it’s more positive than negative. For a male, it’s more negative than positive,” she said. “As an Asian male, I can never get a date. As a female, it is so easy. Females are lewd, flirtatious, great in bed. Asian men ... aren’t. But yes, being a ho is easier!” she joked.

She said she believes the media is to blame for these perceptions of Asians that she feels play out in real life.

“Asian men are unattractive, not sexy. Asian women are sexy, needy. It’s up to the media to change what the public eye sees.” - Yuhua Hamasaki

“If you’re not Asian, you’re not going to experience the same situation. It’s totally over-exaggerated in the media. It’s not the fault of the public. It’s the fault of the media for creating that stereotype. The public has been tainted by the media’s point of view. Asian men are unattractive, not sexy. Asian women are sexy, needy. It’s up to the media to change what the public eye sees.”

Hamasaki said she’s honored to be a representative for the Asian community on “Drag Race” and hopes she is seen as someone who fights stereotypes.

“We as Asians are expected to be obedient and quiet. Whenever I do drag, other people expect me to be quiet and obedient. Little do they know my performances are very loud and vocal and very funny.”

One way she tries to break with convention is via her geisha persona. Hamasaki said she loves the fact that she can subvert the submissive, hypersexualized geisha archetype ― as well as embrace it. She points out it’s often misunderstood and complicated and should be embraced as many things all at once.

“We as Asians are expected to be obedient and quiet," says Hamasaki. "I’m not quiet. I’m not obedient. I’m not subtle." Boris KJ

“I am playing with this geisha stereotype and making it funny. I am this sexy beautiful woman. And yes, I also want your money. And I’m also a hardworking woman. We are not just hyper-sexualized objects. Both of these are credible identities.”

Hamasaki points out that coming to love and accept herself hasn’t exactly been a simple journey as an Asian-American, but that she hopes there’s a lesson for others in the simple audacity of being herself.Police fatally shot an unarmed black man walking down the street in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday.

Officers responded to three 911 calls reporting that a man at an intersection was pointing what callers believed to be a gun at residents, New York Police Department Chief Terence A. Monahan said in a news briefing.

“Today at 4:40 p.m., the NYPD received several 911 calls of a man described as a male black, wearing a brown jacket, pointing what is described as a silver firearm to people on the street,” Monahan said. When officers arrived, they saw a man matching that description.

“The suspect then took a two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at the approaching officers,” the police chief said.

Four officers, three in plainclothes and one in uniform, fired 10 rounds among them, striking the man. The officers then called for an ambulance, Monahan said, and the man was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police did not immediately name the man, but family members identified him as 34-year-old Saheed Vassell.

Despite reports that the victim was carrying a firearm, officers later determined the object he had pointed at them was “a pipe with some sort of knob on the end of it.”

NYPD provided a photo of the pipe the man was holding when officers shot him. Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information

The victim’s father, Eric Vassell, told NY1 on Wednesday that his son had bipolar disorder and had been “sick for a long time.” But he described his son as “polite” and said he wasn’t a danger to anyone. He also noted that his son had a teenage child.

“He’s polite, nice, he’s kind. He just comes and he goes,” Vassell told NY1. He told the New York Times that his son would “just walk around the neighborhood and help people.”

Local residents described the victim as a well-known member of the neighborhood. “He don’t bother nobody at all,” a woman named Sandy told WNYC, saying he helped her carry her groceries at one point.

“Every cop in this neighborhood knows him,” another community member, John Fuller, told The New York Times.

None of the officers was wearing a body camera, Monahan said. But during the news briefing, the police chief held up printouts of security footage that showed the man pointing an object at a civilian and another one of him pointing at the police officers right before the shooting.

NYPD also released security camera footage and transcripts of the 911 calls on Thursday.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office said on Twitter that the mayor had “received a preliminary briefing on the officer-involved shooting.”

Dozens of local residents gathered at the scene of the shooting Wednesday evening, many of them expressing their anger over the lethality of the officers’ response.

The shooting comes just two weeks after police fatally shot Stephon Clark in Sacramento, California, after receiving calls that someone in the neighborhood was breaking car windows. The African-American man, who was unarmed, was standing outside the home where he lived with his grandparents and two young children when the officers shot him eight times. It was later determined that he was holding a cellphone. The shooting escalated a national outcry over police brutality involving black victims.

Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) says the GOP lawmakers he knows are as exasperated by President Donald Trump’s tweets as nearly everyone else appears to be.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, host Jimmy Kimmel asked Kennedy if his Republican colleagues “also go like, ‘Oh no, what is this? What has happened here?’” after reading Trump’s latest tweets.

“Yes,” Kennedy, the grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.), said. “Yes, yes. Of course, they do.”

Although he gave the official Democratic response to Trump’s State of the Union speech last January, Kennedy also acknowledged he was an “outlier” among Democrats for his opposition to the legalization of recreational marijuana.

“I think the part of the impact of when you talk about the law is to make sure that you get the border cases right,” Kennedy told Kimmel. “I do have concerns about what an increase in availability of legal marijuana means for adolescents and what it means for folks that are struggling with addiction and mental health.”TEHRAN (Reuters) - The European Union is not doing enough to preserve the benefits for Iran from the 2015 international nuclear pact following the withdrawal of the United States, Iran’s foreign minister told the EU’s energy chief on Sunday.

Miguel Arias Canete, European Commissioner for energy and climate, said Tehran wanted the 28-nation bloc to act fast to preserve its oil trade with Iran, and to consider making direct euro-denominated payments for Iranian oil to Iran’s central bank, bypassing the U.S. financial system.

“With the withdrawal of America .... the European political support for the accord is not sufficient,” Mohammad Javad Zarif told Arias Canete in Tehran, Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.

Since President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that he would pull the United States out of the deal, the U.S. Treasury said Washington would reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including sanctions aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank.

The EU leaders have pledged to try to keep Iran’s oil trade and investment flowing, but conceded that would not be easy.

“We have to preserve this agreement so we don’t have to negotiate a new agreement,” Arias Canete told Western journalists after two days of meetings with Iranian officials in Tehran.

“Our message is very clear. This is a nuclear agreement that works.”

Under the deal, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most Western sanctions. With the threat of new U.S. sanctions looming over them, some foreign firms have already started signaling their intention to pull back from Iran.

“The announcement of the possible withdrawal by major European companies from their cooperation with Iran is not consistent with the European Union’s commitment to implementing (the nuclear deal),” Zarif was quoted as saying.

He appeared to be referring to announcements by several large European companies last week suggesting their activities in Iran would end or be curtailed because of the reimposition of U.S. sanctions.

A top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday cast doubt on whether European nations could be trusted to save the agreement.

“The contradictions in the words of European authorities are suspicious. We hope that our government officials will be able to secure the necessary guarantees in their negotiations, as one cannot rely on those who vacillate and speak contradictory words,” IRNA quoted Ali Akbar Velayati as saying.

Following the withdrawal of Washington, Iran said it would remain in the deal only if Tehran achieved its goals - namely being protected from sanctions on key sectors of its economy such as oil - in cooperation with other signatories of the pact.

EU investment in Iran, mainly from Germany, France and Italy, has jumped to more than 20 billion euros since the lifting of sanctions in 2016, in projects ranging from aerospace to energy.

But to improve its oil-reliant economy, Tehran needs to attract $100 billion in foreign investment to boost its oil industry and major western investors have stayed away from Iran, partly because of the remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran.

“The announcement, in cascade, of European companies that will not keep investing in Iran are making the things much more complicated at the moment,” Arias Canete said.

“So what he (Zarif) is asking the European Union is that we have to have concrete solutions in order to implement the European Union commitments, which is something that we fully recognize.”

The options being considered by the EU to keep Tehran in the nuclear deal include new credit lines for Tehran, increased energy cooperation and implementing EU laws to block European companies from caving in to U.S. sanctions.

Arias Canete said Iranian officials were keen to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions under a proposal for EU governments to make direct euro-denominated payments for Iranian oil to Iran’s central bank, bypassing the U.S. financial system.

“The EU will consider it,” he said, adding that the EU needed to deliver fast on preserving oil trade with Iran.
