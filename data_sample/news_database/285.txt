HUALIEN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Rescuers combed through the rubble of collapsed buildings on Wednesday, as they searched for about 60 people missing after a strong earthquake killed at least five near the popular Taiwanese tourist city of Hualien overnight.

The magnitude 6.4 quake, which hit near the coastal city just before midnight (1600 GMT) on Tuesday, also injured 243 people and collapsed four buildings, officials said.

Hualien Mayor Fu Kun-chi said the number of people missing was now close to 60, although an exact figure was not provided. As many as 150 were initially feared missing.

Many of the missing were believed to be still trapped inside buildings, some of which were tilting precariously, after the quake hit about 22 km (14 miles) northeast of Hualien on Taiwan’s east coast.

At the city’s Marshal Hotel, rescuers trying to free two trapped Taiwanese pulled out one alive, but the other person was declared dead, the government said.

Among the injured were mainland Chinese, Czech, Japanese, Singaporean and South Korean nationals.

Aftershocks with a magnitude of at least 5.0 could rock the island in the next two weeks, the government said. Smaller tremors rattled nervous residents throughout the day.

Residents waited and watched anxiously as emergency workers dressed in fluorescent orange and red suits and wearing helmets searched for residents trapped in apartment blocks.

Hualien is home to about 100,000 people. Its streets were buckled by the force of the quake, with around 40,000 homes left without water and around 1,900 without power. Water supply had returned to nearly 5,000 homes by noon (0400 GMT), while power was restored to around 1,700 households.

DAMAGE, PANIC

Emergency workers surrounded a badly damaged 12-storey residential building, a major focus of the rescue effort. Windows had collapsed and the building, which is around 17 years old, was wedged into the ground at a roughly 40-degree angle.

Rescuers worked their way around and through the building while residents looked on from behind cordoned-off roads. Others spoke of the panic when the earthquake struck.

“We were still open when it happened,” said Lin Ching-wen, who operates a restaurant near a damaged military hospital.

“I grabbed my wife and children and we ran out and tried to rescue people,” he said.

A Reuters video showed large cracks in the road, while police and emergency services tried to help anxious people roaming the streets. A car sat submerged in rubble as rescue workers combed through the ruins of a nearby building.

President Tsai Ing-wen went to the scene of the quake early on Wednesday to help direct rescue operations.

“The president has asked the cabinet and related ministries to immediately launch the ‘disaster mechanism’ and to work at the fastest rate on disaster relief work,” Tsai’s office said in a statement.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and major Apple supplier, said initial assessments indicated no impact from the earthquake.

Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China considers part of its territory, lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck nearby on Sunday.Almost 36,000 feet underwater, near the very bottom of the world’s deepest ocean trench, scientists came across a troubling find: a plastic bag, similar to one you might take home from a supermarket, lying incongruously in the darkness.

A recent study on deep-sea ocean pollution identified the bag, found in 1998 by a robotic submersible at a depth of 35,756 feet in the Mariana Trench, as the deepest known piece of plastic trash on Earth. Scientists say its presence in one of the world’s most remote environments signals just how worryingly pervasive plastic pollution has become.

And the problem isn’t limited to a single plastic bag.

For the study, researchers from Japan, together with scientists from UN Environment’s World Conservation Monitoring Center, combed through the Deep-Sea Debris Database, a massive Japanese library of deep-sea photos and videos taken on more than 5,000 dives over the course of 30 years. The database was made public in 2017.

What they found was a disturbing amount of trash clogging deep-sea environments, including the Japan Trench and the Mariana Trench, as well as deep-sea areas in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans.

The scientists said the images they scoured showed more than 3,400 pieces of debris. More than one-third of the waste they counted was made of plastic ― a staggering 89 percent of which was single-use items like plastic bags, packaging and bottles.

In environments deeper than 19,000 feet, more than half of the debris logged by the study was plastic ― and almost all of the plastic found at those depths was single-use.

“The ubiquitous distribution of single-use plastic, even to the greatest depths of the ocean, reveal a clear link between daily human activities and the remotest of environments,” UN Environment said in a statement last month.

Plastics are now reaching the deepest part of the ocean. It’s time to #BreakFreeFromPlastic.https://t.co/d91klsHX6W — Greenpeace (@Greenpeace) May 13, 2018

It remains unclear what the full impact of plastic pollution is on deep-sea areas and habitats, but preliminary research paints a grim picture.

Last year, scientists were stunned to find more chemical pollutants in parts of the Mariana Trench than in some of China’s most polluted waterways. The researchers hypothesized at the time that some of that pollution had been caused by the breakdown of ocean plastics.

“We still think of the deep ocean as being this remote and pristine realm, safe from human impact, but our research shows that, sadly, this could not be further from the truth,” the study’s lead author, Alan Jamieson told The Guardian last year.

Plastic debris may also be endangering organisms that live deep in the ocean.

The recent pollution study said 17 percent of the manmade debris that was counted was “found with at least one organism” ― a relatively high percentage given how sparsely populated deep-sea habitats are. Some organisms were found to be entangled with the plastic items, the researchers said, and others were covered or “attached” to the debris.

“Once in the deep-sea, plastic can persist for thousands of years,” UN Environment said in its statement. “Deep-sea ecosystems are highly endemic and have a very slow growth rate, so the potential threats from plastic pollution are concerning.”

Every year, the oceans are inundated with about 19 billion pounds of plastic garbage, with single-use plastic products reportedly being the biggest source of trash found near waterways and beaches.

As public concerns mount about the potential impacts of such pollution on human health and the marine environment, state and national governments, as well as corporations and individual consumers, have been pushing for improved regulations of plastic use, production and waste management.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he welcomes a government shutdown if congressional leaders do not agree to a deal to keep the government open later this week.

“I’d love to see a shutdown if we don’t get this stuff taken care of,” he said during a roundtable with legislators and law enforcement officials on immigration, adding that Democrats need to agree to his demands for immigration restrictions.

“It’s worth it for our country,” he said. “If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don’t want safety, and — unrelated but still related — they don’t want to take care of military, then shut it down. We’ll go with another shutdown.”

Lawmakers in both parties have said they hope to avoid another government shutdown like the one that occurred after talks broke down last month. Without an agreement to extend funding, the government would shut down Friday.

At the same time, lawmakers are working on a deal to help young undocumented immigrants, which Trump insists must include border security funding and cuts to legal immigration, something both Democrats and some Republicans have said is a non-starter.

But the White House has not typically taken the position that the debate should be tied to government funding. In January, the White House bashed Senate Democrats for opposing a government spending bill when it left out immigration measures. This time around, it’s not clear Democrats are willing to make the same move ― but Trump is now suggesting he will.

Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who was attending the roundtable and represents a district that is home to many government workers, told Trump: “We don’t need a government shutdown over this. I think both sides have learned that the shutdown was bad.” She added that she believes there is bipartisan support for a deal.

“Barbara, we are not getting the support of the Democrats. I mean, you can say what you want. We are not getting the support of the Democrats,” Trump said in response. “They are not supporting us.”

Among Trump’s demands is his signature campaign promise: a border wall.

“We need the wall. We’re going to get the wall,” he said Tuesday.

Later Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders clarified Trump’s comments, saying that he wants Democrats “to do their jobs.”

“We are not advocating for the shutdown,” she said.

On Monday, Trump blamed Democrats for not coming up with a legislative solution for so-called Dreamers. In a tweet, he claimed that Democrats “seem not to care about DACA,” referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump ended.

Democrats and Republicans have proposed multiple bipartisan bills to help Dreamers, often paired with border security measures. The White House has rejected all of them and says it wants its own framework, even though it faces bipartisan opposition.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that the upper chamber will move forward with discussing immigration only after government funding has been approved. He said it will be an open debate to determine what can get past the 60-vote threshold for passage.

“Whoever gets to 60 wins,” McConnell told reporters.

DACA recipients are set to begin losing their two-year work permits and deportation protections in greater numbers on March 6 if Congress does nothing due to the way Trump rescinded the program. They are currently able to apply for renewal under a court order ― one the administration is fighting ― but it typically takes months for applications to be processed.

White House chief of staff John Kelly said earlier on Tuesday that he does not believe Trump can “extend” that March “deadline,” and would advise the president against signing a bill to temporarily maintain DACA.A mother pulled her son out of school when he violated the dress code for his hairstyle.

In a quest to make a larger point about students’ personal freedom, one Arizona mother pulled her son out of his school after he violated his school dress code by wearing braids.

On January 31, Brittany Anderson of Phoenix received a phone call from Teleos Prep Academy, where her 12-year-old son Nasir attends school. “A teacher [stated] that my son’s hair was against the school uniform policy, he is clean cut with 2 French braids going to the back,” Anderson wrote on Facebook. “The teacher told me I need to come and pick him up from school and basically could not return until his hair was no longer the same.”

Anderson’s post continued: “So I asked the teacher how are these kids able to freely express themselves if your trying to prohibit them from doing so? Of course the teacher had nothing to say, and people wonder why so many kids are [committing] suicide, to me that’s a form of bullying because your talking about my sons hair. My son is 12, no behavior issues, well mannered and is no trouble at all. So I asked the teacher and the front office staff if braids are a form of being in a gang or does it signify that my son is at all gang affiliated? Still no one had anything to say, except for one who [said] that there are not enough parents who challenge the handbook.”

Anderson felt strongly that her son’s hairstyle was appropriate, so she chose to withdraw him from school. “I don’t believe in anyone dictating how my son should look especially if he’s following these uniform guidelines they have in place,” she wrote on Facebook. “My voice will be heard and I will not stop here.”

On Thursday, Arizona news station ABC15, which broke the story, published a portion of the school handbook, which bans shaved heads, mohawks, rattails, ponytails, and, for boys only, braids.

“My son has been going to school with braided hair for the past six months, and Monday — the day of school pictures — was the first time I was notified that it was a problem,” Anderson, 32, a mother of three, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I had previously received an email stating that hair had to be ‘well-maintained’ and ‘conservative,’ but with no further explanation.”

That day, Anderson left her job as supervisor of patient registration at a hospital and went to pick up Nasir. Once there, she says she asked a teacher why braids were a violation. “I said, ‘Do you feel braids are gang-affiliated?’ and he didn’t answer, other than, ‘It’s the rules.’”

She adds, “If this was a problem six months ago, I would never have allowed my son to grow out his hair.”

Great Hearts Academies, which operates 28 charter schools, including Teleos Prep, did not return Yahoo Lifestyle’s request for comment. However, it sent the following statement to ABC15:

“As is the case with many public schools in Arizona, Great Hearts has a dress code policy for all of our academies. We are transparent about this policy and it is clearly stated in the Family Handbook, which is provided to parents to review and sign before their child starts school with us. We take great care in fairly and consistently upholding our policies for all students. We understand parents have a choice about where their children attend school, and some may not agree with our dress code policy, which is certainly their right. We’re sorry to see this family leave the Teleos Prep community, but we fully respect their decision to do so.”

Anderson enrolled her son in another school that day and insists the drastic move was necessary, telling Yahoo Lifestyle, “I never want my son to feel as though he doesn’t have a voice.”Freeskier Gus Kenworthy popped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Monday to discuss ― among other things ― making history with figure skater Adam Rippon as the first two openly gay men to compete for the U.S. in the Winter Olympics.

Kenworthy, who secured a spot on the men’s Olympic slopestyle team in January, told DeGeneres that he was “excited to soak up” the experience at the Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, later this month. While he previously competed at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, and brought home a silver medal, this will be his first time at the Olympics as an openly gay man.

“It’s going to be a different experience than last time around because I’m not in the closet,” Kenworthy said (see video above). “I just want to meet as many athletes as I can, get to enjoy the opening and closing ceremonies, [and] hopefully ski the best I possibly can.”

Pence was “a strange choice” for the job, Kenworthy said.

“To have somebody leading the delegation that [has] directly attacked the LGBTQ community ... just seems like a bad fit,” he told DeGeneres. “I feel like the Olympics is all about inclusion and people coming together, and it seems like it’s not really doing that.”

Later in the interview, DeGeneres asked Kenworthy about the experience of posing au naturel for ESPN’s 2017 Body Issue, as well as his Head & Shoulders campaign, which broke fresh ground as the first nationally televised commercial to feature a rainbow flag.The Philadelphia Eagles will celebrate their first-ever Super Bowl win at home with a championship parade on Thursday, and the city’s public school system wants to make sure students and teachers get to experience the magic.

In a tweet sent Monday afternoon, the School District of Philadelphia said that all schools and administrative offices will be closed on Thursday for the festivities.

“The excitement of the Eagles first Super Bowl victory is a once in a lifetime event,” the message read. “For this reason, we have decided to give our students, teachers & their families the chance to witness history.”

Superintendent William Hite followed up the tweet with his own note stressing the importance of attending school every other day while encouraging students to enjoy the parade.

Even though we will be closed on Thursday, I want to remind every student, parent and guardian that attending school is absolutely essential. Just like the Eagles were football heroes on Sunday, I want all of our students to be attendance heroes everyday.



Enjoy the parade! https://t.co/3WU27MXSm2 — Dr. William Hite (@SDPHite) February 5, 2018

After the Eagles flew to victory Sunday night against the New England Patriots, rowdy fans took to the streets of Philadelphia to party. There were reports of small fires and at least one overturned car, and the mayor said three arrests had been made as of Monday morning.

Several Eagles players have already indicated that they would not accept a still-hypothetical invitation from President Donald Trump to mark their win at the White House.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump’s stock market boom boasts are coming back to bite him.

Trump hasn’t shied away from claiming credit for surging indices in recent months. On Jan. 20, he tweeted about bringing “unprecedented success” to the U.S. with a “record stock market”:

Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2018

And in his State of the Union speech, Trump bragged about how the stock market’s surge was directly affecting Americans.

“The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value,” Trump said. “That is great news for Americans’ 401(k), retirement, pension and college savings accounts.”

But on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500 index both took massive tumbles and suffered their biggest percentage drops in seven years.

People on Twitter were keen to let Trump take equal credit for the plunge:

The cast and crew members are “fine” and on the mend after the accident, which occurred around noon on Interstate 80. The crash killed one driver and injured several others, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Nathan Ludwig told HuffPost.

“One of the tour buses transporting cast and crew of ‘Dancing with the Stars: Live! Light Up The Night’ was involved in a multi-car accident this afternoon due to bad weather while en route to Ames, Iowa. All cast and crew members are fine, with some recovering from minor injuries,” the “Dancing with the Stars: Live! Light Up The Night” tour organizers said in a statement on Instagram.

The statement revealed that the Ames tour date was canceled as a result of the crash, citing “the safety and health of our cast and crew.”

“To anyone involved in the accident, the entire cast sends their best wishes for a speedy recovery, and their deepest apologies to all of the fans who have been waiting to see the show tonight,” it read.

Severe winter snow storms hit much of central Iowa on Monday, resulting in 185 accidents across the state, according to local news outlet KCCI 8. The same day, more than 50 cars were involved in another pile up on 1-35, which authorities called the “worst they’ve ever seen.” That accident also killed one driver.

On his Fox News radio show on Monday, Hannity said the market drop ― which at its worst saw the Dow industrials plunge by nearly 1,600 points and closing down 1,175 points for the day ― wasn’t the fault of President Donald Trump.

It’s his predecessor that’s to blame.

“Because the Obama economy was so weak all of these years, we had just artificially cheap money,” Hannity said, referring to a Fox News analysis he had seen on the cable network.

He explained that “cheap money” is from borrowing at “ridiculously low rates,” which he added must now end.

“The government has artificially, the Fed has artificially, kept the price of money down and the price of borrowing down, and now that’s going to come to an end.”

Then, he declared that the plunge ― which saw stocks erase all their 2018 gains ― is actually good.

“In many ways, it’s a sign of the strength of the economy more than anything else,” he said in comments posted online by Media Matters.“Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Kylie wrote in her Sunday announcement. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”

In addition to her message, Jenner posted a sweet, 11-minute video, called “To Our Daughter,” that shared moments from the past nine months.

There were a few butterfly references in the video (Jenner wears a butterfly chain and there were butterflies on what looked like the walls of the nursery). Many fans speculated that Kylie would name her daughter Butterfly, Mariposa (which means “butterfly” in Spanish) or Monarch, after Scott’s song “Butterfly Effect.”

Jenner and Scott also have matching butterfly tattoos.First thing’s first: Has Andie MacDowell’s “Magic Mike XXL” performance been enshrined in the Smithsonian yet? If not, maybe we can launch a joint campaign for that and her “Love After Love” turn.

Each day Johnson drives far out into the bush of northern Uganda to provide lifesaving health care to scores of children suffering from a baffling condition known as nodding syndrome.

The neurological disorder is often ignored, as many of the thousands of children affected live in Uganda’s remote north, a land at peace but struggling with the legacy of long years of civil war. It’s partly because of the area’s remoteness that the causes of the syndrome remain a mystery.

Though limited in its spread, nodding syndrome is devastating to the tiny communities that are affected. Scientists first recorded cases of nodding syndrome in Tanzania in the 1960s, but it is not clear whether that outbreak is related to the one in Uganda. (Neighboring South Sudan has also reported cases, but the ongoing conflict there makes the extent difficult to assess.)

Photographer Sumy Sadurni and I had come to find out more about what was behind a strange syndrome that has left thousands of children crippled and in pain. And joining Johnson on motorbikes was the only way to reach the remote farms at the end of narrow tracks.

“I bring them the anti-convulsion drugs,” Johnson shouts, as clouds of orange dust rise high into the air.

Without these pills, the children would soon die from the intense seizures. Nodding syndrome has no known cure.

Joe Otoo, a 59-year old volunteer health worker, claims to be the first person to report Ugandan cases of the disease.

It was 1998, and northern Uganda was in the grip of a brutal insurgency. Tumango was at the epicenter of an army crackdown against the Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group also known as the LRA.

As the land burned, nodding syndrome developed amid the nearly 2 million people forced into crowded government-run camps.

“I was called to Tumango because of odd reports [that] three children were sick,” Otoo said, recalling his visit to a scattered collection of thatch huts to investigate.

“When food was brought for children, they began to nod their heads, then sleep,” he said, copying how the seizures looked by banging his head forward. “It was a strange disease, something no one had seen before.”

The smell of food triggered the seizures, with a child’s head slowly nodding forward, then growing in intensity. The nodding eventually develops into an uncontrolled seizure. Epilepsy was well known, but the traditional treatments of crushed roots used to calm patients proved useless against this new problem.

The unexplained condition now affects about 3,300 children in northern Uganda, with around 5,200 with epilepsy that resembles nodding syndrome.

Otoo opens his ledger of cases: page after page, each with hundreds of names.

Dozens have died, many from complications related to the seizures. They include Otoo’s son, Oroma Ronald, who fell sick at 8 and died a decade later during a seizure.

“He started nodding, too,” he said, running his hands over the faded photograph of his child. “It made me sad, because I knew what it meant for him.”

Many scientists, and the Ugandan government, believe nodding syndrome may be connected to parasitic worms spread by the black fly. These parasites cause the disease known as river blindness, which is a known threat to millions of people in more than 20 countries, mostly in tropical regions of Africa.

Last year a team of U.S. scientists published a study suggesting that nodding syndrome might be an auto-immune response to the parasite, NPR reported.

Distrust of the government, however, has led some to question those conclusions. Locals have noted that river blindness was a problem long before nodding syndrome was identified, across a much wider geographic area. They wonder why nodding syndrome would suddenly appear in such a specific location in East Africa.

“We have always had black fly, so why has it made the children suffer from nodding here?” asked one parent, who was fearful of publicly challenging the government’s official line blaming black fly. “In the end, all we care about is the health of our child.”

Some skeptics have blamed poisoned food in the camps, or they believe it’s due to fallout from explosions during the fighting. Others see the nodding children as spirits of those never buried in the massacres of the war.

Of the three cases Otoo recorded in 1998, two have since died. But the third, a woman called Abalo Monica, has survived.

We left Otoo behind and went to find her. After an hour of driving, we turned down the thinnest of tracks, weaving between mango trees and sunflower plants that towered above us.

Monica, now in her early 20s, was sitting outside her home, a thatch hut she shares with her smiling, year-old son Otema.

Abalo Monica was one of the first identified with nodding syndrome in 1998. Her son, Otema, is healthy and shows no sign of the syndrome. Sumy Sadurni for HuffPost

“It was as though invisible hands had grabbed me,” Monica said, recalling the first seizures and intense hallucinations she suffered from the syndrome. “I dreamed that men came out the termite mounds, calling out my name over and over. ‘Monica! Monica!’ But I refused to join them.”

Today, she still has fits, but drugs keep the worst symptoms at bay.

Johnson is worried, however. Funding for the care he provides is at risk of being cut, as a U.S.-based charity that supports the only care center for the children is struggling to raise cash.

Supporters are trying to ensure Johnson’s lifesaving work continues.

“Without this help, the children will die,” he said.

AdvertisementJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel launched celebrations on Sunday for the U.S. Embassy’s relocation to Jerusalem, a move whose break with world consensus was underscored by the absence of most envoys to the country from a reception hosted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Monday’s slated opening of the new embassy follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a decision he said fulfilled decades of policy pledges in Washington and formalized realities on the ground.

The Palestinians, who want their own future state with its capital in east Jerusalem, have been outraged by Trump’s shift from previous administrations’ preference for keeping the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv pending progress in peace efforts.

Those talks have been frozen since 2014. Other major powers worry that the U.S. move could inflame Palestinian unrest in the occupied West Bank and on the Gaza Strip border, where Israel reinforced troops in anticipation of the embassy opening.

Most countries say Jerusalem’s status should be determined in a final peace settlement, and say moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal.

Addressing dignitaries at the Foreign Ministry, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the president’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the Israeli prime minister urged others to follow Washington’s lead.

“Move your embassies to Jerusalem because it’s the right thing to do,” Netanyahu said. “Move your embassies to Jerusalem because it advances peace, and that’s because you can’t base peace on a foundation of lies.”

Netanyahu said that “under any peace agreement you could possibly imagine, Jerusalem will remain Israel’s capital”.

Jerusalem, which is sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians, was decorated with roadside flowerbeds in the design of the U.S. flag and posters reading “Trump make Israel great again”.

“Tragically, the U.S. administration has chosen to side with Israel’s exclusivist claims over a city that has for centuries been sacred to all faiths,” the general delegation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation to the United States said.

The U.S. Embassy move “gives life to a religious conflict instead of a dignified peace,” it said in a statement.

Israel said all 86 countries with diplomatic missions in Israel were invited to the event, and 33 confirmed attendance. Among those present were delegates from Guatemala and Paraguay, which will open their own Jerusalem embassies later this month.

EUROPEAN RIFT

Attending the Foreign Ministry gathering were representatives from Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic, but none from western European Union states - suggesting a rift within the bloc over Trump’s Jerusalem move.

No-show nations withheld comment on Sunday.

The EU mission in Israel tweeted on Friday that the bloc would “respect the international consensus on Jerusalem ... including on the location of their diplomatic representations until the final status of Jerusalem is resolved”.

Outside Jerusalem’s ancient Damascus Gate, Israelis danced in another celebration on Sunday, marking the capture of the Old City from Arab forces in the 1967 Middle East War.

Hundreds of Israeli rightists entered Al Aqsa mosque compound, an icon of Palestinian nationalism and a vestige of ancient Jewish temples. Witnesses said some prostrated themselves in Jewish prayer, violating religious restrictions at the site and sparking scuffles with Muslim worshippers.

Israeli police said several people were forcibly removed and questioned.

The U.S. Treasury secretary called the embassy relocation “a sign of the enduring friendship and partnership between our two countries” and also referred to the U.S. withdrawal last week from the Iran nuclear deal, a move welcomed by Israel and some U.S. Arab allies in the Gulf but lamented by other world powers.

The Palestinians plan to demonstrate against Monday’s inauguration from Arab districts abutting the Jerusalem site.

On the border with Gaza, Palestinians have also held protests as Israel prepares to mark 70 years since its creation, an event Palestinians call the Nakba, or Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of them were displaced from their homes.

More than 40 Palestinians have been killed in the latest violence.

In a recorded speech released on Sunday, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri criticized Trump’s decision on the embassy, as well as the leaders of Muslim countries he said had sold out the Palestinians. He also said Israel’s Tel Aviv was Muslim land.

The Trump administration has sought to keep the door open to Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy by saying the embassy move did not aim to prejudge Jerusalem’s final borders. The U.S. consulate in the city, tasked with handling Palestinian ties, will remain.YouTube star Kian Lawley has been fired from the upcoming film adaptation of “The Hate U Give” after a recently resurfaced video shows him making racist remarks.

“Due to the controversy surrounding his past comments and behavior, Kian Lawley will no longer appear in ‘The Hate U Give.’ The studio plans to recast the role of Chris and reshoot scenes as needed,” a Twentieth Century Fox Films spokesperson told Variety.

In a 12-second bleeped video on YouTube that made the internet rounds last month, Lawley is heard using a racist slur and other racially offensive comments. “We’re all black drinking purple Kool-Aid and eating Kentucky fried motherfucking chicken,” he says in the clip.

Lawley was set to star as the boyfriend of Amandla Stenberg’s character in the adaptation of the beloved and critically acclaimed young-adult novel written by Angela Thomas. “The Hate U Give” centers around the story of a 16-year-old girl who feels torn between the worlds of her poor and mostly black neighborhood, and the suburban prep school she attends. She later witnesses the murder of her childhood friend at the hands of a police officer.

Issa Rae, Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, Algee Smith, Lamar Johnson, and Common are also attached to the project.

Lawley has formally apologized for the video, and said he agrees with the studio’s decision to drop him from the film.

“Words have power and can do damage. I own mine and I am sorry. I respect Fox’s decision to recast this role for ‘The Hate U Give’ as it is an important story, and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved considering the actions of my past,” Lawley told Variety in a statement. “I understand the impact and I have grown and learned since then. From now on I plan to use my voice for positive change.”

Earlier in the week, he addressed the controversy on social media, where he’s amassed more than 6 million followers.

if u don’t learn from ur mistakes, u can never grow as a person.



i’ve learned a lot & i am grateful to have the power to change. i never want to be who i was yesterday. we’re in a constant battle to become a better version of ourselves, use ur voice as ur weapon. — Kian Lawley (@KianLawley) February 4, 2018

Thomas, barraged by Lawley fans on social media, also responded to the recasting, writing, “the past two weeks have been hell for me, but I’m the enemy. Y’all. I’ve been trying. You just don’t know.”

The author explained that she’s been “hurt severely” and there is a “ton of pain” associated with the uproar.

Y'all are screenshotting me and coming at my friends without knowing the details of the situation. There is so much more that you don't know, and I'm honestly sad for you.



But I'm unprofessional? — Angie Thomas Doesn't Control Movies (@angiecthomas) February 5, 2018

Oh, only you knew half of what I've gone through because of this. Half of the tears that have been shed. The disappointment and heartbreak.



Don't assume, sweets. Everything I've Tweeted is out of sheer disappointment in someone I love. They know. I know. That's all that matters. — Angie Thomas Doesn't Control Movies (@angiecthomas) February 5, 2018

Fans of the author have since come to her defense, attempting to shift the narrative to a celebration of Thomas’ breakout novel. The hashtag #AngieThomasAppreciationDay is now trending on social media.

A representative for Twentieth Century Fox Films did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Two guys from the tiny town of Sandpoint, Idaho, are trying to do what their political leaders won’t: Provide health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income Idahoans.

Through a political action committee they founded called Reclaim Idaho, Luke Mayville and Garrett Strizich, both 32, are traveling the state collecting signatures to put the question of whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act before the voters.

“If I can, I want to make a difference where I grew up, because where I grew up has been overtaken by similar kinds of politics that seem to be taking over the country,” Mayville told HuffPost. “So I want to do something to push back against that.”

The Idaho effort is one of several in conservative-leaning states seeking to duplicate what activists in Maine achieved last November through a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid in that state.

Advocates in Nebraska and Utah also are working to gather signatures to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and a retiree in Missouri has taken up the cause for a long-shot bid to do so as well.

These campaigns to expand health coverage using funding the Affordable Care Act provides come at a time when President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress are busy rolling back other parts of the 2010 law and implementing changes to Medicaid policy that make it harder for low-income people to get and keep health benefits.

“Maine really motivated myself to look into the ballot route,” Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld said.

He and other Nebraska legislators have tried advancing Medicaid expansion through legislative channels for years, and are trying again this year.

But Morfeld said he’s also working with private organizations to get the issue on the ballot this November. The Nebraska legislature consists of a single chamber and is technically nonpartisan, but Morfeld, a Democrat, is effectively in the minority.

Expanding Medicaid could benefit 90,000 Nebraskans, Morfeld said. They have to gather signatures representing 10 percent of the state’s registered voters ― about 120,000 people ― and submit them by July 6, according to Nebraska law.

The Affordable Care Act called for Medicaid to become available to anyone with an income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person.

A 2012 Supreme Court ruling made this policy optional for states, however, and 18 states have declined to participate. Nationwide, almost 2.5 million people who would qualify for Medicaid under this policy are uninsured, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

In Idaho, Mayville, Strizich and his wife, Emily Strizich, are traveling around the state in a camper van the Strizichs bought last year for $1,500, which they’ve decorated with the campaign’s name and dubbed the “Medicaid Mobile.”

Mayville and Garrett Strizich each grew up in Sandpoint, a town with fewer than 8,000 residents that sits about an hour south of the Canadian border and an hour or so east of Washington state. Sandpoint is known to some as the birthplace of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.

The Strizichs live in Moscow, Idaho, where Garrett is in medical school and Emily is an occupational therapist who primarily works with low-income children with disabilities. Mayville currently resides in New York City, where he teaches political philosophy at Columbia University, and travels back to Idaho regularly.

They’ve raised about $10,000, along with contributions of gasoline and supplies for their barnstorming campaign, mostly from the residents of their hometown, Mayville said.

Idaho is a conservative state, but Mayville is optimistic the campaign can succeed at extending health coverage to as many as 78,000 Idahoans. “Our kind of philosophy all along has been that it’s actually a kind of Republican elite and activist class that is really against these programs, whereas the broader base of voters is not,” he said.

Reclaim Idaho has a tough task ahead just to give voters a chance to decide. They must collect signatures from 6 percent of the state’s registered voters, or about 56,000 people. They must also meet that percentage threshold in 18 of 35 state legislative districts. The deadline to submit signatures is May 1.

Mayville and the Strizichs, for now, are pretty much on their own, though they hope to gain the support of other organizations.

The Utah effort has been able to gather wider backing because advocates have been pushing for Medicaid expansion since the Supreme Court ruling almost six years ago, said RyLee Curtis, the campaign manager for Utah Decides Healthcare.

“Our coalition grew over the years. We got more businesses and chambers of commerce on board, and that drew the attention of our funders,” Curtis said.

One advantage the Utah ballot push has over Idaho’s is that Medicaid expansion has been the subject of a public debate in the state for several years already. Utah’s state Senate passed a privatized version of Medicaid expansion in 2016 with the support of Gov. Gary Herbert (R), but the bill died in the state House. Medicaid expansion could provide coverage to an estimated 120,000 Utahns.

“You’re seeing a frustration from Utah voters in that we want to see good policies go forward, and the Utah legislature is not reflecting or acting in a way that Utah voters want to see them act on these issues,” Curtis said. There hasn’t been a ballot initiative presented to Utah voters since the 1990s, but there could be as many as five this November, she said.

Utah Decides Healthcare has until April 15 to collect about 113,000 signatures, which represents 10 percent of the number of Utahns who voted in the 2016 presidential election. As in Idaho, the signatures must come from all over the state; in Utah, that means meeting the 10 percent threshold in 26 of 29 state Senate districts, Curtis said. “It’s going to be close, but it’s not so close that we’re nervous about it,” she said.

A key player in the Maine and Utah ballot campaigns will decide soon whether to join the fights in Idaho and Nebraska. The Fairness Project, a labor-backed organization that successfully promoted the Maine Medicaid initiative last year and minimum-wage-increase initiatives in five states in 2016, sees expanding health care as a priority, executive director Jonathan Schleifer said.

“There’s no better way to improve people’s lives,” Schleifer said.

The Fairness Project serves as a support system for these statewide ballot initiatives, conducting public opinion research, helping with signature-gathering, providing data modeling and other means of assistance. But the group is choosy about where to devote its resources and only wants to support campaigns that will actually result in the change they’re seeking.

“We’re not interested in principled wins or principled losses. We want to see the impact,” Schleifer said.

“We’ve had early conservations in Idaho and Nebraska. We are optimistic that we’re going to be able to advance Medicaid on the ballot in both of those states and we think that if we do, we will be able to expand Medicaid,” Schleifer said. The Missouri effort is too much of a long shot, he said, and he doesn’t expect to see ballot campaigns in any other states this year.WASHINGTON ― The U.S. House voted unanimously Tuesday to explicitly ban sexual relationships between lawmakers and staffers as it adopted changes to the arcane process for handling sexual misconduct claims.

House members also approved the creation of an office providing legal support to staffers reporting sexual harassment, and authorized a separate bill that requires lawmakers who agree to sexual harassment settlements to pay out of their own pockets. Currently, accusers are provided no legal support, and lawmakers have access to a little-known taxpayer fund for workplace settlements.

The #MeToo movement has forced Congress, like Hollywood, the media, sports and other major industries, to examine its own practices ― including the basic failure to specifically prohibit sexual relationships between members and their staffers.

The two bills passed by voice vote, bypassing the normal legislative process because of overwhelming bipartisan support.

Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) said last month that he would not seek re-election after a former female staffer said he lashed out at her after she rejected his romantic advances. Meehan, who served on the House Ethics Committee, which investigated sexual harassment claims, said he considered the aide his “soul mate” and attributed his aggression to stress over the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The series of sexual harassment revelations exposed a congressional process that often disadvantages the accuser, and allows perpetrators to conceal the allegations and use taxpayer dollars to pay settlements that mandate secrecy.

In addition to banning sexual relationships between House members and “any employee of the House that works under [their] supervision,” members are now explicitly prohibited from “unwelcome sexual advances or conduct” involving any other member or staffer, including those they do not supervise.A controversial minister linked to President Donald Trump said flu shots aren’t necessary when you have Jesus.

“Inoculate yourself with the word of God,” urged Gloria Copeland, who with her husband co-founded the Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Texas.

Both serve on Trump’s evangelical advisory board.

While health officials continue to urge people to get flu shots during a season that has been marked by widespread illness, Copeland told followers that faith in Christ is all that’s really needed.

“Well, listen, partners, we don’t have a flu season,” Copeland said in a video clip posted online by Right Wing Watch. “And don’t receive it when somebody threatens you with, ‘Everybody’s getting the flu.’ We’ve already had our shot: He bore our sicknesses and carried our diseases. That’s what we stand on.”

She said the faithful who don’t have the flu can ward off the infection by repeatedly saying, “I’ll never have the flu. I’ll never have the flu.”

For those who are ― somehow ― sick anyway, she offered a prayer.

“Flu, I bind you off of the people in the name of Jesus,” she said, “Jesus himself gave us the flu shot. He redeemed us from the curse of flu, and we receive it and we take it, and we are healed by his stripes, amen.”

Last week, the CDC said flu hospitalizations have reached their highest point in nearly a decade, and that 48 states are experiencing widespread illnesses due to the virus.

The agency also urged people who have not yet been vaccinated to get the flu shot.Actor Terry Crews, who filed a lawsuit in December against top talent agent Adam Venit for allegedly groping his genitals, says he’s faced pressure from the producer of “Expendables 4” to drop the sexual harassment suit.

In a Saturday tweet, the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star claimed producer Avi Lerner had called his management team to say Crews could avoid “problems” if he dropped his case against Venit and the agency he works for, William Morris Endeavor (WME). Crews is expected to reprise his role as Hale Caesar in the fourth installment of the “Expendables” franchise.

Management got a call last week from Avi Lerner producer of EXPENDABLES 4 saying I could avoid any “problems” on the sequel if I dropped my case against @WME.



Guess who’s Sly’s agent?

ADAM VENIT — terrycrews (@terrycrews) February 3, 2018

The “Sly” in the tweet is an apparent reference to Sylvester Stallone, who starred in the first three “Expendables” films and has reportedly clashed with Lerner on the creative direction of the upcoming sequel.

As Jezebel noted, Crews’ tweet may allude to this clash, which sparked rumors last year that Stallone, who is represented by Venit, was considering withdrawing from the franchise and refusing to participate in “Expendables 4.” The veteran action star, however, has apparently changed his mind about the withdrawal. In December, Stallone shared a photograph on Instagram promoting the sequel.

Representatives of Stallone, Lerner and Crews have not responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Crews first accused Venit of sexual assault last year, naming the agent during an interview with “Good Morning America.” Crews alleged that he was at a Hollywood party with his wife in 2016 when Venit suddenly grabbed his crotch.

“I stick my hand out,” Crews said, “and he literally takes his hand and puts it, squeezes my genitals. And I jump back like, ‘Hey, hey!’ … I go, ‘Dude, what are you doing?’”

“I have never felt more emasculated. More objectified. I was horrified,” he added.

WME suspended Venit without pay for a month following Crews’ allegation. The agent has since returned to his job.A pro-Trump super PAC called the Committee to Defend the President has placed a digital ad in New York’s Times Square that condemns “fake news,” calling out several media outlets in what looks like a thinly veiled effort to tout the committee’s Federal Election Commission complaint against Hillary Clinton.

The ad, which debuted on Monday, lists CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, NBC News and Time above the words “The Fake News ...”

Super PAC called Cmte to Defend the President pays for Times Square E Billboard calling mainstream media Trump coverage “Fake News.” #1010WINS pic.twitter.com/o4Jk6eRix4 — NYRogerStern (@NYRogerStern) February 5, 2018

The next screen of the ad reads, “Spent more ink on President Trump’s second scoop of ice cream than the ongoing FEC investigation of Hillary’s $84M Campaign Finance money laundering scheme.”

The “second scoop” refers to a Time feature story last May about Donald Trump’s life at the White House, which noted that he received two scoops of ice cream at a dinner where his guests got one.

The “ongoing FEC investigation” refers to the committee’s own FEC complaint, which accuses Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign of a “money laundering scheme.” The complaint by this group ― which was previously known as Stop Hillary PAC ― asks the FEC to determine whether Clinton was involved in an “unprecedented, massive, nationwide multimillion-dollar conspiracy” that allowed donors to spread more money around.

But that so-called conspiracy may simply have taken advantage of “new loopholes in campaign finance law,” according to The Washington Post. In a 2014 Supreme Court case named for Republican donor Shaun McCutcheon, the rules that made it harder for candidates to “blow past their own donation limits by routing more money through state parties” were lifted.

As the Post explained, the presidential campaigns of both Clinton and Trump set up joint fundraising committees that pulled in money for their own campaign and the coffers of multiple state parties. During the election, “neither move courted much controversy,” the paper wrote.

The FEC acknowledged receipt of the complaint in December, according to the Committee to Defend the President’s website. The Washington Post wrote that it’s “unclear how long it might take the FEC” to assess this particular case.Caitlyn quickly put all the rumors to rest with an Instagram photo on Monday.

“My daughter just had a daughter. It’s amazing to be by your side through this journey,” Jenner captioned her emotional post. “She’s SO beautiful already. Can’t wait to watch her grow.”

Caitlyn posted a photo of Kylie as a baby, captioning the picture, “Throwback to my baby, as a baby @kyliejenner.”

A post shared by Caitlyn Jenner (@caitlynjenner) on Feb 5, 2018 at 5:09pm PST

Kylie commented on the photo, writing “Love you” with a heart emoji.

The new mom, who has yet to release the name of her baby, welcomed her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott on Feb. 1.

“Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Kylie wrote in her announcement. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”

At an event in Los Angeles on Monday night, Kris Jenner told People magazine that Kylie is already “an amazing mom.” The momager added that she couldn’t stop crying over the sweet video, called “To Our Daughter,” that Kylie released.

“I was bawling! I was crying so hard, especially at the end,” Kris said. The video also provided the first footage of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s newest addition to the family, a little girl named Chicago.

Watch the whole video below:Character actor John Mahoney, who was best known for playing the character Martin Crane on the 1990s sitcom “Frasier,” died Sunday in Chicago at the age of 77.

Mahoney’s manager, Paul Martino, confirmed to Variety that the actor died while he was in hospice care.

Born in Blackpool, England, in 1940, Mahoney decided to move to the U.S. at age 19 after visiting his war bride sister in the states.

He immediately noticed the difference between the two countries.

“It was so bleak and dark in England ― those gray and foggy postwar years,” he told the Chicago Tribune in 1996. “Here it was so sunny. The people smiled.”

Mahoney moved to the U.S. permanently in the late 1950s and served in the U.S. Army for three years. He also taught English at Western Illinois University before becoming a professional actor in 1977.

Nine years later, Mahoney won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor In A Play for his work in “The House of Blue Leaves.”

After making an impression in film classics like “Moonstruck,” and “Say Anything,” Mahoney tasted mainstream success in 1993, when he was hired as a cast member for “Frasier,” a “Cheers” spinoff starring Kelsey Grammer.

“Frasier” ran from 1993 to 2004. During that time, Mahoney was nominated for two Emmys and two Golden Globes, and won a SAG Award in 2000.

His most recent acting gig was last fall in the play “The Rembrandt” at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre.

Mahoney never married and had no children, according to Fox News.Voters in California’s Santa Clara County will decide this summer whether or not to recall the judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a fraternity party.

A board of supervisors on Tuesday ordered Santa Clara Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky’s recall to be placed on the June 5 ballot after a petition calling for his removal garnered 95,000 signatures, making it eligible for a vote.

Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor who has led the recall effort, said she was “extremely grateful” to the volunteers and signatories who made the ballot vote possible.

“Brock Turner’s victim Emily Doe wrote that when she learned that Judge Persky had sentenced Turner to only a few months in jail she was ‘struck silent.’ Today the voters of Santa Clara County spoke up loud and clear,” Dauber told HuffPost on Tuesday.

Persky came under fire after his 2016 sentencing of Turner, who was a freshman at Stanford University when he was accused of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster on campus in 2015.

Turner faced up to 14 years in prison, but Persky sentenced him to six months in a county jail and three years of probation. He was released after just three months and was also required to register as a sex offender.

Turner filed an appeal to his sexual assault conviction in December.

The California Commission on Judicial Performance conducted an inquiry into possible misconduct by Persky following Turner’s trial and said it found no “clear and convincing evidence of bias.”

Persky has defended his action in the case. “California law requires every judge to consider rehabilitation and probation for first-time offenders,” he said in a statement. “It’s not always popular, but it’s the law, and I took an oath to follow it without regard to public opinion or any personal opinions I might have as a former prosecutor.”

But many advocates were outraged over what they felt to be an overly lenient verdict granted to Turner, in part based on his privilege as a white male and a star athlete.

“This historic campaign is part of a national social movement to end impunity for athletes and other privileged perpetrators of sexual assault and violence against women,” Dauber said.

In a devastating statement read out loud by the victim in court and published online on media outlets, the 23-year-old woman, referred to “Emily Doe” in news reports, described waking up in the hospital and being told she was a “rape victim.”

“I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up,” she wrote.

During the trial, she said, Turner’s attorneys asked her questions like, “What were you wearing” and “How much did you drink?”

Opponents of the recall effort, however, say Turner received a fair trial and that letting voters decide Persky’s fate would undermine the judicial system.

The Santa Clara County Bar Association opposes the proposed recall and has urged residents to vote “no” in June.

In a January op-ed for The Sacramento Bee, University of California, Berkeley’s law school dean Erwin Chemerinsky called the recall campaign “a threat to judicial independence.”

“Justice, and all of us, will suffer when judges base their decisions on what will satisfy the voters,” he wrote.

But Dauber disagreed, noting that Persky holds an elected position and stands for re-election every six years.
