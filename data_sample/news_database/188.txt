The Trump administration is “basically going to war” against California, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown warned Wednesday, citing Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision to sue his state over its policies aimed at shielding undocumented immigrants from a federal crackdown.

“It’s not wise, it’s not right and it will not stand,” Brown said in a press conference.

The Trump administration sued California late Tuesday over three laws meant to protect undocumented immigrants. But on Wednesday, the fight was in the court of public opinion, with Sessions and California Democrats holding dueling events casting one another as the villain in the country’s contentious battle over immigration policy in the Trump era.

In a speech in California announcing the administration’s suit, Sessions described the state’s Democrats as “lawless open borders radicals,” accused them of sheltering criminals from immigration authorities and likened their limitations on cooperating with federal immigration authorities to the Confederacy’s effort to secede from the Union in order to protect the institution of slavery.

“I understand that we have a wide variety of political opinions out there on immigration. But the law is in the books and its purposes are clear and just,” Sessions said. “There is no secession ... I would invite any doubters to go to Gettysburg, to the tombstones of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln.”

The Trump administration’s lawsuit seeks to block three California laws: One that prohibits business owners from voluntarily letting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers enter their property without a judicial warrant; a second measure that requires state inspections of immigrant detention facilities; and a third that bars local law enforcement officers from helping transfer people to ICE or telling the agency when they will release people from custody.

The Democrat-dominated California Assembly passed all three laws last year amid White House efforts to boost deportations. California is home to the nation’s largest population of undocumented immigrants.

Sessions characterized the challenged laws in stark terms, claiming that they effectively neutered ICE agents’ ability to safely detain criminals. But although the laws limit some of the ways employers and police can work with ICE, they don’t ban immigration agents from entering jails or workplaces, and include exceptions for immigrants convicted of serious crimes.

“There are three lies,” Brown said of Sessions’ comments. “Open borders, lie one. Protect criminals, lie two. California wants to secede, lie three. Not true.”

Brown took personal jabs at Sessions, calling his press conference in California a “political stunt” and describing the attorney general as “a fellow coming from Alabama talking to us about secession and protecting human and civil rights.” He called the Trump administration “full of liars” and said the Department of Justice special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia was “closing in.”

“Maybe [Sessions is] trying to keep his job because the president’s not too happy with him,” Brown said, a reference to Trump’s public hostility against his own attorney general. “I do think this is pure red meat for the base and I would assume ― but this is pure speculation ― that Jeff thinks that Donald will be happier with him and I’m sure Donald will be tweeting his joy at this particular performance.”

The escalating tensions mark the latest spat in a long-running feud between the Trump administration and California Democrats over the White House’s aggressive immigration tactics. Following the playbook of Texas Republicans during the Obama administration, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) has sued the Trump administration several times in federal court, seeking to block or delay construction of a proposed wall on the Mexican border and the rollback of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children from deportation.

“We are in the business of public safety, not deportations,” Becerra said Wednesday, alongside Brown.

Despite the political contention over California’s policies, most ICE arrests there continue to take place in jails or prisons, according to a declaration submitted to federal court alongside the DOJ’s complaint by the agency’s acting director, Thomas Homan. Last year, 17 percent of ICE’s 34,606 arrests in California were carried out “at large.”

At large arrests, however, have spiked in recent months, accounting for nearly 30 percent of ICE’s 8,588 apprehensions in California since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1, according to Homan.

““These California laws were very carefully written. When you look at the details, the laws build in some important exemptions to prepare for a case like this, where the federal government is claiming that they’re preempting federal law.”” - Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute.

Homan vowed to ramp up ICE efforts in California last year, following passage of one of the laws the Trump administration is now seeking to block in part. He has also called for public officials to be criminally prosecuted if they back so-called “sanctuary” policies that restrict police cooperation with ICE. Most recently, he criticized Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf for warning the public about reports of upcoming ICE arrests in the area.

Sessions took a jab at the mayor in his remarks, too, accusing her of “actively seeking to help illegal aliens.”

Sessions’ lawsuit argues that the three laws passed by California last year violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which dictates that the federal government sets immigration policy. The lawsuit also argues that the limitations on sharing information about suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails violates a provision of federal law requiring local authorities to provide ICE with information about the citizenship of the people in their custody.

But some legal analysts pointed out that the laws are narrowly tailored and loaded with exceptions that may fortify them against legal challenges.

“These California laws were very carefully written,” said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “When you look at the details, the laws build in some important exemptions to prepare for a case like this, where the federal government is claiming that they’re preempting federal law.”

The Trump administration probably would have challenged the laws even if it didn’t expect to win in court, immigration attorney David Leopold argued.Sarah McBride discusses her new book as part of the Build Series in New York on March 6, 2018. Noam Galai via Getty Images

Sarah McBride is a force to be reckoned with.

Since coming out as transgender while serving as the student body president at American University in Washington, D.C., six years ago, McBride has lived a public life that’s helped drive the mainstream movement for transgender equality.

With her passion for politics, LGBTQ rights and fighting for a more just society, McBride has gone from the White House, to the Democratic National Convention, to one of the most influential LGBTQ advocacy organizations in the world. She was the first openly transgender White House intern and the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention. She currently serves as the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign.

And now, McBride is detailing her history-making journey in her new memoir, Tomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality.

She stopped by the Build Series on Tuesday to chat with HuffPost Queer Voices Editor James Michael Nichols about the book and her life in the public eye.

“Everyone’s journey to coming out as transgender is different,” McBride said. “For me, I’ve know that I’m transgender my entire life. I think it’s really difficult for folks that aren’t transgender to really wrap their mind around the feeling of having a gender identity that differs from their sex assigned at birth. But for me, it felt like a constant feeling of homesickness. An unwavering ache in the pit of my stomach that would only go away when I could be seen and affirmed as myself.”

McBride’s highly emotional, even vulnerable, book also tells the story of her late husband, Andrew Cray. Andy, who was transgender as well, died of cancer just days after their wedding.

“What my relationship and his passing taught me in my work as an advocate is truly change cannot come fast enough,” McBride said. “Every single day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest.”

McBride had some suggestions for those who want to be allies for queer and trans people in creating a more just world. She said that allies should call and email their representatives on the issues, in particular nondiscrimination protections for trans people.

But this was her key piece of advice:

“The first thing we need allies to do is listen,” McBride said. “Come to us with a willingness to grow and evolve. You’re going to make mistakes and that’s fine, but be willing to listen and grow from those mistakes. I think that’s the most important trait an ally can have.”Tom Williams via Getty Images

More than five dozen congressmen who have retired or plan to retire next year have raised at least $32.8 million since the 2016 election, according to a MapLight analysis of campaign data. The 64 departing senators and representatives have accumulated $95.1 million in campaign funds.

At least $87.3 million in campaign funds raised by retiring lawmakers is stored in committee treasuries, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The surplus money can be transferred to a party, donated to other candidates, donated to a nonprofit foundation, or used to continue political activity of retiring lawmakers. Loopholes, however, are egregious and common. The remaining $7.8 million balance in “leadership committees” is subject to fewer restrictions and can be kept by the retiring lawmakers.

The excess campaign funds have accumulated as the Federal Election Commission considers a new rule proposed in March that would prevent retired lawmakers from continuing to use campaign funds for questionable expenditures that have included everything from the costs of private club memberships and monthly cell phone bills to consulting services paid by the campaign fund of a dead congressman. The FEC is accepting public comments on its proposal until Monday.

“It shows that there’s unanimous agreement on the part of the FEC that this is a problem,” said Brendan Fischer, a lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that pushed the commission into drafting the proposal. “It’s sending a signal to former officeholders you can’t use leftover campaign money as a slush fund.”

The retiring crop of lawmakers may still have a chance to use the money to their own benefit, said Fischer. The FEC is considering a two-year window to dispose of a surplus for retiring members of the House of Representatives, and a four-year window for retiring senators.

Sixty-four lawmakers have either retired or announced plans to retire in the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 White House victory. The retiring lawmakers include 45 Republicans who have declined to run for re-election. Eight House GOP members are leaving their seats to run for the Senate; five Republican lawmakers are running for governor.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced his plans to quit last month, will dispose of the largest war chest of any retiring lawmaker. The Wisconsin Republican reported $13.1 million in campaign funds at the end of March, roughly $2.7 million more than his balance at the end of 2016. At the end of March, Ryan’s campaign funds include $10.6 million in a committee fund and a $2.6 million balance in Prosperity Action, a leadership PAC.

Rep. Beto O’Rourke, a Texas Democrat, reported an $8 million campaign balance at the end of March, about a $7.6 million increase over his 2016 balance. O’Rourke, who doesn’t have a leadership PAC, is using the campaign committee funds in his bid to unseat unpopular incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, a first-term Republican.

O’Rourke is among eight retiring Democrats running for a different office. Two Democrats ― Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan ― resigned in December after being accused of sexually harassing women.Gary Oldman’s son is defending the actor against domestic abuse allegations following his Best Actor win at the Oscars.

Gulliver Oldman, the “Darkest Hour” star’s 20-year-old son, released a statement saying his father’s alleged abuse of ex-wife Donya Fiorentino ― Gulliver’s mother ― “didn’t happen.”

“In the case of my father, there is only innocence. There never has been any guilt,” Gulliver Oldman wrote, slamming “clickbait journalism” for perpetuating the allegation.

“I can see how coming out with a statement to combat an allegation must look. However, I was there at the time of the ‘incident,’ so I’d like to make this radiantly clear: it didn’t happen. Anyone who says it did is lying,” he continued, also expressing support for the Time’s Up and Me Too movements.

The British actor picked up one of the awards ceremony’s most coveted prizes on Sunday, but the conversation surrounding his win has largely been dominated by Fiorentino’s allegations.

In 2001, Fiorentino, a former model, accused Oldman of choking and beating her with a telephone in the presence of their children, Gulliver and and his younger brother Charlie.

Gary Oldman has described the claim as “replete with lies, innuendos and half-truths.” Police investigated, but filed no charges. He was awarded sole legal and physical custody of the couple’s sons, which Gulliver cites as further evidence of innocence.

“Custody of children is not given to a wife beater, and under most circumstances, hardly ever a man,” he wrote.

After the Oscars ceremony ― the first in the wake of Hollywood’s reckoning with sexual harassment and violence ― Fiorentino gave an interview calling out the awards’ hypocrisy.

“Congratulations, Gary and congratulations to the Academy for awarding not one but two abusers with Oscars,” Fiorentino told TMZ in an article published Monday. “I thought we had evolved. What happened to the #MeToo movement?”

Gulliver said he ceased communication with his mother seven years ago, after concluding he and his brother were pawns in a “big game our mother has been desperately trying to play against our father.”

“She has been a sad and very troubled person most of her life,” he wrote. “Yes, she brought me into this world. She didn’t however, teach me how to be a part of it.”

Gary Oldman later married writer and curator Gisele Schmidt, who has accompanied him and his sons on many awards season red carpets.Ricky Martin says he’ll “definitely connect” with Gus Kenworthy, after a post-Oscars meetup between the two led to a seriously flirtatious Instagram post.

On Monday, Kenworthy recalled a conversation he and his boyfriend, Matthew Wilkas, had with Martin and his husband, Jwan Yosef, at the Academy Awards Sunday night.

The Olympic freeskier posted a photo of himself and Wilkas at Vanity Fair’s Oscar party. His caption was written as a parody of a Craigslist “Missed Connections” entry.

He called Martin and Yosef “gorgeous” and said that he and Wilkas “searched for you both for the rest of the night but never found you again.”

“In town for a week,” he wrote. “Let’s connect.”

A post shared by gus kenworthy (@guskenworthy) on Mar 5, 2018 at 5:02pm PST

Appearing on CBS’ “The Talk” Tuesday, Martin said he and Yosef were “flattered” by Kenworthy’s compliments.

“That is so cute ― and clever,” the Latin pop superstar said, as seen in the video above. “I mean, he’s a national hero. Give me a break!”

Martin said the four would “definitely connect,” and, addressing Kenworthy directly, slyly added, “I love you, brother.”

Not one to miss a beat, Kenworthy tweeted:

*clears schedule for the rest of the week* https://t.co/E1bOeAPLYq — Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) March 6, 2018

Though it’s unclear exactly what Kenworthy’s intentions are, Martin made headlines in February after he implied that he was using his role on “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” to “normalize another kind of reality for open relationships.”

Kufrin’s new looking-for-love gig on ABC came to light during Tuesday’s “The Bachelor: After the Final Rose” ― which also featured Luyendyk proposing to the finalist he had originally spurned, Lauren Burnham.

Kufrin, a 27-year-old publicist from Prior Lake, Minnesota, took the high road, forgiving Luyendyk and embracing her new reality.

“I want to be the best damn Bachelorette I can be,” she said, per E! News. “So I’m so excited. I want to find love.”Pixar’s “Coco” completed its award season sweep Sunday when it nabbed Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song.

For many fans, the film’s loving portrayal of Mexican culture ― as seen through its young protagonist, Miguel, as he ventures through the Land of the Dead ― stands as a testament to the power of diversity in family-friendly films.

If the “Coco” creators have their way, the film will pave the way for more representation of marginalized groups, including the LGBTQ community, in animated Pixar features in the future.

Fielding questions from reporters backstage at the Academy Awards, producer Darla K. Anderson said an LGBTQ-inclusive Pixar movie would be “a dream.”

“‘Coco’ is a great example of diversity and representation, and the success of that,” Anderson said. “All of us would very excited to have characters like that represented as protagonist role in every realm.” (Her comments come at 6:01 in the video above.)

“That would be a dream,” she continued. “That would be a hope, and we are all talking about all kinds of things like that right now.”

Earlier in the evening, Anderson thanked her wife, Kori Rae, while accepting the award for Best Animated Feature. (Watch the full speeches below)

The film’s co-director, Adrian Molina, followed suit, thanking his family, the Latino community and his husband, Ryan Dooley, for “expanding my sense of what it means of to be proud of who you are and where you’re from.”

Social media users quickly praised their words.

Pixar is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, which has made a number of strides toward LGBTQ representation in recent years. The 2017 live-action “Beauty and the Beast” reboot made headlines after director Bill Condon announced that the film would include a gay character ― LeFou, the goofy sidekick to villain Gaston ― for the first time in the company’s history. (Some critics, however, felt the “exclusively gay moment” Condon promised was a letdown.)

Meanwhile, fans have been enthusiastically lobbying for Disney to give Elsa, the heroine of “Frozen,” a girlfriend in the smash film’s forthcoming sequel.

“Frozen” writer and co-director Jennifer Lee has been coy on whether or not Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, would have a same-sex love interest in the future.A split screen shows Arie Luyendyk Jr. breaking up with Becca Kufrin on national television during ABC's "The Bachelor" finale. ABC

“Fair warning: It might just be the most emotional scene ever,” said “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison to a live audience. And so began 60 minutes of the most brutal and compelling television “The Bachelor”franchise has ever brought to the masses.

On Monday night, the fairytale ending “The Bachelor” normally delivers took a dark and twisty turn. Arie Luyendyk Jr., former race car driver and human incarnation of “meh,” followed the script of “Bachelor” love and proposed to Becca Kufrin at the show’s conclusion. But at some point between mid-November and mid-January, he had a change of heart and decided to end his engagement to Becca to pursue runner-up Lauren Burnham.

Just as Arie and Becca’s love story would play out on national television, so, inevitably, would its demise. “Bachelor” producers filmed the post-season breakup, and we, the viewers, ended up in a room we otherwise never would (and perhaps never should) have had access to.

The cameras captured every uncomfortable drawn-out pause, every stomach-churning moment of realization as it dawned on Becca that she was being left for a woman she’d said had absolutely nothing in common with her. There was no music, no editing, none of the overly produced artifice we’ve come to expect from the franchise. Just two people going through an excruciating breakup ― one that would be broadcast to millions.

The cameras continued to follow Becca post-breakup. Viewers saw her looking downtrodden as she wheeled her luggage out of Los Angeles, her plane ride back to Minneapolis (in a middle seat!) and her teary-eyed perusal of old photos and videos of her and Arie.

This is the kind of television that draws us in even as it repels us, and the ratings bear that conclusion out. Arie’s season has been, by all accounts, a snoozefest. As BuzzFeed reported, the season’s average viewership was 6.2 million viewers, with a 1.7 rating among 18 to 49-year-olds. But on Monday night, those numbers shot up ― 7.8 million people tuned in, earning the “The Bachelor” a 2.2 rating for that same valuable demographic.

And people weren’t just watching the show; they were talking about it. A Twitter spokesperson told HuffPost that there were more than 530,000 tweets about “The Bachelor” finale, making it the third-most-tweeted-about episode ever. In weeks prior, the number of “Bachelor”-related tweets had lingered around 100,000.

We might hate ourselves for not having the strength or desire to look away from that brutal breakup scene. We might tweet angrily at ABC for putting Becca in such a cruel position in the first place. We might call it emotional torture porn. We might feel ill. But we still watch.

How did this breakup end up on camera? Seems like a private conversation. We don’t belong in this conversation....but im still watching #TheBachelor — Benjamin Higgins (@benhiggi) March 6, 2018

In the moment, it feels almost impossible to wrench our eyes from the screen, or to still our fingers from tweeting about it. The finale was so compelling, its appeal felt like dark magic. By intruding so completely on this intimate moment ― a couple’s heart-wrenching breakup, shown in real time, unedited ― the show made viewers feel as if we were standing, helplessly, just a few feet away from the long gray couch as Becca attempted to wrap her mind around being dumped.

We watch “The Bachelor,” at least in part, because it taps into themes that are largely universal: love, desire, heartbreak. Many of us spend years grappling with what love should look like or whether the love we’ve found is the right one or whether we’ll ever find it at all.

We have our hearts stomped on, we break up with people we once adored, and we ruminate on the feelings those experiences leave with us for years to come. But aside from watching a Tinder date at a bar or eavesdropping on a public breakup, we rarely get to witness those experiences from the outside. To do so feels wrong ― we certainly wouldn’t want our break-ups to be closely observed in this way. And yet simultaneously, it’s deeply satisfying, almost cathartic, to watch. We can’t separate the hypnotic attraction of Monday’s breakup scene from the queasy sense that it’s invasive, voyeuristic, not for our eyes.

“This is the kind of television that draws us in even as it repels us, and the ratings bear that conclusion out.”

“The Bachelor” encapsulates the appeal of this genre of TV: It’s somehow both durable and unsustainable. The show garners healthy ratings year after year after year ― it’s been on the air, along with various spin-offs, since 2002 ― but there’s indisputably an arms race within the show itself. “The Bachelor” needs to continually top its own past dramatics. If one Bachelor asks a woman to keep dating him, the next needs to propose on TV. Once all the leads are proposing on TV, we need a live wedding special.

The same is true of emotional torment. Arie wasn’t the first lead to flip-flop after the finale, ditching his chosen bride for the runner-up ― that honor goes to Jason Mesnick, Bachelor No. 13. (Mesnick ditched his first choice, Melissa Rycroft, and married the runner-up, Molly Malaney. The couple have a family together.) The Mesnick switch-up was luridly exploited for ratings as well; Jason sat Melissa down in a studio with Chris Harrison to explain that he wanted to pursue Molly instead. But the pomp and circumstance of this meeting would have tipped off even a clueless Melissa ― and, in fact, Jason later stated that the couple had separated before their interview taped, though she did not yet know of his feelings for Molly.

If Arie was going to follow in Jason’s footsteps, the show couldn’t just play out the same predictable beats. “The Bachelor” needed to top itself again. Producers needed to capture, on camera, the moment that an unsuspecting Becca first heard that her engagement with Arie was coming to an end. They needed to make it feel as real, as unrehearsed, as unfiltered as possible. And they did.

Even this season’s cast seemed ambivalent about whether privacy or entertainment value should have come first. Caroline Lunny, a contestant who befriended Becca on the show, told Harrison on Tuesday night’s “After the Final Rose” special, “I think we all kind of needed to see it, I guess ... but I just don’t think it’s something we actually should have seen.” Exactly.

But if “The Bachelor” and its history have taught us anything, it should be this: We haven’t reached the limit. There is always some greater betrayal of the contestants’ privacy, some deeper level of invasiveness to plumb, all done in the name of ratings. And “The Bachelor” will keep pushing further, because we will never be equally compelled by this level of voyeurism again. To replicate this phenomenon, the show will have to dissolve the boundaries between TV and life even further.

“We have our hearts stomped on, we break up with people we once adored, and we ruminate on the feelings those experiences leave with us for years to come. But we rarely get to witness those experiences from the outside. To do so feels wrong. And yet simultaneously, it’s deeply satisfying.”

Where, then, is the limit? The limit is what the market will bear. “The Bachelor” will stop exploiting its contestants’ heartbreak for ratings when the ratings disappear. Based on the reaction to this week’s finale, we’re nowhere close to hitting that limit.

That’s the true love story being enacted annually on “The Bachelor”: the one between real life and TV artifice. There’s an undeniable pull between them, one that’s electrifying and yet disturbing to watch. The more entwined they become, the more they’re both weakened.

For Becca, the blurring of real life and TV life continues. Deprived of the fairytale ending she was supposed to receive, “The Bachelor” offered her another option: Wrest control over her tragic narrative and become the center of a new one. She may or may not find lasting happiness among the 30 chiseled men the casting department has surely already selected to woo her, but at least it will make for great television.

The actress and talk show maven generated presidential buzz earlier this year after giving a rousing speech at the Golden Globe Awards. But weeks later, she appeared to shoot down speculation about a potential 2020 run against President Donald Trump, saying she prayed over the issue but hadn’t heard back.

“‘God, if you think I’m supposed to run, you gotta tell me, and it has to be so clear that not even I can miss it,’” she recounted to People Magazine. “And I haven’t gotten that yet.”

On Tuesday night, Winfrey may have finally heard from the deity on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show.”

“God stops by every once in a while,” Colbert said when “God” ― a recurring character on the show ― spoke from above the audience. “He’s a fan.”

Turns out God’s not just a fan of Colbert. He also has a sign for Winfrey.Miami Heat basketball star Dwyane Wade dropped by Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday to thank students for their inspiring response to last month’s mass shooting at their Parkland, Florida, campus.

Students and school staff flooded social media with photos and videos from Wade’s visit. The shooting guard, who has called for gun safety in the wake of the massacre, spoke as students excitedly crowded around him.

“I just wanted to come and say I’m inspired by all of you,” Wade told the students, many of whom are involved in organizing the upcoming March for Our Lives to demand stronger gun legislation.

“As someone out here in the public eye, I’m proud to say I’m from this state because of you guys, because of the future of this world because of you guys,” he continued.

Wade, who was traded back to the Heat just a week before a teen gunman killed 17 students and faculty members at the high school on Feb. 14, has vowed to help spotlight the victims and the survivors’ fight for gun control.

He said he was especially touched after learning one of the teenaged victims, Joaquin Oliver, was buried in a Heat jersey bearing Wade’s name and number.

“You’re about to make me cry,” Wade tweeted when he learned of Joaquin’s burial. He dedicated this season to the teen, saying in a tweet: “This is why we will not just SHUT up and dribble!” ― a response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham urging basketball players to stay out of the gun control discussion.

Wade invited Oliver’s family to a Heat game earlier this month and delivered an emotional tribute at the time.

“We honor the 17 lives that were tragically lost in Parkland,” he said. “We applaud the fearless students that are fighting for their lives. We will also make sure that their voices are heard around gun safety. You are our nation’s inspiration. We salute you and we support you.”

Neither the Heat nor the high school immediately responded to HuffPost’s request for more details about Wade’s visit.

A man accused of raping a Yale classmate on Halloween 2015 was found not guilty Wednesday by a New Haven, Connecticut, jury after a trial of less than two weeks.

A woman referred to only as Jane Doe, now 24, accused Saifullah Khan, now 25, of raping her in her dorm room after she had vomited multiple times from drinking too much alcohol. Khan said that Doe had initiated the sexual encounter, which she said she barely remembered.

Khan was found not guilty on all charges of sexual assault in the first, second, third and fourth degrees after his lawyers cast doubt on Doe’s memory and called attention to her clothing. The defense also alleged that Yale officials had influenced the investigation carried out by the university’s own police force, in an effort to prove that Yale took sexual assault seriously.

Research shows that sexual assault occurs on college campuses nationwide, yet relatively few incidents are reported to authorities and even fewer make it to trial. Just how few is unknown. According to the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN, 11.2 percent of undergraduate and graduate students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation. Yet a whopping 89 percent of colleges reported zero incidents of rape in 2015, according to a May 2017 American Association of University Women report using data from the Department of Education.

Doe and Khan were both seniors at the time of the alleged assault. While Doe has graduated, Khan, an Afghanistan native studying cognitive science, was suspended in November 2015 and has not returned to the school.

A jury heard testimony from Doe, Khan, law enforcement and various witnesses beginning Feb. 26.

Doe told the jurors that she became inebriated after consuming two rum-and-cokes, one shot of hard liquor and two cups of wine at a 2015 Halloween party, the Yale Daily News reported. Her friends testified that she did not typically drink very much, if at all, according to the New Haven Register.

Later in the evening, Doe accompanied friends to a Yale Symphony Orchestra concert, but said she vomited at the show and left to use the bathroom. After she was denied re-entry due to her intoxication, Doe said she went back to her dorm, accompanied by Khan. When they got to her room, Doe said Khan restrained and raped her. She also said that Khan took her phone and sent text messages to her friends to let them know she made it back safely.

Khan denied the rape accusation and characterized their sexual encounter as consensual, the Register reported. In Khan’s telling, Doe did not appear too intoxicated to consent. The pair had flirted during the concert, he said. When they returned to her dorm, Khan said she did not appear to have difficulty walking.

Khan’s attorney Norm Pattis offered an alternate explanation for surveillance footage showing his client supporting Doe as she appeared to stagger forward, the Register wrote.

“How many times have you seen young lovers walk across campus in just such a pose? Does it look to you like two lovers out for a stroll?” Pattis asked the jury.

Doe testified that she went to a sexual assault counseling center following the alleged incident and then to a hospital to be tested for venereal disease. Hospital photos of bruises on Doe’s legs were shown in court.

“What transformed that night from happy into a nightmare was she miscalculated her own tolerance for alcohol,” Supervisory Assistant State’s Attorney Michael Pepper said in his closing arguments. “She ate too little and drank too much. But that’s not criminal. And it doesn’t absolve the defendant,” he said.

In his closing argument, Pattis drew attention to Doe’s outfit that night, a “short skirt and tube top,” and suggested she was “dressed to party.”

“She made up this story because she can’t face the fact that the one night when she took a walk on the wild side, she’s got to face her friends the next day,” Pattis said. “I think she let her friends convince her she’d been raped.”

A representative for the prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trials over alleged sexual assault on campus may become even less frequent under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who last year ordered her department to roll back Obama-era rules that aimed to reform systemic mishandling of such cases under Title IX. (Title IX requires the Department of Education to protect students from gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and assault.)A photo of one of the postcards the stunt artists planted in the American Museum of Natural History's gift shop. Clean Money Project

The latest attempt to pressure the American Museum of Natural History to sever ties with billionaire Rebekah Mercer asks for her to exit through the gift shop.

A New York-based political stunt group calling itself the Clean Money Project planted spoof gifts in the museum store and staged fake exhibit signs on Monday in a bid to highlight the hypocrisy of allowing Mercer, a major donor, to remain on its board of directors.

The group put postcards on display with Mercer’s picture and the words “climate change denier and museum board member” alongside Isaac Newton with the slogan “global warming is a myth” and Albert Einstein facetiously quoted as saying, “There’s no way to prove climate change is related to fossil fuels.” The group posted a video of the stunt on YouTube.

Mercer has donated $4.1 million to the museum over the past four years through her family’s foundation, and has sat on the board since 2013.

The Long Island heiress to her father’s hedge fund fortune also funded and orchestrated candidate Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, bankrolled the right-wing news site Breitbart and donated millions to climate change denial think tanks. More than 200 scientists launched a campaign in January demanding that the museum remove Mercer, whom they called an “anti-science propagandist,” from the board.

A similar effort in 2015 forced fossil fuel billionaire David Koch, one of the top financiers behind the climate denial movement, to leave the museum board.

The stunt this week was not connected to the campaign. A member of the group spoke on condition of anonymity to prevent security officials from identifying him in future projects, but HuffPost confirmed his identity.

“We want Rebekah Mercer off the board, and we do think the Natural History Museum is complicit in allowing these people to be two-faced,” he said. “They’re giving them credibility when they are spending much more money battling science and undermining science.”

The satirical products also included bottled “fracking water” branded with the Koch brothers’ name and flammability warnings, a 2019 calendar celebrating the “beauty of CO2” with photos of smokestacks, and an empty two-foot box advertising a “home fracking set” that looked like a kids’ chemistry kit.

In various wings of the museum, the group left behind framed signs proclaiming a new “Breitbart evolution wing” sponsored by Mercer and a Koch Enterprises-funded “fossil-fuel appreciation wing.”

“The Museum doesn’t have anything to add to the information you already have,” Roberto Lebron, a museum spokesman, said in regards to the group’s stunt via email Wedensday.

The Mercer Family Foundation has donated generously to climate misinformation groups in recent years, contributing nearly $5.9 million to the Heartland Institute, a leading proponent of climate science denial, between 2008 and 2016, according to previously unreleased tax filings reviewed and published by HuffPost in January.

The foundation increased spending on climate denial in recent years. The family gave $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition, an organization born from the ashes of the defunct George C. Marshall Institute, which denied global warming and lobbied against the science behind acid rain and carcinogens in cigarette smoke. It also provided $125,000 to the Arizona-based Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, an oil-funded think tank run by former Peabody Energy executive Craig Idso.

The foundation donated nearly $2.3 million to the Donors Trust, a fundraising organization nicknamed “the dark-money ATM of the conservative movement” that does not take an official position on climate change but has for years directed money to denial proponents.

In a rare and widely derided public statement in February, Mercer dismissed accusations that she is “anti-science” as “absurd smears.”

“I oppose politicized science, in which researchers cannot study certain subjects — or even ask certain questions — for fear of career-ending backlash and persecution,” she wrote in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal. “These beliefs shape my philanthropy and my political activity.”KANSAS CITY, Kan. ― In mid-October, on the last day he could register to vote ahead of the Nov. 4, 2014, midterm elections, Charles Stricker went to the DMV in Wichita. When he checked in, Stricker, who had just moved to Kansas, was told he didn’t have all the documents he needed to get a driver’s license. So he went home, put all the documents together and rushed back to the DMV. He wanted to make sure he got there in time because at the DMV he could do both: get his license and register to vote in time.

He showed the DMV clerk the folder of documents he brought, including his birth certificate from Missouri, and thought he had successfully registered to vote. The officials at the DMV told him his permanent license and voter information would come in the mail in a few weeks.

Stricker, who is 37 and works as a hotel manager, went to vote with his wife when the polls opened on Nov. 4. By that time he had gotten his permanent driver’s license, but when he went to sign in at the polls, they told him his name wasn’t on the list. He thought it was a mistake, maybe because he had registered at the last minute, and he asked to speak with the person in charge to try and figure out what the problem was. Eventually he was given a provisional ballot, but instead of getting a private booth to fill out his ballot like everyone else, he was sent to a white plastic table, where everyone could see how he was marking his votes. He could see who the person next to him was voting for, and he was pretty sure she could see who he was voting for. He said he felt humiliated.

Since 2013, Kansas has required anyone who registers to vote to prove they are a U.S. citizen. Even though Stricker had brought his birth certificate to the DMV that day, election officials said they couldn’t prove he was a citizen, so they blocked his registration.

On Tuesday, Stricker was one of three Kansans who testified in a closely watched federal lawsuit challenging the law. Stricker and a handful of other Kansas voters are the plaintiffs in the case and contend the law violates a federal requirement that state agencies can only ask people the minimum amount of information necessary to assess their eligibility to vote when they give them the opportunity to register. To justify the law, Kansas officials have to prove that such a restrictive registration policy is justified by a substantial number of noncitizens on the voting rolls. In many ways, that is the same question at the heart of the national debate over voter fraud, which several studies have shown is not a widespread problem.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who is a defendant in the case and is serving as his own lawyer, questioned how much of a burden it would have been for Stricker to prove he was a citizen to election officials, noting that there was an election office near the hotel where he worked, so he could have taken his birth certificate there during his lunch hour. Stricker said he frequently works nearly 12-hour days and often eats lunch at his desk. Plus, in 2014 he had just started a new job and was wary about taking a lunch hour to go to the election office. He has since refused to register on principle, saying an average Kansan shouldn’t have to take legal action to register. The Kansas law has also been blocked since 2016, when a federal judge stepped in and issued a temporary injunction, a decision that allowed 18,000 people who had tried to register at the DMV but failed to prove their citizenship to vote that year.

Sue Becker, an attorney for Kobach’s office similarly pressed Donna Bucci, 59, about how difficult it would have been for her to prove she was a citizen. Bucci, who was born in Maryland, tried to register to vote in 2013, but her name was purged from the rolls because she didn’t have a birth certificate or a passport and couldn’t prove she was a citizen. Becker asked Bucci how difficult it would have been for her to call the secretary of state’s office to explain her situation during a break at work.

Bucci explained that she works as a cook in a prison from 3 a.m. to noon and can’t have her cellphone in the building.

A big part of the case will be whether Kobach can show that current federal law is not doing enough to combat voter fraud. The federal form to register to vote requires a person to swear under penalty of perjury that he or she is a citizen, a safeguard Kobach said Tuesday was too weak and “like nothing.”

Since 2000, Kobach’s office has identified only 129 noncitizens who registered to vote or attempted to register, but he cites a study by political scientist Jesse Richman that indicated as many as 18,000 noncitizens could be on the rolls in the state. As of October 2016, there were more than 1.8 million registered voters in Kansas.

Even though Kobach argued there could be substantial voter fraud in Kansas, he conceded that the court would have to define what substantial meant. The American Civil Liberities Union, which is representing the plaintiffs, said voter fraud was insignificant because it is such a small percentage of the overall voting population in Kansas.

Kobach said one could also take “substantial” to mean a small number of illegitimate voters who could end up swinging a close local election. He urged the court to evaluate the proof-of-citizenship law through a kind of intermediate standard and consider whether enough noncitizens were getting around the proof-of-citizenship requirement to render it insignificant.

He spent much of the afternoon questioning Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who is serving as an expert witness in the case about an analysis he prepared showing that over 35,000 people in the state had been affected by the proof-of-citizenship law and that it disproportionately affected first-time voters, who are usually young. But Kobach countered that McDonald had not analyzed how many noncitizens there were among those affected and had not fully examined all the possibilities for why people might be removed from the list.

Kobach is running for governor of Kansas and has drawn national attention for his staunch conservative views on immigration and voter fraud. The courtroom at the Robert J. Dole federal courthouse was packed with about 100 people for the opening statements in the case, which was filed in 2016. Joe Cheray said she woke up before 6 a.m. and drove from Topeka to make it in time for the opening statements at 9 a.m.

There were a few moments of befuddlement throughout Tuesday.

Within the first hour of the trial, lawyers for the ACLU complained Kobach had sent them a document at 10:45 p.m. Monday and they had not had time to review it. Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, declined to let Kobach use the documents in court.

Robinson also rebuked Kobach and his team throughout the day for not following usual procedures for entering documents as evidence, at one point having to remind them that they should know something because it was “Evidence 101.” At another point in the afternoon, lawyers and Robinson had to sort through the confusion of a reply-all email thread because the court had incorrect email addresses for Kobach and some of his team and ACLU lawyers had sent documents to those incorrect addresses.

Kobach also pointed to several of McDonald’s tweets in an effort to discredit McDonald’s expertise and show McDonald had a personal bias against him (McDonald said he did not). In one of the tweets Kobach pointed to, McDonald had referred to a CNN report in which someone in Vice President Mike Pence’s office referred to working with Kobach as a “shit sandwich.”

When Kobach asked him whether or not the tweets showed a personal bias, McDonald said they did not.House GOP leaders Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy at the Capitol on May 16.

WASHINGTON ― With GOP support for a farm bill wavering among moderates and conservatives, Republican leaders are facing a dilemma that may force them into a deal this week to at least temporarily kill a discharge petition on immigration ― or not.

House Freedom Caucus leaders emerged Tuesday night with a plan for more than a dozen members to withhold support for the farm bill until leaders agreed to vote on the so-called Goodlatte bill, a hawkish immigration measure authored by Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the judiciary committee. Republican immigration advocates are using the Goodlatte bill as a vehicle to get a vote on a plan addressing the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program that Democrats would support.

But members of the Freedom Caucus, seeing how close the chamber is to getting a vote on a Democratic-preferred DACA measure, is using their leverage on the farm bill to secure a vote on the Goodlatte bill to, in their minds, effectively kill the DACA discharge petition and reset the clock on when GOP moderates and Democrats could get a vote on the issue. The problem with this plan is that it isn’t clear whether voting on Goodlatte would kill the discharge petition.

Discharge petitions are used to bypass leadership decisions on which bills get a vote and can bring a bill to the floor with a minimum of 218 signatures. The current discharge petition is on a rule that would bring up Goodlatte and a number of other immigration proposals. Although conservatives in the Freedom Caucus think dispensing with Goodlatte would render the rule moot, it’s possible that the Republicans and Democrats who support the discharge petition could change the rule.

The uncertainty over the gambit is adding to the shakiness of the farm bill, as well as the Goodlatte bill, but GOP leaders say they would like to avoid all these complications by voting on the Goodlatte proposal only if it has the votes to pass.

The problem with that idea is that its author has shown little willingness to alter the legislation to make it more palatable to his fellow Republicans, and there may be a key number of Republicans who would side with Democrats for a solution for immigrants affected by DACA.

These issues would normally be separate from the farm bill, which reauthorizes certain farm subsidies for five years and provides money for food stamps, but the Freedom Caucus wants to use the weak support for the farm bill as leverage.

“GOP aides said the clearest path to victory on the farm bill may be to just give conservatives what they want.”

Nearly all Democrats intend to vote against the farm bill, and that, coupled with at least a dozen moderate Republicans signaling strong opposition to the bill and at least another dozen conservatives who understand the power they have to extract an immigration concession, means Republicans just don’t have the votes. And because moderates look far more immovable than conservatives on the farm bill, the GOP leadership is forced to deal with the representatives whose votes can be bought.

Some Republicans from New Jersey and New York and possibly some from Pennsylvania look poised to vote against the farm bill when it’s supposed to come up for a vote on Friday, no matter what, and a smattering of other members could have problems too, particularly if the right ― or wrong ― amendments are adopted or rejected.

That means GOP leaders don’t have the votes to pass the bill if more than a dozen conservatives oppose the legislation. And with leadership stating its preference to avoid the discharge petition anyway, GOP aides said the clearest path to victory on the farm bill may be to just give conservatives what they want ― only that may change if the gambit to kill the discharge petition wouldn’t work anyway.

What conservatives ultimately want is still up in the air. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Tuesday night that he wanted a vote on the Goodlatte bill to happen concurrently with the farm bill so that leaders couldn’t go back on their word, but he also said he could give GOP leaders some leeway if they promised to hold a vote, say, next week.

Of course, that was when Meadows was under the belief that voting on Goodlatte would at least delay the discharge petition. Now conservatives may regroup and think of a different ask. But even if Republicans reach a deal among themselves, they may still have problems passing the farm bill. There are still a significant number of moderates opposing the bill, and there are likely a few conservatives who will vote “no” regardless of whether leadership cuts a deal, particularly if there’s no feasible agreement on immigration.

Passage could come down to how many Democrats support the bill, and not many are expected to vote “yes.”

Another potential issue concerns the Republicans who support the discharge petition. On Wednesday, those Republicans seemed to be caught flat-footed by the Freedom Caucus’ gambit. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who told HuffPost she is voting against the farm bill, said she hadn’t heard anything about conservatives trying to kill the discharge petition. And Mario Diaz-Balart, another pro-immigration Republican from Florida, said he was concentrating on appropriations (though he said he supported the farm bill).

GOP moderates could still band together to oppose the farm bill if their leadership worked out some mechanism to give conservatives what they want by somehow killing the discharge petition, but there seems to be no organized effort to do that at the moment.

Republicans have acknowledged that passing the farm bill with only GOP votes would be difficult, but they now find themselves negotiating against different factions of the conference.

The farm bill combines welfare for farmers and the much bigger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is commonly known as food stamps and is one of the federal government’s biggest anti-poverty programs. It helps 40 million Americans buy food every month.

Most Republicans in Congress think there are too many people on the program who should be working instead, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said reforming SNAP would make it easier for employers to fill available jobs.

The bill would expand a SNAP work requirement ― which currently applies to recipients ages 18 to 49 who don’t have minor children or disabilities ― to people in their 50s and parents of minors older than 6. There would be several exemptions, but generally, the requirement would be to work 20 hours a week or spend that amount of time in an approved activity, such as enrollment in a government training program that the legislation would create.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the expanded work requirement would reduce enrollment by an additional 1.2 million people in 2028. With no policy change, the office expects enrollment to decline by 8 million by then because of the improving economy. But some moderates ― and almost all Democrats ― see those changes as an assault on food stamps.

There’s also a significant battle brewing over sugar subsidies in the farm bill. Some members from areas where sugar is grown want higher prices, while companies using it to make products like candy and soda want cheaper sugar.A group of black women are honoring Harriet Tubman this Women’s History Month by taking a 100-mile trek to retrace her escape from slavery to freedom on the Underground Railroad.

The women, who are part of black health and wellness advocacy organization GirlTrek, began their journey in eastern Maryland on Tuesday and will end after crossing the Mason-Dixon Line into Delaware on Saturday.

The group includes the 10-woman GirlTrek national team, whose members come from cities like Sacramento and New Orleans. Other women have also been joining in and sharing photos of the journey on social media. In just the first day, they walked more than 22 miles.

GirlTrek co-founder T. Morgan Dixon hopes the walk will inspire all black women to put themselves and their health first. The women are documenting their journey with the hashtag #HarrietsGreatEscape.

“We will show and prove that 2018 is about radical courage and unshakeable sisterhood,” Dixon said in a statement. “Harriet Tubman saved her own life first and then went back time after time to save the lives of others giving us the blueprint for the work GirlTrek does today.”

Each year since the 100th anniversary of Harriet Tubman’s death in 2013, GirlTrek has honored Tubman through the hashtag #WeAreHarriet. As part of the group’s mission to improve black women’s health, the tribute encourages black women to get active by simply walking.

According to the 2017 Institute for Women’s Policy Research report “The Status of Black Women in United States,” 1 in 7 black women has diabetes. Black women also have the highest heart disease mortality rate of any ethnic group in the U.S. These statistics reflect a history of American society neglecting and devaluing black women’s health.

“We’ve learned to be invisible even to ourselves,” said GirlTrek member Theresa Thames in a video. “We’ll take care of everyone else, but we will neglect ourselves because that is the trauma. It’s the trauma of history and it’s the trauma of life.”

Clearly, he was a very good boy.

Queen of social media Chrissy Teigen made the internet collectively cry on Wednesday when she announced on Instagram and Twitter that her bulldog, Puddy, had died and “gone on to the pup heavens.”

“He was there for everything. Every time I needed a taste tester, someone to kiss or needed to sob into his stinky rolls, he was there,” Teigen wrote. “I always knew I would lose a piece of me when he left us. I feel the hole now. I will love you forever, my boy. My heart aches.”
