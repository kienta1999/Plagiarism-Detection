Israeli police have recommended that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges, after police agreed last week there was sufficient evidence to charge him, Israeli media reported Tuesday.

Netanyahu responded to the reports in a live address Tuesday afternoon, saying he will continue to lead Israel and that the recommendations against him will “end with nothing.”

The nation’s prime minister since 2009, he could face indictment after a monthslong investigation into two separate allegations of corruption. The police findings will be examined by state prosecutors and the attorney general, which could take months, The New York Times reported.

In a first case, known as Case 1000, investigators have looked at whether Netanyahu accepted bribes from billionaire donors, including Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.

In Case 2000, Netanyahu faced claims he entered into a deal with the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in which he would receive favorable coverage in exchange for weakening a rival publication by restricting its circulation. Both the prime minister and the publisher, Arnon Mozes, have denied that the conversations, leaked in transcripts to the media, were serious discussions.

Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing in both cases. In a Facebook video published last week in response to news of the impending recommendation, the prime minister maintained his innocence and said the investigations would turn up “nothing.”

“Many of you are asking, what will happen? So I want to reassure you: There will be nothing, because I know the truth,” he said, according to a translation of his address. “I’m sure that at the end of the day the qualified legal factors will come to one conclusion, the simple truth: There is nothing.”

In a follow-up statement, also posted to Facebook last week, the prime minister criticized the investigation and claimed “a great shadow” had been “imposed tonight on police investigations in the matter of Prime Minister Netanyahu.”

“Any fair-minded person will ask themselves how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can investigate him objectively and make recommendations in his case without bias,” he wrote.

Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said in August that if Netanyahu were to be indicted on corruption charges, he would not be obligated to resign.

Netanyahu is serving his fourth term as Israel’s prime minister, the second time he has held the position after formerly being elected to the office from 1996 to 1999.A suspected poacher was found dead last week after being killed and partially eaten by lions, according to reports out of South Africa.

The victim was attacked on Friday night. His remains were discovered on Saturday at a private game reserve near Kruger National Park, Sky News reported.

“It seems the victim was poaching in the game park when he was attacked and killed by lions,” Limpopo police spokesman Moatshe Ngoepe told AFP. “They ate his body, nearly all of it, and just left his head and some remains.”

A loaded hunting rifle was found near the remains.

Initial reports indicated that the victim may have been a farmworker whose tractor stalled and was attacked by the lions as he attempted to walk home, local news site The Citizen reported. That man was later found safe.

Now, authorities believe the dead man was trying to illegally hunt the protected big cats. They are still working to identify the body.

“The process of identifying the deceased has already commenced and it might be made possible by the fact that his head is amongst the remains that were found at the scene,” Ngoepe told SowetanLIVE.

South Africa’s IOL said several lions were poisoned in the same region last year. Their heads and paws were also chopped off.Despite the damning decision to order Zuma’s “recall” - ANC-speak for ‘remove from office’ - domestic media have speculated that the 75-year-old might yet defy the party’s wishes, forcing it into the indignity of having to unseat him in parliament.

Shortly before midnight, the SABC state broadcaster said Zuma had been told in person by Ramaphosa that he had 48 hours to resign. A senior party source later told Reuters Zuma had made clear that he was going nowhere.

“Cyril went to speak with him,” the source said, adding that when Ramaphosa returned to the ANC meeting in a Pretoria hotel, the discussions were “tense and difficult”.

“We decided to recall Zuma. He hasn’t been told yet,” the source said.Kei Saito of Japan trains during Short Track Speed Skating practice ahead of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Robert Cianflone via Getty Images

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Japanese short track speed skater Kei Saito has failed an out-of-competition doping test and was expelled from the Pyeongchang Olympic Games, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Tuesday.

Saito, a reserve athlete who had not yet competed, was provisionally suspended after testing positive for masking agent acetalozamide, CAS said, adding that a final ruling would be issued after the Games.

Masking agents are often used to cover up banned performance-enhancing substances.

This is the first doping case during the testing period of the Olympics in South Korea and comes as Tokyo prepares to host the Summer Games in 2020.

“The athlete accepted on a voluntary basis to be provisionally suspended and to leave the Olympic village,” CAS said.

“As a consequence, the athlete is provisionally suspended from competing at the Pyeongchang 2018 (Olympic Games) and at any future ISU (International Skating Union) competition pending the resolution of this matter.”

The Japanese Olympic Committee is to hold a news conference later in the day.

Doping cases are rare among Japanese athletes and this is the first for the country at a Winter Olympics.

LeBron James is re-imagining a classic hip-hop film for a new generation.

The NBA star is producing a remake of the 1990 comedy “House Party,” The Hollywood Reporter reported on Tuesday. The original movie starred hip-hop duo Kid ’n Play and centered around a high school student who throws a house party while his parents are on vacation. The film went on to have two sequels.

“This is definitely not a reboot. It’s an entirely new look for a classic movie,” James told The Hollywood Reporter. “Everyone I grew up with loved ‘House Party.’ To partner with this creative team to bring a new ‘House Party’ to a new generation is unbelievable.”

‘Atlanta’ writers Stephen Glover and Jamal Olori will pen the screenplay. James will be producing the movie with the help of his SpringHill Entertainment partner, Maverick Carter.

Carter said they’re currently “trying out some ideas for musicians to be cast” into to the movie. James, who made his movie debut in the 2015 comedy “Trainwreck,” could also possibly have a cameo in the new film.

The basketball star hinted at a possible cameo on Tuesday via Twitter, when he shared the news using the hashtag #MayEvenHaveToMakeACameo.

This is gonna be fun!! Stephen and Jamal are so talented. Very excited to work with them on this. Stay tuned! #MayEvenHaveToMakeACameo https://t.co/sJ8EoqHs1e — LeBron James (@KingJames) February 13, 2018

The “House Party” remake isn’t the only Hollywood project James has in the works. Last May, Entertainment Weekly confirmed the Cleveland Cavaliers player will be starring in the long-awaited “Space Jam 2.” The film will be a sequel to the hit 1996 film “Space Jam,” which starred basketball legend Michael Jordan.Another Winter Olympics, another tussle over the masks of U.S. ice hockey goaltenders.

USA Today reported Tuesday that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had ordered two goalies on the U.S. women’s ice hockey team to remove images of the Statue of Liberty from their masks to conform to IOC rules.

Goalie Nicole Hensley has an image of Lady Liberty on the left side of her mask, while goalie Alex Rigsby has the symbol on her chin. According to IOC rules, athletes cannot wear items that feature the “wording or lyrics from national anthems, motivational words, public/political messaging or slogans related to national identity.”

USA Hockey spokesman Dave Fischer told USA Today that the team was in “discussions” with the IOC to see if the goalies could keep the images on their masks.

He added that the issue should be resolved before the USA’s next game, slated to take place on Tuesday night local time against the Olympic Athletes from Russia.

The IOC said in a tweet early Tuesday that “there seems to have been a misunderstanding,” and that it “had not asked for the symbol to be removed.”

This isn’t the first time that U.S. goalie masks have been given the thumbs-down by the IOC. Before the Sochi Winter Games in 2014, goalie Jessie Vetter had to remove an image of the Preamble to the Constitution from her mask because of the same IOC rules.

Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said Tuesday that she is “extremely disappointed” in the White House’s handling of domestic abuse allegations against former aide Rob Porter, calling on Donald Trump to “send a stronger message” after the president has appeared to side with Porter.

“I’m not sure of the internal workings of the White House and when they found out, what they found out. But I’m extremely disappointed in this situation,” Ernst told CNN. “Abuse is never OK. It is never OK, and so I feel very bad for those women. I am glad that they have come forward.”

Ernst has previously worked with women who have faced abuse and supported bipartisan legislation on domestic violence and sexual misconduct.

After affirming that “we need to send a very clear signal that it won’t be tolerated,” the GOP senator asserted that Trump himself should “send a stronger message.”

“We need to allow women and men that have been abused to come out, make sure their stories are heard and believed,” Ernst said. “I’d like him to come out a little bit stronger on that.”

Trump administration officials have continually put forth conflicting narratives and talking points about the allegations against Porter, who left the White House as staff secretary last week after his two ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennie Willoughby, said that he had punched and choked them.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday stressed that the president “supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly,” and that he “takes the issue of domestic violence very seriously.”

But Trump has made plenty of public statements suggesting otherwise, and Sanders would not affirm whether the president believes the women making the allegations.

On Friday, Trump expressed sympathy for Porter and reiterated that the former aide denied the claims by Holderness and Willoughby. He told reporters that the situation was “very sad” and “a tough time” for Porter, adding that “we wish him well.”

He later tweeted that “lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,” and implied that Holderness and Willoughby were liars.

AdvertisementOnce again, a White House press conference has left viewers with more questions than answers regarding the Trump administration’s stance on disgraced former staff secretary Rob Porter.

On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders further muddled the administration’s messaging on Porter, who left his position last week after new reports alleged he physically abused his two ex-wives.

During a press briefing, Huckabee Sanders repeatedly said “the president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously” and that he “supports all victims of domestic violence” when reporters pressed her to clarify President Donald Trump’s position on Porter and his accusers.

But just days earlier, some reporters noted, Trump had tweeted that he sympathized with lives and careers that are “being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.”

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018

Huckabee Sanders pushed back when reporters asked why Trump has yet to make his own statement in support of domestic violence victims. She said she could speak directly for Trump and that his silence had no bearing on how seriously he takes such accusations.

She was even vaguer about whether Trump still wishes Porter well, as he said last week.

“I think the president of the United States hopes that all Americans can be successful in whatever they do. And if they’ve had any issues in the past ― I’m not confirming or denying one way or another ― but if they do, the president wants success for all Americans,” Huckabee Sanders said.

White House chief of staff John Kelly has said that Porter was gone from his job 40 minutes after Kelly discovered the abuse allegations against Porter were credible. Huckabee Sanders said on Monday that Porter was out “within 24 hours.”

Both claims are at odds with multiple reports that Kelly, who had first hired Porter, has known about the accusations for months and understood they were the reason the Porter had not received a full White House security clearance. Even after the abuse allegations emerged, Kelly said he stood by an earlier statement that Porter is “a man of true integrity and honor.”

Huckabee Sanders also avoided saying why Porter was allowed to handle sensitive information without a full security clearance. She instead turned security concerns back onto reporters.

AdvertisementComedian Julio Torres has some unconventional Valentine’s Day gift ideas for anyone thinking of giving their loved one a perfume.

The Valentine’s Day correspondent for “The Tonight Show” crashed Jimmy Fallon’s monologue on Friday to share six scents that are, uh, different. The El Salvador-born star explained the inspiration behind each perfume, which included “Silent Scream,” “But Who Is SHE?,” “Brofume” and “ALL CAPS.”

One of the biggest crowd pleasers seemed to be “FLOTUS Whisper,” which the comedian described as “a scent inspired by the forbidden secrets that Melania [Trump] whispers in a little box at night, like ‘Get me outta here.’”

The joke is reminiscent of one of Torres’ most notable contributions as a writer for “Saturday Night Live”: the “Melania’s Moments” shorts, which star Cecily Strong and often portray the first lady as trapped in her own reality.Iranian firefighters relocate the remains of a plane near Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport after a crash in 2014. Iran operates one of the world's oldest fleets of civilian airliners and has had more than two dozen civilian crashes since 2000. Behrouz Mehri/Getty Images

WASHINGTON — On a Sunday morning in February, a twin-engine turboprop passenger plane crashed in Iran’s Zagros Mountains. All 65 passengers and crew members were killed. The plane, an ATR 72, had been flying for nearly 25 years, about 10 years longer than the average U.S. aircraft is kept in service.

Ancient, dangerous airliners are the norm, not the exception, in Iran. For decades, U.S. and international sanctions have prevented Iran from buying new planes from companies like Boeing and Airbus, which dominate the global aviation market. Some of the sanctions have even complicated Iran’s ability to purchase spare parts and service its aging planes. The country now operates one of the world’s oldest fleets of civilian airliners, and it shows: There have been more than two dozen civilian airplane crashes in Iran since 2000.

The 2015 Iran nuclear deal was supposed to offer Iran a chance to finally replace planes that Iranians sometimes call “flying coffins.”

Now that effort is stalled — thanks to President Donald Trump. When Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last week, the Treasury Department said it would revoke licenses that allowed aviation companies to sell planes and parts to Iran.

As part of the nuclear agreement, the U.S. had agreed to issue licenses on a case-by-case basis to allow American companies (and foreign companies that use a certain amount of U.S.-origin components) to sell planes and parts to Iran. Shortly after the deal went into effect, Iran Air signed deals to purchase 100 planes from Airbus, 80 planes from Boeing and 20 from ATR, a Franco-Italian manufacturer. Iran’s Aseman Airlines reached a separate agreement to buy 30 planes from Boeing. In total, the contracts were worth about $40 billion.

But Airbus has delivered only three planes to Iran since the nuclear deal went into effect. The 2017 deliveries marked the first time Iran had acquired new aircraft in nearly 20 years. ATR has shipped eight short-haul regional airliners to Iran and plans to squeeze in more deliveries before the sanctions kick in in August, the Financial Tribune reported. Boeing has not yet delivered any planes to Iran.

Both Boeing and Airbus have backlogs of orders. Boeing, mindful of the Trump administration’s threats to pull out of the nuclear deal, had not started building the planes it agreed to sell to Iran.

“It was viewed as a win-win that would help the U.S. business community — and the broader perception was that it would contribute to the quality of life and better safety standards for Iranians.” - Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department Iran adviser

“We will consult with the U.S. Government on next steps. As we have throughout this process, we’ll continue to follow the U.S. Government’s lead,” Boeing Vice President Gordon Johndroe said in a statement after Trump’s announcement. An Airbus spokesman said the company is analyzing the situation and plans to consult with its customers. ATR did not respond to a request for comment.

Before Trump came into office, the U.S. government had long viewed easing restrictions on aircraft sales as an area “ripe for cooperation” between Washington and Tehran, said Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department Iran adviser.

“It was viewed as a win-win that would help the U.S. business community — and the broader perception was that it would contribute to the quality of life and better safety standards for Iranians,” she continued.

When planes crash in Iran, the country’s state-owned media reliably blames U.S. sanctions for putting Iranian civilians at risk. But even amid climbing fatality figures, hard-liners in the U.S. urged Western airplane manufacturers to stay out of Iran, arguing that the Iranian military would divert civilian planes to send troops and weapons to Syria. After the nuclear agreement went into effect, Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) pushed legislation through the House to block the Treasury Department from granting companies like Boeing licenses to sell aircraft to Iran.

Sanctions experts say concerns about Iran diverting civilian aircraft are overblown. The Iranian government is eager to upgrade civilian airplanes — and Western companies that sell to Iran do extensive due diligence to make sure they won’t be implicated in Iran’s military endeavors.Former Major League Baseball player Esteban Loaiza has been charged with drug trafficking after police said they found 44 pounds of suspected cocaine at a home he rented near the U.S.-Mexico border.

The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department valued the drugs at $500,000. Loaiza, 46, was charged with drug possession and trafficking and was jailed under $200,000 bail.

Police said Loaiza, a former All-Star pitcher who had a 14-year MLB career, was stopped for a traffic infraction on Friday. He had already been on law enforcement’s radar because he’d been seen driving a vehicle “believed to be involved in the smuggling of narcotics,” the sheriff’s department said.

Deputies searching Loaiza’s car found a “sophisticated” compartment for concealing contraband and obtained a search warrant for the home in Imperial Beach, California, that Loaiza had been renting since early February.

Investigators say they discovered packages of “white powder” weighing 20 kilograms, or about 44 pounds. The sheriff’s department described the substance as suspected cocaine, though it’s still being tested and could include other drugs.

Loaiza’s agent, John Boggs, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he had not been in contact with his client recently and was “shocked” by the arrest.

“I am shocked and saddened by the news and had no indication he would ever be in this type of situation,” Boggs said. “I don’t know how he would get himself involved in this, so it’s difficult to even comment on it.”

Loaiza was born in Tijuana, Mexico, just across the border from Imperial Beach. From 1995 until his retirement in 2008, he played for teams that included the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox.

He was the starting pitcher in the 2003 All-Star Game and, according to the New York Daily News, was the second-winningest pitcher from Mexico in MLB history.

As CBS Sports noted, Loaiza made an appearance earlier this month at a White Sox fan event in Chicago.

AdvertisementPolitics is a dog-eat-dog world, and no one knows that better than a pooch in Hutchinson, Kansas.

Angus P. Woolley is a 3-year-old vizsla whose owner, Terran Woolley, wants him to be the next governor of the Sunflower State.

Woolley decided to throw Angus’ hat ― er, collar ― in the ring after he learned about six teenagers who are planning to run for the state’s highest office this year.

Woolley read through the bylaws and requirements to be Kansas governor and realized nothing was stopping Angus from actually being in the hunt ― which is perfect because his breed is a hunting dog.

“I thought, ‘Hey, why not Angus? He’s a good dog, he’s smart. And I think he could provide better leadership than what we’ve had the last seven years in our state,’” Woolley told The Hutchinson News.

But even though Woolley officially filed paperwork for Angus last week, the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office decreed on Monday that dogs are not allowed to serve as governor, according to local station KWCH-TV.

“Officially, we will not allow a dog to run for governor,” Brian Caskey, director of elections, told The Kansas City Star on Tuesday. “There’s several laws that reference that the governor has to be an individual or a person, and so we are relying on that, and if a dog comes in to file for office, we will not allow that.”

Woolley suspects the office has an ulterior motive for the decision: Kris Kobach, the current secretary of state, is running for governor.I like tough competition, but I also like to see good sportsmanship.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump made it appear that former White House staff secretary Rob Porter was the “victim” after accusations of domestic violence by two of Porter’s ex-wives, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said.

Scarborough, during a segment of “Morning Joe” on Monday, said he was shocked that Trump praised Porter’s work during a press conference last week, and repeatedly reminded the public that the former aide had proclaimed his innocence. The president continued to defend Porter even after he resigned on Feb. 7.

Scarborough called Trump’s comments “unbelievable.”

“Two or three phrases just stand out and they really are shocking: ‘This is a tough time for him,’ the president’s words. ‘It’s a very sad time, very sad time for him. We wish him very well in the future,’” Scarborough said.

“The president, in those comments, made the man accused of beating up two women the victim,” he added.

Porter’s ex-wives, Jennie Willoughby and Colbie Holderness, publicly accused the former White House aide of abusing them emotionally, verbally and physically during their marriages. Porter has denied the allegations.

Scarborough discussed the abuse allegations and Trump’s reaction with a panel of reporters. BBC journalist Katty Kay noted that Trump made “absolutely no mention” of Porter’s ex-wives in his statement, “let alone a word of sympathy for them.”

“He made a choice, the president, right there and he sided with Rob Porter,” Kay said.

A day after Trump made his public statement on Porter, he tweeted that “peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.” He added: “There is no recovery for someone falsely accused ― life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as due process?”

Jennie Willoughby, one of Porter’s ex-wives, wrote an op-ed published in Time on Monday criticizing the president for insinuating she’s lying.

But he didn’t dismiss the idea of a “Seinfeld” revival when she broached the topic.

“‘Murphy Brown?’ And Candice Bergen is coming back?” Seinfeld asked as he teed DeGeneres up for her big question. “I think I know where you’re going with this ― why don’t you finish it?”

“Well,” DeGeneres said, “do you think, Jerry, there would be a possibility that ‘Seinfeld’ would come back?”

“It’s possible,” the comedian started to say before he was interrupted by the audience’s extended applause. He smiled and said, “They like the idea.”

The interview ended before the two could talk about it anymore. Seinfeld has previously said that he has no plans to bring back the hit TV show, which also starred Michael Richards as Cosmo Kramer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine Benes and Jason Alexander as George Costanza.

During an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” in 2017, reporter Nischelle Turner asked the comedian if he’d want to bring the show back.

“Why?” Seinfeld asked, before adding, “Maybe it’s nice that you continue to love it instead of us tampering with something that went pretty well.”The envelope containing a nonhazardous white powder resembling anthrax addressed to Donald Trump Jr. included a letter full of personal insults, according to New York media.

Trump’s wife, Vanessa, was taken to a hospital on Monday after opening the envelope in her mother’s Manhattan apartment.

“You are an awful, awful person,” the letter read, NBC affiliate News 4 New York reported, citing officials familiar with the case. “I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV. You the family idiot. Eric [another of President Donald Trump’s sons] looks smart. This is the reason why people hate you. You are getting what you deserve. So shut the f**k up.”

The New York Daily News reported slightly different wording: “You’re an awful person and now you get what you deserve.”

A spokesperson for the New York Police Department declined to comment.

The powder was determined to be cornstarch, and reportedly postmarked from Boston.

Two other people, including Vanessa Trump’s mother, were also taken to the New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center. Vanessa had complained of nausea.

Trump Jr., the eldest of the president’s three sons, addressed the scare in a tweet Monday afternoon.

“Thankful that Vanessa & my children are safe and unharmed after the incredibly scary situation that occurred this morning,” he wrote. “Truly disgusting that certain individuals choose to express their opposing views with such disturbing behavior.”After a poor showing at Sochi 2014 and a scary practice fall that left him with 62 stitches on his face last October, snowboarder Shaun White took a spectacular step in his comeback at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Trump indicated the summit could be salvaged after welcoming a conciliatory statement from North Korea saying it remained open to talks.

“It was a very nice statement they put out,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see what happens - it could even be the 12th.

“We’re talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it.”

After years of tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program, Kim and Trump agreed this month to hold what would be the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The plan followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over North Korea’s development of missiles capable of reaching the United States.

Trump scrapped the meeting, planned for Singapore, in a letter to Kim on Thursday after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials demanding unilateral disarmament. Trump cited North Korean hostility in canceling the summit.

In Pyongyang, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea’s criticisms had been a reaction to American rhetoric and that current antagonism showed “the urgent necessity” for the summit.

He said North Korea regretted Trump’s decision to cancel and remained open to resolving issues “regardless of ways, at any time.”

Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea had appreciated Trump having made the bold decision to work toward a summit.

“We even inwardly hoped that what is called ‘Trump formula’ would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue,” he said.

DIPLOMATS AT WORK

Trump’s latest about-face sent officials scrambling in Washington. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters diplomats were “still at work” and said Trump had just sent a note out on the summit, which could be back on “if our diplomats can pull it off.”

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams declined to give details of any diplomatic contacts but said: “As the president said in his letter to Chairman Kim, dialog between the two is the only dialog that matters. If North Korea is serious, then we look forward hearing from them at the highest levels.”

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters Trump did not want a meeting that was “just a political stunt.”

“He wants to get something that’s a long-lasting and an actual real solution. And if they are they are ready to do that then ... we’re certainly ready to have those conversations,” she said.

“If the meeting takes place on June 12, we’ll be ready, if it takes place on July 12, we will be ready.”

Sanders indicated it had yet to be decided whether White House officials would stick to a plan to travel to Singapore in coming days to prepare the summit.

North Korea had sharply criticized suggestions by Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Vice President Mike Pence that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed by NATO-backed militants after halting his nascent nuclear program.

“TRUMP FORMULA”

Trump had initially sought to placate North Korea, saying he was not pursuing the “Libya model” and Sanders said he was following “the President Trump model.”

U.S. regional allies Japan and South Korea, as well as North Korea’s main ally, China, urged the two countries to salvage the summit on Friday.

At an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said it was necessary to ensure security on the Korean peninsula, which touched on China’s core interests.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at the same forum, regretted the cancellation and said the world should keep doing its bit to make the summit happen.

South Korea also would continue efforts to improve ties with the North, the office of President Moon Jae-in said after Moon’s top security advisers met for the second time on Friday.

Some analysts worried that canceling the summit could prompt a resumption in hostilities, including renewed shorter-range missile tests or stepped-up cyber attacks by Pyongyang and increased sanctions or deployment of new military assets by Washington.

In his letter, Trump warned Kim of the United States’ greater nuclear might, reminiscent of his tweet last year asserting that he had a “much bigger” nuclear button than Kim.

While the Trump administration had insisted on North Korea’s complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear program, Pyongyang had always couched its language in terms of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

It has said in previous, failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States provided security guarantees by removing its troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.

“This is the Trump era. We support law enforcement,” Sessions said. ”Of course, we will continue to hold accountable any officer who violates the law and undermines the good work of our police. But we will not malign entire police departments. We will not try to micromanage their daily work all the way from Washington, D.C. We will not enter into agreements or court decrees that outsource policymaking to political activists.”



Sherrilyn Ifill, the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called on Congress to step up oversight efforts in response to Sessions’ comments.

“Eschewing legal requirements and permitting systemic constitutional violations to go unaddressed is the opposite of what our communities need from the nation’s top cop,” she said. “The Justice Department has a unique responsibility to enforce the law enforcement misconduct statute, and our elected officials should stop the Department from shirking its obligations. If the Attorney General and Congress are serious about increasing officer safety, they should double down on policing reform efforts, not abandon them.”

Joshua Roberts / Reuters

NEW YORK ― When Betsy DeVos was named education secretary last February, she become public education’s No. 1 enemy. After all, the billionaire is notorious for her desire to expand private school choice programs (which include many religious private schools that teach Christian fundamentalist doctrine).

One year into her tenure, educators have turned this opposition into action.

As in so many industries and among Democrats at large, there has been a wave of activism in response to President Donald Trump in the past year. In education, this activism has manifested as a renewed rallying around traditional public schools.

The Network for Public Education, an advocacy group, has seen membership shoot up to 330,000 members, compared to 22,000 members before DeVos was nominated. The previous year, membership had increased by only a fraction of that amount.

And in states like Kentucky, more teachers than ever are running for office.

Polls have shown a decline in support for some of DeVos’ favorite types of schools. One poll from August showed that public enthusiasm for charter schools ― a type of public school that is privately operated and often has support from both parties ― is dropping. Another poll, from American Federation for Children, the education reform group DeVos used to head, found that overall support for the concept of “school choice” has been dropping too, although it remains high. (The AFC poll defines school choice as giving “parents the right to use the tax dollars designated for their child’s education to send their child to the public or private school which best serves their needs.”)

DeVos “was a wake-up call to everyone who was concerned about the future of public education,” Diane Ravitch, a former U.S. assistant secretary of education and founder of the Network for Public Education, said over breakfast in a Brooklyn neighborhood in January. “I’m actually glad [Trump] chose her.”

Ravitch, who is writing a book about resistance to school privatization efforts, calls DeVos a “blessing in disguise.” For the first time in a decade, Ravitch said, she feels public schools are “gaining ground on the school privatization movement... and I don’t think it’s going to survive the scrutiny.”

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second largest teachers union, says she has also seen increased engagement among her members in the age of Trump and DeVos ― especially as an upcoming Supreme Court case threatens to deal a major blow to union finances. She told HuffPost she has recently observed a string of local races where pro-public education advocates have prevailed. More members are showing up at town halls and regional meetings.

“You see a tremendous appetite to fight,” Weingarten said.

But she’s not cheery about the reasons for this increased engagement.

“What you also see, on the other side, is a brazen, non-hidden quest to just kill us, and to kill every bit of every tool that enables broad-based voice and opportunity,” she said.

Indeed, Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education, says she is far more more worried than she is optimistic about DeVos’ impact.

“The truth of the matter is, even though there is a heightened awareness and pushback, there is so much money on the other side that it is overwhelming,” said Burris, a former public school principal.

Despite widespread dislike for DeVos and some of her policies, these issues are still moving forward in many places. A majority of consequential education policy decisions are made at the state and local levels, especially as DeVos’ plans for more federal school choice have mostly stalled. Burris notes that groups like hers have seen an increase in monetary donations ― but “because there are so many Republican majorities in statehouses, they are seizing the day,” she said. “They are sponsoring legislation at a breakneck speed.”

Advocates for charter schools say they have seen some declining support from liberals, but support among centrists and conservatives has remained steady.

Peri Lynn Turnbull handles external relations and strategy at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. She says that while charter schools have become a harder sell in left-leaning, anti-Trump states, she’s glad that overall it has become a more relevant issue. It has become challenging, though, to combat what she calls increased misinformation about what charter schools are and what they do.

“It’s elevated the conversation, for one. There’s no doubt about it,” said Turnbull, whose organization has also been critical of many of Trump and DeVos’ signature priorities.

On the other hand, Lennie Jarratt of the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank, said there’s been an increase in private school choice legislation at the state level that “hadn’t happened like that in prior years.” Private school choice takes various forms ― whether through tax credits, vouchers, or education savings accounts ― but it generally helps parents subsidize a child’s enrollment in a private school. Opponents of private school choice say it drains public school systems of resources.

“Teachers unions pushed back harder probably than any other year against school choice,” Jarratt said. “The proponents of school choice [have] been just as vocal, and more vocal too.”

Jeanne Allen, head of the pro-charter and pro-voucher group Center for Education Reform, says that not having to advocate as much to get a voice with federal leaders has freed up her group to focus more on other issues.

She doesn’t believe that opposition to DeVos has had any lasting impact on the education field.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) rejected top Republicans’ proposal for a new congressional map in his state Tuesday, saying the plan continued to be an unacceptable partisan gerrymander.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s current congressional map in January, saying it so unfairly gave the GOP an advantage in the state that it violated Pennsylvania’s constitution. The court gave Republicans and the governor until Feb. 15 to agree on a map, but said it would draw a map on its own if they could not reach an agreement.

“The analysis by my team shows that, like the 2011 map, the map submitted to my office by Republican leaders is still a gerrymander,” Wolf said in a statement. “Their map clearly seeks to benefit one political party, which is the essence of why the court found the current map to be unconstitutional.”

In a Feb. 7 opinion, the court offered Republicans some guidance on how they needed to make the congressional map more fair. At a minimum, the court said, the map needed to be compact and contiguous, maintain roughly equal populations in each district and not unnecessarily split communities. Lawmakers could not value partisanship over those criteria, the court said.

House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R) offered a proposal to Wolf on Friday that they said complied with the court’s guidelines. Several analyses immediately pointed out that their proposal, which was not voted on by the legislature, maintained a severe Republican advantage.

Moon Duchin, a Tufts University mathematician Wolf hired to evaluate the plan, said she analyzed the map using the court’s criteria and found “there is no more than a 0.1 percent chance that a plan drafted to comply with the court’s factors would have been as favorable to Republicans as is the proposed Joint Submission Plan.”

In her analysis, the only plan that stood out with more of a partisan skew was the congressional map currently in place.

Republicans controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and drew a congressional map that gave the GOP a considerable advantage. The party has consistently won 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats, despite winning around 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also outpace Republicans statewide in voter registration.

Republicans have fought the state Supreme Court’s order in every way they can, and have hinted that they may pursue further legal action. In a Friday filing, lawyers for Turzai and Scarnati said if the state Supreme Court drew the map, it would be infringing on the process the state constitution outlines for how a bill may become law.

In a letter to the state Supreme Court Tuesday, Wolf’s lawyers said Scarnati and Turzai also had not complied with the court’s order because the entire legislature had not voted on it. In a separate letter to the two top Republicans, Wolf said he was open to considering a new proposal, approved by the legislature, ahead of the Thursday deadline.

Turzai and Scarnati responded to Wolf with their own harshly-worded letter Tuesday afternoon and said his “pronouncements are absurd.” The two top Republicans defended their map and charged the governor with coming up with a new one that was better.Figure skater Adam Rippon harbored dreams of Olympic glory long before his dazzling games debut this week in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

In a recently unearthed 2003 interview with Pennsylvania TV station WNEP-TV, Rippon, then 13, demonstrated much the same determination as he did Monday when he helped Team USA clinch a bronze medal in the figure skating team event.

Rippon, now 28, had been skating for just over three years when he appeared on the channel’s Newswatch 16 program. He spoke enthusiastically about competing in Europe, taking his first airplane and train rides, and visiting the Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.

“And then, when you see, like, all these things about other people who have won the Olympics and everything, you think that you’ve done a great thing,” Rippon, a Scranton, Pennsylvania, native, told reporter Jim Coles. “But you’re still so far away.”

The young Rippon, who has since become the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete at the games, also had some tips on how to succeed in the sport:

“All the little things that your coach tells you, you always have to remember them. And you always have to try not to overdo it, just to do it. So as long as you remember everything your coach tells you, you’ll be OK.”

AdvertisementBlake Lively isn’t going to put a pretty filter on it.

On Monday, the actress posted a gym photo to Instagram. In the caption, Lively got real about how long it took her to lose her baby weight after the birth of her daughter.

“Turns out you can’t lose the 61 lbs you gained during pregnancy by just scrolling through instragram [sic] and wondering why you don’t look like all the bikini models,” she wrote. “Thanks @donsaladino for kickin my A double S into shape. 10 months to gain, 14 months to lose. Feeling very proud.”

A post shared by Blake Lively (@blakelively) on Feb 12, 2018 at 9:04am PST

The 30-year-old actress gave birth to her second child with actor Ryan Reynolds, 41, in September 2016.

Lively’s candid post about losing weight is in stark contrast to unrealistic but aspirational stories about how quickly some celebrity moms manage snap back into shape after pregnancy.

But Lively isn’t the only actress who has been honest in regards to these quixotic expectations.

In 2016, actress Zooey Deschanel, just months after she gave birth to her daughter, discussed her concerns with the idea of women “bouncing back” after pregnancy.As of early Tuesday, Team USA has won three gold, one silver and two bronze medals at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. And it has received zero tweets from President Donald Trump in support of those victories.

While not every world leader jumps on social media to congratulate athletes, several have. Canada’s Justin Trudeau, for example, has sent off several such tweets, in both English and French.

Trump, for his part, has been as active on Twitter as ever. Since the Games began last week, he’s complained about the “fake news media,” claimed (incorrectly) that he was “vindicated” in the Russia investigation, railed against Democrats and stuck up for alleged abusers. He also plugged his tax cuts, promoted Republican candidates and teased an upcoming appearance at a conservative conference.

But the last time Trump commented on a specific U.S. result in the Winter Olympics was this tweet, from the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia:

Russia beat the United States in the Olympics-another Obama embarrassment! Isn't it time that we turn things around and start kicking ass? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2014"The LGBTQ community means the absolute world to me and inspires me every day," Britney Spears said. C Flanigan via Getty Images

Britney Spears once thanked her LGBTQ fans for their “unwavering loyalty” and “unapologetic truth,” and now the community is about to give her an even bigger thank you in return.

The pop superstar will be honored with the Vanguard Award at the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards on April 12 in Los Angeles. Each year, the award is bestowed on a media personality who has “made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance of LGBTQ people,” GLAAD officials said in a press release. Spears joins a number of A-list stars, including Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson and Demi Lovato, who have received the honor.

GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said Spears “embodied the spirit of GLAAD’s Vanguard Award by speaking out on significant issues that face her fans ― from the Dream Act to anti-transgender bills in Texas.”

“She is a force in the music world who has used her global platform to share messages of love and acceptance, something that the world needs today more than ever,” she continued in a Tuesday post on the organization’s website.

Spears seemed elated by the news, tweeting:

Honored to be receiving the Vanguard Award at the @GLAAD Media Awards this year! The LGBTQ community means the absolute world to me and inspires me every day. I am proud to be an ally and I will continue to support equality and acceptance for all!! 💜💜💜 #GLAADAwards pic.twitter.com/iInKolgW61 — Britney Spears (@britneyspears) February 13, 2018

Spears has stepped up her support of the LGBTQ community in recent years. In 2016, she joined Troye Sivan, Gwen Stefani, Meghan Trainor and other artists in performing “Hands,” a song released by GLAAD in honor of the 49 victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which targeted the LGBTQ community.

She was also one of more than 140 stars to speak out against two anti-LGBTQ bills introduced, but later defeated, in Texas last year.

The singer, who will return to the concert stage on her Piece of Me Tour this summer, wrote a heartfelt “love letter” to her LGBTQ fanbase for Billboard in honor of Pride Month last June.A New Jersey deputy mayor compared undocumented immigrants to “rabid, messy raccoons” infesting basements — and President Donald Trump to an exterminator — in an inflammatory Facebook post on Sunday.

Mendham Township Deputy Mayor Rick Blood apologized and removed the comment the night he posted it after receiving angry reactions from stunned locals — even though he had earlier defended the comments with additional posts.

Blood, who also runs the public works department in Roxbury, New Jersey, will face residents and officials Monday night at a Mendham Township Committee meeting where his comments will be discussed.

“This has really turned into quite an uncomfortable situation,” Blood told the Daily Record on Monday. “We’re all waiting to see what the public side is going to be. It was a bonehead thing to do, but that’s not racial.”

Blood said in a subsequent Facebook post that his comments weren’t intended to be offensive. But he conceded that the outraged reaction “led to some introspection” on his part. He said the statement was copied from elsewhere and intended to “illustrate — however poorly — one of the reasons our president was elected.”

He added: “I didn’t realize how crude it would be received by others.”

Almost all responses to Blood’s apology post were angry, with several people calling for his resignation. One writer noted that referring to extermination and calling immigrants “vermin” was “trafficking in the language of genocide.”

Blood didn’t reveal the origin of his first post. But the language appeared word-for-word in a 2016 comment to a Breitbart story.

It was also similar to remarks by Carl Paladino, who co-chaired Trump’s New York campaign, when he talked to NPR in 2016.

“People that get on this bus, on the Trump bus, are people that are very, very frustrated with their government,” Paladino said on “Morning Edition.”

“It doesn’t matter what kind of person is the exterminator, okay? They want the raccoons out of the basement.”

A North Jersey.com editorial blasted Blood’s comments as “despicable,” adding: “Reading Blood’s Facebook mea culpa, it’s clear he still doesn’t get it.”Seventeen-year-old Chloe Kim won gold at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics with a near-flawless score of 98.25 in the women’s snowboard halfpipe event ― and she did it even though she was hangry.

Kim, the youngest-ever gold medalist in the halfpipe event, topped the field, while U.S. teammate Arielle Gold took the bronze. But even at the top of the slope, Kim didn’t appear to be too nervous, firing off a breakfast-related tweet between her second and third runs:

Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now I'm getting hangry — Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 13, 2018

Kim said she was hangry ― hungry and angry ― while waiting for her third run, where she nailed the 98.25, beating the impressive score she’d already recorded on her first run. Soon after, fans started wanting to help her out with a bite to eat.

New York Times CEO Mark Thompson said in a Monday interview with CNBC that the next decade will likely witness the decline of the paper’s print edition as it transitions to digital-only distribution.

“I believe at least 10 years is what we can see in the U.S. for our print products,” Thompson said. Although he’d like to see the print edition “survive and thrive as long as it can,” the CEO said his company will decide when to shutter its print operations “simply on the economics.”

“The key thing for us is that we’re pivoting,” Thompson said. “Our plan is to go on serving our loyal print subscribers as long as we can. But meanwhile to build up the digital business, so that we have a successful growing company and a successful news operation long after print is gone.”

Despite the repeated insults President Donald Trump has hurled at the Times over Twitter, it does not appear to be a “failing” enterprise. The New York Times Company said Thursday that it added more than 150,000 digital-only subscriptions in the last quarter of 2017. Digital ad revenue over the last year increased 14 percent, and the company’s fourth-quarter earnings blew past expectations.

While print subscribers are more profitable, Thompson said the company is banking on replacing them with many more digital subscribers.

“The point about digital is that we believe we can grow many, many more of them,” he said.

As media critic after media critic declares print “dead,” the days of fighting over sections or lazily paging through jumbo-sized Sunday editions of any newspaper are waning.

The Village Voice, a New York alt-weekly, became one of the most prominent local outlets to announce plans to shut down its print operation last summer, continuing digitally. Other print publications have disappeared completely or face worrisome futures.Outsports

Editor’s note: Junior White identifies as trans gender fluid and told Outsports they prefer any pronouns. This story fluctuates the use of pronouns for Junior to reflect his identity.

A 12-year-old trans gender fluid student at Berrendos Middle School in Red Bluff, Calif., has been kicked off of the school’s boys basketball team because she requested to use girls restrooms and locker rooms in the school.

Junior White was a part of the Berrendos Matadors boys basketball team until just recently, when her parents received a letter from Antelope School District superintendent Richard Hassay saying that Junior would be allowed to use girls locker rooms. Junior is trans gender fluid, meaning she was assigned male at birth but identifies as both male and female genders and uses both male and female pronouns. Her use of the girls locker room is consistent with her gender identity.

However, Hassay went a step further that stepped outside of state law.

“Junior is no longer eligible to participate on any male only athletic teams, including basketball,” Hassay wrote to the Whites. “Junior will be eligible to participate on co-ed or female only teams.”

The problem is that AB 1266, enacted in California in 2013, allows students to participate on sports teams regardless of their gender. The state law does not say the gender of a student’s athletic team must be consistent with the locker room they choose to utilize. It reads:

“A pupil shall be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil’s records.”

An email to Berrendos Middle School principal Jim Weber was not returned. Hassay has refused to comment to the media, telling the local Action News Now, “This is a confidential student case. I cannot release any information about this.”

To be clear, there is no “advantage” issue here. Junior was assigned male at birth but identifies as trans gender fluid. Junior wants to play on the boys teams.

Earlier this fall Junior came out to his parents as a gay boy. That’s how he identified at the time. His parents, Matt and Vanessa White, were concerned with how it would be received by the local community, so they asked Junior to hide his truth.

“That was a huge mistake,” Matt told Outsports. “I take responsibility for that.”

Even as he was destroying other teams on the football field, Junior attempted to harm himself as he didn’t know how else to express his need to share his true self.

That was a wake-up call for Matt and Vanessa. They spoke to the football coach about Junior being gay. That coach then spoke to the team captains. Together they handled it perfectly, rallying support for Junior across the team. By the end of the football season Junior felt at home.

“All of them were accepting,” Junior told Outsports.

Former NFL player Ryan O’Callaghan, who lives in nearby Redding, had even visited Junior and his parents last autumn to provide some insight and inspiration to the family.

“He seems like a good kid,” O’Callaghan told Outsports of Junior, “the best player on his youth football team.”

The trouble for Junior started when he made another announcement: He was questioning his gender identity and identifying more and more as a girl.

Junior hadn’t been using any restroom facilities in school for a while because she didn’t feel comfortable walking into the boys bathroom anymore. One day at school it became impossible to avoid. So she walked into a girls bathroom. That’s when all hell broke loose.

She was reported to the principal and called out of class. She was told that she was not allowed to use any restrooms — boys or girls — in the school other than the one in the school’s main office.

That outraged Junior’s parents, who fought back. That’s when they were informed that Junior could use the girls facilities but she would no longer be allowed to play on any boys basketball teams.

Junior said his teammates want him back on the team, but the principal and superintendent simply won’t let him play.

“They’re mad at the superintendent,” Junior said of his teammates. Junior is also a competitive gymnast.

Outsports

Junior has already had to watch from the sidelines as his team has continued its season. He and his friends have held signs at the games demanding that “#34” be allowed to play.

The basketball games have not been easy on Junior. At one game, Junior was harassed by a parent in the girls room, and then accosted by another woman when she walked out of the restroom, being told she is never to use a girls room again.

“Just look what they’re doing to my kid,” Matt said, simultaneously saddened and enraged.

Now Junior is simply wanting to play on the team where he feels the most comfortable — with the boys and his friends. Matt said Junior is exceptionally talented athletically and that it makes absolutely no sense to force him to compete against girls. It’s a similar issue Texas wrestler Mack Beggs faced, forced to compete against girls while identifying as a boy.

“It doesn’t matter who’s there, he stands out,” Matt said of his child who plays both sides of the football. “He’s one of the best players on offense and defense. In football he’s the fullback, and he intimidates the defense.”

In basketball, Matt added, “he jumps the highest” on the team.

Junior’s dream is to play football for Stanford University.

Junior’s plight has given rise to #ISTANDWITH34 on Twitter, which reflects Junior’s number on the boys basketball team and on the football team.

Now all Junior wants to do is play with those teams again and use the restroom where he feels most comfortable. All that’s standing in the way is a school district insistent that he now compete against girls.
