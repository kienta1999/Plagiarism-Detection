I Love it!



You know who else is family? Kids!



Kids are family too, and 17 families just had their kids murdered with an assault rifle, right inside their own school in Florida, just one month ago.



Why not introduce a bill to do something about that too?Mohammed Hassan is a worried man. In a few months’ time, the place he has called home for 27 years may be unrecognizable. Even scarier, he says, his newborn child may not enjoy the same little pleasures of life he did while growing up.

The clear skies, the endless supplies of fresh fish and the midday plunge into the sky blue ocean from one of the many jetties along Kenya’s Indian Ocean coastline may all be part of a painful past for generations that come after him.

In a bid to maintain its dominance as one of East Africa’s biggest and most ambitious economies, Kenya is betting big on dirty energy by building a controversial Chinese-funded coal plant at a World Heritage site.

“If these plans go on, maybe we might just have to move away,” Hassan said, his gaze first falling on the beach front, then farther west toward a cluster of mangrove trees behind which the sun, a big ball of orange, is lazily disappearing before a starlit night takes over.

The ambitious 1,050-megawatt plant is set to meet an anticipated energy demand from a growing economy as well as a growing population. But as building approvals trickle in to the historic seaside town of Lamu ― Hassan’s hometown and the agreed-on site for the plant ― questions from residents as well as conservationists on the validity and viability of the energy venture refuse to die down.

“This is a matter of life and death for us,” Hassan said. “The effects of this plant are much larger than the projected energy needs of the country. If it goes on, we might lose it all.”

The Lamu Archipelago rests on the northern coast of Kenya, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northeast of the coastal resort city of Mombasa, and it faces the Indian Ocean. The archipelago is a valuable marine ecosystem of coastal mangroves that provide a breeding ground for protected sea turtles.

“This project will be Kenya’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide and may be Kenya’s single largest emitter of toxic substances,” said David Obura, a U.S.-trained marine biologist and a founding director of Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean. For him, the coal plant represents a potentially massive loss of flora and fauna within the protected archipelago.

And this is what Hassan is afraid of. A future completely altered from his current reality as well as his past.

A 2015 report by heritage body UNESCO backs up some of these fears. “There is... a potential of not only marginalising the community but total disruption of a tradition and all sustaining traditional lifestyle developed and nurtured over millennia,” the report says. Lamu Town is also on the World Heritage list as the oldest and best preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa.

This history of the area and fears of environmental destruction aren’t the only reasons some oppose the plant. There’s also the apparent overlooking of the country’s burgeoning renewable energy sector.

Kenya’s electricity supply is predominantly sourced from hydro, geo-thermal and fossil fuels, including gas and diesel.

Ongoing wind, solar and geothermal power projects are all aimed at feeding an energy appetite projected to grow from 1,600 megawatts to between 2,600 and 3,600 megawatts by 2020.

“Kenya’s energy mix is remarkably sustainable, with 70 percent of electrical power generated through renewable sources,” said Guillermo Polavieja, a health assessment specialist. “The country’s clean energy potential is immense.” According to Polavieja, Kenya was under no pressure to dive head first into coal-powered energy.

Kenya has “enormous potential to expand” its renewable energy sources ― including geothermal, solar and wind ― according to Power Africa, a report on the U.S. government-led partnership with Kenya on the country’s energy needs. The report predicts renewables will supply 83 percent of Kenya’s energy by 2020.

The country boasts the largest geothermal plant in the world from a single site, located deep in the Rift Valley, which currently produces 563 megawatts but is projected to produce 1,984 by 2020.

Apart from geothermal resources, Kenya is also developing one of the continent’s largest wind farms set on 40,000 acres, powered by 365 turbines and designed to inject an additional 310 megawatts of power into the national grid.

“The Kenyan government either acted on poor advice, showed a lack of ambition in trusting the renewables or perhaps surrendered to other economic interests,” Obura said.

Nairobi, the seat of the Kenyan government, insists that all precaution is and will be taken to make the coal plant safe.

“The newly built power plants of coal right now are environmentally clean. If you look at China, most of their power supply is through coal,” said Charles Keter, Kenya’s energy and petroleum minister, last May at the signing of a $2.6 billion financing deal between Amu Power, a consortium of Kenyan companies that won the initial tender for building the plant, and China Power Global. The Energy Ministry did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

But as Kenya continues its dance with coal, the rest of the world is slowly moving away from the dance floor.

Ninety-seven percent of the European Union’s 619 coal plants will be losing money by 2030, according to an analysis from U.K. nonprofit Carbon Tracker, due to factors including falling renewable energy prices and increased regulation. Research from Greenpeace International in 2017 found that more than 25 percent of the 1,675 companies that have owned or developed coal-fired power capacity since 2010 have left the coal business. Most of them were based in India, followed by China and the U.S.

Even in the face of this data, Kenya remains undeterred.

In just less than two years, Lamu’s coal-fired power plant will roar to life, burning coal from South African mines arriving by ship, before eventually moving to exploit its own deposits about 350 kilometers (217 miles) away.

“We hope that it will not come to this,” Omar Elmawi, a member of lobby group Save Lamu says. “Logic ought to prevail.”

In spite of Elmawi’s optimism, all indications are that, buoyed by Chinese funding, the project will be pushed through to completion. Currently, China is in charge of many of the country’s major infrastructure developments.

Just over 20 percent of Kenya’s international debt is owed to China, according to 2018 data from Kenya’s Treasury, making it the biggest bilateral lender, ahead of Japan, Germany and France. With this kind of advantage, it might take a little miracle for Hassan’s newborn son to have a childhood similar to his.SAN FRANCISCO ― After thousands of students marched out of schools nationwide on Wednesday to honor victims of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting and call for change on gun violence, the student-led wave of activism is far from over.

On Wednesday, students from New York to Nashville to San Francisco walked out of school at 10 a.m. to commemorate the one-month anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in which 17 people were killed, and to push for gun reform.

In the coming months, several more nationwide, student-led rallies are planned to keep attention on the issue and press for legislative action.

On March 24, the nationwide March for Our Lives, led by survivors of the Parkland shooting, will hold rallies in Washington, D.C., and cities across the country. The event is meant to “demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be brought before Congress to address gun issues,” the website says.

“Today was wonderful. Today was important. Today was historical. But sadly, today was not enough,” reads a post on the March for Our Lives website in the wake of Wednesday’s school walkouts. “That is why 10 days from today we’re going to March and demand change... From walkouts, we march on.”

On April 20, another National School Walkout is planned, marking the anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting. The student-led event, organized by teens at Connecticut’s Ridgefield High School and beyond, is meant to protest “congressional, state, and local failures to take action to prevent gun violence,” per the website. Like Wednesday’s rallies, students across the country plan to leave class at 10 a.m., observe a moment of silence for gun violence victims and then hold protests.

“I think that student-led activism is the driving force for change in America,” Saleen, a 17-year-old senior at Lowell High School in San Francisco, told HuffPost Wednesday. “Congress refuses to make the changes that we need, and the only way to get them to listen is to be loud, proud and consistent.”

Beyond the national rallies, some student groups have begun planning further actions at the local level. In Wisconsin, students are planning a four-day, 50-mile march from Madison to the hometown of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in Janesville. Kicking off March 25, a day after the March for Our Lives, the 50 Miles More walk is about “keeping the national spotlight on gun reform,” says the website.

There are likely many more local and perhaps national student-led actions to come. Teens at San Francisco’s Lowell High have already scheduled a meeting on Sunday to discuss further actions, Saleen said.

Student organizers at Berkeley High School, across the San Francisco Bay, plan to use their lunch hours in the coming weeks to register and pre-register their peers to vote, as well as to write letters to representatives “demanding common-sense gun reform,” Roni, a 16-year-old Junior at Berkeley High, told HuffPost Wednesday.

AdvertisementRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) brought down the House on Tuesday with a loving tribute to female hip-hop and rap artists.

“Throughout the years, artists such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and Bruce Springsteen have been recognized on the floor of the House of Representatives,” Jeffries said. “Today, I rise to honor the top 10 female MC hip-hop collaborations of all time.”

Jeffries’ top 10 includes Eve’s “My Chick Bad,” Lauryn Hill’s “Ready Or Not” and, of course, Lil’ Kim’s “Quiet Storm” remix. He also shouted out the legendary Queen Latifah, MC Lyte and Salt-N-Pepa.

“As we celebrate Women’s History Month here in the United States’ Congress, these dynamic women are worthy to be praised,” Jeffries said.

This isn’t the first time the Brooklyn-native congressman has honored rap artists on the House floor. Last year, Jeffries paid tribute to New York rapper The Notorious B.I.G. on the 20th anniversary of his death.

So, for Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” host Trevor Noah went one step further and imagined what a recruitment ad for that service might look like.A woman who had been legally adopted by an American couple could be sent back to her birth country.

Patrick and Soo-Jinn Schreiber of Lawrence, Kansas, officially adopted Hyebin Schreiber, who’s originally from South Korea, when she was 17. The adoption was legally recognized under Kansas state law.

However, due to a legal loophole on her age at adoption, Hyebin, now 20, could be deported. And the family has filed a civil suit against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

“I belong here. I have family here. That’s where I should be. This is my home,” Hyebin told KCTV5 in Kansas City

Hyebin, a junior at the University of Kansas, came to the U.S. on a student visa when she was 15 years old after dealing with some family issues back in South Korea, KSHB in Kansas City reported. Patrick, a military veteran, is Hyebin’s biological uncle and had wanted to adopt her then. But the family postponed the process while he was deployed in Afghanistan for a year.

After the couple completed the adoption, Hyebin received a Kansas birth certificate and the family had assumed her immigration status would not pose any issues. But later on, the Schreibers discovered that their daughter would not be eligible for U.S. citizenship regardless of her birth certificate because of immigration law.

“It wasn’t until we applied for her citizenship, or a path to citizenship, is when we found out from [USCIS] that because we failed to adopt her prior to age 16, she would not be granted citizenship,” Patrick told KSHB.

What’s more, a state provision stipulates that a birth certificate from a foreign-born adoption does not guarantee U.S. citizenship. So Hyebin, who’s currently on a student visa, will have to leave the United States after she graduates from college, Military Times reported.

USCIS declined to comment on this case.

Patrick told Military Times that being unaware of the age policy is his “biggest mistake in life.” He now wishes he’d filed the adoption papers sooner.

“In my 27 years in the Army, we’re taught selfless service, but that’s probably one time I should have put my family ahead of the Army,” he told KSHB.

According to Military Times, if Hyebin is sent back to South Korea, the family will likely opt to move to the country so they won’t have to be separated from their daughter.Laura Dern couldn’t help channeling her 8-year-old self during filming for “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”

A federal judge in Texas has thrown out a lawsuit brought forward by the family of a Muslim teen who was arrested after bringing a homemade clock to school.

U.S. District Judge Sam Lindsay dismissed Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed’s case “with prejudice” on Tuesday. This means that the teen’s father cannot refile the lawsuit against the Irving Independent School District and other defendants named in the case using the same claims.

The judge also ruled that Mohamed’s family was responsible for covering the cost of the lawsuit.

Kathryn Long, an attorney for the school district, said it is “pleased that the Court has dismissed the case in its entirety.”

“The Court’s Order confirms that there is no plausible claim that Irving ISD or its employees violated anyone’s constitutional rights,” Long told HuffPost in an email. “Irving ISD is committed to the safety, well-being, and equality of all students.”

Mohamed’s son, Ahmed Mohamed, was arrested in September 2015 after administrators at Irving’s MacArthur High School mistook a clock that the student constructed inside a pencil case for a “hoax bomb.” Ahmed, then 14 years old, was sent to juvenile detention and suspended from school for three days.

Ahmed told local media at the time that he was passionate about robotics and wanted to impress teachers with his invention. Irving police later announced that they would not file charges against the teen.

Ahmed’s father claimed that the school district discriminated against Ahmed because of his race and religion. In 2016, Mohamed filed a lawsuit against the Irving school district, the city of Irving, and other defendants, saying that his son’s civil rights were violated.

The following year, Judge Lindsay ruled that Mohamed had failed to prove to the court that officials had discriminated against the teenager. Tuesday’s dismissal comes after the suit was refiled.

In a statement, the city of Irving told HuffPost that the court’s ruling supports the “justifiable actions” taken by its police officers.

Susan Hutchison, Mohamed’s attorney, indicated to HuffPost that she intends to move forward with the case.

“Certainly, we disagree with the court’s ruling and hope to prevail on appeal,” Hutchison said in an email.

Separately, the family had also filed a defamation lawsuit against Irving’s former mayor and a host of conservative news personalities and networks, including Glenn Beck and Fox News. According to Dallas News, the mayor and Fox News were dismissed from the suit, while Beck reached an undisclosed settlement with the family.Special Counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization as part of his investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, The New York Times reported on Thursday, citing two people briefed on the development.

Some of the documents are related to Russia, the sources said.

The subpoena is the first known instance of Mueller ordering the production of documents directly from President Donald Trump’s business during his nearly yearlong investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

Trump has denounced the probe as a “WITCH HUNT!” and said in July that he would consider any investigation into his finances as crossing a red line.

“I think that’s a violation,” he said in a Times interview at the time. “Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company.”

Mueller at the time had just asked Deutsche Bank, which has loaned the Trump Organization millions of dollars, to share information on accounts held by the Trump family.

A Trump Organization attorney said in a statement that the company continued to be “fully cooperative” with Mueller’s investigation.

The White House just got a whole lot friendlier.

Jennifer Aniston has been tapped to star in Netflix’s new political comedy “First Ladies” as the president of the United States. “One Mississippi” actress Tig Notaro will be playing her wife.

The film follows America’s first female president, the fictional Beverly Nicholson, and her wife, Kasey, as they move into the White House and prove that “behind every great woman... is another great woman,” the official description says.

The streaming service picked up the film based on an original pitch by Notaro and her wife, Stephanie Allynne, who will write the script together. Aniston is slated to produce the project alongside Notaro, Allynne, Adam McKay, Will Ferrell, Jessica Elbaum and Betsy Koch for Gloria Sanchez Productions. Chris Henchy will executive produce.

Aniston, who made her name on network TV, is also set to star with Reese Witherspoon in a currently untitled show about the behind-the-scenes action of competing morning shows. In November, Apple landed the rights to the series, which has no premiere date yet.After spending a year in space, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly is not the man he used to be — at least genetically speaking.

His genetic expression has changed, according to preliminary results from a NASA study that compared the bodily changes between the astronaut and his identical twin, who stayed on Earth while Kelly was aboard the International Space Station.

About 7 percent of Kelly’s gene activity has yet to “return to normal” ― almost two years after his yearlong expedition came to an end. Kelly has since retired from NASA.

The Twins Study, as it’s been dubbed, looked at what happened to Kelly — both from a physiological and psychological perspective — before, during and after his trip in space, and then compared that data to Kelly’s twin brother, Mark.

Mark Kelly is also a retired NASA astronaut. Unlike his brother, however, who spent months at a time in space, Mark’s missions were on the shorter side. His last ― and longest ― mission, which took place in 2011, lasted 15 days.

They have both retired from NASA, but continue to contribute to the @NASA Twins Study.

NASA described the research as a “perfect nature versus nurture study” ― one that could provide important insights into the effects of long-term spaceflight on the human body.

“By measuring large numbers of [the brothers’] metabolites, cytokines and proteins, researchers learned that spaceflight is associated with oxygen deprivation stress, increased inflammation, and dramatic nutrient shifts that affect gene expression,” NASA said of the study’s initial findings.

Although most of the biological changes Kelly experienced in space disappeared in the hours and days (and in some cases, weeks) after his return to Earth, NASA said some alterations appear to have persisted.

While 93 percent of his genetic expression has returned to normal, several hundred “space genes” still have changed activity levels, the data suggests. NASA said this could indicate “longer term changes” in genetic expression, caused by the stresses of spaceflight.

NASA said it would be releasing more findings from the Twins Study in the coming months. This research, they added, will inform their planning for a mission to Mars, which would see astronauts spending some three years in space.

Reacting to the news of the study results this week, Kelly expressed amazement at his body’s changes ― and also used the opportunity to poke fun at his brother.

“This could be good news,” he joked on Twitter. “I no longer have to call [Mark] my identical twin brother anymore.”

What? My DNA changed by 7%! Who knew? I just learned about it in this article. This could be good news! I no longer have to call @ShuttleCDRKelly my identical twin brother anymore. https://t.co/6idMFtu7l5 — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) March 10, 2018Rihanna is outraged by an ad on Snapchat that downplayed abuse by referencing Chris Brown’s 2009 conviction for assaulting her while they were dating.

The ad, which is for a game called “Would You Rather,” asks users if they would rather “slap Rihanna” or “punch Chris Brown.”

The social media platform told BBC News that it published the ad “in error” and removed it last weekend, as soon as it was made aware of its mistake. Snapchat has a review process for ads that states it will not publish ads that feature “shocking, sensational, or disrespectful content.”

“We are sorry that this happened,” Snapchat said.

Is it just me, or is this ad that popped up on my Snapchat extremely tone deaf? Like what were they thinking with this? pic.twitter.com/7kP9RHcgNG — Royce Mann (@TheRoyceMann) March 12, 2018

Rihanna, however, isn’t accepting the apology. The singer posted an Instagram story Thursday that said “Throw the whole app-oligy away” in response to Snapchat.

“I’d love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain’t that dumb!” she wrote. “You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it!!! This isn’t about my personal feelings, cause I don’t have much of them … but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven’t made it out yet … you let us down!”

Her statement was shared on Twitter by Gennette Cordova:

After Rihanna called the company out, Snapchat apologized again, saying the ad was “disgusting.”

The insensitive ad came to the public’s attention on Monday when Twitter user Royce Mann screenshot and posted it to the social media platform. It didn’t take long for other users to express their outrage ― including activists Brittany Packnett and Chelsea Clinton.

I know that social media ads go through an approval process from the platform.



This means @Snapchat approved an ad that makes light of domestic violence.

Following Rihanna’s response, shares for Snap Inc., Snapchat’s parent company, dropped nearly 5 percent, Bloomberg reported.

The “Wild Thoughts” singer isn’t the only celebrity whose star power has influenced the company’s value.

In February, the company dropped in value after Kylie Jenner tweeted, “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore.”

“Would You Rather” did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.Jimmy Kimmel might end up costing President Donald Trump’s family some big money.

In light of the White House’s “buy American” rhetoric, the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” host bought a bunch of merchandise from the Trump Store, which is run by two of the president’s sons, to see where it all came from.

“I’m sure Eric and Donald Jr. take this American thing very seriously,” Kimmel said. “These guys are red, white and blue to the core. They’re like a couple of flags wearing hair gel, these two.”

Well, not so much.

Most of the merchandise Kimmel purchased was made abroad, and two items didn’t list a country of origin at all. Kimmel said such an omission could lead to potential fines of up to $500,000 if it turns out these products were made overseas.

“This could be very expensive,” Kimmel said. “Not to mention embarrassing. Are they even capable of shame? I mean Trump’s whole platform is about American companies, his company isn’t even supporting America!”

And Kimmel has a way to fix it.

“I’ll just file an official complaint and let them sort it out,” he said to cheers.Nashville's Song Sufragettes. Song Suffragettes

Critics don’t hesitate to point out that country music is a male-dominated industry. In fact, some data suggests that with the recent popularity of “bro country” — think Luke Bryan or Blake Shelton — the problem has gotten worse.

Women artists notoriously don’t get as much airtime on country radio stations as their male counterparts. If you look at the current Billboard Country Airplay chart, every artist in the top 20 is a male singer or group of men ― with the sole exception of pop singer Bebe Rexha, who collaborated with Florida Georgia Line on “Meant to Be.”

Women of color face even more challenges in country music. Their historical contributions to the genre have been erased, and the contemporary mainstream scene is seriously lacking in diversity.

In recent years, many women in country music have lamented their underrepresentation on the radio and at live music events.

“You would think that we would be farther along in the thinking about women in country music,” Carrie Underwood told Billboard in 2014. “There is certainly not a shortage of talented ladies out there that want so badly to get their fair shot in this business. But there seems to be only room for only a few.”

During a candid discussion with other female artists about sexism in country music in 2016, Margot Price said she’s often the only woman on the bill at country shows and notices that many labels seem hesitant to take on female musicians. “Follow Your Arrow” singer Kacey Musgraves said women are held to different standards than men when it comes to radio play.

“If they can’t get your song off the ground, it’s immediately blamed on your personality, or the fact that you’re female, or that you didn’t make a radio station program director feel important,” she noted.

In addition to speaking out, many female country artists over the years have recorded songs that tackle gender equality and women’s issues. In honor of Women’s History Month, we’ve put together a list of country songs that feature feminist messages.

“Girl in a Country Song” by Maddie & Tae

Maddie & Tae’s 2014 debut single quickly became known as “the feminist country song.” The Billboard Country Airplay chart-topper was a response to troubling trends in contemporary country music — namely the rampant objectification of women in songs and music videos from male artists.

Notable lyric: “Like all we’re good for is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend, nothing more.”

“Time’s Up” by Song Suffragettes

In January 2018, 23 members of Song Suffragettes ― a Nashville songwriting coalition for women ― contributed vocals on “Time’s Up,” an empowering song recorded in support of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund to combat sexual misconduct in the workplace. The group is vocal about women’s issues, even creating the hashtag #LetTheGirlsPlay to bring attention to the shortage of airtime and live performance spots for female country singers.

Notable lyric: “They say good things come to those who wait. But we’ve waited long enough. Our time is here. Our time is now. Our time has come. And your time is up.”

“Quarterback” by Kira Isabella

Released in March 2014, Kira Isabella’s “Quarterback” is one of the first mainstream country songs to tackle the topic of rape culture. The lyrics tell the story of a high school girl in the marching band who survives sexual assault at the hands of the hometown hero football star. Even after degrading photos of her appear on Internet, the town sides with the eponymous quarterback.

Notable lyric: “Who you gonna blame, the star of the game or the no name girl in the freshman class?”

“Just Because I’m a Woman” by Dolly Parton

In 1968, Dolly Parton addressed the sexist double standards women face with the title track off her second solo album. “Just Because I’m A Woman” was an anti-slut-shaming anthem before the phrase took hold in mainstream media.

Notable lyric: “Yes I’ve made my mistakes, but listen and understand, my mistakes are no worse than yours just because I’m a woman.”

“One More Girl” by The Wreckers

A country-fied cover of an early track from singer-songwriter Patty Griffin, the Wreckers’ “One More Girl” (2006) is a frank song about the objectification of women. Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp sing about being reduced to sexual objects, as “one more girl on a stage, just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans.”

Notable lyric: “Did you ever take the time to think about who I might be? Where I’ve been, what I’m thinking, who I love, what I’ve seen? ... I’m one more car out on the road that you might pass on your way home. I’m someone’s sister or someone’s wife or just some bitch who’s probably got no life.”

“What Part of No” by Lorrie Morgan

“What Part of No” speaks from the perspective of a woman at a bar who is fed up with the man persistently hitting on her. The 1992 song is an anthem of female agency in the face of harassment.

Notable lyric: “Sir if you don’t mind, I’d rather be alone, from the moment I walked in tonight; you‘ve been coming on. If I told you once, I told you twice, I’m just here to unwind. I’m not interested in romance, or what you have in mind. What part of no don’t you understand?”

“The Pill” by Loretta Lynn

The meaning of Loretta Lynn’s controversial 1975 song, “The Pill,” is pretty straightforward. It’s a celebration from the perspective of a woman who just gained freedom and control over her reproductive health through access to birth control.

Notable lyric: “I’m turning down your brooder house cause now I’ve got the pill. All these years I’ve stayed at home while you had all your fun and every year that’s gone by, another baby’s come. There’s gonna be some changes made right here on nursery hill. You set this chicken your last time cause now I’ve got the pill.”

“Follow Your Arrow” by Kacey Musgraves

Kacey Musgraves’ 2013 song calls out the double standards women face (“you’re damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t”) and empowers listeners to be true to themselves. The chorus is also explicitly non-heteronormative with its “kiss lots of boys or kiss lots of girls if that’s something you’re into” line.

Notable lyric: “If you save yourself for marriage, you’re a bore. If you don’t save yourself for marriage, you’re a whore ... able person. If you won’t have a drink, then you’re a prude. But they’ll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one.”

“Harper Valley P.T.A.” by Jeannie C. Riley

This narrative song, which has ben covered by Martina McBride, tells the story of a widow and mom who stands up for herself after being slut-shamed for the way she dresses and raises her teenage daughter. In a PTA meeting, she calls out the parents who shamed her by highlighting their various examples of misconduct and utter hypocrisy.

Notable lyric: “Mrs. Johnson, you’re wearing your dresses way too high. It’s reported you’ve been drinkin’ and runnin’ round with men and goin’ wild. And we don’t believe you oughta be a bringin’ up your little girl this way.” “Guys Do It All The Time” by Mindy McCready

Mindy McCready’s 1996 song addresses the double standards for men and women when it comes to bad behavior. The narrator of the song complains about being chastised for staying out late and getting drunk with her girlfriends, while many men do the same thing all the time without shame. Notable lyric: “Guys do it all the time. And you expect us to understand. When the shoe’s on the other foot. You know that’s when it hits the fan.” “He Thinks He’ll Keep Her” by Mary Chapin Carpenter

Mary Chapin Carpenter’s “He Thinks He’ll Keep Her” tells the story of a woman who gains the strength to walk away from an unhappy marriage after 15 years of dutiful work as a housewife and mother ― juxtaposed against the perspective of a husband who “thinks he’ll keep” his wife because she does everything right. After leaving her husband (and her 15-year job with “not one raise in pay”), the wife can only find a minimum-wage job in the working world. The 1993 song was reportedly inspired by the tagline of 1970s ads for Geritol. Notable lyric: “And every Christmas card showed a perfect family. Everything runs right on time. Years of practice and design. Spit and polish till it shines, he thinks he’ll keep her.” “Don’t Put Her Down (You Helped Put Her There)” by Hazel Dickens

This song by bluegrass singer-songwriter Hazel Dickens is another one that calls for men to understand the way their mistreatment of women and complicity in oppression creates certain female archetypes.

Notable lyric: “You abuse her, accuse her, turn her round and use her. Then forsake her any time it suits you. There’s more to her than powder and paint, than her peroxided bleached-out hair. And if she acts that way it’s ’cause you’ve had your day. Don’t put her down, you helped put her there.” “Better Than You Left Me” by Mickey Guyton

Mickey Guyton’s 2015 debut single, “Better Than You Left Me,” is about her growth and renewed strength as a woman after a breakup. It also propelled Guyton, one of the relatively small number of black women country artists, to the Billboard Country Airplay Top 40. Notable lyric: “I’m better than I was when you walked out that door. I’m stronger than the woman, the one that you knew back then. So don’t you think I’ll take you back like every time before.” “Not Ready To Make Nice” by The Dixie Chicks

After being shunned by the country music industry for their lead singer’s criticism of President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, The Dixie Chicks fought back with “Not Ready to Make Nice.” The 2006 anthem of resistance was in many ways ahead of its time, forging the path for artists and celebrities to use their platforms to speak out on issues that matter to them.

Notable lyric: “And how in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that they’d write me a letter saying that I better ‘Shut up and sing’ or my life will be over! ... I’m not ready to make nice. I’m not ready to back down. I’m still mad as hell and I don’t have time to go round and round and round.”

“Fight Like a Girl” by Kalie Shorr

Kalie Shorr’s “Fight Like a Girl” was a response to #SaladGate ― a 2015 incident when a country radio consultant said women artists shouldn’t get a lot of airplay because they’re the “tomatoes of our salad” while men are “the lettuce.” Shorr’s song is about female empowerment and grit in the face of adversity.

Notable lyric: “I’m perfume sweet and whiskey strong. I damn sure ain’t no underdog. I might fall down but I get back up. I shine brightest when the going’s tough. You say I can’t ― well, darling, watch me. You can’t stop me ’cause I fight like a girl.”

“A Broken Wing” by Martina McBride

Martina McBride’s “A Broken Wing” (1997) tells the story of a woman escaping an emotionally abusive relationship and finding her strength to “fly ... with a broken wing.”

Notable lyric: “With a broken wing. She carries her dreams. Man you oughta see her fly.”

“I’m a Survivor” by Reba McEntire

The theme song to her show “Reba,” McEntire’s “I’m a Survivor” celebrates women’s might. The 2001 song focuses on a premature baby girl and a hardworking single mom and their roles as “fighters” and “survivors.”

Notable lyric: “A single mom who works two jobs. Who loves her kids and never stops. With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter. I’m a survivor.”Samantha Bee broke down why Wednesday’s nationwide school walkout in support of gun control was such a step forward.

The “Full Frontal” host said thousands of students who walked out of their schools protesting gun violence were “filling me with hope.”

“And I’m sure they’ve also been filling the GOP establishment with fear,” she added.

Bee noted “one of the worst parts of my job” was her broadcasts that followed mass shootings.

“I’ve screamed, I’ve cried, I’ve seen staffers have panic attacks because of their own brushes with gun violence,” she said. “We cover hard topics all the time, but gun violence is the worst, because honestly I never thought anything would change.”

But Bee ended on an upbeat note. “I should have known better,” she said. “I should have known that a generation would come that wouldn’t repeat our mistakes.”

AdvertisementDemi Lovato marked six years of sobriety on Wednesday, and her fans celebrated with her.

The “Sorry Not Sorry” singer proudly tweeted her anniversary, saying she was grateful for her joy while reminding those struggling that kicking substance abuse “IS possible.”

Just officially turned 6 years sober. So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible. 🙏🏼 — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) March 15, 2018

The former Disney Channel star has been fairly open about her battle with drugs and alcohol.

She’s had her temptations, like her recently disclosed night at the 2016 Met Gala that nearly drove her to drink and sent her right into an AA meeting. But that became just one of many obstacles the 25-year-old Grammy nominee has overcome.

Demi Lovato, pictured Tuesday at a concert in Detroit, wrote that she was "grateful for another year of joy." Scott Legato via Getty Images

“What keeps me on this path is there’s a drive that I have to stay sober because I know that my life depends on it,” Lovato told “Entertainment Tonight” last year. “If I would have continued down that road, I don’t know if I’d be here today.”

People on Twitter congratulated Lovato.

So proud of you. Your recovery inspired me to get clean. It will be 5 years April 1st 💖 — Amanda (@nomakeupmetria) March 15, 2018

Yasss girl! That’s amazing 😘 — Adelaide Wilson (@addieey279) March 15, 2018When “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek introduced Paris Themmen as an “entrepreneur” and “avid backpacker” on Tuesday night’s show, he failed to note that his guest had a famous past.

And Themmen didn’t mention it either.

But you can’t fool viewers, who quickly identified the 58-year-old contestant as the TV-obsessed little cowboy Mike Teevee from the 1971 film, “Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory.”

Twitter lit up.

Is nobody realizing that Paris on Jeopardy right now, is Mike TV from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?.... Like legit it’s the actor. — Rachel Michele (@rachelmichele25) March 13, 2018

And Themmen, whose character dreamed of getting on television, performed well on the tube, finishing second.

Not a golden ticket, but pretty good.

AdvertisementA minor league baseball team in Pennsylvania released a player after a TV station posted video of him beating his girlfriend when he played on a Texas team, according to news outlets.

The Lancaster Barnstormers fired outfielder Danry Vasquez after KRIS-TV showed security camera video from Aug. 2, 2016, that captured him repeatedly hitting a woman and pulling her hair.

“There is no choice but to sever the relationship,” Ross Peeples, manager of the independent Lancaster team, said on Facebook Wednesday. “Neither I, nor the Barnstormers’ organization as a whole, can condone or associate with that behavior.”

The security clip (below) shows Vasquez attacking the woman in a stairwell at the stadium of the Class AA Corpus Christi Hooks, a Houston Astros affiliate, where Vasquez had been a player.

Please note the following video may be disturbing to some viewers.Let’s all hope President Donald Trump’s next candidate for secretary of state isn’t Ryan Zinke. Because as evidenced by a stupid blunder on Thursday, diplomacy isn’t his strong suit.

The incident centers around Zinke’s tone-deaf reaction to Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii), whose grandfathers were incarcerated by the U.S. government during World War II for their Japanese heritage. She said one of her grandfathers, a U.S. citizen, didn’t speak about the painful experience until much later in life.

Hanabusa shared the detail Thursday morning in a hearing with the interior secretary, seeking to persuade him to restore around $2 million in grant funds for organizations dedicated to preserving the memory of that ugly chapter in American history.

“I believe that it is essential that we as a nation recognize our darkest moments so that we don’t have them repeat again,” Hanabusa urged Zinke.

“My grandfather was born in Hawaii and is a citizen by birth,” Hanabusa noted during the hearing. Despite being a U.S. citizen, however, he was imprisoned in an Oahu camp called Honouliuli ― though the prisoners there used a different name: “jigokudani,” or “Hell’s Valley.”

After listening to her concerns, and for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Zinke responded to the U.S. representative with a cheery and extremely tone-deaf “Konnichiwa!”

The phrase ― which, let’s remember, Hanabusa’s grandfather imprisoned on Oahu was a U.S. citizen ― means “good afternoon” or “good day” in Japanese. If you’re wondering what sort of reaction it prompted from the audience, here’s a perfectly good summary:

House Natural Resources Committee Democrats

A short yet painfully awkward silence followed, as indicated by the shocked woman in the above photo.

Hanabusa broke the tension with a terse, “I think it’s still ‘ohayo gozaimasu’ [good morning], but that’s OK.”

Several social media users, including many Asian-Americans, took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Zinke’s handling of a sensitive topic. Some labeled his choice of greeting as “racist”:

Once a friend of mine accidentally said “Konichiwa” to a Japanese waitress in a Japanese restaurant when he meant to say “Arigatou” and spent the meal so mortified he barely ate and also, Ryan Zinke is racist af. https://t.co/VwsT7RVKzY — shing yin khor (@sawdustbear) March 15, 2018

Hanabusa had been inquiring specifically about the Japanese American Confinement Sites Grant Program, which Congress established to preserve sites where Japanese-Americans were detained during World War II, a time of rampant anti-Japanese sentiment. As the congresswoman mentioned, Trump’s 2019 budget proposal, unveiled in February, would eliminate funding for the program ― a move widely criticized by Japanese-American activists.

“The JACS grant program is an important component of our country’s recognition of the egregious wrong that was done, and the need to remember and preserve that history so that it not be repeated,” the Japanese American Citizens League wrote in a statement.A University of Pennsylvania law professor will no longer teach a first-year lecture class after backlash to her claim that black students score lower than their counterparts.

Amy Wax, who made the racial inferiority argument in an interview last fall that resurfaced recently, will lose her duties teaching the introductory civil procedure class, Penn Law dean Ted Ruger announced Tuesday. He insisted the decision was not a penalty of any kind, and noted Wax will retain her faculty status, seniority and tenure.

“She will be similarly situated to a substantial majority of our tenured and chaired faculty, most of whom do not teach required first-year courses,” Ruger said in an email to students.

Ruger slammed Wax’s claim as false, but said she’s entitled to free expression and will continue teaching elective classes.

“Black students have graduated in the top of the class at Penn Law,” Ruger told The Daily Pennsylvanian, the student newspaper. “And contrary to any suggestion otherwise, black students at Penn Law are extremely successful, both inside and outside the classroom, in the job market, and in their careers.”

Wax cited her experience with the civil procedure class in an interview last fall with Brown University professor Glenn Loury.

“Here’s a very inconvenient fact, Glenn: I don’t think I’ve ever seen a black student graduate in the top quarter of the class, and rarely, rarely, in the top half,” Wax said. “I can think of one or two students who scored in the top half of my required first-year course.” She said the class has 89 to 95 students per year, “so I’m going on that because a lot of this data is a closely guarded secret.”

Ruger said Wax violated school policy by mentioning student grades to back up her argument.

Alumni circulated an online petition this week urging Ruger to take action after Wax’s comments resurfaced. The professor’s claims are “in clear violation of the terms and spirit of Penn Law’s anonymous grading policy, and compromise the law school’s assurance that grades are maintained by the Registrar under strict scrutiny,” the petition says.

Wax’s views on race ignited backlash even before her interview with Loury. In August, she wrote an op-ed published in The Philadelphia Inquirer that declared, “All cultures are not equal. Or at least they are not equal in preparing people to be productive in an advanced economy.”

Wax declined to comment to HuffPost. She has defended her statements in the past, and doubled down on her argument in an interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, asserting that people seek to move to countries with “superior” bourgeois values.

“I don’t shrink from the word, ‘superior.’ Everyone wants to go to countries ruled by white Europeans,” she said.

More than 30 Penn law professors signed an open letter condemning Wax’s statements.

She has pushed back, however, arguing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month that hurling epithets at people who promote unpopular views is wrong.The Charmed Ones are back.

The CW announced last year it was working on a reboot of the hit series “Charmed,” and now it has summoned an official trailer. Instead of Prue, Piper and Phoebe, the trailer introduces us to Mel, Maggie and Macy.

“Charmed” 2.0 is already setting itself apart from The WB’s 1998-2006 incarnation, putting women of color in the three lead roles. Sarah Jeffery plays Maggie, Melonie Diaz is Mel, and Macy is portrayed by Afro-Latina actress Madeleine Mantock.

Fans of sister CW show “Jane the Virgin” should note that the supernatural showdowns are being executive-produced by “Jane” creator Jennie Snyder Urman. And seeing as that show is ending next year, the Power of Three may have the magic cure to fill the telenovela hole in your heart.

This iteration of “Charmed,” per Shadow and Act, has Mel as “a graduate student in the women’s studies department her mother heads at Hilltowne University” while “Maggie is a freshman considering rushing a sorority (to Mel’s bemused dismay) and going ‘on’ again with her on-again off-again boyfriend Brian.”

The Charmed Ones appear in a shot from the trailer. Youtube

The trailer takes us through the tragic death of Marisol, their mother, and the discovery by her two daughters of a third, older and previously unknown sister, Macy, who is a “brilliant geneticist.” All three sisters appear to have supernatural powers mostly like the original trio: Mel can freeze time (like Piper), Macy is telekinetic (like Prue) and Maggie can hear others’ thoughts (unlike Phoebe, who had the power of premonition).

HuffPost caught up with the OG Piper, Holly Marie Combs, who has spoken out about the reboot before. Combs told HuffPost that while she appreciates “the jobs and opportunities the ‘Charmed’ reboot has created,” she doesn’t understand “what is fierce, funny or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago.”

“I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain,” she told us. “Reboots fare better when they honor the original as opposed to taking shots at the original. Reboots also do better when they listen to a still passionate fan base which is what it’s all about, isn’t it? That’s why we do reboots. The fans are why we all get to do what we do. So we wish them well and hope for success.”

Hear, hear, Holly!

As for what mayhem the revised trio will get up to... the devils are in the details.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Phoebe in the original “Charmed” could hear others’ thoughts. In fact, she had the power of premonition.A British Muslim activist is trying to turn around an anti-Muslim hate campaign that’s mailing letters to addresses across the U.K.

Shahab Adris, an activist from Leeds, is encouraging interfaith allies to shower Muslims with love after racist “Punish a Muslim” letters began showing up in mailboxes and calling on people to terrorize British Muslim communities with violence.

Adris’ “Love A Muslim” letter mimics the format of the “Punish a Muslim” campaign. But instead of acts of violence, it urges acts of kindness. For example, the letter assigns 10 points for smiling at Muslims, 25 points for buying Muslims coffee with cake, 500 points for fasting with Muslims during Ramadan, and 1,000 points for raising funds to help needy residents of Iraq or Syria.

Adris, a regional manager for the advocacy group Muslim Engagement And Development, said he felt “compelled to put something totally positive out there in response to the original vile letter.”

“It’s crucial to rid our society from anti-Muslim popular attitudes and the best way we can do this is by engaging and enjoying each other’s company,” Adris told HuffPost in an email. “There is so much we can learn from each other and together we can make our communities a more welcoming and tension-free environment.”

British Muslim communities have been alarmed by the “Punish a Muslim” letters reportedly sent to people across the U.K., including at least three Muslim politicians. The letters assign points for terrorizing Muslims on April 3 ― from 25 points for pulling Muslim women’s headscarves, to 1,000 points for bombing a mosque.

Counterterrorism police are investigating the “potentially malicious communications,” but haven’t identified those responsible.

Adris said the “unusual” nature of the point system encouraging violence has caused significant distress in British Muslim communities. He said he also worries about potential consequences for non-Muslims.

“We were getting increasingly concerned because people who are perceived to be Muslim can potentially be a target too, such as the Sikh community, and even the Jewish, Hindu, and even people with beards,” Adris said.

He said he’s been encouraged by the positive response after posting his “Love a Muslim” letter to Facebook and Twitter. Some non-Muslims have pledged to take Muslim colleagues out for coffee and cake.

Muslim Engagement And Development is considering mailing the letter to “random people,” Adris said. Volunteers plan to set up community events on April 3 to help people celebrate “Love a Muslim” day.

On the 3rd April, don't listen to the bigots and their "Punish a Muslim" day, instead let's show that our communities won't be divided, that hope is better than fear and we have more in common. #LoveAMuslimDay https://t.co/YhPXBMb403 — Thelma Walker MP (@Thelma_WalkerMP) March 12, 2018

Other people say that the “Love a Muslim” effort, though noble, diverts attention from rampant Islamophobia that inspired the hate letter the first place.

As lovely as #LoveAMuslimDay might be it shouldnt detract from the fact that there has, I feel, been a hate crime committed. It encourages bombing, acid attacks, torture and violence . It incites religious hatred. What is being done about it? @metpoliceuk @WestYorksPolice ? pic.twitter.com/FLKQY5Hjgh — Siema Iqbal (@siemaiqbal) March 12, 2018

of course there's room for this stuff, but we have to recognise that there's a more fundamental issue here, that is that Islamophobia is widespread. People are obviously outraged at the letters, but how about the more subtle Islamophobia we experience day to day — AssedBaig (@AssedBaig) March 12, 2018

Faima Bakar, a British Muslim journalist for Metro, wrote that it’s worrying that Muslims “need to go out of our way to show how normal and British we are, and that a whole day has to be dedicated to reversing an already abundant belief that we’re a problem community.”

“Are the people that retweet the initiative going to stand up for lesser obvious and tangible evidence of bigotry?” Baker wrote in Metro. “Muslims are human beings too, so why do we need to prove this?”

Adris said that in the face of extreme hatred, he believes it’s important to remain positive “and show a level of creativity.”

“We must rise above it and actively show a level of compassion and love to our fellow citizens,” Adris wrote.

In the meantime, he encouraged fellow British Muslims and their allies to be “on guard” and to contact his group and local police if they encounter evidence of hate crimes.On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Conan,” the wrestler-turned-actor put host Conan O’Brien’s acting skills to the test. For the spoof segment, O’Brien had a shot at becoming Johnson’s stunt double for his upcoming movie, “Rampage.”Actress Gal Gadot probably didn’t mean to offend anyone with a recent tweet — but she certainly did.

Stephen Hawking died Wednesday at the age of 76 from complications due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. On the day of his death, many, including “Wonder Woman” herself, mourned the world-renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist on social media.

“Rest in peace Dr. Hawking,” Gadot wrote in a tweet. “Now you’re free of any physical constraints. Your brilliance and wisdom will be cherished forever.”

Rest in peace Dr. Hawking. Now you're free of any physical constraints.. Your brilliance and wisdom will be cherished forever ✨ pic.twitter.com/EQzSxqNTuN — Gal Gadot (@GalGadot) March 14, 2018

People with disabilities and their advocates took offense at Gadot’s statement that Hawking was finally free of his “physical constraints” and said the assertion was ableist, or discriminatory toward people with disabilities.

Hawking was diagnosed with ALS at the age of 21 — and is believed to have been living with the condition longer than any other patient in medical history. He spent the majority of his public life in a wheelchair and used a sophisticated computer system to speak.

Several people on Twitter explained to Gadot that it’s bothersome when a disability is viewed as something that inhibits a person from living life to the fullest and that death relieves a person of this burden.

I think you’re fantastic Gal but this tweet is very ableist. His physical constraints didn’t stop him from changing the world. People with disabilities don’t wish for death to be free of their challenges. We wish to be valued for what we CAN do, not pitied for we can’t. — Adam B. Zimmerman (@ABZimm) March 14, 2018

Yes!!!! Thank you. Stop making death seem like a positive alternative to being disabled!! It’s that attitude more than anything that makes disabled ppl’s lives difficult. — Nina Fiore (@NeedsNYC) March 14, 2018

Gal I am chronically ill. Can't shower or even get myself out of bed. Lost 18 years thus far. But I ran a charity funding research for my illness #ME and advocate for Change. All from my bed. Is my life not important? Disablement is not shameful, bigotry is. Watch @unrestfilm pls — amara campbell (@amaracampbell) March 14, 2018

Ms. Gadot, he will always be remembered for his brilliance and humor despite his physical condition. I must disagree however, with a mind like his, he had no physical constants. He took trips through space, time and dimensions that we could not even imagine. May he Rest In Peace. — Rev. Gary Conkle (@nthdeegree) March 14, 2018

So what we're NOT gonna do is talk about Stephen Hawking's disability like it was a tragedy. Because it wasn't. Disabilities are not tragedies. Abled people can go away. https://t.co/e1PB6TB79F — Ophelia Brown (@bandaidknees) March 14, 2018

Hawking has even credited his ALS as a motivating factor in his life.

“Before my condition was diagnosed, I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing,” he wrote in his 2013 memoir My Brief History. The realization that he might not even live long enough to earn his Ph.D. inspired Hawking to pour himself into his work.

“I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do if I was reprieved,” he wrote.

He added cheekily, “After all, if I was going to die anyway, I might as well do some good.”

Gadot is not alone in her thinking, however. Some disability advocates were bothered by media coverage that fixated on Hawking’s ALS and suggested he was heroic simply for living with the condition.

for the love of dog and all things holy, please don’t describe stephen hawking as having overcome his disability, or his disability as inability, or any number of boring, ableist tropes that take away from what an utter badass he was and how the world was better for him in it. — ace ratcliff ♿️ (@MortuaryReport) March 14, 2018

Cartoonist Mitchell Toy ‏also drew a tribute to Hawking that many viewed as ableist.

I know that people are not sharing this image to be ableist, but please remember that it ties into the rhetoric of “Stephen Hawking is now free of his wheelchair now that he is dead”. This is highly problematic since it reinforces the “better dead than disabled” trope. pic.twitter.com/08csp8Ml1d — Derek Newman-Stille (@DNewmanStille) March 15, 2018

The image also suggests that Hawking was not free as a wheelchair user. Remember, his wheelchair allowed him mobility and access to different areas. He was not “confined to his wheelchair” as people keep saying - his wheelchair was a vehicle of freedom, not confinement. — Derek Newman-Stille (@DNewmanStille) March 15, 2018

This is such a problematic image! It is an ableist fantasy that every person with a disability dreams of being made "Typically-abled" in the after-life. Not to mention that Stephen Hawking did not believe in an after-life! https://t.co/GZJXA1SRqE — Hank Jenkins (@HankAJenkins) March 14, 2018

“It just reinforces the ableist view that disability is something negative,” filmmaker and activist Dominick Evans, who has spinal muscular atrophy — a progressive neuromuscular disability — told HuffPost of Gadot’s comment. “[It] encourages sentiments and beliefs that disabled people are somehow less simply because of their disability.”
