Sarah Paulson found it a little distracting to work, work, work, work, work, work with Rihanna while filming their upcoming movie, “Ocean’s 8.”

“It was sort of a daily struggle not to embarrass myself because every time I looked at her, I was like, ‘Work, work, work, work, work, work,’” the Emmy-winning actress told Ellen DeGeneres while doing a little shimmy on Monday. “It’s just deeply nerdy, and [Sandra Bullock] would just constantly look at me like, ‘Hey, dial it down. Just stop.’ And I’d be like, ‘What? I gotta just do it.’”

Paulson even began pitching songs she’d make up on the fly to Rihanna, which the singer apparently had no time for.

“She’d be like, ‘No … I really need you to stop singing,’” Paulson, 43, told DeGeneres. “She thought my lyrics weren’t so bad but my melody was terrible. And she gives great side-eye, so the minute she does it, you’re like, ‘I’m really sorry.’”

TheEllenShow

When DeGeneres asked Paulson if the two eventually became friends despite her geeky tendencies, she replied, “I like to think I did … I think we’re friends,” adding that they text sometimes.

Paulson said the two recently “had fun” watching Madonna perform at the Met Gala together.

“So y’all are pals?” DeGeneres asked.

“Yeah, we’re best friends,” Paulson said sarcastically before mouthing “no” to the audience.The popular co-host of a Boston radio sports program has been suspended after using a fake Asian accent to impersonate the agent of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

Station managers suspended Christian Fauria on Friday for five days after what he called a “horrible attempt at humor.” While pretending to speak as Don Yee, Brady’s athletic agent, Fauria had used an accent that many consider to be a racist stereotype of Asians. Yee was born in Sacramento, California.

Fauria, who co-hosts the daily program “Ordway, Merloni & Fauria” that’s broadcast throughout Massachusetts on WEEI-FM, said in a statement that he has reached out to Yee to personally apologize for his racially “insensitive” impersonation.

He also posted an apology on Twitter to both Yee and his audience for the “regrettable” stunt. Fauria, who played tight end for the Patriots from 2002 to 2005, said he “fully” supports management’s decision to discipline him.

Earlier today I made a horrible attempt at humor. In a segment during the show, I impersonated agent Don Yee in an insensitive and regrettable way. I want to publicly apologize to Don and anyone in the audience who heard it. — christian fauria (@christianfauria) February 10, 2018

I have also reached out to Don directly to personally apologize. I have been disciplined by WEEI management and I fully support their decision. — christian fauria (@christianfauria) February 10, 2018

It was the second major bumble related to Brady on the sports radio station. Before the Super Bowl, Brady cut short his weekly appearance on the station’s “Kirk and Callahan” program to protest after a host on another program, Alex Reimer, called Brady’s 5-year-old daughter an “annoying little pissant.”

WEEI-FM’s managers issued a statement saying they did not “support or condone” Fauria’s behavior, adding: “We apologize to Mr. Yee and those offended by the segment.”

Every boarder had three cracks at the course, with each athlete’s result calculated as the best score of the three as assessed by the nine judges.

Despite frigid temperatures of -13 Celsius, the sun shone down on the fans gathered at the foot of the slope to cheer on the riders. However, it was a strong cross-wind of 2 m/s, combined with nerves, that caused problems for the athletes on their first run.

Over half the competitors suffered a fall on the first run, including a heavy fall for Parrot, before New Zealand’s Carlos Garcia Knight kick-started the competition with a switch backside 1260 on the final kicker to lead after the first heat. He would never improve on that to finish fifth.

With rivals Sebastien Toutant, Gerard and Parrot still struggling to land a clean run, McMorris took control of the contest with a spectacular second run, finishing with a backside triple cork 1620 to score 85.20 and take the lead.

Gerard raised the bar with his backside triple cork 1440 during his final run to take the lead off McMorris and the Canadian couldn’t respond, falling on the final kicker.

Parrot landed the same trick on his third run but could only score 86.00 to finish second. Afterwards, Parrot admitted to feeling the pressure going into the final run of the morning.

“I felt a lot of pressure, especially after bailing my first two runs and not putting a score down. I had to land this run so the pressure was at its maximum level but I think I dealt pretty well with it,” Parrot told reporters.Chris Mazdzer revels in his history-making achievement.

Hey, it took just 54 years.

Chris Mazdzer won a silver medal in the luge singles at the Winter Olympics on Sunday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, becoming the first U.S. man to earn a medal in the event.

Austria’s David Gleirscher took gold and Germany’s Johannes Ludwig bronze.

You think Mazdzer’s happy?

Mazdzer finished 13th in two previous Winter Games, so this was quite a step up.

Mazdzer had slumped on the World Cup circuit recently, but it didn’t matter on the world’s biggest stage.

“I like being the underdog,” he told USA Today earlier.

The event premiered at the 1964 Winter Olympics. That’s a lot of Olympics ago.

The U.S. men’s team had previously captured medals in the luge doubles competition (1998 and 2002).JAKARTA (Reuters) - Zulfikar Fahd, an openly gay man, says he flew from Indonesia to Canada late last month and claimed asylum on grounds that he faced discrimination and persecution in his home country, which is poised to criminalise same-sex relations and consensual sex outside marriage.

Fahd, 30, who had worked in public relations, said he had already given up hope that the police would provide him protection against Islamic fundamentalists who have fomented hostility towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in this Muslim-majority country, which is also the world’s third-largest democracy.

Police have stood by while vigilantes have stormed “gay sex parties”, and have themselves broken up gatherings at spas and hostels, charging some with violating strict pornography laws, and prompting many others to go underground. The authorities have also been clamping down online, blocking many LGBT sites or getting LGBT apps removed by host companies, including dating apps.

Until now, homosexuality has not been regulated by law in Indonesia, except in the ultra-conservative Aceh province where Islamic law bans same-sex relations.

But as lawmakers look to shore up conservative votes ahead of elections, parliament appears on the verge of revising the national criminal code to impose restrictions on same-sex relations and consensual sex between men and women outside marriage.

PRISON SENTENCES

Various drafts of the criminal code have appeared. The latest, though not necessarily the final one, seeks the prosecution of same-sex relations if an act is carried out in public, if there is evidence of abuse, or if a minor is involved.

Unmarried co-habiting couples or those engaging in extramarital sex could be prosecuted only if there is a complaint from a close relative.

Adultery is already a crime in Indonesia.

Under the proposals, those found guilty of a public act of gay sex could be sentenced to up to 18 months in prison, and up to nine years if there is evidence of abuse or video of the act is published. Heterosexual couples found living together without being married could face up to six months in prison, and two years if engaging in sex outside marriage.

Rights activists say the proposed rules could breach basic rights like privacy and could be subject to interpretation by vigilantes, the police and courts so that a party in someone’s home could be deemed a public event.

“The police are not doing anything to protect us. In fact, they stand by and let things happen, almost as if they have a deal with the conservatives and vigilantes,” Fahd told Reuters by phone from Ottawa. “If they enact this new law, this kind of vigilantism will be out of control.”

Fahd says he has been granted temporary residency in Canada and has a final immigration hearing in May.

Cases before Canada’s Refugee Protection Division, where all refugee claims in the country are initially adjudicated, are private, said Immigration and Refugee Board spokeswoman Anna Pape.

RELOCATE TO THAILAND?

Concord Consulting, a Jakarta-based risk consultancy, said in a recent report that Indonesia has much to lose from allowing homophobic attitudes to take hold of society, including potentially foreign investment, donor assistance, and vital tourism earnings.

Travel websites aimed at LGBT holidaymakers indicate the gay scene remains vibrant on the resort island of Bali, the cornerstone of Indonesia’s tourism industry. But some in the industry fear the new rules could deter gay travellers.

“It will probably force them to go to places like Thailand instead of coming to Bali,” said the owner of a Bali guesthouse that caters to LGBT tourists. The foreign owner, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said he would try to relocate his business to Thailand.

Thailand, a predominantly Buddhist country, is home to a liberal LGBT scene and has launched marketing campaigns aimed at attracting gay tourists. The Tourism Authority of Thailand has a gothaibefree.com website aimed at LGBT travellers. It says the Thai people are tolerant and respectful of the LGBT community and also offers discounts for hotels and spas.

In Indonesia that is far from the approach. A parliamentary commission drawing up changes to the Dutch colonial-era criminal code has been consulting with the public and taking the opinions of religious scholars, legal experts, and rights groups.

Its deliberations come against a backdrop of rising anti-LGBT rhetoric, including from senior officials, and a string of vigilante and police raids on places where gay people have gathered.

“MENTAL ILLNESS”

A recent survey found that nearly 90 percent of Indonesians who understand the term ‘LGBT’ feel threatened by the community, while the Indonesian Psychiatric Association and the Health Ministry state in internal documents seen by Reuters that being LGBT is a mental illness.

Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu has branded homosexuality a national security threat on the basis that it “is a kind of modern warfare that undermines the country’s sovereignty”.

Last month, 12 transgender women in Aceh were detained by police and forced to cut their hair and dress in ‘masculine’ clothes, sparking outrage from rights groups.

Most political parties support the changes being proposed, particularly those that outlaw gay sex.

“If someone dares to disagree, does that person want to risk not being elected again?” said Arsul Sani, a lawmaker from the United Development Party, an Islamic party, who has been involved in drafting revisions to the law.

Most Indonesians adhere to a moderate form of Islam under an officially secular system, but there has been a rise of hardline, politicized Islam in recent years, and it has moved from the fringe to the centre of politics.

Islamist groups led mass rallies last year to unseat the then governor of Jakarta, a Christian. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama had said political rivals were deceiving people by using a verse in the Koran to say Muslims should not be led by a non-Muslim. He apologised for the comments, but was later jailed for two years for blasphemy.

Critics say the creeping Islamisation of politics is fostering moral conservatism as Indonesia heads into crucial provincial polls in June and a presidential election in 2019.

“The hateful rhetoric against (the LGBT) community that is being cultivated seemingly for cynical political purposes will only deepen their suffering and create unnecessary divisions,” U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra‘ad Al Hussein said when visiting Indonesia this week. He said he raised the issue with President Joko Widodo.

SOME DISSENTING VOICES

There are some dissenting voices as the legislative revisions are nudged forward, among them parliament deputy speaker Fahri Hamzah, who has been lobbying lawmakers and the government to apply the brakes.

“I‘m warning them on the dangers of criminalisation of our privacy too much. It endangers our future, our freedom and also our economy,” he told Reuters.

“You don’t regulate the bedroom of the people.”

He accused Widodo of being “weak on the issue” and, instead of speaking up, relying on the lobbying of liberal media and non-governmental organisations.

Top officials, including the president, have said that while LGBT people should not face discrimination, Indonesia’s cultural and religious norms do not accept the LGBT movement.

A presidential spokesman declined to comment, but a government representative involved in the deliberations said efforts were underway to protect privacy.

“The state cannot enter the private realm. It can only get involved if what people do disturbs public order,” said Enny Nurbaningsih of the law and human rights ministry.

Fahd, who is originally from East Java, says he has lost faith in the protection promised to the nation’s people in the Indonesian constitution. “I want the Indonesian government to see that we have our voice. It’s like I‘m saying to them, ‘I don’t need you: there are other countries that accept me for who I am.’”The show’s iconic theme song recently got a touching, albeit cheeky, redux courtesy of drag queen Alexis Michelle. The “RuPaul’s Drag Race” veteran, whose real name is Alex Michaels, performed the song last year as part of the cabaret act, “It Takes A Woman... An Evening With Alexis Michelle,” as seen in the above video.

If you think you know all the words, think again: “Thank You for Being a Friend,” which was originally written and performed by Andrew Gold in 1978, has an unusually morbid bridge that was omitted when the tune was adapted for “The Golden Girls” in 1985.

Since coming in fifth place on the ninth season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” last year, Michelle has become a fixture on the Manhattan cabaret circuit. She’ll return to the concert stage Feb. 21 for “Alexis, I Am!,” performing songs that Madonna, Lady Gaga and Dolly Parton, among others, made famous. (Spoiler alert: “Thank You for Being a Friend” will be on the set list, too.)

“The best I can do – as a gay man, a queer performer and a drag queen – is live my life honestly, openly and authentically, and let that authenticity be reflected in my performances,” Michelle told HuffPost in May 2017. “I really do believe that if we all live authentically, that behavior in and of itself has the power to change the world.”

No doubt these ladies would agree with that sentiment.

AdvertisementJimmy Kimmel broke down last week’s headline-making ruling allowing a California bakery to refuse to make cakes for same-sex weddings as only Jimmy Kimmel can.

On Friday’s installment of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” he played waiter to a group of four customers in a cheeky “Food For Thought” skit. As the patrons attempt to place their orders, however, the host cited personal characteristics as a reason they wouldn’t be allowed to consume their dish of choice.

One customer is denied one of the restaurant’s “signature salads” because she’s a lesbian. Similarly, a Jewish customer isn’t allowed to order the lasagna, while the steak is off the menu, too, because the chef is Hindu.

Kimmel’s skit was a nod to a controversial case involving Tastries Bakery of Bakersfield, California. Kern County Superior Court Judge David Lampe issued a ruling in the case last Monday in favor of bakery owner Cathy Miller.

Mireya and Eileen Rodriguez-Del Rio spoke out against the bakery in August 2017, claiming that Miller had turned them away when she found out they were seeking a wedding cake. Miller confirmed the couple’s claims and pointed to her Christian faith, which “will not allow me to participate in things that I feel are wrong.”

California’s Department of Fair Housing had been seeking an injunction that would either require Miller to prepare wedding cakes for same-sex couples or force her to stop selling them entirely. It’s this request that Lampe denied, and his decision hinged on the fact that the cake had not yet been baked. It would have been a discriminatory act, he said in his ruling, if Miller had refused to sell a finished cake to the couple.

AdvertisementDutch fans attending the 2018 Winter Olympics took a shot at U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday.

The Netherlands’ Carlijn Achtereekte, Ireen Wust and Antoinette De Jong scored the gold, silver and bronze medals respectively in the women’s 3,000-meter speed skating event in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

And their supporters couldn’t resist trolling Trump by unfurling their nation’s flag on which “Sorry Mr. President. The Netherlands First... And 2nd... And 3rd” had been written, per Mashable.

It was a mocking reference to Trump’s “America First” policy.White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she has “no reason not to believe the women” who accused staff secretary Rob Porter of domestic violence ― but then defended President Donald Trump, who has suggested that the allegations might not be true.

Porter resigned Wednesday following allegations from his two ex-wives that he had physically abused them. The revelation has roiled the White House, raising questions about the vetting process and how long Trump’s top advisers knew about the allegations.

Conway made the remark about having no reason to doubt Porter’s accusers in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. She also appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” where she seemed to validate Trump’s Friday remarks noting that Porter “says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that.”

“The president believes, as he said the other day, you have to consider all sides,” she said. “He has said this in the past about incidents that relate to him as well.”

Conway also indicated that any furor over Trump’s comments doesn’t matter because Porter is now out of his job.

“You have to look at the result here, Rob Porter’s gone from one of the top aides to Donald Trump, our president, to no longer working” at the White House, she said. “I think the president, like the rest of us, were shocked and disturbed by the allegations.”

White House legislative affairs director Marc Short made similar arguments on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday, after host Chuck Todd showed a highlights reel of Trump suggesting many of the allegations of sexual abuse and physical assault by powerful men against women were false.

“I think the president is shaped by a lot of false accusations against him in the past,” said Short. “But in talking to the president I think he’s saddened about what happened with Rob. I think he’s very disturbed by it. And he’s very disappointed in it, and I think he believes the resignation was appropriate.”

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) arguing that congressional hearings should be held for the women who have accused Trump of assault or abuse.The comedian was a must-read social media commentator during the 2016 Summer Olympics, and she has upped her game for the cold-weather sports in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Two thousandths of a second was the difference between second and third place in Sunday’s 5,000m men’s speed skating final at the Winter Olympics.

After Farenthold’s resignation, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he expected the former lawmaker to repay the money. The House Ethics Committee also released a statement urging Farenthold to follow through on his earlier repayment promise.

On Monday, Farenthold announced that he had landed a new job at the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca, Texas, as reported by Caller Times. He is to serve as the port’s full-time legislative liaison, with responsibilities that include increasing its visibility with federal lawmakers and the Trump administration.

His annual salary is expected to be roughly $160,000.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who has been critical of Farenthold for his indiscretions, encouraged her colleagues to not meet with him as he plies his new trade.

“I would hope Republicans would stand up for what’s right and say he is not allowed in their offices until he pays up,” Speier told HuffPost in a statement.

The story has been updated with comment from Rep. Speier. Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.The Pyeongchang Olympics may have broken the record for the most condoms to ever be distributed at the Winter Games, but at least one competitor — U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon — has expressed disappointment at the “generic” contraceptive.

In an Instagram Story posted Saturday, Rippon shared some “disappointing news” with his 143,000 followers about what he referred to as the “condom drama.”

“Like, I’m not entirely sure what I was expecting. I thought maybe they’d have like Olympic rings on them or they’d be all different colors, but, no. It’s all a myth,” Rippon said, his tone deadpan.

“And I’m not, like, upset,” the 28-year-old continued, pausing for effect. “I’m disappointed.”

Rippon stressed, however, that he was taking the matter in stride.

“It’s alright. Life isn’t always what it seems and sometimes the condoms are just generic,” he said. “And sometimes they’re not only just generic, sometimes they’re only available at the polyclinic outside the gym. And that’s okay.”

Earlier this month, news emerged that some 110,000 condoms would be distributed at the Pyeongchang Games — the most of any Winter Olympics in history. If divvied up between the 2,925 athletes competing at the games, that works out to about 37 condoms for each one.

According to Korea Biomedical Review, South Korean condom maker Convenience donated 100,000 of the condoms, worth more than $93,000, and the Korean Association for AIDS Prevention donated an additional 10,000.U.S. siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani were the picture of togetherness during their routine on Sunday.

But get along they did. In their first competitive appearance at Pyeongchang, South Korea, the “Shib Sibs” helped Team USA to the bronze medal position in the team event behind Russia and the leader, Canada.

Given their performance Sunday (Pyeongchang local time) in the team event, the Shibutanis looked primed to improve on their ninth-place ice-dance finish at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

“We felt that the skate was actually really good,” Maia Shibutani said of their routine Sunday, according to U.S. Figure Skating. “We’ve been training so hard, and to be out on Olympic ice for the first time, we are really happy with it.”

Alex and Maia, 26 and 23 respectively, have been an ice pair since 2004. Maybe their time has come.

Jocelyn Morffi returned to work at Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic School in Miami on Wednesday after marrying her wife, Natasha Hass, in the Florida Keys. The following day, she was terminated after refusing to resign, the Miami Herald reported.

“This weekend I married the love of my life and unfortunately I was terminated from my job as a result,” Morffi, who had taught at the school for more than six years, wrote Friday in a Facebook post cited by CBS Miami. “In their eyes I’m not the right kind of Catholic for my choice in partner.”

Principal Carlota Morales called Morffi’s dismissal a “difficult” yet “necessary” decision in a letter sent home to parents of Sts. Peter and Paul students. Morales added that “throughout the next days and weeks your child’s daily school routine will not be disrupted as Ms. Morffi’s replacement will be selected very soon.”

The letter didn’t mention anything about Morffi’s sexuality, nor did it provide a reason for her termination.

A group of about 20 parents showed up at the school Friday demanding an explanation.

“We send our kids here because we want them to learn messages of love,” parent Rochelle Martin told CBS Miami. “I truly believe that Jesus’s message is about love, compassion and acceptance, and this is the opposite and that’s very upsetting.”

Another mom, Samantha Mills, said several teachers who attended Hass and Morffi’s wedding were concerned about retaliation. “There’s a fear to speak out about what has happened,” she said. “There was a warning provided to those teachers.”

A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami told the Sun Herald that Morffi was fired for violating her contract, without specifying exactly what provision the teacher breached.Yura Min and Alexander Gamelin of South Korea compete at the Winter Olympics on Feb. 11, 2018. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters

South Korean skater Yura Min’s Olympic debut on Sunday was marred by a performer’s nightmare: A wardrobe malfunction that occurred seconds into her short dance figure skating routine that threatened to reveal just a little too much to the watching world.

But instead of stopping the show in a panic, Min gamely continued her performance with partner Alexander Gamelin, improvising as she went so as to prevent her top from slipping off her shoulders.

Min, who was competing in the figure skating team event, was lauded by viewers for performing — and recovering from the wardrobe near-disaster— “with class.”

Min, a dual citizen of South Korea and the United States, told the Detroit Free Press that the hook on her top “came undone” seconds into the routine.

“I was like, ‘Oh no!’” she told the paper. “If that comes undone, the whole [outfit] could just pop off. I was terrified the entire program.”

Min was determined not to stop in the midst of the performance, however, and instead changed her movements so her arms would be kept back, preventing her costume from falling off.

She only paused once, during the twizzles (synchronized side-by-side spins), when her top began slipping off her shoulder. “It started to come down so I had to stop my twizzle and pull it back up,” she told the AP.

Min managed to finish the routine with her outfit still in place. She and Gamelin, who will compete together again at the individual ice dance competition later this month, received 51.97 points for their performance and finished ninth out of 10 teams.

And that apparently includes the first lady.

It’s highly likely the next recession will occur in the coming three years, while President Donald Trump is still in office. Maybe it’ll happen as a result of his inflation-baiting tax bill. Maybe it’ll have something to do with excessive consumer debt. We don’t know what the cause will be, but we do have some idea of how Americans will experience the next sustained economic slump. Since the Great Recession, during which the GOP repeatedly if grudgingly went along with former President Barack Obama to extend unemployment insurance, Republicans on both the state and federal level have pushed to make benefits less generous and harder to get.

Meanwhile, the holes they’ve created in the safety net will be filled by so-called “alternative work arrangements” — gigs — which offer fewer protections for workers than full-time jobs.

By design, America is ill-prepared for its next recession, and it’s going to suck.

It’s the U.S. government that measures economic growth and the unemployment rate, but it’s actually up to a private nonprofit organization called the National Bureau of Economic Research to tell us when a recession has begun. Since the 1920s, this organization has had a committee of eggheads looking at a variety of indicators, especially personal income levels, unemployment rates and the gross domestic product, to determine when a recession has started.

A recession starts after economic activity has reached its peak. Right when things are better than ever is when they’re about to get worse. The decline in business conditions has to affect the whole economy; it can’t just be a single-sector slump, like the one Amazon has wrought among retailers. But you won’t know the recession has started until later, because the NBER waits until the government has finished its data revisions, which happens over a period of months. It wasn’t until 2008 that the organization announced that the last recession had begun in 2007.

There have been 11 recessions since World War II. The current economic expansion began in mid-2009, making it the third longest in history, and it can’t last forever.

Expansions don’t just die of old age. One thing that can trigger recessions is the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to quell inflation. The Federal Reserve is currently in the process of raising rates, but inflation is still low and most economists see no cause for concern in the immediate future ― though economists are not exactly great at predicting what will happen.

“When wage and price pressures develop, that’s when the clock starts to tick,” said Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody’s Analytics, a financial analysis provider.

Upward pressure on wages has begun to develop. The official unemployment rate is still falling, and it has been at or below 5 percent for about two years ― a level that has traditionally triggered inflation fears. But economists can point to a range of other measures, such as reduced labor force participation, that suggests the labor market is still out of whack. With interest rates already very low, the Fed has wanted to bring them up partly to ward off phantom inflation and partly just so it can lower them again when the next recession comes around. Because it will.

One possible table-setter for a recession, Zandi said, is a huge tax cut that increases the size of the federal budget deficit — something very much like the contents of the Republican tax bill that Trump signed in December. In such a scenario all the extra money in taxpayer’s hands could cause the economy to overheat, leading the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates faster in an effort to stave off inflation.

“If the tax cuts are deficit financed, that is going to juice the economy and it will overheat, significantly raising the odds of a recession early in the next decade,” Zandi said.

Most economists are less confident the tax cuts will juice the economy quite so much, but they generally do anticipate an aggressive Fed response. “Interest rates are projected to rise in the short term because the legislation would boost aggregate demand and output, leading the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to avoid a surge in inflation,” the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said in its December 2017 analysis of the economic effects of the new law.

Outgoing Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, for her part, kept the Fed’s plans cryptic in the wake of the tax bill. “I think my colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years,” she said.

While federal and state governments run an array of programs that respond to economic need, nothing is more important when mass layoffs roll around than unemployment insurance, which is not handed out to just anyone. Only people who are laid off through no fault of their own, and who have well-established work histories over the previous year, are eligible. Benefits are designed to replace about 46 percent of the person’s lost wages.

The average unemployment benefit ranged from $330 to $350 per week since 2016, according to The Department of Labor, making it more valuable than other programs responding to economic need. Food stamps, for instance, might provide that much money over the course of a month. The generosity of the benefit serves two purposes: one is to protect layoff victims themselves, and the other is to prevent a broader deflationary spiral caused by desperate people accepting terrible wages at jobs for which they’re not really suited.

After the Great Recession got underway, while hundreds of thousands of people were losing their jobs each month, Congress started increasing the duration of unemployment insurance for people who’d used up the standard 26 weeks of benefits that states provide. Republican foot-dragging over the cost of the benefits led to a huge fight in 2010, with former Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) infamously responding to Democratic pleas by saying “tough shit” on the Senate floor.

Since then, Congress has quietly allowed those benefits to expire while statehouse Republicans ― aghast that Barack Obama gave their constituents up to 99 weeks of combined state and federal unemployment insurance ― have hacked away at their own unemployment programs. Nine states reduced benefit duration from the usual 26 weeks, and many others have apparently gotten more aggressive in checking up on claimants to make sure they’re continuing to look for work, which has always been an eligibility requirement.

As a result, the rate at which unemployed Americans receive layoff compensation overall has fallen from about 36 percent in 2007 to about 28 percent in 2017, according to data from The Department of Labor. Wayne Vroman, an associate with the Urban Institute, said a big reason for the decline is that states are finding ways to kick unemployed people off benefits after they’ve already been deemed eligible. His research shows a big increase in “nonseparation determinations.” These are instances of states investigating whether someone is continuing to meet eligibility requirements by doing things like writing down the names and addresses of businesses where they’ve applied for work on forms to state work agencies.

“When agencies have undertaken nonseparation determinations in recent years, the outcome has become much more likely to be a denial than in 1989 or 1999,” Vroman wrote in a paper that will be published this year. For instance, denial rates for determinations examining a person’s availability for work ― their willingness to take a job ― which is a requirement of benefit receipt, were 64 percent in 1989 and 83 percent in 2016.

Unemployment compensation is a state-federal program financed by payroll taxes on employers. When a lot of people lose their jobs and state unemployment trust funds run dry, states have to borrow money and sometimes increase payroll taxes ― something that makes Republican lawmakers enthusiastic about trimming benefits. (Most extra weeks of federal benefits are fully funded by the federal government and created by Congress on an ad-hoc basis.)

States are still smarting from the Great Recession. At the beginning of last year, only 21 state trust funds had achieved what the Labor Department considers a minimum level of solvency. If they can’t catch up before layoffs hit, there will be political pressure to follow the new path that other states have taken to reduce benefits. Lawmakers in Kentucky, which has a poor solvency rating, are currently considering proposals to make the state’s unemployment system more like Florida’s, currently one of the worst.

It’s an old pattern. After the recession of the early 1980s, changes in state benefits helped reduce the proportion of unemployed workers receiving compensation from 50 percent in 1980 to 37 percent in 1990, according to political scientist Paul Pierson’s 1994 book Dismantling the Welfare State?

Josh Bivens, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said the country isn’t well prepared for the next recession.

“We have managed to make UI incredibly non-protective,” Bivens said. “If we want the UI system to not be a complete joke in the next recession, it’s going to depend on Congress and the president.”

But Congress and the president might be more interested in urine tests than UI. Since about 2011, Republicans at the state and federal level have been trying to make drug tests a requirement for welfare, food stamps and unemployment insurance. In 2012, Congress passed a law giving states the right to drug test some unemployment claimants, but the measure let the Obama Labor Department decide who would be subjected to the test, resulting in a narrowly written regulation that Republicans said wouldn’t catch anybody.

Republicans scrapped the regulation last year, and the Trump administration has said it will release a new one sometime soon. Wisconsin, Texas and Mississippi have already passed drug test laws and are just waiting for a green light from the Labor Department.

How will a new recession play out under this new unemployment benefits regime? The recent hurricanes offer a preview. Storms that battered Texas and Florida threw tens of thousands of people out of work. Storm victims are supposed to be eligible for unemployment benefits and can file through the regular process.

In Florida, it’s not an easy process. The state overhauled its unemployment system in 2011, requiring layoff victims to file claims online and even (for a time) take a math and reading test. Since 2007, before the last recession started, the percentage of unemployed Floridians who receive compensation plunged from 32 percent to 9 percent, almost the lowest rate of coverage in the nation.

Anthony Di Biagio is the co-owner of a residential and commercial cleaning service in Cape Coral, Florida. In the aftermath of Hurricane Irma he was unable to work because some of his clients’ homes and businesses were inaccessible. As a business owner, Di Biagio was ineligible for regular unemployment compensation, but perfectly eligible for the special disaster assistance provided through the state unemployment system.

After spending 40 minutes initiating his application online, Di Biagio learned it would take some real vigilance to actually receive the benefits. He’d have to request payments every two weeks and register with an online service called “Employ Florida Marketplace” as though he were looking for a job ― which, as a business owner, he was not.

“Unfortunately, this is counterproductive for me because I know that my unemployment is temporary and I’ll most likely only need benefits for 1-2 months,” he said in a Facebook message. “Even if I found a job with EFM, I couldn’t commit to it because I already own a company which plans to be fully operational as soon as possible.”

The problems stem partly from the state’s apparent desire to discourage people from obtaining benefits and partly from plain old private sector incompetence. Florida hired Deloitte Consulting to overhaul the website and complained loudly about the contractor’s work, which in 2013 and 2014 the state blamed for claimants being unable to receive benefits in timely fashion. Handling claims through an automated system is supposed to save money on staff, but two other states that hired the firm to overhaul electronic benefits delivery have also encountered massive benefits delays and other problems.

(A Deloitte Consulting spokesman said unemployment systems in all three states have been fully functional since 2014. “Unemployed workers in all of the states in which we have worked are receiving the unemployment benefits for which they’re eligible, in a timely fashion and in accordance with state and federal laws,” he said.)

“The states that run these really threadbare programs, it’s not the economic stabilizer you would want for a family facing job loss for their main wage earner,” George Wentworth, a senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project, said in an interview. “It’s the most important program for the average American who loses their job. That’s why there are standards [in federal law] saying as soon as you’re eligible you should be getting payment within three weeks of filing that claim.”

The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity declined to comment.

One thing that could actually make the next recession less miserable than its predecessor is “work sharing.” Thirty states currently offer work-sharing or “short-time compensation” programs that allow companies to reduce a group of employees’ hours instead of doing layoffs. The state then uses its unemployment insurance trust fund to compensate the workers for the missing hours.

Congress doled out $100 million for states to set up work-sharing programs in 2012, and several states designed new programs as a result. A Labor Department-commissioned study released in 2016 found that of the more than 2,000 businesses that enrolled in a state work-sharing program from 2008 through 2013, most had a favorable experience and more than 80 percent said they would sign up again.

It’s such a good idea that of course nobody has heard of it.

Economists who are familiar with work sharing say it’s ridiculous how unfamiliar the concept is to most people considering its bipartisan backing. One flaw of the policy is that it’s entirely up to employers to sign up for the state-sponsored programs, even though its workers whose livelihoods are at stake.

“It would be neat if employees could initiate this as well,” economist Lonnie Golden of Penn State Abington said. “The information is just not out there.”

Another distinguishing feature of the next recession will be the prevalence of fake jobs with no benefits. Since 2005, the percentage of the workforce toiling in “alternative work arrangements,” such as freelance or subcontractor gigs, has risen from 10 to almost 16 percent, according to 2016 research by Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger, economists at Harvard and Princeton, respectively. Less than 1 percent of jobs are for online platforms like Uber or TaskRabbit; alternative work arrangements are more commonly along the lines of those Amazon warehouse jobs where you don’t actually work for Amazon.

This kind of work accounted for all of the net employment growth from 2010 to 2015 and has spread throughout occupations. The advantage is that these jobs are easier to get. The disadvantages are that they’re less likely to come with benefits; they’re less secure; and the schedules are more erratic.

And people working in such jobs may be ineligible for unemployment, since if they’re not actual employees of the firm they work for their state won’t have W2 forms on file reflecting their earnings. For people who don’t have benefits, the “flexibility” of contract work may be their only lifeline.

Katz and Krueger found in a follow-up paper that people who’d suffered unemployment were significantly more likely to find themselves in an alternative work arrangement after the Great Recession ― something that will happen even more next time the economy tanks.

“We would certainly expect a jump in people, as they lose out on possibilities of more traditional jobs, moving into alternative work,” Katz said.

“I haven’t believed a word they told me in years.” - Donald Witkowski, former paper mill worker

Then there’s the Trump factor. When the mass layoffs return and the unemployment rate rises the newly jobless will discover that not only have they lost their livelihoods, but they have also become fake news.

The president of the United States will deny that the bad jobs numbers are real. Just as candidate Trump insisted the official unemployment rate was 10 times higher than the Obama administration said, President Trump won’t hesitate to cast doubt on his own government’s rate when it starts rising.

Who cares? Well, the tens of millions of Americans who will churn through the unemployment system are going to care. One of the worst things about being unemployed, aside from the fact that you have no money, is that you lose a routine that essentially connects you to society through daily interactions with other people. And since American culture closely links your value as a human to your career, it can be difficult to maintain self respect ― which helps explain the link between joblessness and suicide. Massive numbers of alienated and vulnerable people already living a surreal existence will be explicitly told they’re not even real.

Ask anyone who suffered more than a brief spell of joblessness in the wake of the Great Recession, which officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, how it felt to keep hearing that the economy was improving. Ask Donald Witkowski.

“I haven’t believed a word they told me in years,” Witkowski told HuffPost. And that’s how he felt even though the president at the time took pains to say that, despite economic progress, many people had been left behind ― a kind of nuance Trump doesn’t do.

Witkowski, 59, lost his job in 2011 when the paper mill in Whiting, Wisconsin, closed down. He’d worked there for decades. Now, still unemployed and receiving disability benefits, he’s alienated from his government even after having gotten nearly a year of unemployment insurance thanks to a series of federal extensions. Whatever goes wrong with the next recession, he said, will be worse than whatever the statistics say. He has a prediction for the next downturn, and it’s based less on economics than on his experience of the last one.

“It won’t be a recession,” he said. “I think it will be a total collapse.”Kim Cattrall has no interest in accepting condolences from Sarah Jessica Parker.

“I don’t need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker,” reads a scathing Saturday Instagram post from Cattrall.

Parker earlier in the week commented on Cattrall’s Sunday announcement that her brother, 55-year-old Chris Cattrall, had been found dead in Canada.

“Dearest Kim, my love and condolences to you and yours and Godspeed to your beloved brother. Xx,” Parker wrote.

But Cattrall made it clear she had no time for any kind words from her former “Sex and the City” costar.

“Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now,” Cattrall wrote. “Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I’m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona.”

A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 10, 2018 at 5:20am PST

Cattrall linked to an October article in the New York Post, headlined “Inside the mean-girls culture that destroyed ’Sex and the City.” The article came out after Cattrall, who played Samantha on the “Sex and the City” TV series and in the first two movies, declared she had no interest in reprising her role for a third film.

Representatives for Parker didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Cattrall’s Instagram post. But Parker has said previously that she found Cattrall’s comments “upsetting.”

“That’s not the way I recall our experience,” she told Andy Cohen earlier this month.Eric Trump has set the internet alight with what appears to be a new business.

On Friday, President Donald Trump’s second son shared a snap of what looked to be the front cover of a new “Trump” magazine to Twitter:

He captioned the photograph, which features an image of Trump International Hotel in Washington, with the hashtag #HotOffThePress.

Trump offered no more information on the publication, which promotes Trump properties on the cover. It’s not clear when it will be available, how often it will be published, how many pages it contains or whether it will be sold on newsstands.

But Time noted it could be the latest attempt by the Trump family to enter the magazine industry. Its last title, “Trump Magazine,” was reportedly closed in 2009 following the global financial crisis, per the New York Post.

Unsurprisingly, people on Twitter had plenty to say about Eric Trump’s new endeavor:

Looks like the building is giving everyone the finger. Who thought this design was a good idea? — Wayne Lee Harrison (@WayneHarrison) February 9, 2018The Cannes Film Festival audience did the right thing at the premiere of Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” Monday, showering the director with a 10-minute ovation, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The adoration didn’t end there.

The crowd applauded several times during the screening, and erupted for four minutes as the credits rolled. Guests stood and clapped for an additional six minutes, the show business publication wrote.

Lee, whose “Do The Right Thing” lost the Palme d’Or top Cannes prize to Steven Soderbergh’s “sex lies and videotape” in 1989, may fare better this year, given the reception and early reviews.

Variety called the film a “major comeback for Lee” and “a welcome throwback to the days when Lee’s movies struck a nerve in the cultural conversation.” Time said it deserved to win an Oscar.

The film revolves around the true story of Ron Stallworth (John David Washington, Denzel’s son), a black Colorado Springs cop who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the ’70s. Adam Driver, Topher Grace and Laura Harrier also star in the film, slated for an August release in the U.S.

A montage about last summer’s racial clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, ends the movie, providing a bookend to a Cannes day in which race ― and Lee ― dominated the conversation.

Lee included a dedication in the film to Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville by a man driving his car into people protesting white nationalism.

President Donald Trump infamously summed up the Charlottesville violence by saying there were “very fine people on both sides.”

Lee used that as a jumping-off point in a fiery condemnation of Trump at an earlier press conference.

“That motherfucker was given the chance to say we are about love, not hate,” Lee said in the clip below. “And that motherfucker did not denounce the motherfucking Klan, the alt-right, and those Nazis motherfuckers. It was a defining moment, and he could have said to the world ‘not the United States,’ that we were better than that.”SEOUL/PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang “at an early date”, South Korean officials said on Saturday, potentially setting up the first meeting of Korean leaders in more than 10 years.

Any meeting would represent a diplomatic coup for Moon, who swept to power last year on a policy of engaging more with the reclusive North.

The recent detente, anchored by South Korea’s hosting of the Winter Olympic Games, came despite an acceleration in the North’s weapons programme last year and pressure from Seoul’s allies in Washington.

The invitation came during talks and a lunch Moon hosted with Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of the North Korean leader, at the presidential Blue House in Seoul.

Kim Jong Un wanted to meet Moon “at an early date”, a spokesman for the Blue House said. Moon had said “let’s create conditions to make it happen”, the official said, an indication that Moon was likely to accept the invitation.

Kim Yo Jong arrived in South Korea on Friday with Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in the alpine resort town of Pyeongchang. They shook hands with Moon and cheered for athletes from the two countries who marched under a unified peninsula flag for the first time in a decade.

Some North Korean experts believe tough U.N. sanctions that are cutting off most of the isolated North’s sources of revenue have added pressure on Pyongyang to engage further with Seoul.

“I think this overture towards South Korea is partly sanctions-related, and also related to the fact that it’s clear a divergence has developed between Washington and Seoul’s most keenly desired goals in the near term,” said Andray Abrahamian, a research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS in Hawaii.

“The North Koreans should understand that for a summit or any kind of serious talks to occur, Moon needs to be able to take something to Washington - something that addresses denuclearisation,” he said before the North’s invitation to Moon was announced.

EXTREME PRESSURE

Moon’s desire to engage North Korea was in contrast to his U.S. ally. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence also attended the Games opening ceremony but had no contact with the North Korean delegation.

North and South Korea are technically still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. The United States fought with South Korea and maintains tens of thousands of troops and an “ironclad” agreement to protect its ally.

North Korea has spent years developing its military, saying it needs to protect itself from U.S. aggression.

Pyongyang conducted its largest nuclear test last year and said it had developed a missile capable of carrying a warhead to the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump and the North Korean leadership traded insults as tensions rose.

Pence said the United States and South Korea were closely aligned in their approach to dealing with North Korea.

“I am very confident, as President Trump is, that President Moon will continue to stand strongly with us in our extreme-pressure campaign,” Pence told NBC in an interview, maintaining all options were open to deal with the crisis.

“Make no mistake about it, the United States of America has viable military options to deal with a nuclear threat from North Korea but, that being said, we hope for a better path,” he said.

SACRED BLOODLINE

The two Koreas have a rocky and sometimes violent history at the Blue House. In January 1968, Kim Yo Jong’s grandfather, founding North Korean president Kim Il Sung, sent a squad of North Korean commandos to Seoul who tried unsuccessfully to kill then-president Park Chung-hee.

Kim Yo Jong, 28, is the first member of the ruling Kim family bearing the bloodline of the sacred Mount Paektu, a centrepiece of the North’s idolisation and propaganda campaign, to cross the border into the South since the 1950-53 Korean War.

The delegations shared a lunch of dried pollack dumpling soup, a regional speciality of the only divided province on the Korean peninsula, and soju, a spirit popular on both sides of the heavily militarised border.

Moon and Kim Yong Nam planned to return to the Games venue to watch the joint Korean women’s ice hockey team - the first ever combined team at the Olympics - take on Switzerland, the Blue House said.
