Former President George W. Bush is reportedly pleased by at least one element of the Donald Trump presidency: It’s making him look better.

While Bush doesn’t often address Trump or his policies directly, he does have a zinger he likes to deliver when the issue comes up. Tom DeFrank, a contributing editor for The National Journal, reported:

“Without chiming in with the Trump critics, Bush is often heard to remark, unable to stifle his trademark smirk: ‘Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?’”

The relationship between Trump and the Bush family hasn’t been a warm one. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was widely considered the frontrunner for the 2016 GOP nomination until he was steamrolled by Trump, who famously dismissed him as “low energy.”

Over the weekend, Trump reportedly called George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 “the single worst decision ever made.” However, last week he also endorsed George P. Bush ― one of Jeb’s three children ― for re-election as Texas land commissioner.

AdvertisementThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has quietly begun allowing more trophy hunting of African elephants, despite President Donald Trump’s pledge last year to uphold a ban on importing parts of animals killed by big-game hunters.

The agency issued a formal memo Thursday saying it would consider issuing permits to import elephant trophies from African nations on a “case-by-case” basis, effective immediately. The new guidelines, first reported by E&E News and later by The Hill, end U.S. bans on the import of such trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.

The decision comes nearly four months after Trump stepped in to halt his own administration’s decision to begin allowing hunters to import elephants killed in the two African countries. The president called such trophy hunting a “horror show.” He drew rare accolades from environmentalists at the time, who said they were surprised that Trump would move to uphold environmental protections.

“What the agency just did with this memo is completely contrary to everything Trump has been saying,” Tanya Sanerib, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an interview.

Environmental advocates say it’s unclear if the new move will result in additional elephant trophy imports, but the guidelines give more leeway to hunters to apply for permits. The Fish and Wildlife Service has already updated its webpages on the import of sport hunted trophies for both elephants and lions.

In November, the agency reversed an Obama-era ban on the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, determining that sport hunting in those countries would “enhance the survival of the species in the wild,” a spokesperson said at the time.

The decision was first revealed publicly by Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group with close ties to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The group, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban on elephant trophies from Zimbabwe. Late last year, a federal appeals court ruled that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedures when it instituted the ban. Among other things, it failed to invite public comment, the court said.

The Trump administration based its decision allowing case-by-case permits on the court’s opinion, writing in the memo that so-called enhancement findings are “no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies.”

Some wildlife experts said the memo complicates the administration’s stance on conservation at the expense of animals desperately needing protection. The memo also withdrew findings related to the Endangered Species Act for trophies taken from bontebok, a species of antelope, elephants and lions hunted in several other countries.

“Our biggest concern is there’s been too much back and forth by the U.S. government to the point of really confusing the public,” Jimmiel Mandima, the director of program design at the African Wildlife Foundation, said. “Why does the decision keep flopping, are we hunting or are we not hunting?”

Mandima, who noted that his group has long opposed the hunting of threatened, vulnerable or endangered species, said such confusion makes it difficult for the public to voice opinions about the issue, and harder for environmental groups to craft conservation recommendations.

Several environmentalists on Monday pointed out that the new import guidelines haven’t been made public, and Freedom of Information Act requests to determine what “case-by-case” actually means will likely take months. In that time, an unknown number of applications could be approved.

“We saw the public outcry last fall when [the trophy decision] was announced … not just from people who are traditionally Democrats,” Sanerib said. “The agency is really playing hide the ball. It’s incredibly disappointing.”

It’s unclear if Trump supports the new Fish and Wildlife Service guidelines. The White House did not immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

A Fish and Wildlife spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Trump “has been very clear in the direction that his administration will go.”

“Unfortunately, since aspects of the import permitting program for trophies are the focus of ongoing litigation, the Department is unable to comment about specific next steps at this time,” the spokesperson added.London Mayor Sadiq Khan will be joined on stage by HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen for an interview and Q&A session following his keynote at SXSW 2018 on Monday, March 12 at 2pm CT/8pm GMT.

WASHINGTON ― Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) signed new gun safety legislation into law on Monday, making the state the first to tighten its firearm regulations since last month’s mass shooting at a high school in Florida.

The bill expands an existing law to prevent intimate partners who have a domestic violence or stalking conviction from buying and keeping guns. Until now, the state’s law only applied to married partners, and the new measure closes what was termed the “boyfriend loophole.”

“I’m proud to sign this bill, making Oregon the first state to take action to prevent senseless gun violence since the tragedy in Parkland, Florida,” Brown said in a statement. “Today marks an important milestone, but we know we have more to do. It’s long past time we hold the White House and Congress accountable. Now’s the time to enact real change and federal gun safety legislation.”

The bill was introduced in January, but the governor called it “historic” because state legislators decided to advance the measure in response to the Parkland shooting.

Major gun retailers including Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods changed their policies on selling guns because of the Florida shooting. But besides Oregon, no states ― or Congress ― have passed any new laws aimed at reining in gun violence.

To the contrary, Florida state legislators voted Saturday to keep AR-15s legal. These military-style rifles have been used in a number of mass shootings around the country ― including in the Parkland massacre that left 17 dead.The U.S. presidential seal may be adorning a Trump golf course near you ― at least if the Trump Organization has its way, according to a new report.

The Trump Organization appears to have ordered replica presidential seals to mark its golf courses, an act that may be a federal crime, ProPublica reported on Monday.

President Donald Trump’s longtime business, which his older sons currently run, reportedly ordered dozens of 12-inch plates bearing the official eagle-emblazoned U.S. presidential seal, to be used as tee markers.

Similar plates bearing a family coat of arms are already in use at Trump golf courses. (The New York Times reported last year that the Trump family’s coat of arms actually belonged to another family ― though it has been modified, including by replacing the word “Integritas,” Latin for “integrity,” with the word “Trump.”)

Eagle Sign and Design, a metalworking and sign company with offices in Indiana and Kentucky, confirmed to ProPublica that it had produced the plates with the U.S. presidential seal after sharing a photo of them on Facebook.

There no longer appear to be any photos of the plates on the business’ Facebook page, but the page does show an empty photo album labeled “Presidential Seal” and captioned “Trump International Golf Course.”

“We made the design, and the client confirmed the design,” Joseph E. Bates, who owns Eagle Sign and Design, told ProPublica while declining to identify the customer.

ProPublica and WNYC reported that they had reviewed an order form that listed Trump International as the buyer.

Eagle Sign and Design and the Trump Organization did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment on Monday.

It is illegal to use the U.S. presidential seal in a way that would convey or give a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the U.S. government. It is also illegal to knowingly manufacture, reproduce, sell or purchase the presidential seal for resale.

The penalty is a fine and/or imprisonment of not more than six months.

Past presidents have used the seal on custom-made items, like golf balls, dishes and even socks. But it would be illegal for a private company to use the presidential seal, Richard Painter, vice chairman of the government accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told ProPublica.

“If we had heard of a private company using it for commercial purposes, we would have sent them a nasty letter,” said Painter, who served as an associate White House counsel during the George W. Bush administration.

Trump’s ties to his pre-White House businesses have raised a number of ethics concerns.

Last year, critics denounced a State Department blog post that promoted Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago estate and club in Palm Beach, Florida. The Trump family frequents the estate, which Trump has deemed “the winter White House,” and has held fundraising events there, drawing similar scrutiny from ethics watchdogs.

It’s estimated that the president and his family’s visits to Mar-a-Lago cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and critics see the trips as a way to drum up free advertising for Trump properties.

Trump vowed that profits from foreign government representatives’ stays at his family’s properties would be donated to the U.S. Treasury, but that’s a promise the family has yet to keep, the The Associated Press reported in January.Philanthropists Melinda and Bill Gates have pledged a massive sum toward women's empowerment worldwide.

Everything changes when women have money.

That’s the gist of what philanthropist Melinda Gates says in an op-ed published Monday in Quartz, in which she announced that she and her husband, Bill Gates, are pledging $170 million to help empower women economically around the world.

The money, from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will be spent over four years “to help women exercise their economic power,” Melinda Gates wrote. She noted that research shows economic power is the “most promising entry points for gender equality.”

“Simply put when money flows into the hands of women who have the authority to use it, everything changes,” she wrote.

Gates broke down how women’s economic empowerment is key to gender equality, saying families benefit when women control household finances.

“Research shows ... that women are much more likely than men to buy things that set their families on a pathway out of poverty, like nutritious food, health care, and education,” Gates wrote.

Additionally, Gates noted, when women have economic power, communities begin to rethink the roles women play in society.

“Women acting on their own can do what all the philanthropic organizations in the world can never accomplish: change the unwritten rule that women are lesser than men,” she wrote. “Our role, as we see it, is to make targeted investments that give women the opportunity to write new rules.”

According to the op-ed, the donation will fund a three-pronged approach to economically empowering women: First, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will support and organize female farmers so they can sell their products at competitive prices; Second, the foundation will work in eight countries, including India, Pakistan and Tanzania, to promote women using digital bank accounts; And lastly, the foundation will facilitate self-help groups allowing women and girls share information about “everything from launching a small business to raising healthy children.”Bamboo Bicycle Club

People at an east London workshop are paying to learn how to make their own bicycle. Nothing particularly unusual about that. But at this Bamboo Bicycle Club session, the bikes are being made with bamboo.

In all the excitement to proclaim bicycles the answer to congested roads, polluted city air and our own health, the materials used to manufacture those bikes often get overlooked.

Carbon fiber, for example, is increasingly popular for new bicycles, particularly racing bikes. The material, though lightweight and strong, is difficult to recycle and cannot be melted down and reused in its original form, unlike aluminum and steel.

Carbon fiber also is dangerous and dirty to work with ― constructing carbon fiber bike frames or wheels means working with toxic resins ― so it’s an unlikely material for encouraging people to build and repair their own bicycles.

It’s also incredibly wasteful. Most people replace a racing bike every three years, adding to carbon fiber scrap, says James Marr, founder of the Bamboo Bicycle Club and a former wind turbine engineer.

Motivated to cut the waste and make bike-building more popular, Marr has set up a club to teach people how to make their own bikes out of bamboo.

Far from just panda food, bamboo is a strong and popular building material in Asia, and it’s well suited to being shaped into a bicycle frame, says Marr. It can grow from seed to harvest in less than four years. Still, its sustainability relies on production standards, for example avoiding the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides, and ensuring natural forest is not cleared for plantations.

“Not many people in the bicycle industry are taking responsibility for disposing of bikes. It’s a saturated and cost-driven industry that won’t change in a hurry,” says Marr, who set up the the club five years ago.

The club’s workshop in London makes around 500 bicycles a year, with a two-day session building your own bamboo bicycle costing around £600, or about $835. The club has opened franchises in Germany and Italy, with more in Canada and South Africa opening soon.

As well as teaching people to build bikes, the club was invited by two NGOs working in Kenya last year to help teach students in Malaa near Nairobi how to repair, maintain and build bicycles. The ultimate ambition, says Marr, is to help reconnect people with bikes and the materials used to build them.

While bike-sharing companies have promised lots in terms of more sustainable transport, they haven’t yet changed wasteful consumer attitudes. Only last month, the Hong Kong bike-sharing company Gobee.bike was forced to pull the plug on its operations in France and Italy after vandalism.

“We don’t as a society make much anymore,” says Marr, who says he was shocked by photos of thousands of unwanted bicycles dumped in cities across China.

“We just click a button and it’s there for us,” Marr says. “It makes us disconnected with how difficult things are to make. As a result, we think nothing of throwing away a computer or bicycle. If people understand and appreciate something they respect it. It’s their bike, they build it. That’s important.”

For mass-market bicycle companies producing their own bikes with carbon fiber, there is an imperative to instill a circular economy ― reusing, recycling and repurposing rather than throwing away.

The standard way to recycle a material like carbon fiber is to chop it into bits and then burn off the plastic glue holding the fibers together. But this process will not create recycled material as strong as the original carbon fiber, says Dustin Benton from the non-profit Green Alliance.

With the rapid spread of carbon fiber in the bicycle, aerospace and automotive industries, Benton says bad habits among manufacturers and consumers need to shift.

In the U.S., a pioneer of carbon fiber bicycles, Trek, has partnered with the company Carbon Conversions to ensure the scrap material from Trek’s manufacturing site in Wisconsin is reused. While not as strong as the original carbon fiber material, the waste can be remolded and reused in sailing boats, laptops and sunglasses.

The catch, of course, is that this only involves leftover parts from the manufacturing process ― not the carbon fiber bikes that are either damaged or scrapped by consumers. That means the effort involves only a fraction of the total carbon fiber footprint of a bicycle company.

A better example, says Benton, is Japan, where recycling infrastructure is required by law to be co-owned by manufacturers. This encourages product designers to work out how to design products that are easier to take apart and reuse.

For consumers not minded to join a workshop and build their own bike, the advice from Benton is simple: “Keep their carbon fiber bikes in use as long as possible by replacing and repairing parts.”

The child’s name has not yet been released.

Teigen and Legend are also the parents of a 2-year-old girl named Luna Simone. In November, the couple let Luna announce that they were expecting a second child on Instagram:

it's john's! A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Nov 21, 2017 at 1:15pm PST

Months later, Teigen confirmed that she was pregnant with a baby boy, which wasn’t a surprise to fans of the couple. The two have been open about their journey with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and previously revealed that she and Legend had one viable male embryo remaining.

“I wouldn’t say we can’t conceive naturally, but I would say that it’s enough of a challenge where it felt like we needed help,” Legend told Cosmopolitan. “We’re lucky that we’re living in an age where we can conceive in other ways. [IVF] brought us Luna and hopefully it will bring us a few more awesome kids, too.”

And now she finally can.Kids around the world will soon be able to own a Barbie doll bearing the likeness of Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart or Katherine Johnson.

All three women made herstory in different industries: Earhart was the first female aviator to fly across the Atlantic Ocean; Mexican artist Kahlo was known for her unique painting style and feminist activism; and Johnson, who was highlighted in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” broke boundaries for black women in mathematics and calculated dozens of trajectories for NASA, including the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the moon.

The dolls, which are part of Mattel’s new series called “Inspiring Women,” will be mass produced and sold in stores. The toy company does not have an exact date for when they will hit shelves, but said each will come with educational information about the woman who inspired it.

“As a brand that inspires the limitless potential in girls, Barbie will be honoring its largest line up of role models timed to International Women’s Day, because we know that you can’t be what you can’t see,” Lisa McKnight, the senior vice president and general manager of Barbie, said Tuesday in a press release. “Girls have always been able to play out different roles and careers with Barbie and we are thrilled to shine a light on real life role models to remind them that they can be anything.”

Johnson, 99, worked closely with Mattel to create her doll and ensure it looked as much like her as possible.

Ahead of International Women’s Day on Thursday, Barbie’s “Shero” line is also honoring 14 modern-day role models from around the world. These dolls celebrating women who have recently broken boundaries in their fields aren’t meant to be sold, but some particularly popular ones have ended up in stores before.

The buzz at the San Diego Padres’ training camp on Monday wasn’t about the team’s hopes for the coming baseball season.

It was the bees invading the team’s Peoria, Arizona, facility and forcing the players to hit the ground.

This was “The Swarm” sequel for the Padres. Players last year had to take cover, along with their Spring Training game opponent, the Colorado Rockies, during another bee flyby.

USA Today noted that bee swarms are common in Arizona at this time of year, and many of them involve aggressive Africanized honeybees.

Her 4-year-old daughter, Abigail, was killed when they were both struck by a car in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, according to NBC 4 New York.

A white Volvo reportedly drove into a crowd of people after running a red light around 1 p.m. near the intersection of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. A 46-year-old man and another woman, Lauren Lew, were also injured. Lew’s 1-year-old son was pronounced dead at the scene.

The two children and their mothers had reportedly recently left a church event at a local community center when the accident occurred.

Miles, who is currently expecting her second child, was critically injured but in stable condition, police said.

Will and Jaden Smith’s eco-friendly water company, JUST, is vowing to donate water each month to Flint, Michigan, schools until the city’s water is drinkable again.

The company has already donated 9,200 bottles to Flint. After reading about how the city’s water crisis affected its public schools, JUST’s CEO, Ira Laufer, decided the donations were simply necessary.

“This just makes sense for us to do,” Laufer told MLive. “After reading more about [Flint’s] challenges and the mayor objecting to pulling bottled water from the schools, we thought, ‘Let’s help these kids.’”

Will and Jaden Smith founded JUST in 2015 to provide a green alternative to plastic bottles and to invest in communities. JUST’s bottles are 82 percent plant-based, and the company has initiated long-term investments in Glens Falls, New York, the city where the water is sourced.

The Flint water crisis became a national topic in 2014 after city officials began using the Flint River as the town’s main water source. The city’s pipes were dangerously corroded, and they polluted the water with dangerously high levels of lead. In one study, the Environmental Protection Agency found lead levels in the city’s water to be as high as 397 parts per billion, far above the federal limit of 15 ppb.

Several city officials have been charged with involuntary manslaughter after at least 12 people died from a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak linked to the environmental catastrophe. The disease, a form of pneumonia, is spread by bacteria that can be found in drinking water.

Today, Flint’s government has set up water bottle distribution stations to supply communities without access to clean water until lead levels return to EPA-approved limits.Men who impersonate police officers use guns, false badges and uniforms, and flashing red or blue lights to do so.

In every state, cops have enormous power.

It’s still legal for police officers to have sexual contact with people in their custody in 35 states. Given that there no laws against sexual contact with suspects throughout the U.S., it’s even legal for police officers to engage in this behavior with sex workers and arrest them afterward. A group of sex workers and sex worker advocates in Alaska are working to change this, but it continues to be a pervasive practice among law enforcement.

Criminals benefit from this abuse of power: In the past six months, several men have been accused of impersonating police officers in order to rape or harass women.

On Jan. 25, 54-year-old Stanley Troy Friesen from Tracy, California, was arrested after he allegedly raped a woman in nearby Milpitas. He had arranged to meet with a sex worker he met online and, pretending to a police officer by brandishing a gun and a fake badge, proceeded to rape her. A few months earlier, 41-year-old Salt Lake City resident Christopher Scott was arrested for impersonating a police officer to rape a sex worker he’d arranged to meet with on Backpage. Salt Lake City police have reportedly been in touch with other victims, and encouraged others to come forward. Friesen faces charges of rape, sodomy, oral copulation and impersonating a police officer; Scott was charged with first-degree felony rape. Similar arrests have recently been reported in Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland.

The prevalence of men impersonating police is underreported, says Callie Marie Rennison, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver who published a 2012 study on the subject.

“Law enforcement agencies rarely collect the exact number of police impersonation cases reported and investigated,” Rennison and co-author Mary Dodge wrote in the study, in which they examined 56 incident files from three metropolitan cities over eight years. “Only some police departments take the issue seriously,” she added.

There are several issues complicating the tracking of these crimes. According to RAINN, 2 out of 3 of all sexual assault victims do not report it to police. Victims may not even be aware a perpetrator is not actually an officer. If they believe the perpetrator is indeed a member of law enforcement, they could feel unsafe going to the police. As the Friesen and Scott cases show, it is not unique for impersonators to target women who have a reasonable fear of turning to police to report violent crimes, like sex workers.

“Some police departments don’t think it’s an issue at all,” Rennison told HuffPost. “I wish police would get behind it more.”

Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, said that the issue of police impersonation is taken “extremely seriously” among law enforcement.

Jack Kitaeff, a lawyer and clinical psychologist who’s currently writing a book on the topic, says impersonation is “rampant” and a “precursor” to more violent crime.

“I think that these are dangerous people,” he told HuffPost. “If you get someone who’s impersonating a police officer, you can make the hypothesis that this person is going to do something worse later on.”

Take the case of Paul Winklebleck: In 2011, he impersonated a cop to kidnap and attempt to sexually assault two teenage girls in Portland, Oregon. They escaped, and he disappeared until his remains were found in 2015. Winklebleck was a pedophile who had been previously arrested for rape and sexual assault.

Far-right terrorist Anders Breivik was dressed as a police officer before he detonated a bomb in Oslo and opened fire on the Norwegian island of Utoya in Norway in 2011, killing 77 people. Matthew Scheidt, infamous for impersonating a physician assistant as a teenager in central Florida, was later found guilty of police impersonation as well.

In his research, Kitaeff has interviewed victims and perpetrators of police impersonation.

He has found, he said, that motivations are twofold: to gain access to vulnerable victims, and the power trip and “pure thrill” of having people respond to them as authority figures. From his perspective as a clinical psychologist, he told HuffPost that many of these men (“It’s almost always guys,” he said) would likely be diagnosed with borderline personality or antisocial disorders.

Kitaeff, like Rennison and Dodge, believes that the crime should be taken more seriously — not necessarily with harsher punishments like jail time or heavy fines, but with more vigorous intervention in the form of probation, therapy and counseling, or the removal of licenses.

Police departments are more inclined to prioritize the “violent” aspect of impersonation crimes without focusing on the issue of impersonation, according to Rennison. The result, she said, is that the issue isn’t taken seriously nor seriously punished, and therefore harder to prevent from happening in the future.

Friesen, for example, had allegedly impersonated a cop and sexually assaulted a woman before, said Dave Morris, a sergeant in the Milpitas Police Department. Police impersonation is only a misdemeanor in Milpitas, where Friesen was arrested in January; the maximum penalty is a year in county jail and a $1,000 fine.

Another example of this is Christian Leon, who was first arrested for impersonating a member of law enforcement in March 2016 after pulling over a stripper in West Palm Beach, Florida, and posing as an officer. He was let go on bond despite Florida’s slightly more serious punishment for police impersonation (a felony in the third degree, with punishment up to five years in prison, five years probation, and a $5,000 fine). But a month later, he impersonated a police officer again — and escalated to the more serious attempt of sexual assault.

The punishment in most states for impersonation is either a high-class misdemeanor or low-class felony. In some states, like Arizona or New York, charges are elevated if the perpetrator uses the impersonation to commit further crimes.

“We know that laws alone don’t always stop criminals from being criminal. But longer or harsher sentences — that may include probation or house arrest —may require these offenders to be monitored in such a way that they have fewer opportunities to predate,” Rennison said.

Pasco, of the Fraternal Order of Police, doesn’t believe that impersonating a cop should universally come with a harsher punishment.

“I think it depends on what crimes ensued [from the impersonation],” he said. “If someone pretends to be a cop to get a free cup of coffee, that’s one thing. If someone pretends to be a cop and rapes someone, that’s something else entirely.”

Sex worker advocates say that ultimately the crime of impersonation ― and the oft ensuing crime of sexually exploiting vulnerable women ― can be attributed to the long-accepted culture of law enforcement not taking violence against sex workers seriously. Maggie Mayhem, Bay Area-based former Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA Board member, pointed to the case of William Suff, a California man who impersonated a California Highway Patrol officer and murdered more than a dozen sex workers over a span of six years, from 1986 to 1992.“The Voice” has a long history of LGBTQ inclusivity, even winning a GLAAD Media Award in 2012. Openly gay singers regularly compete on “The Voice,” and on last season’s finale, a Christian drag queen, Chris “Nedra Belle” Weaver, stole the show. But Monday, we had a “Voice USA” first: the series’ first transgender contestant, Angel Bonilla.

(International trivia alert: Jordan Gray was the first trans contestant to compete on “The Voice U.K.,” back in 2016; in 2014, trans man Tom Atias competed on “The Voice Israel,” but he didn’t come out until after his audition.)

“As early as 5 years old, I already knew that I am a girl trapped in a boy’s body,” Bonilla, who was born Carlos in the Philippines, told host Carson Daly. “Growing up in a very conservative family, it was very difficult for my father. When my dad saw me as a girl for the first time, he was puzzled. He’s not sure if I am his son, but he embraced me. I promised him that I will do great things. I wanted my father to be proud of me, and I’m doing this to honor him.”

As Papa Bonilla cheered on Angel’s performance of Sam Smith’s “Lay Me Down,” it was a special TV moment that could earn the “Voice” another GLAAD accolade. Maybe another Emmy. But will Angel, who joined Team Adam, win “The Voice”? That I do not know … BECAUSE HER PERFORMANCE WAS MONTAGED. What the heck?

Well, Angel is no stranger to singing competitions — she made it to Boot Camp on “The X Factor” Season 1 with a cover of “Killing Me Softly,” and was second runner-up in Bulgaria’s Discovery International Pop Song Festival — so hopefully we’ll hear more of her during the Battles. Check out some found footage of her killing it not-so-softly in an impressive cabaret performance below, then I’ll review Monday’s other successful auditioners.

Christiana Danielle, 22: “Hotline Bling”

The torch-singer daughter of a Christian rapper, this beautiful creature transformed Drake’s booty-call club banger into the haunted, heartbroken lament of a spurned lover. This was my favorite performance of Season 14 so far. My goosebumps had goosebumps.

Who turned? Adam Levine, Kelly Clarkson, Alicia Keys.

Result: Team ­­­­Alicia. Adam called Christiana “one of the greatest gifts we have been given on this show,” but Alicia’s mention of Christiana’s idol, Ella Fitzgerald, sealed the deal.

Brett Hunter, 30: “She’s a Bad Mama Jama”

A shaggy “Portlandia” character come to life, from his jaunty fedora to his hipster ukulele, Brett was enjoyable, but gimmicky, with a reedy and affected voice. Blake Shelton’s likening him to novelty act Tiny Tim wasn’t a good sign.

Who turned? Just Blake, who must be a big Tiny Tim fan.

Result: Team Blake. Of course!

Jamai: “U Got It Bad”

Apparently singing telegrams are still a thing in 2018, and Jamai sings them for a living. That makes him a great entertainer but not quite the “New Age Bobby Brown” he claims to be. He looked sexy and supercool, but his vocals sounded goaty and strained.

Who turned? Kelly, Alicia.

Result: Team Alicia. Jamai sang his answer, of course.

Mia Boostrom, 24: “Pillowtalk”

I wish Mia hadn’t stayed in her lower register for most of the Zayn bedroom ballad — she didn’t turn any chairs until she hit a high note — but her control on the deeper notes was masterful, and there was a subtle sultriness to her approach.

Who turned? Just Adam, who said Mia might be the best one-chair turn in “Voice” history.

Result? Team Adam. Duh!

Jackie Foster, 21: “What About Us”

Jackie fronts a hard rock band, but there was nothing rawkin’ about this audition. Her Berklee/theater background came out, and I experienced flashbacks to the technically proficient but bland Emily Luther of Season 13. Jackie’s performance had none of P!nk’s fire. This was a very pale P!nk.

Who turned? Kelly and Alicia, surprisingly.

Result: Team Kelly. I’m not sure why we needed a commercial break cliffhanger to learn this unexciting news.

Reid Umstattd, 34: “Take Me to the Pilot”

I think the coaches were more excited about this Austin everyman’s song choice — who doesn’t love Elton John? — than they were about his generic bad-band voice. Not much charisma here.

Who turned? Adam, Alicia.

Result? Team Adam. Reid was a sucker for Adam’s typical “I believe you could win this show” lies hyperbole.

Jorge Eduardo, 24: “Despacito”

This son of a famous Mexican mariachi singer turned four chairs on La Voz, later placing fourth on that show. He had a competent, radio-ready pop voice but wasn’t quite quadruple-spin-worthy. I actually preferred it when Blake sang the lyrics of this song to the Eagles’ “Desperado.”

Who turned? Kelly. Just Kelly.

Result? Team Kelly. Maybe one chair is all it’ll take.

Jamella, 21: “Dive”

This pop/R&B girl was Monday’s other montage victim. I’m not even sure if the “Dive” she sang was the Ed Sheeran song.

Who turned? Kelly, Blake. I have no idea why.

Result? Team Kelly. OK, then.

Austin Giorgio, 21: “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)”

Young crooners have appeared on singing competitions since “American Idol”’s John Stevens in 2004, but this sharp-suited kid was something else — charismatic, tons of fun, and a name that belongs in lights. Austin may not have the strongest or most versatile voice of the season, but he’s a superstar.

Who turned? Blake, Kelly.

Result? Team Blake. No surprise, given Blake’s longtime man-crush on Michael Bublé.

Johnny Bliss, 26: “Preciosa”

The half-Dominican, half-Puerto Rican karaoke host was the other contestant representing the Latin community Monday — but the only contestant to earn a four-chair turn. He had a robust, full-bodied voice on Marc Anthony’s classic ballad. This was not a karaoke performance.

Who turned? All four coaches … but Adam, remembering Kelly’s fondness for “Despacito” singer Jorge, used his Block button on her. Not cool, since Kelly was Johnny’s No. 1 coach choice. I hate this stupid new twist!

Result? Team Alicia. Alicia lured Johnny with a Spanish-language serenade of her hit “If I Ain’t Got You.” And now, Adam ain’t got Johnny.Passengers on a flight from San Francisco to Boise, Idaho got a scare on Monday when a traveler in the first-class section tried to open the emergency exit door.

“I am God!” the unidentified woman can be heard repeating in footage of the incident that was posted by Boise ABC affiliate KIVI.

Passengers told KBOI, the CBS station in Boise, that the woman shouted “I want to die! Get me off this plane!” before running for the exit.

Although the woman was restrained aboard SkyWest flight 5449, which was operating as United Express, the plane was not diverted. She was later taken into custody and handed over to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare for evaluation, KBOI reported.

“She wasn’t acting right or normal from the very beginning (of the flight),” passenger Scott T. Smith told the Idaho Statesmen.

Smith initially thought the woman was just a nervous traveler, but it soon became apparent something else was wrong as she kept repeating phrases such as “God has all the data,” “I don’t have any data” and “We landed in Boise 15 minutes ago.”

Smith said people remained calm during the incident.

“I was never that concerned,” he said.Attorneys across Utah received an unexpected piece of email from the State Bar on Monday: a picture of boobs.

“We are horrified,” John Baldwin, the organization’s executive director, told Fox 13 in Salt Lake City. “We are investigating to discover how this occurred. Our goal is to find out what happened and ensure it never happens again.”

The Utah State Bar also tweeted an apology:

Apologies to all who received an inappropriate email from the Utah State Bar. We are aware of the situation and are investigating the matter. — Utah State Bar (@UtahStateBar) March 5, 2018

The email contained the subject line “2018 Spring Convention Walk-Ins Welcome! Learn How!” along with an image promoting the March 8-10 event. Below that was an image of a woman’s breasts.

Here’s a censored version of the message:

⚡️During a thunderstorm - even sitting in a parked car under a tree is dangerous due to falling limbs from lightning and wind.



⚡️Imagine how many people don't know this?#WeatherReady pic.twitter.com/S0FIR16oer — NWS (@NWS) May 16, 2018

With summer approaching, the National Weather Service (NWS) has posted some sage advice about what not to do during a thunderstorm: Don’t run under a tree to avoid lightning.

In a tweet posted on Wednesday, the agency called it “literally the WORST place to be” and shared a clip showing what happens when lightning strikes a tree.

“Most lightning deaths or injuries occur when people are on a golf course, near water or standing under trees for shelter,” the NWS wrote in a bulletin posted last year.

The agency’s safety campaigns have been credited with helping to reduce the number of lightning deaths annually. USA Today reported last year that when the NWS launched its first “when thunder roars, go indoors” campaign in 2001, the U.S. averaged 55 lightning deaths per year. That number has steadily dropped, and last year it reached an all-time low of 17.

“While we don’t like to see any lightning deaths, the continuing downward trend in yearly fatalities is encouraging,” meteorologist John Jensenius told the newspaper.

The clip, released by the NWS this week, shows a 2016 strike at Bishop Thomas K. Gorman Catholic School in Tyler, Texas:

While lightning can strike any time of year, it’s most common in summer during the late afternoon and evening. The highest incidence of lightning strikes occurs around the Gulf Coast.

The agency advises people to head indoors when they hear thunder. If that’s not possible, a closed automobile was the next-best option.

“Stay away from trees, power poles, antennae and away from lakes, ponds and water,” the NWS said. “Stay away from metal objects such as fences, railroad tracks and metal bleachers.”Actress Tiffany Haddish did what any normal person would do when confronted with the chance to meet Meryl Streep: She quite literally jumped a barrier and stopped traffic.

The “Girls Trip” actress attended Sunday night’s 90th Academy Awards ceremony where she presented the nominees for animated and live action short films. On the red carpet earlier in the night, Haddish made it known that her real reason for coming to the Oscars was to meet the one and only Streep.

“I’m looking forward to meeting Meryl Streep and asking her to be my mama,” the actress told Ryan Seacrest during the red carpet pre-show.

Later on, Haddish finally got her moment. The actress went rogue and ran over to a roped off walkway where Streep was walking and taking press photos. Haddish hopped the barrier ― dress and all ― and stopped traffic, putting her hands on her hips and looking square at Streep.

The two hugged briefly as Streep laughed and continued walking. Haddish ended their quick meet and greet with a small curtsy, as one does when meeting Hollywood royalty.

Haddish told People at the Governors Ball after-party that she was elated to meet her idol earlier in the night.

“When I asked Meryl Streep to be my mama, [she said] of course! Best moment of the night!” Haddish said.Well, it seems that Paul Thomas Anderson has very good taste in funny women.

In fact, the ladies were so great together that people on Twitter immediately requested that they host the award show together next year.

“I had to take my shoes off,” Rudolph said.

“Girl, me too,” Haddish followed up. “I’ve been wearing these shoes since 11 o’clock this morning.” She then asked Rudolph how long she had been wearing her heels.

“Since the Critics’ Choice Awards,” Rudolph quipped.

But the jokes didn’t end there. (You can watch their other cracks — about white people with clipboards and pinky toes falling off — in the clip above.)

But if you’re not completely convinced, here are all the other projects that people on Twitter want Haddish and Rudolph to do together.

(@AlannaBennett) March 5, 2018LOS ANGELES ― If you watched the Oscars Sunday night, then you probably heard the last two words of Frances McDormand’s speech: “inclusion rider.”

Backstage in the press room, nearly everyone around me, including myself, scratched their heads and said something to the effect of, “What is that? And is it inclusion rider or inclusion writer?” We quickly started Googling and hunting on Twitter to figure it out.

Aha, inclusion rider.

After the telecast wrapped, a victorious McDormand, star of “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” arrived in the press room ― with her best actress Oscar in hand. Not surprisingly, the topic came up.

“Please explain your comment at the end ― the two words ‘inclusion rider,’” one reporter asked.

McDormand said:

“Right. I just found out about this last week. There is, has always been available to all ― everybody that gets, that does a negotiation on a film ― an inclusion rider which means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50 percent diversity in not only the casting, but also the crew. And so, the fact that we, that I, just learned that after 35 years of being in the film business ― it’s not, we’re not going back. So the whole idea of women trending, no. No trending. African-Americans trending, no. No trending. It changes now, and I think the inclusion rider will have something to do with that. Right? Power in rules.”

McDormand may have only learned about inclusion riders last week, but the concept has been circulating for at least a year.

Kalpana Kotagal of the law firm Cohen Milstein worked on drafting the inclusion rider with Stacy Smith, founder of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, alongside producer and actor Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni.

So, what is it?

“It’s a short addition to a contract that an actor can take into negotiations with a studio that would provide for a hiring and casting process that basically follows some best practices and helps to cut through some unconscious bias to hopefully lead to casting and crew hiring that better reflects the world that we live in,” Kotagal told HuffPost.

Kotagal says that some A-listers and production companies have already started successfully using the provision. Her hope is that it becomes the norm in the industry.

“Women like Ava DuVernay and Shonda Rhimes have been using these kinds of hiring practices in their own work for as long as they’ve had the power to be able to do it,” Kotagal said. “This contractual provision is about is giving those who have the bargaining power in the industry, historically straight white men, giving them the tool to say, ‘I’m going to use my bargaining power to drive change in this industry.’”

“That’s why it’s different than lots of other tools. It doesn’t call on those who have struggled to find a place in the industry to also be the source of the solution,” she said. “Instead it says, those of you who have power, who want to make change, here’s your tool do it.”

Kotagel had no idea McDormand would mention an inclusion rider in her acceptance speech Sunday night. But she’s certainly glad she did.

“We knew this had to take off at some point,” said Kotagel. “It’s a common sense solution to what has been a thorny and hard-to-address problem.”

McDormand’s passion for the Time’s Up movement to fight harassment and inequality is part of the reason she decided to attend the Academy Awards this year.

“As you know, I don’t show up all the time. I only show up when I can and when I want to, but I was there at the Golden Globes and it’s almost like there was an arc that started there. It doesn’t end here,” she said backstage. “We actually started a conversation that will change something.”

McDormand’s comments followed her roaring acceptance speech in which she asked that all female nominees stand.

“Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed,” she said.

AdvertisementSome older Academy voters apparently think “Get Out,” one of the most profitable movies of 2017 and Best Picture nominee, is not Academy Awards material.

In an interview with Vulture, newer academy voters revealed that their older colleagues hadn’t even seen the film. While the 14 newcomers interviewed reflect an extended effort on behalf of the academy to diversify its voters room, the remaining voters are older and have much narrower views on what makes a film worthy of a statuette.

“I had multiple conversations with longtime academy members who were like, ‘That was not an Oscar film,’” said one new voter. “And I’m like, ‘That’s bullshit. Watch it.’ Honestly, a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it, so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important.”

“Get Out” wasn’t the only film passed over this awards season. Jada Pinkett-Smith said that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association “wouldn’t even watch” “Girls Trip” after the summer blockbuster was snubbed by the Golden Globes.

Last year’s Best Picture winner, “Moonlight,” had a majority black cast, marking a win for representation. Unfortunately, #OscarsSoWhite is still a thing. In 2015 and 2016, no black actors were nominated for major awards.

Older academy members’ dismissal of films like “Get Out” shows there is still a long way to go. The new members of the academy are hoping to lead the change.The State Department has spent nothing of $120 million allocated to combat foreign influence in U.S. elections, according to The New York Times. Muhammad Hamed / Reuters

The State Department has spent $0 of $120 million allocated by Congress to combat foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections, The New York Times reported on Sunday.

Despite the massive budget, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has done little to thwart a sweeping influence campaign by the Russian government, and an office tasked with countering such efforts has no employees that even speak Russian due to an ongoing hiring freeze.

Tillerson himself has continued to doubt the ability of his department to combat Russia, and just last month said that if Moscow wanted to meddle, it was “going to find ways to do that.”

The report comes as American intelligence officials and lawmakers warn that the Kremlin is, once again, working to influence upcoming elections, using a coordinated campaign of social media trolls and disinformation in an attempt to sway voters.

Congress directed the Pentagon to give $60 million to the State Department in late 2016 to combat such efforts. But the Times reported Tillerson took seven months deciding if he should spend the money, and when the agency finally asked for it, the fiscal year was almost over and the request denied.

Another $60 million became available for the next fiscal year, but both State and the Department of Defense have been at loggerheads over how much money to send over. After media outlets, including the Times and Politico, began asking about the funding, the Pentagon said last Monday it would direct $40 million to the State Department sometime in April.

The U.S. government also has vast resources and spends billions each year on cyberweapons, but those tools do little against trolling campaigns.

Rather, State’s Global Engagement Center would use the funding to develop means to combat social media campaigns to influence voters. The Times notes the office could do so by crafting anti-propaganda projects, or amplifying pro-democracy voices.

President Donald Trump has done little himself to combat Russian meddling. Rather, he’s moved to deny the influence of Moscow in his own election, despite many of the nation’s leading intelligence agencies saying otherwise.

When Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians last month for such interference, Trump tweeted that his campaign “did nothing wrong” and once again emphasized that there was “no collusion!”

Regardless of the president’s opinions, however, intelligence officials warned last month that Russia was using the internet once again to sow discord among American voters.They were hilarious before they even said a word, walking out onto the crystalline Dolby Theatre stage, hand in hand, carrying their shoes, Tiffany Haddish rocking her cherished Alexander McQueen dress, Maya Rudolph with her air of slightly tipsy superciliousness.

This was the most memorable moment of a night with few memorable moments to speak of. For all their talk of representation, of new Hollywood ideals, the Oscars was a safe affair, the industry returning to the mean. But here was an enactment of the new ideal right in front of us: Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph. On stage. Together. Being funny as hell, and black in their own ways.

Watch Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph’s very funny #Oscars intro. pic.twitter.com/8VlvxK5l7N — The A.V. Club (@TheAVClub) March 5, 2018

Rudolph, deadpan, set up the joke: “We are so happy to be here, but a little nervous, too, because a few years ago people were saying the Oscars were so white,” she said.

Haddish, unapologetically ratchet, spiked it: “I know what you’re thinking. Are the Oscars too black now? Don’t worry. We were just backstage, and there are still a bunch of white people still to come.”

The two-minute bit, in which the pair mimicked “white people with clipboards ... and headsets,” elicited genuine laughs from the auditorium and had people on social media clamoring for Haddish and Rudolph to host the next Oscars, star in a movie together or both.

Why are Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph not hosting — jay smooth (@jsmooth995) March 5, 2018

Hollywood loves to have “conversations” about diversity and representation in front of and behind the camera, ones that often hinge on what it means for the underrepresented to “see themselves” on screen. But rarely does the conversation delve into what it actually means to “see” yourself.

Which makes Haddish’s and Rudolph’s brief appearance as significant as it was hilarious. It’s noteworthy that two black women got to share space as equals and deliver some of the biggest laughs of the night. It’s even more noteworthy that, in seeing them together, we saw a striking testimony to two notions that are evidently still viewed in some circles as novel ideas: that two funny women can exist at the same time and that blackness is not a monolith.

Haddish and Rudolph have navigated their blackness in vastly different ways over their careers. Rudolph, who is biracial (her mother was singer Minnie Riperton), played everyone from Beyoncé to Michelle Obama during her tenure on “Saturday Night Live.” She had to be something of a chameleon in that respect, gracefully taking on the burden of being “every” black woman (an impossible task) while injecting her own brand of sly humor into every skit.

Haddish, on the other hand, has built her stardom over the last five years by being and doing one thing. She is loud, brash and sometimes crass, traits that for many white female comics (Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman) are considered edgy but for many black female comedians can either become a liability or a gimmick. Haddish’s blackness is deeply woven into her comedy, but it isn’t a shtick either, and that’s what makes her so refreshing.

Together, however briefly, Haddish and Rudolph represent a kind of comedy ideal: a world in which black women of vastly different backgrounds and perspectives can be funny without code-switching, without recalibrating their blackness for the benefit of white folk. And that’s why the bit worked. Though the two are wildly different, they share an understanding, a knowing as black women that only black women get ― it can be communicated with something as simple as a look or a head nod.
