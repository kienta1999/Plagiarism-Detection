“It has a different vocabulary on the dictionary,” Cardi said in her video. “Now if that’s a word that you guys said is a bad word for gays, I’ve never even heard that word in the first place. Why don’t y’all educate people? A lot of people are not aware about what’s wrong or right in the LGBTQ community.”

OK. To clarify: The “Q” in LGBTQ stands for “queer,” and it’s been reclaimed by many in the community to describe their identity.

However, the term has long been used in a derogatory manner ― and Offset’s lyric seems, to many, to play into that negative historical use of the term.

Offset attempted to explain himself on Thursday in an Instagram post.

He insisted he didn’t intend to offend anyone and said “queer” just happened to rhyme with other words.

“When I wrote that I was thinking of words that could rhyme with others (here, lear, solitaire, bear),” the rapper wrote. He added that by “queer,” he didn’t “mean someone who’s gay.”

Offset claimed that the term “queer” referred to paparazzi and “lame people who film you, post it and stalk you.”The Capitol building in Tallahassee, Florida. directorspence via Getty Images

Floridians will get to decide in November whether they want to amend the state constitution to automatically restore voting rights to felons once they complete their sentences, a move that could significantly expand the franchise to over 1.5 million people.

Florida election officials verified Tuesday that organizers had gathered enough petitions to put the referendum on the ballot this year. Just gathering those signatures was a herculean task for the grassroots effort ― Florida law required the organizers to gather 766,200 signatures, equal to 8 percent of the votes cast in the last presidential election. Within that amount, organizers also had to collect 8 percent of the presidential vote totals from 14 of the state’s 27 congressional districts.

“Through the hard work of Florida voters and unwavering dedication of a truly grassroots movement, we have reached a historic milestone and have officially placed the Second Chances Voting Restoration Amendment on the ballot,” Desmond Meade, chair of Floridians for a Fair Democracy and spokesperson for Second Chances Florida Campaign, said in a statement. “Voters took matters in their own hands to ensure that their fellow Floridians, family members, and friends who’ve made past mistakes, served their time and paid their debts to society are given a second chance and the opportunity to earn back their ability to vote.”

To pass in November, the referendum will need to get the support of 60 percent of voters.

Florida has some of the most restrictive laws when it comes to restoring rights to felons. The state is one of four that permanently strips people with a felony conviction of the right to vote. Once they complete their sentences, felons can apply to have their rights restored. To do so, they have to appeal to the state’s executive clemency board, which consists of the governor, attorney general, chief financial officer and commissioner of agriculture. The board meets once every three months to hear fewer than 100 cases ― but there are tens of thousands of petitions, meaning it can take years for people to get a hearing. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) also implemented new rules in 2011 making it so that felons must wait at least five years after completing their parole and paying all fines and fees before they can apply to have their rights restored.

If approved by Florida voters, the ballot initiative would eliminate that process by automatically restoring voting rights to people who complete all terms of their sentence. The amendment would not restore voting rights to people convicted of murder or sexual offenses.

Kerri Wyland, a spokeswoman for Scott, said it was up to Floridians to decide whether to restore voting rights to former felons.

“This is a decision for each voter to decide on,” she said in an email. “The Governor has been clear that the most important thing to him is that felons can show that they can lead a life free of crime and be accountable to their victims and our communities.”

Nationally, about 6.1 million people are disenfranchised because of a felony conviction, according to the Sentencing Project, meaning the people disenfranchised in Florida make up about one-quarter of that population. The analysis found African-American voting-age adults are four times more likely than non-African-Americans to be disenfranchised; in Florida about 1 in every 5 eligible African-American voter is disenfranchised.

Florida’s disenfranchisement policies have roots in the Jim Crow South. After the Civil War, Congress forced Florida and other southern states to ratify the 13th and 14th amendments and to write new state constitutions guaranteeing universal male suffrage. Florida lawmakers did so, but also created criminal codes targeting black voters and then stripped people convicted of certain crimes of their right to vote.

In the spring of 1996, strippers at the Lusty Lady in San Francisco noticed that the men watching their peep shows were filming them. The women asked their bosses to kick the men out for filming them without their consent. But management refused. When the women asked management to get rid of the one-way glass altogether, they were told they could go find work somewhere else.

The women of the Lusty made a different choice.

Thanks to their efforts over the subsequent year, the Lusty became one of the first strip clubs in the U.S. to unionize. By 2003, it had become the first to be run as a cooperative by its own performers and other employees. But the Lusty officially shuttered in 2013, and the industry today is still plagued by the same sorts of problems as then: a lack of workplace protections; discrimination against dancers based on race or body or hair type; arbitrary firings for things as small as arriving one minute late or suggesting the club keep strippers safe. In the vast majority of clubs, there are no protections for dancers if they are sick or injured, or if they have a family emergency.

Most strippers want a guaranteed minimum wage, fair workplace practices and protections, some minimal benefits and legal recourse against blatant discrimination. But first they have to win the same battle their peers in the trucking, cleaning and driving industries are fighting: They have to defeat employers who classify them as independent contractors rather than employees.

The Lusty was only able to unionize because the strippers were already employees, explained Kristina Zinnen, who worked at the Lusty and led the charge to unionize before going to law school and becoming an employment lawyer.

Treating strippers as contractors, rather than employees, gives club owners all kinds of advantages. They can block contractors from unionizing and ignore the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which doesn’t protect contractors. They don’t have to pay strippers the federal minimum wage, provide benefits or offer workers’ compensation.

Club owners have a huge amount of leverage over women who need the work. In fact, some women need the work so badly, they’re literally paying for it: Not only do strippers pay a fee to rent out the stage for their shift, they often pay out club fees afterward.

Sex work is work

Around the country, strippers are starting to fight for the same things the workers at the Lusty did decades ago.

In New York City, strippers from clubs in Queens and the Bronx began mobilizing for an impending strike at the end of 2017 at a Bronx-based dance studio called Poletic Justice. The meeting focused on the “bartender issue” — a growing trend in the city’s clubs where managers seek out Instagram models to “bartend” in similar outfits as strippers and bring in their droves of followers. When this happens, it tends to overshadow the strippers’ performances and make them lose out on tips ― which, because they’re not making a minimum wage, is where their money comes from.

The bartender issue has triggered discussions in the NYC stripper community about other issues: racism and colorism, women being pitted against each other, and the lack of managerial support when complaining about problems.

“When you work in a male-dominated industry, it’s very easy for them to make the women go against each other,” Mona Marie, who runs Poletic Justice, told HuffPost in December.

“At the end of the day, being an entertainer is more mental than it is physical. It’s just like any other industry. We still deserve respect.” - Mona Marie

Strippers and their allies are frustrated, she said. “I think these women are just tired. They’re tired of feeling discriminated against, they’re tired of being disrespected, they’re tired of the lack of rules and professionalism from people that should be conducting themselves with professionalism.”

Strippers in other states are mobilizing, too. In 2015, strippers in Oregon took the fight for better workplace treatment to the state legislature, ultimately lobbying for the successful House Bill 3059. That bill established a toll-free hotline where “live performers” could get guidance on employment classification. If a performer feels she or he has been misclassified, hotline responders provide counsel and legal advice.

Club owners are adamant that strippers are, fundamentally, independent contractors. Zinnen disagrees.

The line dividing employees from independent contractors is not always clear ― it’s decided on a case-by-case basis. The IRS uses what’s known as the “20 questions” form, and the Department of Labor provides a six-factor “economic realities” test. One item on that test says that a person is likely an employee if “the work performed is an integral part of the employer’s business.” This alone would suggest that a stripper is an employee of the club, rather than an independent contractor. No one is going to a strip club for the $9 Budweisers.

Courts tend to side with Zinnen and the strippers. In 2002, Zinnen and other San Francisco-based strippers brought claims against the club Chez Paree (now closed) to the labor commissioner’s office at California’s Department of Industrial Relations, which supported their claims. Chez Paree filed for bankruptcy, and the women never got their money. Zinnen filed a claim against another club, Temptations, also for misclassification, and was ultimately paid what she was owed by the club owner.

In Peabody, Massachusetts, in 2011, women alleged that the strip club management “misclassified them as independent contractors rather than as employees.” The Superior Court of Massachusetts sided with the strippers. Last year, a stripper in Atlanta filed a federal suit against the Cheetah club for misclassifying her and not protecting her in a predatory workplace. (The lawsuit is ongoing.)

But even with the law on their side, it’s hard for strippers to stand up to club owners. Cases can take years to resolve ― and strippers are sometimes blacklisted by other clubs for stirring up trouble, or ostracized by other strippers who just want to put their heads down and keep their jobs.

“At the end of the day, we’re all independent contractors,” Mona Marie said. “To stand up for yourself means to get fired or to be blacklisted from these clubs. And when you have responsibilities and you have bills and families and tuition to pay and all those other things... it’s a chance that you don’t want to take.”

Changing the way we think about the profession

As high-profile industries like Hollywood and the media reckon with sexual harassment and exploitation amid the #MeToo movement, some strippers and sex workers — like many people at the margins of society — feel left out.

“I always tell people, ‘You think this is easy?’” Mona Marie said. “None of this is easy. My job is not easy at all. I want you to stand in front of a room in your two-piece, in heels, for whatever hours, and you deal with... being bashed or being called names or being discriminated against.”

“At the end of the day, being an entertainer is more mental than it is physical,” she went on. “It’s just like any other industry. We still deserve respect.”

And insisting on respect for strippers as workers is an uphill battle. Misogyny is certainly a major problem, says Antonia Crane, a writer and stripper who’s been in the business for more than 25 years and who was involved in the unionization of the Lusty in 1996. But often, she said, it’s other women who fail to stand up for their sisters in the profession.

“Other women hate strippers,” Crane said. “They think we’re trying to steal their men. Of course we’re not! That’s ridiculous. It’s a job.”

We talked about last year’s Women’s March, which issued an official platform and “guiding principles” that included unapologetic support for sex work. “We stand in full solidarity with the sex workers’ rights movement,” the statement reads.

I tell Crane this feels like progress.

“Sure,” she says. “But I was at the Women’s March in LA on January 21st, 2017. It was the biggest [Women’s March] turnout in the whole country... I had made five signs about support for sex workers. And I had to carry all of them by myself.”A new “faith-based” adoption law signed by Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on Friday is raising red flags for LGBTQ groups.

Oklahoma Senate Bill 1140 allows agencies to deny adoptions and foster care placements if a given placement violates an agency’s “written religious or moral convictions or policies.”

Fallin says the law does not restrict LGBTQ couples from adopting. While that may be technically true, it would allow agencies to reject couples “in accordance with their beliefs” ― that is, because those couples are in the LGBTQ community.

“Rather than stand up to religious fanaticism, the governor has chosen to reinforce the delusions of those who confuse discrimination with liberty,” Oklahoma ACLU external affairs director Allie Shinn said. “This measure serves no legitimate policy purpose.”Ja Rule branded 50 Cent a “pussy” and “power bottom” in a fiery, obscenity-laced Twitter tirade last week that will no doubt reignite the long-simmering feud between the rival rappers.

The two men, who both hail from Queens, New York, have had an adversarial public relationship for nearly two decades, with each attempting to overtake the other in interviews, “diss tracks” and even alleged physical altercations.

The latest chapter in the feud began when 50 Cent appeared on Big Boy’s 92.3 radio show in Los Angeles last Thursday to promote his new movie, “Den of Thieves.”

When the 42-year-old rapper was asked what he would do if he were to run into Ja Rule, he replied, “I done put him to bed.”

Needless to say, the comment didn’t sit too well with Ja Rule, 41. The rapper fired back on Twitter on Friday with a stream of insults and homophobic epithets that didn’t let up until the next day.

Fun hip hop FACT: @50cent is PUSSY... — Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) January 19, 2018

On Friday, the rapper continued the insults, suggesting fans visit his Instagram page to see their boyfriends and husbands “dick riding” 50 Cent, who he branded a “piece of shit human being” ― comparable to President Donald Trump. It’s not clear what image Ja Rule wanted fans to see.

Ladies please go to my instagram page @Ruleyorkcity so you can see your man/husband dick ridding @50cent lmao y’all must be proud haha... — Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) January 20, 2018

On Monday night’s “The Bachelor,” sensual elf Bekah M. and awkward Labrador Arie Luyendyk Jr. took their steamy chemistry to new, explosive heights. They make out near horses, they make out in a hot tub, they make out at a fancy dinner. Watching their one-on-one date felt so voyeuristic, there were times we nearly yelled at ourselves, “Take a picture, it’ll last longer!”

But hovering over their date was the specter of Bekah’s dark secret: She’s only 22, a fact she finally revealed during their romantic dinner. While Arie, 36, had pressed her in the past about her readiness for marriage, and while he was aware she was young, the revelation that she’s the age of a new college graduate left him gobsmacked, and uncertain whether their relationship could have a future at all.

While in the past, a 14-year age difference might have gone unremarked upon in “Bachelor” land, in 2018 it sparked a lively conversation ― both on-screen and off. Is 14 years too much of an age gap? Is 22 too young to get married, especially to a 36-year-old? Is Arie condescending to question her readiness, or just realistic? Why did he send all the 30-ish women home and keep a bunch of young 20-somethings, if he thinks age is a consideration?

On HuffPost’s “Bachelor” podcast “Here to Make Friends,” we discussed all this and more with Yahoo Entertainment’s Kristen Baldwin:

Claire: Back at the house, the women are discussing Bekah’s age gap with Arie. She is 14 years younger than him. The age difference between them is in high school.

Emma: So, this is a topic that I was finding kind of difficult to clarify my feelings on, because I think it’s a valid concern that she is 22. That is a specific place in your life. That is a large age gap, and for a lot of people, especially mid-30s to early 20, that’s a big change and there is a lot of life to be lived and things to figure out, usually, when you are 22.

Claire: Especially Bekah in particular, doesn’t seem like someone who would really want to get married right after college.

Emma: Which is not a bad thing, let’s clarify.

Kristen: Probably should be how you think about life.

Claire: Some people pointed out that Maquel is only a year older. Maquel has already been married, so I probably wouldn’t have quite the same question about Maquel simply because she clearly wants to just get married as much and as quickly as possible.

Kristen: Early and often.

Emma: That’s actually true. I was saying, hey, Maquel’s actually 23, but that’s a really good point that she has been married and divorced. It’s weird that it hasn’t come up. But we know that as people who read a lot of media that is adjacent to the “Bachelor” franchise. But I also did find the intense focus on [Bekah’s] age to be funny given how many 25-year-olds he’s readily down to marry tomorrow. And the fact that he sent home every woman who is 30 to 32. And there are no women older than 32.

Kristen: On the other hand, I do think Bekah also ― not that she acts immature, but she acts very young. She just has a lot of very youthful vivacious energy ―

Emma: Which he likes!

Kristen: Which he likes, but I think that’s what’s causing the other women to say, is she really ready? She’s not this quiet, mature soul, older than her years. She seems like a young, very young woman. A lot of energy. She’s smart, she has her wisdom, everybody talks about her wisdom, but she does seem quite young and vivacious, and somebody who maybe isn’t ready to settle down with a 36-year-old man who likes cardigans and lives in Arizona.

Claire: And that’s not a knock on her at all.

Kristen: That’s fine!

Emma: To me, that’s actually a positive for her.

Claire: When we say things, when I say things like, “She’s not ready for marriage,” I don’t mean that she’s not mature enough, I don’t mean that she’s not wise enough, I don’t mean that she’s not sure who she is. I think that she doesn’t literally seem like someone who is going to want marriage right now. You could be that person at 35. Typically, if you’re a 35-year-old woman who comes on “The Bachelor,” you probably want to get married. But a lot of young women come on the show just to have fun, and that’s fair, but also something Arie gets to take into account. I think that’s valid.

Emma: He is allowed to take pause at that.

Claire: In the meantime, they get in an outdoor hot tub and make out.

Kristen: Yeah they do!

Emma: He is into her.

Kristen: And I think she actually is into him, and is surprised by that. I think she clearly went in thinking, ‘Oh, I’ll get a free trip to wherever, maybe I’ll get to do some fun stuff and then I’ll get sent home.’ And now she’s like, ‘Wait, I actually like him, and we have a great chemistry.’ So that is giving her pause, but there’s still no way that she wants to get married.

Emma: No, which she says to him she doesn’t know and she can’t give him any fake assurances, which I actually appreciated, because at the end of the day, he has, ultimately, all the power. He can send her home at any point. She doesn’t want to be sent home, because as she said and I believe her, she’s feeling genuine feelings, and she’s having a great time. But at the end of the day, it’s his choice.

Claire: They have different interests in this relationship, which is fine, and they both are just gonna pursue their own interests. He wants to have a relationship that he can feel really confident will lead to marriage soon. She wants to date this guy she’s attracted to and has fun with and see where it goes. They were both honest about that, I think, and it comes down to the fact that she’s like, “But won’t it still be worth it if we date and it doesn’t work out?”

Emma: And he’s like, “no.”

Claire: I’m like, honey, he’s a lot older than you. He’s done that a bunch of times. She’s at the age where she maybe hasn’t had to experience the consequences of wasted time yet.

Emma: I appreciate that he said no, that’s not worth it to me. I related to that.

Kristen: Absolutely.

Emma: I think we’re going to see this become an issue down the road, but I am glad that Bekah makes it through this date.

Kristen: I do think that he felt ― he genuinely likes her, and he knew she was young, but he was avoiding really asking her until this moment for whatever reason, and even though he knows somewhere in the back of his head that this is not gonna work out, he couldn’t cut the cord just yet. So, fine!

Emma: It’s still early.

Kristen: There are 12 other women, whatever. He’s got time.

Claire: I think it was sort of dumb of him to keep her, but ―

Kristen: I understand that he’s not ready to rip off the Band-Aid.

Emma: She’s good TV. So I’m happy to have her around. She brings a fun personality, and I love her haircut.

Kristen: She’s stunning.

Claire: The moment in their conversation where Bekah finally tells him she’s 22 ― the look on his face is like he’s just seen a beautiful racecar have a two-ton weight dropped on it.

Kristen: Explode.

Claire: The sadness. And he says, “Ohhhhh, you’re so young. You’re so young.”

Kristen: It was heartbreaking.

Claire: But then he transitions so quickly into this very paternal mode with her.

Emma: But then makes out with her.

Kristen: He still wants to hit that.

Claire: Oh, totally, but it was interesting to me how quickly he shifted into ― before it was all chemistry and “We’re young and sexy,” and suddenly, it was like, “Oh, she’s 14 years younger than me.” He started talking to her like, “Oh, you don’t know about the world, you need to have experiences.”

Kristen: “Live your life.”

Claire: “Find a guy who’s closer in age to you, maybe, I don’t know. I just feel like maybe you’re not ready.” It sounded so much like a stepdad, or a teacher just being like, “Maybe don’t write me love letters and leave them on my desk.”

Kristen: “This is not appropriate.”

Claire: But then he still does make out with her. The teacher vibe was still so present to me when she was just hanging on his neck.

Kristen: She was literally just draped on him, being like, “Pretty please with sugar on top, don’t cut me tonight!” And he just couldn’t do it. I understand that.

Emma: I think she’s got another, maybe two weeks?

Kristen: Yeah, I think that’s about right. She’s not making it to ―

Emma: It’s gonna curdle.

Claire: I think it’s worth noting that although her age revelation really brought out the “You’re not ready yet” conversation — and really caused him to make a lot of statements about what she did and didn’t want in life, which isn’t really his place to say — he already was concerned about that with Bekah.

Emma: He had brought up before, “I don’t know if you’re ready to get married.”

Kristen: But he hadn’t really, he didn’t want to deal with it yet because she was so hot and he likes making out with her. But now he’s getting to the point where he’s like, I’ve got to start actually focusing on this.

Claire: Yeah. So.

Kristen: The pixie cut lives to see another day. Bless her heart.

AdvertisementA lawsuit filed by a member of the Satanic Temple challenging Missouri’s abortion law on religious grounds heads to the state Supreme Court on Tuesday.

The lawsuit invokes the same First Amendment and Religious Freedom Restoration Act protections that the Hobby Lobby company in Oklahoma successfully cited to refuse contraception coverage for its female employees on religious grounds.

Plaintiff Mary Doe is arguing that Missouri’s abortion law violated her rights to religious liberty.

She “would be the first to admit her religious beliefs are outside the mainstream thinking of many Christians in Missouri,” the suit states. “Indeed, some would label her with the sobriquet ‘Satanist.’ But if religious freedom is going to have any meaning under RFRA, the court must accord Mary Doe the same respect for her religious beliefs it would grant Mother Theresa.”

“The state has essentially established a religious indoctrination program intended to push a single ideological viewpoint.” - Satanic Temple spokesman Jex Blackmore

The activist Satanic Temple, based in Salem, Massachusetts, does “not promote a belief in a personal Satan,” according to its website. Its mission includes encouraging “benevolence and empathy among all people,” rejecting “tyrannical authority” and advocating for justice.

Doe’s suit, initially filed in 2015, argues that Missouri’s so-called “Informed Consent” abortion law aimed to convince Doe ― contrary to her religious beliefs ― that abortion is murder. The law also sought to cause her “guilt and shame to dissuade her from getting an abortion” and “punish her for her beliefs,” according to the suit.

Doe has the “right to reject any part of any medical procedure on religious grounds,” the suit states. Nevertheless, Doe, who obtained an abortion in a St. Louis clinic in 2015, was required by Missouri law to view an ultrasound of her fetus and read what she considered a “political and religious statement” that life begins at conception. In addition, she was required to wait 72 hours after her first appointment before she could obtain an abortion. She was forced to incur all costs of the law’s requirements, including for the ultrasound and lodging.

Doe gave the clinic a letter before the difficult process, stating her “deeply held religious beliefs that a non-viable fetus is not a separate human being but is part of her body,” and that abortion “does not terminate the life of a separate, unique, living human being,” as the Missouri reading material insists.

Doe’s religious tenets also hold that her body is “inviolable and subject to her will alone” and that her health decisions must be based on the “best scientific understanding of the world,” the suit states.

“The state has essentially established a religious indoctrination program intended to push a single ideological viewpoint,” Satanic Temple spokesman Jex Blackmore said in a statement Monday. “The law is intended to punish women who disagree with this opinion.”

Missouri argued that the requirements were not “unduly restrictive on Doe’s asserted exercise of religion.”

A lower court ruled against the suit in 2016. But the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals determined unanimously last year that the case “raises real and substantial constitutional claims,” and transferred it to the Missouri Supreme Court. State Attorney General Josh Hawley said in a statement then that he would vigorously defend “Missouri’s sensible waiting period law from this challenge by the Satanic Temple in the Missouri Supreme Court.”

Arguments begin Tuesday.

In 2016, the Satanic Temple launched after-school programs as a counterpoint to conservative Christian lessons being taught after class at public schools.Frank Wuco, a White House senior adviser for the Department of Homeland Security, role-played as a fictional "jihadist" named Faud Wasul during his work as a security consultant. Wuco has a long history of making anti-Muslim remarks. Screenshot

A White House senior adviser at the Department of Homeland Security once said that “true” Muslims can’t peacefully “coexist” or “mingle with other faiths,” it was revealed in a report this week.

The strikingly Islamophobic remarks were made by Frank Wuco, a former radio host and veteran naval intelligence officer who frequently appeared as a pundit on far-right radio and TV shows before being appointed to the White House by President Donald Trump in 2017.

During an August 2010 appearance on “The Willie Lawson Show” on Blog Talk Radio, Wuco presented himself as an expert on “true” Islam, according to audio unearthed Monday by the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America.

“[There’s] a critical misunderstanding of the true nature of Islam, which was never intended to coexist, to complement, to mingle with other faiths,” Wuco said during that appearance. “It is clearly stated in the law, in the traditions, in the Quran, that Islam is here to abrogate all faiths that came before, was sent to abrogate and cleanse the corruption of the Jews and the Christians that are found in the previous scriptures.”

During a July 2012 appearance on a radio program called “Erskine Overnight,” also unearthed this week by Media Matters, Wuco can be heard arguing that “so many have bought in hook, line, and sinker into the Muslim propaganda, particularly generated by the Muslim Brotherhood, that this is a — yeah, it’s a religion that seeks cohabitation and tolerance and peace with non-Muslim faith groups and nationalities and it just simply is not true.”

“To say that Islam is willing to coexist peacefully with other religions and other sort of nationalities, if you can have such a thing in Islam, is really antithetical to what the Quran and what Sharia law teaches,” he added.

As a senior White House adviser, Wuco has a role in developing national security policy, and has been charged with helping enforce Trump’s constitutionally dubious Muslim ban. Wuco, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on this story.

In statements to HuffPost, Muslim scholars and civil rights groups roundly condemned Wuco’s remarks.

“First of all, we would need ask him whether he still believes bigoted and Islamophobic things about Muslims and Islam,” said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “My assumption is that he still believes these things. Anyone who believes that an entire faith or religious minority in America is incompatible with our society should not be serving anywhere in our government or be advising our government.”

John Esposito, a professor and founding director of Georgetown University’s Bridge Initiative, noted that Wuco’s remarks demonstrate “an ignorance of the faith and history.”

A majority of Muslims, he said, according to “findings of major polls conducted by Gallup, PEW and other polling organizations in Muslim-majority countries and in the US and Europe... reveal consistency in the values held by Muslims and mainstream followers of other religions.”

Scott Simpson, public advocacy director for the civil rights group Muslim Advocates, said Wuco “is the kind of bigoted, hostile, conspiracy-theory pushing official who is simply incapable of governing our diverse nation.”

“DHS is one of the key agencies implementing the Muslim ban and anyone who still doubts that anti-Muslim animus is a driving force behind the ban should take a look at Wuco’s record,” Simpson said.

The Trump administration, which last week marked its first anniversary, has been flush with anti-Muslim bigots. Former chief strategist Steve Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, former national security adviser Sebastian Gorka, White House aide Katharine Gorka, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, White House counsel Kellyanne Conway and former national security adviser Michael Flynn all have close ties to anti-Muslim organizations listed as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

These groups propagate debunked conspiracy theories about American Muslims plotting to take over the West and implement a distorted and brutal version of Sharia, or Islamic law. Last year, Media Matters released a report on Wuco’s history of parroting these theories.

In 2010, writing on the website of “Need To Know” ― a radio show hosted by Wuco that is now off the air ― Wuco insisted that Muslims around the world are “perfectly happy to subjugate and humiliate non-Muslim members of their societies.” Muslims who live in the West, he claimed, “will make every effort to establish independent rule for their enclaves under Sharia law, using violence to secure what they believe to be their divinely revealed right; the eventual subsuming of all that lies outside the dar al-Islam (House of Islam), until all is within it; until all is consumed by Islam in preparation for God’s final judgement of man.”

As recently as 2016, during an appearance on the radio show “The Dougherty Report,” Wuco falsely claimed that Sweden is being overrun with violent Muslims.

“The assertiveness of Muslim communities in Western nations is becoming so pronounced... you don’t even need ISIS in Sweden,” he said.

“You’ve got everyday run-of-the-mill Muslims in massive communities protesting and becoming violent with the Swedish government, saying that they’re going to take over the country,” he continued. “This isn’t even ISIS. These are just peace-loving Muslims who have been allowed to immigrate into these countries.”

Wuco also worked as a “security consultant” prior to his time in the White House, delivering bizarre lectures to the American military. Wuco, who is from Florida, frequently affected an Arabic accent during these lectures, role-playing as a fictional character named Fuad Wasul ― a “committed jihadist” who’d supposedly escaped from an American prison.

“If you think you’re winning this war, if you think that you’re defeating jihad, you’re wrong, dead wrong,” Wuco once told a group of civilian intelligence analysts at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida.

At various points during his career as a pundit, Wuco called for a mosque surveillance program, described a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. as a “great idea,” and said he would have dropped nuclear bombs on Iraq and Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks.

In July 2011, according to audio obtained by CNN’s KFile, Wuco ― like many other anti-Muslim bigots at the time ― speculated that a terror attack in Norway that had left 77 people dead was almost certainly the work of Muslims.

A short time later, however, the murderer was revealed to be Anders Breivik, a white supremacist enamored with American anti-Muslim extremists like Robert Spencer, Frank Gaffney and Brigitte Gabriel — all of whom, incidentally, have appeared as guests on radio shows hosted by Wuco.

In audio clips recently obtained by KFile, Wuco can be heard advancing other forms of bigotry: promoting the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born in another country, denouncing the supposed “Zimbabwe-ficiation” of America, and mocking the LGBTQ community.

Wuco, according to another Media Matters report, once claimed that “societies and nations for millennia have suffered greatly” for accepting LGBTQ people.Jordan Peele’s critically acclaimed horror film, “Get Out,” nabbed four Oscar nominations Tuesday, including best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best actor for Daniel Kaluuya.

In response to the news, Peele posted a GIF from the film that seemed to perfectly capture the way he felt.

But he didn’t stop there. He then made another clever reference to his movie.

[HuffPost]The nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause has filed a complaint with the Department of Justice and Federal Elections Commission, arguing that an alleged payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Donald Trump may have violated campaign finance laws.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump lawyer Michael Cohen arranged to pay Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 in 2016 to stay mum about an affair she allegedly had with Trump shortly after his son Barron was born. Clifford said she had an affair with Trump in a 2011 interview with In Touch magazine.

The Journal reported that Cohen created a private Delaware limited liability company, Essential Consultants, LLC, to pay Clifford. Cohen has denied the allegations.

The complaint, filed with the Justice Department and the FEC, says there’s “reason to believe” that the alleged payment to Clifford was an “unreported in-kind” campaign contribution, which would be a violation of campaign finance law.

Common Cause, which has called for a full investigation, says the alleged funds should be considered a campaign contribution and should have been reported because they were paid “for the purpose of influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential general election.”

Cohen dismissed the double complaint in an email to The Washington Post.

“The Common Cause complaint is baseless along with the allegation that President Trump filed a false report to the FEC,” he wrote.Jimmy Kimmel’s puppet version of Kellyanne Conway broke out an old bottle of Trump Vodka to celebrate her boss’s first year in office.

AdvertisementDAVOS — The snow has stopped, the sun has broken through, and the CEOs and heads of state have arrived. It’s the first official day of Davos, which is kicking off with a keynote by Indian Prime Minister Modi, who some would have you believe was practicing Trumpism before Trump was.

“We must accept that globalization is slowly losing its luster,” Modi said in his speech, blaming in part the United Nations for failing to effect real change. Sound familiar?

Even so, the mood at Davos this year is decidedly upbeat, actually the best in memory at least according to one long-time attendee. And that may not be such a good thing. “That must mean it’s all going to crash,” joked Larry Fink, after I relayed that optimistic observation upon bumping into him on the ground floor of the Congress Center. When I mentioned the mood to Jes Staley, Barclays CEO, he nodded and noted that last year the talk here was all about income inequality. This year, not so much, suggesting that the streaking stock market has unfortunately made this group at least forget about that gap.

As you can tell, the power swirl here has begun in earnest here, particularly in the elite Strategic Partner’s lounge, where most attendees are not allowed unless they have an appointment. Companies pay big bucks for their executives to hang out there. (It is perhaps ironic that Davos, which preaches global egalitarianism is so hierarchal. Here was Ray Dalio picking at a plate of salmon, there’s Larry Fink badging in, meanwhile across the way, CEOs of two of the biggest banks on the planet are deep in conversation.

It turns out that many CEOs came in last night from France, where President Macron hosted what is called French Davos, a one-day event held at Versailles (which is conveniently closed on Mondays) to discuss world events and hear about the French economy. In attendance was Jamie Dimon, a jet-lagged Lloyd Blankfein and UPS CEO David Abney, among others.

I also ran into all manner of media types this morning including Ben Smith of Buzzfeed, Marty Baron of the Washington Post and Ed Felsenthal of Time, and I picked their brains about Rupert Murdoch’s Facebook mini-manifesto, where he blasted the social network for not paying publishers. Reactions ranged from, ’he’s right and was all along,” to “I’m not shedding any tears for Rupert,” to “none of us are getting paid.”

And yes, there is much talk of Donald Trump. One top Internet executive said to me that Trump’s speech would be a direct response to Xi Jinping’s speech here a year ago, where the Chinese president asserted that with the United States in retreat, China was ready to assume the mantle as the world leader. And, this exec continued, he expected Trump to escalate his tough on China talk after this speech, which of course follows the administration’s announcement of tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines.

And then there’s the somewhat curious timing of Trump’s speech here, Friday afternoon at 2pm local time, when usually most attendees have departed. Former House Majority Leader and now Moelis & Co banker Eric Cantor has a theory. “I think it was the only slot they had. You’ve got Modi today, Theresa May, Merkel and Macron. What are you going to do, boot out one of them? Friday was what was available.” Anyway, Cantor points out, the speech isn’t so important for the audience here, it’s all about the TV audience and clips from the speech.

For the rest of the week the outlook remains sunny—both inside and outside the Congress Center—that is until Friday when once again snow is expected. And Trump speaks.

@jazquevedoo I aspire to this level of pettiness #queen — B (@BazMariana) January 22, 2018Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating contributions to Donald Trump’s massive inauguration fund from donors with ties to foreign countries, sources have told ABC News.

Trump amassed a record $107 million in contributions to his inaugural committee. Previous presidents had kept donations low in an effort to avoid the appearance of selling presidential access — or favors.

As much as $45 million to the committee came from companies, some of which have served to shield the identities of the individual donors behind them. Following an investigation last year by HuffPost, the committee also admitted that it had made numerous errors in a list of donors it filed with the Federal Election Commission.

Mueller’s team has talked to witnesses about millions of dollars in contributions from donors to the inaugural committee with links to Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, ABC reported, based on information from a source who has been present at recent interviews. Donations from some of those individual donors surpassed $1 million each, ABC said.

One of those questioned was California billionaire real estate investor Thomas Barrack, a longtime friend of Trump who was in charge of fundraising for the inaugural committee. Barrack has substantial private equity holdings in the Middle East.

One donor being scrutinized by Mueller’s team is American Andrew Intrater, who is both a business associate and relative of Russian multibillionaire Viktor Vekselberg, who owns the Russian global conglomerate Renova Group. That company was sanctioned in April by the U.S. Treasury Department to punish Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential election and other suspected “malign activity.”

Vekselberg, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is an investor in New York investment company Columbus Nova. Renova recently listed Columbus Nova as a subsidiary, and it was identified as such in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Renova Group website

Intrater, the CEO of Columbus Nova, donated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration committee, according to FEC filings.

Columbus Nova also reportedly paid Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen $500,000 for consultant fees after Trump’s election. The company has acknowledged the payments to Cohen regarding information concerning “potential sources of capital and ... investments in real estate and other ventures.” But the company statement denied that Vekselberg had anything to do with the money.Ji Sub Jeong/HuffPost

In the year since Donald Trump became president, Democrats have had a string of successes at the ballot box ― making many Republicans nervous about a potential blue wave in November.

Over the past year, Democrats have picked up 34 state legislative seats that were previously held by Republicans. They have also won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama and the governor’s mansion in New Jersey.

Republicans, meanwhile, have turned just four state legislative seats from blue to red.

Ji Sub Jeong/HuffPost; Icons:Getty Images

The most recent Democratic win was in Wisconsin’s state Senate district 10. Democrat Patty Schachtner defeated her opponent there by 11 percentage points, taking a seat Republicans had held since 2001. The district was solidly red: Trump won by 17 percentage points in 2016, and Republican Mitt Romney won there in 2012. The Republican incumbent state senator won her re-election race in 2016 by 26 points.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) called the results a “wake up call” for his party, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Republicans certainly needed to “pay attention” to the results.

One of the most high-profile contests was in Alabama, where Democrat Doug Jones won the U.S. Senate seat in a special election. Republicans were widely expected to hold on to that position when Jeff Sessions stepped down to become Trump’s attorney general, but they ended up suffering when Roy Moore ― who was eventually accused of pursuing teenage girls when he was an adult ― won the GOP nomination.

Democrats say all these wins are good news for 2018. It shows the base is excited, the party has its act together and the electorate is frustrated with Trump and the GOP.

“If 2017 was bad news for Republicans facing voters this fall, 2018 is shaping up to be worse,” said Carolyn Fiddler, the political editor for the liberal site DailyKos. “This special election is a red alert for the GOP at every level of the ballot, even those running in gerrymandered districts and drastically outspending their Democratic challengers. The reckoning is here, and no Republican is safe.”

DailyKos has a full list here of all the flipped seats, both the Democratic and Republican ones.

Democrats have been learning some lessons along the way about how to harness the enthusiasm from the base that erupted after Trump’s election.

The party thought the special election in Georgia’s 6th congressional district ― a wealthy suburban district that’s not hardcore Trump territory ― was winnable in June. The Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, received tons of national help and attention, which ultimately may have backfired as Republicans were able to easily tie him to the national party.

In Alabama, the Democratic Party followed a different script. To be fair, Moore was about as flawed a candidate as they could face. But Democrats also learned from the Georgia race and were much quieter about their involvement in the Senate special election, working behind the scenes.

The Republican State Leadership Committee, which is in charge of electing Republicans at the state level, said that Democrats still have a long way to go in catching up to them. Republicans currently have majorities in 67 of the 99 state legislatures. And the group’s president, Matt Walter, noted that despite the Democrats’ win in Wisconsin’s 10th state senate district, the GOP still controls the majority in the state Senate.

“Democrats want to make winning one out of four [recent] contested special elections ... sound like a tidal wave, when it was just a ripple,” said Walter. “What the Democrats fail to mention is that the win in Wisconsin Assembly District 58 ... keeps the majority in that chamber at a historic high, as well as maintains the historic highs around the nation for the GOP, with Republicans flipping nearly 1000 seats in the past decade.”

Two of the races that flipped from blue to red, the RSLC noted, were in the Democratic states of Massachusetts and New Jersey ― in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. (Although on the flip side, Democrats also won in plenty of districts that Trump won too.)Transgender actress Daniela Vega starred in Chile's Oscar-nominated film "A Fantastic Woman."

The Oscars may not be so white anymore, but they’re certainly not diverse.

The film industry has been forced to re-evaluate itself since April Reign first tweeted out #OscarsSoWhite in 2015, and we’ve begun to see more black actors be recognized at major awards ceremonies. But the Oscars So White movement was never meant to be black and white.

Sadly, those figures all remained the same when the 2018 Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday. The Academy recognized Latino stories, but our actors remained forgotten.

Pixar’s “Coco,” set in Mexico, received nods in the Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song categories; Guillermo del Toro was recognized for directing and writing the aquatic love story “The Shape of Water” (which overall earned an impressive 13 nominations); and Chile’s “A Fantastic Woman,” about a transgender woman dealing with discrimination after the death of her boyfriend, picked up a nod in the Best Foreign Language Film category. A nomination for Best Animated Feature also went to “Ferdinand,” a film that was set in Spain but had Brazilian director Carlos Saldanha at the helm and cast many Latinos in voice-acting roles.

All four acting categories, however, failed to include Latinos ― even with the buzz around Salma Hayek’s nuanced role in “Beatriz at Dinner” and Daniela Vega’s lead role in “A Fantastic Woman.” Vega also could have been the first openly transgender performer recognized by the Academy.

Sure, “Coco” has been repeatedly lauded for championing Latino representation with its authentic portrayal of the Day of the Dead holiday and its largely all-Latino voice cast. But true on-screen representation is not achieved if Latino recognition doesn’t go beyond animated characters.

A scene from the movie "Coco." Disney/Pixar

The Academy isn’t solely to blame. The issue is far more insidious within Hollywood, as studio executives and talent agency rosters remain largely white. After all, Latino talent can’t be recognized if Latinos aren’t being cast in lead roles or if real-life Latino characters continue to be whitewashed and not portrayed by people of color (we’re looking at you, Catherine Zeta-Jones).

There’s a particular lack of Latino speaking roles. Only 3.1 percent of speaking characters were Latino in 2016′s top 100 films, according to a report by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

Yet Latinos are the film industry’s most profitable demographic, buying 21 percent of movie tickets sold in 2016, according to the Motion Picture Association of America’s Theatrical Market Statistics.

Actress Gina Rodriguez rightfully brought this up Sunday while on the red carpet for the SAG Awards.

“I mean, we do make [up] 55 million plus in the country — no big deal — you should throw us in a movie or two, it would make sense,” Rodriguez said, looking straight into the camera. “We do buy 1 in every 4 tickets every single weekend and make sure that your movies do well. So it would do you a service. And not only service, it would be — I don’t know — integrity.”

The “Jane the Virgin” star also tweeted on Tuesday about the importance of Latino actors being given on-screen opportunities.

The farm epic about race in the Deep South in the aftermath of World War II is Netflix’s first narrative original to be nominated for an Oscar. “Beasts of No Nation,” the company’s film from two years ago, had a successful festival run but was completely shut out of the Academy Awards.

Rachel Morrison’s nomination as the first female cinematographer in the category comes after 651 nominations since 1929.

Fans on Twitter were extremely excited about the nomination:

The “Stranger Things” star asked fans to help in his quest to dance with penguins, and they totally came through.

It’s likely as a result of good karma for the actor, who plays police chief Jim Hopper in the Netflix sci-fi series. In the last month alone, he’s joined a high school student for her senior photographs and promised to officiate at a wedding. Both emanated from cheeky Twitter requests.

Harbour’s possibly tongue-in-cheek mission to “tell emperor penguin couples I think they have terrific parenting ideologies” and “perhaps hone the Hopper dance with the males” began with a tweet to Greenpeace on Sunday:

Hey @Greenpeace , how many retweets to send me someplace to tell emperor penguin couples I think they have terrific parenting ideologies? Perhaps hone the Hopper dance with the males... — David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) January 21, 2018

The environmental organization replied that if Hopper garnered more than 200,000 retweets, it would “ask the Captain if you can join our expedition to the Antarctic.”

Hmm, if you get over 200k we’ll ask the Captain if you can join our expedition to the Antarctic and dance with the penguins. #StrangerThings have happened https://t.co/qT78aIcKOw pic.twitter.com/LmmLceE17J — Greenpeace (@Greenpeace) January 22, 2018
