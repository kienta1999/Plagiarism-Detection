A woman is suing media mogul Russell Simmons for $5 million while accusing him of raping her in his California home ― an incident that the plaintiff’s attorney says occurred after a separate sexual assault in his New York City home years earlier.

Beverly Hills celebrity attorney Perry Wander filed the lawsuit on behalf of Jennifer Jarosik on Wednesday. Recounting the most recent and serious rape allegation, Jarosik, a 37-year-old aspiring filmmaker, claims that the 60-year-old Def Jam co-founder physically forced himself on her at his Los Angeles home in 2016 after she refused to have sex.

The pair, according to the lawsuit, agreed to meet at Simmons’ home to discuss a film Jarosik was working on. It was one that Jarosik claims Simmons had allegedly agreed to co-produce and finance.

During that 2016 visit, approximately 10 years after they first met, her lawsuit claims that Simmons “got aggressive” after she rejected his advances and pushed her onto his bed. Simmons then knocked her off the bed as she was attempting to distance herself from him, causing her to hit her head, the suit states.

While still in “shock and fear,” Jarosik claims Simmons “pounced on her” and “proceeded to rape her.”

Jarosik decided to speak out against Simmons, her lawsuit states, after hearing other women accuse the music producer of sexual assault.

Wander told HuffPost on Thursday that Jarosik has also claimed that Simmons sexually assaulted her in his New York City home in 2011, five years before the alleged assault in Los Angeles.

“Since it was outside the statue of limitations for a civil claim it wasn’t included in the filed lawsuit,” Wander added.

The statute of limitations for assault in New York is one year from the act for a civil complaint or two to five years for a criminal complaint.

Wander said Jarosik does plan to report both incidents to police in Los Angeles and New York City, where authorities have already launched an investigation into allegations against Simmons, The Los Angeles Times reported.

“If [Simmons] really looks forward to a trial in this case he will have to confront ALL his accusers in court, unless he is in prison by then,” Wander said in a statement. “He needs to make restitution. The only way to obtain justice in this case is for Mr. Simmons to make restitution to my client.”

At least 13 women have accused Simmons of sexual misconduct in recent months. Six of the accusers, including Jarosik, have said that Simmons raped them.

Simmons has denied all of the allegations against him.

“All of my relations have been consensual” Simmons said in a Thursday statement. He vowed to “relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.”

“I look forward to having my day in court – where, unlike the court of public opinion, I will have the ability to make use of fair processes that ensure that justice will be done and that the full truth will be known,” he added.Don’t expect to see Casey Affleck come Oscar Sunday.

The “Manchester By The Sea” actor is reportedly breaking with tradition and skipping the 90th annual Academy Awards in March, according to Deadline. As the previous year’s winner for Best Actor, he was set to present the award for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony.

A representative for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed to Variety that he would be absent from the awards show. Affleck’s representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Affleck apparently did not “want to become a distraction from the focus that should be on the performances of the actresses in the category,” in light of the 2010 sexual harassment allegations made against him, Deadline reported.

Two women who worked on the hoax Joaquin Phoenix documentary, “I’m Still Here,” which Affleck directed, accused him of verbally and physically harassing them during filming. The actor has since denied all the allegations and later settled both suits for undisclosed amounts with both women signing nondisclosure agreements.

The awards show, which will see Jimmy Kimmel return as host, will likely tackle Hollywood’s recent reckoning with sexual assault and misconduct. Many of the actors and actresses nominated have pledged their support to the Time’s Up initiative, which seeks to eliminate predatory behavior across all industries through gender and racial parity.

This isn’t the first time the Oscars will have alternatives to previous winners handing out trophies. In 2009, the Academy tapped multiple presenters to introduce the acting awards with each making a short speech on the nominee’s behalf.An event planner appointed by President Donald Trump to a key position at the Department of Housing and Urban Development has apologized after insulting a journalist on Wednesday.

Lynne Patton, who oversees billions of dollars in federal funds as head of the agency’s New York and New Jersey office, had called April Ryan “Miss Piggy.”

Ryan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks.

Patton deleted the tweet, but screenshots persist:

A now deleted tweet from head of @HUDgov New York & New Jersey @LynnePatton pic.twitter.com/Z2fx2O5PWo — Jacqueline Alemany (@JaxAlemany) January 25, 2018

Patton later apologized, writing:

“I deleted my last tweet by choice. No one from this Administration contacted me. It was beneath me & I apologize to @AprilDRyan. My parents raised me to respect others & I regret my response. I apologize to them, @SecretaryCarson & the Trump family. They deserved better.”

However, some of Patton’s other other tweets directed at Ryan remain online, including two calling her a “a blogger working for a bankrupt outlet.”

Ryan fired back:

Fake info girl! Check your facts. I work for American Urban Radio Networks not Sheridan! Whose wedding are you planning now and what wig company do you work for? https://t.co/YtfF4QHzy5 — AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) January 24, 2018

Patton’s apology wasn’t enough for some people on social media who are now calling on her to resign, with many saying she shouldn’t have been appointed to her position in the first place given her lack of qualifications.

The New York Times noted last year that Patton had organized golf tournaments and other events for the Trump family, including Eric Trump’s wedding.

Here is some of the reaction:

Despicable. You should not be working in the US government. — Gabe #DreamActNow Ortíz (@TUSK81) January 25, 2018As “difficult” as some video games may be, there’s still at least some sense that eventually good (i.e., you) will prevail.

The free iOS app “Trap Adventure 2,” on the other hand, is not about happy endings. It is a cold reflection of the real world. Not only is death inevitable, but it feels at times like the world is actively trying to kill you. Because it really is.

As a player, the structures around you take on a life of their own as they antagonize, and ultimately play accomplices to, your demise. Over and over and over again.

“Trap Adventure 2” is the follow up to 2013′s “Trap Adventure,” which was also touted as the “hardest retro game.” These “Super Mario” clones were not by some lord of the underworld, as you’d assume, but by developer Hiroyoshi Oshiba.

In fact, Oshiba warns App Store visitors that this game will test every last bit of one’s mettle.

Caution!! This may be the most hardest, irritating, frustrating game EVER. If you tend to exasperate often, I recommend you not play this game. It will literally drive you insane. I PROMISE. As written above, this game is VERY STRESSFUL. You may get so irritated and frustrated that you throw your phone out the window. I can’t take any responsibilities for the displeasure this game may cause. Even after reading this you are still eager to play the game, then go ahead.

All that being said, watching players’ deaths unfold is actually entertaining, specifically when you’re watching someone else play.She’s back!

CBS has ordered 13 episodes of a “Murphy Brown” reboot.

In a story first reported by Deadline.com, both series star Candice Bergen and series creator Diane English will be involved in the revival of the popular sitcom, which debuted in 1988 and ran for 10 seasons until 1998.

Bergen won five Emmys for playing the tough-as-nails cable news journalist. No air date has been set, but there are talks to bring back other original cast members as well.

The show’s highest profile came during the 1992 election when then-Vice President Dan Quayle criticized Bergen’s fictional character by saying the show mocked “the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice.”

The original series often commented about current events, which has made many of the 247 original episodes seem dated over the years.

Still, the Hollywood Reporter noted the modern world of “cable news, social media, fake news and a very different political and cultural climate” should provide plenty of material for the reboot.

“Murphy Brown” is the latest 1990s show to be brought back by the major networks.President Donald Trump praised his late mother as “incredible” in a Mother’s Day video on Sunday but made no mention of his wife, Melania, who’s the mother of his youngest son.

Nor did he mention his two ex-wives, with whom he had four other children, in a message posted to Twitter.

Trump recognized the holiday as “one of the most important days of the year,” calling it “a special opportunity to honor all of the mothers and grandmothers in our lives.”

“She was just incredible,” he said of his late mother, Mary MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland. “Warm, loving, really smart, could be tough if she had to be, but basically she was a really nice person.

“So much of what I’ve done and so much of what I’ve become is because of my mother. I miss her a lot,” he said.

First lady Melania Trump has made motherhood her primary role in the White House. Along with caring for the couple’s 12-year-old son, Barron, she is focusing on children through her “Be Best” campaign.

Last week, she reflected on the enormous amount of work that goes into being a mom at an event for military mothers at the White House.

“It takes an incredible amount of strength, a lot of time, a generous amount of patience, and all of our love,” she said. “As moms, we are so incredibly privileged to be able to bring children into this world and be a part of helping them grow into adults.”

Vice President Mike Pence posted a Mother’s Day tribute on Sunday that saluted the ladies in his life ― his mother, Nancy Fritsch, and his wife, Karen, who he boasted is “the best mom 3 kids could ever have!”

Happy Mother’s Day!WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have repeatedly said they oppose selling off federal lands.

“I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,” Trump told Field & Stream magazine in January 2016. He re-emphasized this in a subsequent interview with the Outdoor Sportsman Group: “We’re not looking to sell off land.”

It was over this very issue that Zinke — a former Montana congressman — resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016. And in a speech one day after arriving at his new post, Zinke promised Interior staffers: “You can hear it from my lips. We will not sell or transfer public land.”

But a leaked White House infrastructure plan has many conservation groups concerned that Trump and Zinke could soon be singing a different tune: that of the Republican Party, whose platform calls for transferring control of federal lands to states.

The draft plan, which Politico and Axios obtained this week, includes this line: “Disposition of Federal Real Property: would establish through executive order the authority to allow for the disposal of Federal assets to improve the overall allocation of economic resources in infrastructure investment.”

To be clear, the document is a draft plan — one Paul Teller, a special assistant to the president for legislative affairs, told Politico this week does not reflect the final proposal. Nonetheless, it is easy to see how one might read “disposal” to mean that the government will look to sell off, trade or transfer federal assets, including land, to help pay for crumbling bridges and highways.

White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to say whether this “disposal” would include federal lands. “We are not going to comment on the contents of a leaked document but look forward to presenting our plan in the near future,” she wrote in an email to HuffPost.

Politico reported Wednesday that Trump could release his long-anticipated infrastructure plan in as little as two weeks. If it takes aim at public land, Zinke will almost certainly face the brunt of public outrage. After all, it was Zinke who said last month, “No one loves public land more than I. You can love it as much, but you can’t love it any more.”

Fearing a looming about-face, conservation groups sent a shot across the administration’s bow this week.

“It raises suspicions from everybody that cares about public lands,” Brad Brooks, public lands campaign director at The Wilderness Society, told HuffPost. “And if they are proposing to sell off public lands, the American public is not going to stand for D.C. politicians trying to steal our land.”

Brooks added that Zinke needs to explain — one way or another — what’s going on. To his knowledge, there is no precedent for public land being disposed of via executive order.

Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement that the draft infrastructure plan is the latest example of Zinke saying one thing and doing another.

“This plan calls for the disposal of federal lands, it’s right there in black and white,” she said. “The secretary owes the American public an honest answer: Will he continue to be complicit in President Trump’s attempts to sell off our public lands?”

Whit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, told HuffPost that he too is looking for clarification about what the White House means, but said “it smells like selling off public [lands].”

The move provoked outrage from conservationists, hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts, who labeled Chaffetz an “anti-public lands congressman.” Chaffetz ultimately pulled the bill, citing concerns from his constituents.

“I hear you,” he wrote in an Instagram post that included a photo of him dressed in hunting camouflage, and promised to kill the bill.

A post shared by Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) on Feb 1, 2017 at 9:06pm PST

Public lands advocates celebrated Chaffetz’s move as a major victory — and vowed to stand firmly against anyone who threatens their national heritage.

Zinke continues to paint himself a champion of public lands and “a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.” But the conservation and outdoor sporting groups that once supported his nomination have largely walked away, as the interior secretary has led the administration’s effort to gut national monuments and prioritized energy development over conservation.

The Interior Department did not respond a request for comment on the language in the draft infrastructure plan.

But in an interview Thursday with conservative radio commentator Josh Tolley, Zinke re-emphasized his commitment to maintaining federal control of public land.

“We’re not transferring or selling public land,” he said. “What we’re doing is we’re working with the states to open up recreation opportunities. We don’t want to be in an adversarial role. And that’s been the tension out west, is that the local voice, communities, have been ignored. And that’s not right.”Multiple top editors at the New York Daily News have come under investigation this week following allegations of sexual harassment. EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images

Alexander “Doc” Jones, the managing editor of the Sunday paper at the New York Daily News, is under investigation for alleged workplace harassment, HuffPost has confirmed. This is the second investigation into a top editor at the newspaper to come to light this week.

Earlier this week, three former and current employees told HuffPost that Jones displayed a “pattern” of inappropriate behavior toward young women in the newsroom. At least some of the complaints lodged against him were sexual in nature, HuffPost has learned.

Jones stands accused of inappropriate conduct both in and out of the office that includes forcible kissing and other allegations involving him and employees, a former staffer confirmed.

“He would approach women in a way that was not really appropriate,” a fourth former Daily News employee told HuffPost earlier this week.

A spokesperson for Tronc, the newspaper’s parent company, said Thursday, “I can confirm he is still employed.” But two sources close to the situation told HuffPost that Jones was escorted out of the office on Thursday.

He and the New York Daily News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Jones has worked at the company since at least 2000, according to his LinkedIn page, where he lists himself as Managing Editor/Sunday. The page says he previously held the positions of Executive News Editor and Night News Editor.Shirley Chisholm announces her entry for Democratic nomination for the presidency on Jan. 25, 1972.

After one of the most contentious Senate races in recent memory, Democrat Doug Jones defeated opponent Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by nine women, in Alabama’s special election in December. Black women were the ones to make it happen.

They out-voted all other demographics that day, with 98 percent of black women casting a vote for Jones. In contrast, 63 percent of white women who voted did so for Moore.

“America got one more confirmation that Black women are superheroes who save the day time and time again,” wrote Luvvie Ajayi, author of I’m Judging You: The Do-Better Manual on her blog after the election. “I am tired of the world being run into the ground by white men who prove time and time again that they are ill-equipped.”

Ajayi was inspired to find a list of black women politicians she could support. Not finding any, she enlisted the help of three friends to create Black Women in Politics, a living document of black female candidates seeking election in 2018. It’s now an online database that includes more than 400 names.

To start, Ajayi, along with friends Sili Recio, Lucrecer Braxton and Candace Jones, searched through Twitter mentions, polls and did some old-fashioned googling, gathering more than 100 names of women seeking election in 2018.

The list doubled in under a month, and its creators enlisted the help of a coder to help them turn it into a searchable database. They ultimately moved the database from Ajayi’s personal website to its own domain.

Black women vote in higher numbers than any other demographic, yet are underrepresented in political positions of power.

The site’s mission statement explains why the database is so crucial.

“There are Black women running for political office all over the United States, and we need to know who they are,” it reads. “It is abundantly clear that we need to start following the lead of Black women, because we show up and do what is important, even when we are being disenfranchised and sabotaged from doing the work.”

As of Jan. 25, the database has 414 entries. Visitors can filter the candidates by searching for women running for federal seats, state seats and local seats. They can also choose to view candidates running specifically in blue or red states. There’s a section detailing which candidates are incumbents and which are challengers, as well as a page where where users can suggest more politicians to be added.

The database includes a disclaimer noting it is not an endorsement of every woman running.

“Think about it as a phone book,” the site states.

With midterm elections happening this November, it’s especially important for information on black female candidates to be easily accessible for those seeking to support them, Ayaji wrote on her blog.

She added that the database is just the first step. People should use the information provided in the list as a starting point for supporting these candidates.I went to see the new Jumanji.

Otherwise it was quite goodWhite House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Republican staffers that Trump would accept permanent legal status for current DACA recipients and Dreamers who are eligible for the program but don’t currently hold those protections. NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is open to granting a path to citizenship to roughly 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children as part of immigration talks, a top White House aide reportedly told Republican staffers on Thursday.

It was the most detail the White House has given on Trump’s goals for legal status for so-called Dreamers, nearly 700,000 of whom are currently at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief after he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

But although Trump is willing to help those Dreamers and some others who don’t already have DACA protections, the White House has indicated it will only do so at a price — and his demands for steep border security increases and a dramatic reshaping of the legal immigration system could end up being poison pills that kill the chances of a deal.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Republican staffers that Trump would accept permanent legal status for current DACA recipients and Dreamers who are eligible for the program but don’t currently hold those protections, an estimated 1.8 million people, according to reports from NBC News and The Daily Beast. Miller described the plan as offering “extremely generous provisions” and “dramatic concessions” to Democrats, according to The Daily Beast.

But in exchange for helping some undocumented young people, Trump wants to enact policies that would affect countless more individuals, including immigrants in the U.S., people seeking to come here and even Americans who want to sponsor certain family members. Democrats would get one win — help for Dreamers — in Trump’s proposed framework; immigration hardliners like Trump would get a slew of them.

“They think that by offering up a spoonful of sugar — relief for Dreamers — they can get Congress and the American people to swallow the bitter medicine of radical nativism,” Frank Sharry, who leads the pro-immigration reform group America’s Voice, said in a statement. “We are going to fight this tooth and nail. We are not going to stand by while Trump and Miller take Dreamers hostage in order to keep out and kick out millions.”

Trump will request $25 billion for border security measures, including a wall in some areas, according to reports. (During the campaign, Trump said that Mexico would pay for the wall.) He is also seeking an end to the diversity visa lottery system, which allows individuals from countries with low immigration levels to come to the U.S. ― such as those in Africa that the president reportedly called ”shithole countries″ in a meeting with senators.

The plan will also call for ending what Trump and his allies refer to derisively as “chain migration” ― the process by which Americans and legal permanent residents can sponsor their family members to legally immigrate to the U.S. The White House will propose restricting family-based immigration to spouses and minor children, excluding adult children, siblings and other relatives, according to reports.

Trump also wants the government to close “loopholes” in the immigration system to make it easier to deport people — likely including children and people seeking asylum, given past comments by officials — and detain immigrants for longer periods, according to Axios.

Democrats have said they are willing to make certain compromises as part of a Dreamer deal, but that dramatically reshaping the entire immigration system is both too much to ask and something that could easily cause a deal to fall apart under its own weight. Dreamer activists themselves have called for a deal that helps them without hurting other immigrants. The idea of severely restricting legal immigration — a cornerstone of the U.S. — isn’t backed by all Republicans, either.

Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), one of the leaders on immigration policy among House Democrats, said the offer didn’t pass the smell test.

“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards Latin America,” he tweeted. “Both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective and both would express Trump’s deeply held suspicion of Latinos.”

The White House plans to unveil its immigration policy proposals on Monday. A spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports.

Last week, the federal government partially shut down after Senate Democrats refused to vote for a funding bill that didn’t include protections for Dreamers. They agreed to reopen the government on Monday after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he’d allow a vote on an immigration bill in February.

Trump’s support for an immigration measure is crucial, and not just because he’s the one who would ultimately have to sign the bill. Trump is probably the only person in politics who could convince conservative House Republicans to go along with legislation granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, said Michael Steel, who worked as a spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber are happy with the sentence of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who will spend the rest of his life behind bars for molesting children.

All three have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them under the guise of medical treatment, along with over 150 other women who share the same allegations. On Wednesday afternoon ― after a weeklong sentencing hearing where 169 survivors and family members read impact statements ― Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.

In statements posted to Twitter, the three Olympians shared how grateful they are to the other survivors who spoke out against Nassar.

“Thank you fellow survivors for you courage, strength, and leadership, you have all had an overwhelming impact on me and I am proud to stand with you all ― today, tomorrow, and every day that follows,” Raisman wrote on Wednesday night.

Along with thanking her fellow survivors, Raisman thanked her family and friends, the larger gymnastics community, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina and the prosecutors and law enforcement that worked so tirelessly to get this case heard.

“As we continue to process our pain and suffering, it is my hope that in some way, sharing our impact statements is part of our healing process,” Raisman wrote.

Biles thanked both Aquilina and the other women who read impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing hearing.

“THANK YOU, YOU ARE MY HERO,” Biles wrote to Aquilina and added to her fellow survivors: “He will no longer have the power to steal our happiness or joy. I stand with every one of you.”

Wieber quoted a poem from Nikita Gill, adding: “Thank you to Judge Aquilina. Thank you to EVERY SINGLE person that came forward and shared their story, both in and out of the courtroom.”

To Judge Aquilina : THANK YOU, YOU ARE MY HERO

In person. On television. Ever.

The defensive tackle, who will get a chance to play in the Super Bowl on Feb. 4 against the New England Patriots, excited reporters’ curiosity when asked about his memories of the big game at a press conference.

“Nah, man. You know, I don’t really watch football,” he answered during a surprising exchange covered by several outlets. “Ya’ll know that.”

“Not even the Super Bowl?” the reporter asked.

“Nah, I don’t watch sports. You know that.”

Another journalist, just to clarify, chimed in, “Not any of them?”

And Cox stuck to his guns, saying “No, I don’t watch sports.”

A similar exchange can be seen in a short clip posted on Twitter by SB Nation:

Freezing Cold Takes noticed the same thing, plus a comment about the 2012 game.Conan O’Brien did not receive the warmest of welcomes during his recent trip to Haiti.

Angry locals berated the late-night talk show host and his camera crew while they were filming for the upcoming “Conan Without Borders” episode in the Caribbean country’s capital of Port-au-Prince.

“We’re being told through our interpreter that when Americans come here they only shoot the bad things, which obviously is not what we want to,” said O’Brien, in a preview clip shared online late Wednesday. O’Brien decided to visit Haiti after President Donald Trump reportedly called the country a “shithole.”

O’Brien explained to locals via a translator that the “reason I have come to Haiti is because I and a lot of Americans are angry at what President Trump said, so I wanted to come here and show positive, great beautiful things about Haiti.”

But one woman was not having it:

“Make sure Trump knows that you guys are the ones who have bullied us, and have caused us to be in the state that we’re in,” she added.

All was not lost. O’Brien ended up charming his audience with a speech in Creole ― and then further bonded with locals, and the woman, with a Trump-themed joke.President Donald Trump on Wednesday indicated his willingness to create a path to citizenship for the 700,000 young people he put at risk of deportation after ending Obama-era protections.

“We’re going to morph into it. It’s going to happen, at some point in the future, over a period of 10 to 12 years,” he told reporters, speaking about so-called Dreamers, the recipients of protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

“I think it’s a nice thing to have the incentive of after a period of years being able to become a citizen,” he said.

Trump also told reporters he wants $25 billion in funding for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and an additional $5 billion for other security measures.

“If you don’t have a wall, you don’t have DACA,” Trump said.

Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, have been living in limbo ever since Trump announced in September that he would suspend DACA. Facing harsh pushback from Democrats in Congress, Trump agreed to give lawmakers six months until March 5 to codify DACA in legislation, after which the majority of Dreamers would start to lose their protected status and be at risk of deportation.

Legislative negotiations intensified ahead of last week’s government shutdown, and Democrats ultimately agreed Monday to reopen the government without coming to an agreement with Republicans on the fate of DACA’s funding. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said over the weekend that it was his intent to let the Senate bring an immigration bill to the floor next month if a deal on DACA isn’t included in a bill to continue funding the government past Feb. 8.

The White House on Wednesday said it would release an immigration framework proposal next Monday of what the president wants to see in any immigration legislation.

“This framework will fulfill the four agreed-upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes; ending extended-family chain migration; cancelling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on DACA,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.

Sanders declined to answer questions as to whether that framework would include protections for DACA recipients, as Trump appeared to indicate.

“Well, if I told you now, it would kind of take away the fun for Monday,” she told a reporter who had asked for clarity during Wednesday’s press briefing.The latest episode of “This Is Us” was so powerful that it even prompted Crock-Pot to start tweeting. (Warning: Spoilers ahead.)

The slow-cooker manufacturer created a brand-new Twitter account, @CrockPotCares, on Wednesday after an episode of the hit NBC drama shocked fans.

thanks to @NBCThisisUs for crushing my soul week after week. additionally, i'll no longer be making #crockpot chili after last night's episode. — Kayla N. (@kayNiedz) January 24, 2018

We’re 💔 over last night’s episode, too! Kayla, we’re innocent until proven guilty. Since the '70s we've been providing families with quality & safe products, ask your parents if you don’t believe us.

After a night in watching the Super Bowl, America’s favorite TV dad Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) goes to clean up the kitchen and turn off the family’s old slow cooker — a hand-me-down appliance from a neighbor who warned that the switch was a little tricky. So even though Jack turned it off, the slow cooker turned back on, starting the house fire that will likely kill Jack.

In response, fans began eying the kitchen appliance with distrust, with some vowing never to touch their slow cookers ever again.

The Pearsons’ slow cooker brand was never named, but since Crock-Pot is currently the No. 1 brand for slow cookers, they took a lot of heat.

“This Is Us” creator Dan Fogelman probably felt a little guilty about the mass hysteria, because he tried to reassure fans, too.

“Taking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch? Let’s not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together,” Fogelman tweeted.

Crock-Pot confirmed that their new Twitter account is indeed real. The brand spent some time the day after the episode aired in an attempt to reassure Twitter users of the safety of their product.

“Our hope is that the team at NBC’s ‘This Is Us’ will help us spread factual information regarding our product’s safety,” a spokeswoman for Crock-Pot told HuffPost in a statement. “While we know their primary mission is to entertain — something they have continued to excel in — we also feel they have a responsibility to inform.”

Again, the Pearsons’ slow cooker was a gift they received when they first moved into their home in the ’70s, and it was pretty old by that time.

Current Crock-Pot products are low wattage with self-regulating heating elements, the brand told HuffPost in a statement. Their appliance switches are subjected to some heavy testing, including a “Rotary Knob Endurance test, Rotary Knob Force Test and Flame Burning Test and constructed of self-extinguishing, flame resistant material.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he has asked the Commerce Department to help Chinese technology company ZTE Corp “get back into business, fast,” a concession to Beijing ahead of high-stakes trade talks that will take place this week.

ZTE, one of the world’s largest telecom equipment makers, suspended its main operations after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American supplies to its business for seven years.

Trump’s offer to help comes as Chinese and U.S. officials prepare for talks in Washington with China’s top trade official Liu He to resolve an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.

In trade talks in Beijing earlier this month, China asked the United States to ease crushing sanctions on ZTE, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Trump’s reversal could have a significant impact on shares of American optical components makers such as Acacia Communications Inc and Oclaro Inc which saw their stock prices fall when U.S. companies were banned from exporting goods to ZTE.

ZTE paid over $2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017, a senior ZTE official said on Friday.

“Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!” Trump wrote on Twitter, saying he is working with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a solution.

President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2018

The U.S. government launched an investigation into ZTE after Reuters reported in 2012 the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best known U.S. technology companies to Iran. (Reuters report that exposed the practice: https://reut.rs/2GbpCmO)

ZTE pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran and entered into an agreement with the U.S. government. The ban is the result of ZTE’s failure to comply with that agreement, the Commerce Department said.

The ban came two months after two Republican senators introduced legislation to block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from ZTE or Huawei [HWT.UL], citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.

ZTE relies on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Intel Corp and American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.

The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

Republican Representative Robert Pittenger, a sponsor of legislation that would strengthen the U.S. national security review process for foreign investment, said after the Commerce ban was announced that the United States “must be vigilant against Chinese threats to both our economic security and national security.”

Experts said Trump’s policy reversal was unprecedented.

“This is a fascinating development in a highly unusual case that has gone from a sanctions and export control case to a geopolitical one,” said Washington lawyer Douglas Jacobson, who represents some of ZTE’s suppliers.

“There’s no legal mechanism for this. How this will play out remains to be seen. They are not simply going to be able to resume business as usual,” he said.

ZTE suppliers including Acacia, Oclaro, Lumentum Holdings Inc, Finisar Corp, Inphi Corp and Fabrinet, all fell sharply after the ban was announced.

Shares of Acacia, which got 30 percent of its total revenue in 2017 from ZTE, hit a record low after the ban was announced. Oclaro, which earned 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, fell 17 percent.Nearly 4 million people in Cape Town, South Africa, are facing a dangerous reality: Unless their water use severely drops, they will soon run out.

The city has announced plans to turn off water to all of its businesses and residential addresses on April 12, a date also known as “Day Zero,” unless its residents are able to conserve enough water.

The city fully expects to impose the emergency water cutoff, which would be the first by a major city in the developed world, NPR reported.

“Day Zero” was originally set for April 22, but officials moved up the estimated date on Monday after finding that dam water levels in the region have continued to fall, despite residents’ conservation efforts.

By Wednesday, water levels at various dams in the region had dropped, with the overall amount of usable water falling from 18.7 percent of capacity to 17.2 percent in one week, according to the city.

“As the last 10% of a dam’s water is difficult to use, the usable water in the dam is approximately 10% less than the dam level,” the city explained.

In an effort to mitigate the low levels, beginning on Feb. 1, residents will only be permitted to use 13 gallons of water per person a day for the next 150 days.

If or when the overall level of usable water drops to 13.5 percent ― which is expected in April ― residents will have to line up to collect 6.5 gallons of water per person, per day.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American uses an average of 88 gallons of water per day at home.

Dam levels are at 17,2% useable water. We are currently 108 million litres over our 500 million target. Due to a drop in the dam levels of 1,4%, #DayZero has moved forward to 12 April 2018. To avoid Day Zero we have to work together. #ThinkWaterCT https://t.co/Yj9ZUoCpw3 pic.twitter.com/XlepGjBfDK — City of Cape Town (@CityofCT) January 24, 2018

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), if the city is forced to trigger the disaster plan, the water will only be turned on again when the dams recover ― which could take months, the conservation organization estimates.

“It is likely that if we have the same amount of winter rainfall as last year, we will not see an increase in the dams until August,” the WWF stated in a release last week. “We should be prepared to live with very little water for at least three months and possibly up to six months after Day Zero, but it all depends on when rain falls in the water source areas that feed the dams.”

Businesses and schools will be forced to close because of the lack of running water unless they have their own water supplies, like a well or rainwater tank, WWF predicts.

Dry conditions are nothing new for the region. South Africa is the 30th driest country in the world, according to the WWF. The current drought, however, has been described as the worst in a century.

Population growth and climate change have contributed to the extreme water shortage, experts say.

“We have to acknowledge that carbon dioxide is finding its way into the atmosphere and has reached a new high,” Kevin Winter, a lecturer in environmental and geographical sciences at the University of Cape Town, told local news outlet GroundUp last year.The apocalypse is now as close as it has ever been, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Doomsday Clock, which on Thursday ticked 30 seconds closer to midnight ― the symbolic end of humanity.

The clock now stands ominously at 11:58 p.m., a time reached only once before in its seven-decade history, when fears surrounding the Cold War nuclear arms race surged in 1953. The academic journal, which covers global security, established the clock as a metaphorical tool to annually measure the world’s countdown to its final moment. It was first set at seven minutes to midnight in 1947.

In a statement released Thursday morning, the Bulletin identified three “obvious and imminent” dangers that caused the clock to swing forward by 30 seconds since its 2017 assessment:

The untenable nuclear threat An insufficient response to climate change Emerging technologies and global risk

“The time change was mostly focused this time around on nuclear considerations,” John Mecklin, the Bulletin’s editor-in-chief, told HuffPost. “There’s a wide range of nuclear considerations, but North Korea and U.S.-Russia relations were significant factors in the decision.”

In the year since Donald Trump became president, he has engaged in an escalating row of taunts and threats with Kim Jong Un, leader of the nuclear-armed North Korean regime. Pyongyang, which has long been hostile to Americans, has made remarkable advances in its nuclear program in recent months. Trump responded by saying the U.S. would “totally destroy” the hermit kingdom, a nation of 25 million people, if provoked.

In a recent tweet directed at Kim, the president also bragged about the size and effectiveness of his “nuclear button” (which doesn’t exist).

“To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger—and its immediacy.” - The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists

Last July, more than 120 nations adopted the first international treaty banning nuclear weapons. The U.S. and other nuclear powers were conspicuously absent from the negotiations.

Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention organized a public session on how to prepare for a nuclear detonation.

On a cautiously optimistic note, the Bulletin asserted that “the failure of world leaders to address the largest threats to humanity’s future is lamentable—but that failure can be reversed.”

Mecklin warned that leaders like Trump and Kim are not going to change their policies or behaviors without public pressure. “People really should take this seriously,” he said. “There are really concrete, practical things that can be done to lower the risk of a civilization-ending nuclear war.”

He is calling for significant changes to be made to the Trump administration’s Nuclear Posture Review, which appears “likely to increase the types and roles of nuclear weapons in US defense plans and lower the threshold to nuclear use,” according to the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board.

“To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger—and its immediacy,” the board said in its statement.

Among a list of suggestions, the board is also urging the U.S. to maintain diplomatic channels with North Korea and to abide by the terms of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has repeatedly threatened to upend. The landmark agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Germany and the EU requires Tehran to rein in its nuclear program in exchange for relief from stifling economic sanctions.

Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, blamed “the actions and policies of the nuclear-armed states” for winding the Doomsday Clock toward midnight. “We have been lucky to avoid conflict through intentional or accidental means,” she said.

In response to the impending hypothetical apocalypse, Derek Johnson, the executive director of the Global Zero movement for the elimination of nuclear weapons, foreshadowed a grim ultimatum.A movement to cut and restrict welfare programs is being driven by the conversation at the federal level. But in the coming year, states will be the place to watch.

By Jen Fifield

As President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress set out to impose tougher restrictions on welfare, their conservative allies across the country are trying to help them accomplish their mission, state by state.

Republican governors and state legislators are moving ahead with proposals that would make it harder for people to get and keep welfare benefits and restrict what benefits they get. Measures already have been floated in about a dozen states, and, policy analysts say, what happens in states in the coming year will serve as an indicator of what’s to come nationally.

Some state lawmakers are proposing new work requirements for people receiving food stamps under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and for people receiving government-subsidized health insurance under Medicaid. Others want welfare recipients to pass drug tests. Many are looking to crack down on fraud by requiring recipients to prove their eligibility more frequently and with better documentation. Efforts to ban the purchase of junk food and soda with food stamps are also ongoing.

In Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker last week called a special session for lawmakers to consider a package of draft legislation that would impose more restrictions on food stamps and Medicaid. His proposal and many others are driven by the philosophy that government benefits should only be temporary, and that people should earn the benefits if they can.

“Governor Walker has long believed that welfare should be more like a trampoline and not a hammock,” said Amy Hasenberg, Walker’s press secretary, in a statement to Stateline.

But Democratic leaders and welfare advocates say the restrictions Walker and others are pushing would strip people of the support that is allowing them to scrape by, and drive them deeper into poverty.

“These programs work,” said David Lee, executive director of Feeding Wisconsin, a statewide network of food banks. “They help people get the nutrition and health care they need in order to live, and work, and support their families. And that’s what we need to focus on.”

The movement to restrict welfare programs is being driven by conversations at the federal level. But Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C., said much of the change in the coming year will occur as states experiment with new ways to deliver their programs.

What happens in states, she said, “may be a bellwether for things to come down the road nationally.”

Working for Assistance

Republican governors say they are invigorated by the Trump administration’s recent promises to give states more control over how they run programs, including welfare.

The federal government sets rules for administering both food stamps and Medicaid, and many states for years have sought permission to impose greater restrictions on eligibility, such as work requirements and drug testing.

The administration this month signaled it will follow through on its promise, when for the first time it approved a request from a state — Kentucky — to require able-bodied, working-age Medicaid recipients to work, go to school, get job training or volunteer in order to receive benefits.

Ten other states have submitted similar requests, and at least another — Ohio — is in the planning stages. Now that the administration has granted one of the requests, policy analysts and welfare advocates say many more states are soon to follow.

“It will soon become the standard and the norm in the United States of America. And America will be better for it,” said Republican Gov. Matt Bevin at a news conference this month to announce that Kentucky’s request had been approved.

People already have to meet work requirements in order to receive housing assistance and cash assistance through the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. And in the past five years, most states have reinstated work requirements for able-bodied adults without children receiving food stamps. The new proposals would require some Medicaid recipients to meet work requirements for the first time, and would expand the requirements for food stamp recipients.

The goal is to “get the idle population back into the labor force,” to overcome the workforce shortages that exist in many states, said Jason Turner, executive director of the Secretaries’ Innovation Group, a coalition of about 20 human service and workforce secretaries from states with Republican governors.

Creating standard rules across welfare programs, such as work requirements, sets expectations for recipients, Turner said. The group has proposed requiring able-bodied, working-age adults without children to meet work requirements for food stamps immediately, instead of after the three-month buffer period now permitted under federal law.

The group also supports implementing certain work requirements for some parents, which more states are considering.

Maine adopted a new rule this past summer that requires parents who receive food stamps to register with a state service that can help them find a job. And Wisconsin is testing a program next year that would require parents in some regions to meet certain work requirements. Walker has proposed making those requirements permanent and statewide.

Walker also is proposing to increase the food stamp work requirement from 20 hours a week to 30.

The idea of stricter work requirements has long been pushed by the Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group based in Florida with staff in 14 states. Its advocacy work, policy analysts say, is driving many of the proposals for welfare restrictions in state legislatures.

Do Work Requirements Work?

Jon Ingram, the organization’s vice president of research, said he expects more states to impose Medicaid work requirements this year.

The ability to impose the work requirements may prompt leaders in conservative states to revive plans to expand Medicaid for the poor. State lawmakers in Kansas and Utah told The Associated Press, for example, that Trump’s shift gives their states more flexibility. “I have a lot of confidence that they [the Trump administration] will be willing to work with us and approve this,” said Utah state Rep. Robert Spendlove, a Republican pushing for a partial expansion in his state.

In Kentucky, Bevin said the new Medicaid program, which offers workforce training and job search help, will empower recipients to change their lives.

Kentuckians want “an opportunity not to be put into a dead-end entitlement trap but rather to be given a path forward and upward so they can do for themselves,” Bevin said.

The Kentucky program, and the work requirements proposed in other states, wouldn’t apply to most people on Medicaid. Nearly two-thirds of the 68.2 million people on Medicaid would not be subject to the new rules because they are children, elderly or disabled.

The remaining third — about 24.6 million — are working-age adults without disabilities. But the work requirements also wouldn’t apply to many of them, who already work or don’t work for reasons that would make them exempt from the new rules — such as being caregivers or attending school, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.

If the goal is to help people get jobs, policy analysts from left-leaning organizations say, work requirements won’t help. Instead, it will cause them to lose their health insurance, sending them into a downward spiral, said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

“They won’t get the blood pressure medication, they won’t get their diabetes supplies,” she said, “and then they get sicker, and it’s worse.”

Having subsidized health insurance actually decreases the risk of job loss, according to a recent study by researchers from multiple universities.

In another study, which examined work requirements under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that requiring recipients to work did not significantly reduce the share of families living in poverty in most cases. And, the study found, recipients facing work requirements were likelier to live in deep poverty than above the poverty line.

While many state officials want fewer people to need Medicaid, the challenge is ensuring that the changes really help people get back to work, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

“Are you cutting off your nose and saying, ‘Hey, my face weighs less. That’s a good thing,’ ” Salo said. “Or are you saying, ‘Hey, we are building a culture of volunteering, of working, and leading people to springboard out of poverty and into a situation where they can get health coverage elsewhere.’ ”

Salo expects legal challenges to the work requirements, and while more states may submit waiver requests, many may wait to see how those cases play out.

Passing Drug Tests

Along with work requirements, more states may look to require welfare recipients to pass drug tests. Historically, states have had permission to impose the requirement on people receiving cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. At least 15 states drug test for that program, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But in March 2017, Trump signed legislation that allows states to require drug testing for residents to receive unemployment compensation. And some states want to test applicants or recipients of other forms of assistance.

Proposals this year in Illinois, South Carolina and Wisconsin would require some or all food stamp recipients to pass drug tests.

In South Carolina, state Rep. Mike Burns, a Republican who is sponsoring the measure, said spending public dollars on people who may be on drugs is bad policy that rewards bad behavior. “I’m not dishing out the folks in South Carolina’s money when in essence you aren’t rehabbing and treating the illness, you are just perpetuating it,” he said.

Many welfare advocates say drug testing won’t pay off. A report last year from ThinkProgress, a progressive journalism project of the Center for American Progress, found that the 15 states that test TANF applicants or recipients spent $1.3 million for drug testing. Out of 250,000 applicants and recipients, 2,826 were drug tested, and 369 of them tested positive.

Other proposals would restrict welfare benefits further.

Lawmakers in some states are continuing to propose bans on buying junk food with food stamps. But this is something that would require federal permission, and these requests have been denied in recent years. While some policy analysts thought the Trump administration might approve the requests, Maine’s was denied last week.
