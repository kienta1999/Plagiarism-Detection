Jimmy Kimmel dissected Melania Trump’s Twitter game on Wednesday night, and discovered an intriguing detail. Namely, that the first lady only follows five profiles on her official @FLOTUS account.

And one of those people is former President Barack Obama.

“I’m sure the president isn’t very happy about this,” said Kimmel.

Melania Trump’s personal profile @MelaniaTrump follows 55 people. Obama is not among them.SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle’s city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city’s biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class.

Amazon, the city’s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed.

As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker.

That “head tax” formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city.

Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday’s action. The move by the world’s largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs.

Following the council vote, Amazon’s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago.

However, he added, “We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.”

Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability.

The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy.

The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city’s private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits.

Sponsors of the tax said Seattle’s biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city.

Supporters cite data showing Seattle’s median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as “rent-burdened,” meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing.

The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered.

Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law.

She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority.

On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon’s second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure.

“By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,” the officials wrote.Chrissy Teigen and her husband, the thief. David Becker/Getty Images

Chrissy Teigen doesn’t mind calling out her husband for the whole world to see.

The supermodel took to Twitter to roast John Legend for stealing all ― yes, all ― of her phone chargers.

“Yes @johnlegend I buy and leave all the phone chargers all around the house just so you can unplug them all and take them to work with you. all of them!” Teigen wrote on Wednesday, her words dripping with sarcasm. “I love that you love chargers! they’re all for you! I just love you that’s why I buy them. because you love them!”

The “Lip Sync Battle” commentator tweeted then that she was going to purchase a unicorn charger so Legend might avoid taking it:

@johnlegend take this one u thief — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 8, 2018

As one Twitter user put it, the two are facing a “power struggle.”

It sounds like the two of you are facing a bit of a... power struggle.



I'll show myself out. — Jon S. (@SleepiestNinja) February 8, 2018

But clearly, the charger-stealing scenario hit a nerve with people in relationships.

“Orange Is the New Black” star Ruby Rose tweeted at her girlfriend, Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas, and called her out for doing the same thing as Legend:

@Jessicaveronica lol .. You. You are why I need 50000 chargers on my rider. — Ruby Rose (@RubyRose) February 8, 2018

Many others shared their power struggles:

This is marriage summed up in one tweet. — Katie👸🏼 (@katiemylady__) February 8, 2018

I’m married to the same kind of person. Who knew so many men loved chargers this way. Nothing makes my day like frantically looking for a charger when I’m on 2%. And he has them all. Every single one for one phone. — lynnethedreamer (@lynne816) February 8, 2018

pretty sure this is a universal husband/ wife struggle. 😂😂 — Pamela Phillips (@pameladphillips) February 8, 2018

This battle over wall chargers is so relatable lol https://t.co/gq17fYoPES — KristinLasVegas (@KristinLasVegas) February 8, 2018

Teigen has never shied away from calling out Legend on social media. When the musician posted a beautiful ― but low-quality ― photo on Instagram for his wife’s birthday, Teigen simply commented “How about a hi-res,” a reference to the blurriness of the picture.

They also use outlets like Twitter to help each other, like the time Teigen seemingly couldn’t find one of the couple’s toilets (yes, really). Luckily, Legend knew what happened and tweeted an explanation.

And despite all the charger-stealing and blurry pictures, Teigen told Us Weekly in a 2016 interview why she won’t ever leave Legend.States with high rates of residential segregation are significantly more likely to have fatal police shootings of unarmed black victims, according to a new Boston University study.

The Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) research team said their study is the first of its kind to find a link between structural racism, particularly residential segregation, and racial disparities in fatal police shootings at the state level.

“This suggests that the higher rates of fatal police shootings of unarmed Black victims are not merely a result of more interactions between police officers and Black suspects,” wrote study co-author Anita Knopov, a pre-doctoral fellow at SPH in a Monday blog post.

“Instead, our results indicate that in some states, there is a systematically different response based on the race of the suspect,” Knopov said.

The study, which was published in the Journal of the National Medical Association, used data on fatal police shootings of unarmed victims collected between Jan. 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017 from the Mapping Police Violence Project database.

Investigators developed an index of structural racism at the state level. The index included measures of black-white residential segregation and disparities in economic status, employment status, educational attainment and incarceration rates. The authors then rated states on a scale of 0 to 100. The higher the number, the more residential segregation or racial disparities were documented.

Using that scale, researchers noted that for every 10-point increase in a state’s racial segregation index, they found a 67 percent increase in the state’s ratio of police shootings of unarmed black people versus unarmed white people.

According to Knopov and the study’s other authors, there hasn’t been empirical research to understand why Black people are more likely to be killed by police than white people ― until now.

“We used indicators of structural racism that reflect a long history of racial oppression by institutional practices such as redlining, the creation of exclusionary or sundown towns, mass incarceration, and other forms of racial discrimination,” said lead author Aldina Mesic, an SPH student and research study assistant in community health sciences in the same blog post.

“Residential segregation does not occur overnight. It is the direct consequence of a long history of institutionalized racial oppression,” Mesic added.

Police shootings of unarmed black individuals have long been an issue in the United States. The names of the many victims whose deaths sparked massive movements are widely known ― think Philando Castile, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling and Michael Brown.

These lost lives have ignited conversation about racism and police brutality that have rolled out beyond the small city streets, but official change has yet to come in many cases. Young activists have spoken out about the problem with national movements like Black Lives Matter, while others have used kneeling protests during the national anthem to highlight the violence ― both movements have faced backlash from average citizens and even the president.

Senior author and professor of community health sciences Michael Siegel hopes that this research can change that conversation and “pave the way a meaningful discussion about institutional racism.”

“This research should change the conversation about the problem of police shootings,” Siegel said in the blog post. “Part of the resistance to openly discussing this issue is that many people feel offended by criticism of people who are risking their lives to protect all of us.”

“Our study suggests that this problem is not simply about the actions of individuals, but about the actions of all of society,” he added. “Hopefully, reframing this from an individual to a societal problem will pave the way for a meaningful discussion about institutional racism.”liveslow via Getty Images

The 2020 census will continue to count incarcerated people as residents of the place they are imprisoned instead of their homes, a decision critics say can target prisoners and give unfair political power to the rural areas where prisons are located.

State officials use the population from the census when they redraw legislative districts, something required by the U.S. Constitution every 10 years. Each district must have roughly the same amount of people in it, and counting prisoners as part of an area’s population can inflate its population and the political influence of the people who vote there. Just two states in the country ― Maine and Vermont ― allow people convicted of felonies to vote while they are incarcerated.

The census has always counted prisoners as residents of the locations where they are incarcerated, rather than residents of their pre-incarceration addresses. But that practice has become more and more problematic as the prison population soars, said Aleks Kajstura, the legal director at the Prison Policy Initiative, which lobbied the Census Bureau to change the way it counts incarcerated people.

“You have huge prisons built very far away from where most incarcerated people live. You have a whole state’s incarcerated population, people from all over the state, get sentenced and put in a handful of facilities,” Kajstura told HuffPost. “It really shifts the balance of power when you count them in the wrong place, because all of a sudden you have 2,000 extra people just in one little neighborhood.”

The census considers someone a resident of a place if they are a “usual resident,” meaning they live and sleep there most of the time. In several cases where someone might be away from home during the census ― at boarding school, on a business trip ― census officials will still count them at home.

The Census Bureau reconsiders its “usual resident” requirements every 10 years. When it invited public comment on potential changes in 2015 and 2016, advocates were hopeful the bureau might modify its policies. Over a 60-day period in 2016, the bureau got 77,887 public comments relating to residency requirements for prisoners. Only four favored continuing to count them at the facilities where they’re incarcerated.

But on Wednesday, the Census Bureau said that for 2020, it would continue to count incarcerated people at the facility where they’re imprisoned, because it considered that to be the place where they lived and spent most of the time.

“The Census Bureau isn’t fully grappling with the realities of mass incarceration. That when you’re incarcerated, you’re not a member of the community that hosts the prison. You can’t go outside.” - Aleks Kajstura, Prison Policy Initiative

“‘Usual residence’” is defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time, which is not always the same as their legal residence, voting residence, or where they prefer to be counted,” Ron Jarmin, the acting director of the Census Bureau, wrote in a notice filed in the Federal Register on Wednesday. “Therefore, counting prisoners anywhere other than the facility would be less consistent with the concept of usual residence, since the majority of people in prisons live and sleep most of the time at the prison.”

In a 2016 memo, the Prison Policy Initiative explained why the Census Bureau should not consider prisoners “usual residents” of the sites of their incarceration. The group noted that the average jail sentence was nine months, and that those serving longer sentences in state prisons often moved around among different facilities. The memo also noted that other groups, like boarding school students, who kept familial ties at an address despite not being physically present there on census day, were counted at that address.

“The Census Bureau isn’t fully grappling with the realities of mass incarceration. That when you’re incarcerated, you’re not a member of the community that hosts the prison. You can’t go outside. Outside the prison walls, you have no interaction with that community,” Kajstura said. “Your family, your friends, your coworkers are all in your home community.”

In what may be a nod to the issue the census policy carries for redistricting, the bureau also announced this week it would provide data more quickly on where people live so that states could choose to use it in the redistricting process. Some states require that prisoners be counted at their home addresses for redistricting purposes.

But regardless of when it makes the data available, Kajstura said the Census Bureau’s decision reflected a deeper bias towards prisoners.“She wanted to have it,” Tarantino says in the clip, which is no longer available. “He didn’t rape a 13-year-old. It was statutory rape. That’s not quite the same thing.

“He had sex with a minor, all right. That’s not rape. To me, when you use the word ‘rape,’ you’re talking about violent, throwing them down.”

Geimer disagreed, telling the New York Daily News: “He was wrong. I bet he knows it.” She added: “I hope he doesn’t make an a― of himself and keep talking that way.”

Here’s Tarantino’s statement:This tweet does not make you a friend or ally to the LGBTQ+ community. We know you by know; your words and by your actions how you really feel about us. Until you change, @Adaripp and the rest of the LGBTQ+ have every right to keep you at arms length. We simply don’t trust you.LOS ANGELES ― Marcia Clark is finally free from the sexist garbage she faced in the 1990s. And she is on fire.

“Bitch. Shrill. Strident. Emotional,” Clark ticked off some of the words that were used to describe her in the media, and even in court, when she prosecuted the O.J. Simpson trial in the early 1990s.

“All of it is demeaning, all of it is minimizing, all of it is a way to shrink a woman into what is basically a child,” she told a packed audience at a women’s conference here on Wednesday. “Anytime a woman raises her voice and shows her power, they find a way to minimize it.”

For her part, Clark said she walked out of that courtroom, devastated by the verdict, and never went back. She’s now in the middle of writing her eighth novel. Her new TV series, “Marcia Clark Investigates the First 48,” debuts on A&E next month.

Decades ago, no one seemed to notice the biased way Clark was treated, even as her looks, demeanor, private life and “likability” were dissected by the press. Even as Judge Lance Ito cautioned the jury not to be distracted by the length of Clark’s skirt. Finally, with the release of the FX series “The People v. OJ Simpson” in 2016, a new generation woke up and realized that Clark ― who was widely reviled back then ― got a raw deal.

Clark said she was shocked at the change in mindset. HuffPost caught up with her for a few minutes after her talk at the 2018 Makers Conference on Wednesday. (Makers is also owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.)

During the trial, a lot of us didn’t see the sexism. You saw it. You must’ve been so frustrated.

I was aware of sexism. Going into the profession, in the law, women were far outnumbered. At the DAs office, too. On the 18th floor, there were four bathrooms and three of them were for men. Still I was able to succeed. I managed. I didn’t have to confront sexism on a regular basis. I didn’t have to think that much about it.

Until the Simpson trial.

I wind up in a courtroom full of men who are so profoundly sexist, it was shocking. And so it was a bit of a wake-up call for me.

What have your thoughts been watching the reconsideration of your treatment unfold?

I never thought it would happen. Never. The sexism at the trial wasn’t really something that anyone remarked on. Some did, but they were lone voices in the wilderness. Until voices join together in a chorus, nobody hears them. Particularly women.

So it really was not something I thought anyone would ever care about or notice. And then they did. That year after the FX series came out was a mind-blower for me on every level.

Talking to reporters who were outraged by what they’d seen. Who were disbelieving. The younger ones in particular. The millennials. That age group was like, “What the fuck?” [Laughs]

It was refreshing. It was across the board. The men and the women had the same reaction, which was amazing. I thought, OK, we really have moved forward. There really has been progress. There’s a whole generation that looks at that and says, “What bullshit.”

You really seem empowered. It seems like I’m seeing Marcia Clark, unleashed. Today, especially, when you said your message for men afraid to interact with women was “boo-fucking-hoo.” Do you feel more emboldened and empowered by the changing climate?

I think I’ve always been who I am. I kind of didn’t hold back in court, either. It got to a certain point in the trial when I realized he [Judge Ito] was not going to get any better. There was no appeasing him. Then Marcia Clark unleashed in that courtroom. I definitely resorted to my own voice.

I’m still just being me. I think all of us are, but maybe are feeling more empowered to speak out. To say, “This is not OK.” To say, I don’t want to support abusers in Hollywood just because they make money. I don’t want to hide a CEO’s sexual misconduct just because he makes money. In that sense, we have all found a voice that we were afraid to have before.

We talked about changing culture. Is there a changing culture in the criminal justice system around domestic violence?

Absolutely. So that’s the silver lining of the Simpson case. It really shined a light on domestic violence and the connection between domestic violence and murder. It exposed the thinking that domestic violence is somehow a private affair, a family matter, not a crime. That really exposed that lie.

Do you think the trial would’ve gone differently now?

I wouldn’t argue it differently. The case is the case. What will skew it again, if a case like that comes up again, is race. I don’t feel we are post-racial. Many of the problems existing then still exist today. As long as that divide exists, we will come up again and again against the same biases and problems that skewed this trial.

Here’s the perfect example: Trayvon Martin. I don’t how that jury found [shooter George Zimmerman] not guilty. How could they? It was a white jury. The notion that Trayvon was a thug, that kind of language [the defense] used, found real purchase with that jury, when it shouldn’t have. He was a kid. Zimmerman targeted him, no question, initiated the fight and then pulled out a gun.

I was outraged by that verdict. It goes both ways. I’m encouraged by Black Lives Matter. We need more of this.

A lot has changed for women. What’s left to change?

Women are speaking out, they’re finding their voice. They’re finding each other, which is the most important thing. The marches are a really important way to connect with other women and see our power when we come together.

We also need to see the real changes that can make women’s lives truly equal: Glass ceilings need to be broken, maternity leave needs to be a matter of course, childcare needs to be provided. These are the kinds of things we have to put in place. Now that we have spoken, let’s do it.

Did you march?

We only have a single request for this new Amy Schumer movie: Please, for the love of Goldie, be better than “Snatched.”

The comedian premiered the trailer for her upcoming comedy “I Feel Pretty” on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Thursday morning (she also dressed up as a baby, but that’s another story) and it feels tailor-made for her brand of humor.

Directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, the film sees Schumer playing a woman who takes a fall during a Soul Cycle class only to wake up convinced that she is the most beautiful woman in the world.

“I look exactly the same but in my mind I am Gisele; I am one of the Jenner-Kardashians,” Schumer told DeGeneres about the twist.

This newfound confidence propels her to live her life without insecurities, which opens her up to personal and professional opportunities. At one point in the trailer, she actually looks Naomi Campbell in face and tells her, “Modeling is an option for me. It’s not who I am.”

“It’s a really funny and sweet movie that I think will make us all feel better. It made me feel better to play the role,” Schumer explained.

Michelle Williams, Emily Ratajkowski, Rory Scovel, Aidy Bryant, Busy Philipps, Tom Hopper and Lauren Hutton also star in the project.It’s happened again. America’s secret scourge: kids getting stuck in claw machines.

This time, the victim was a Florida boy who was lured into the grip of a claw machine Wednesday night at the Beef ‘O’ Brady’s in Titusville, according to Florida Today.

The boy, identified only as Mason, decided that he really, really wanted a stuffed animal he saw inside the arcade game’s cage. Instead of paying to snatch it using the claw, Mason, who looked to be about 4 or 5, climbed up into the machine.

“He went in, but obviously he couldn’t come back out the same way,” Titusville Fire and Emergency Services battalion chief Greg Sutton said, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Mason wasn’t trapped in the claw machine’s evil clutch for long. Lucky for the little boy, off-duty firefighter Lt. Jeremy House was also dining in the restaurant.

House “told the mother to call 911, knowing our guys are so close by and that they could handle the situation,” Sutton told ABC News.

Responding firefighters were able to rescue Mason within five minutes of their arrival. “Once we understood the mechanism and how it worked, it was pretty easy to get those pins removed and the door open the rest of the way,” Sutton said.

The fire department reported the rescue on its local Facebook page.

There was also minimal damage to the claw machine.

Turns out the potentially frightening experience was worth it in the end: Mason got a toy football and more.

AdvertisementScientists long believed that “Cheddar Man,” Britain’s oldest complete skeleton, was fair-haired and light-skinned. But according to new DNA analysis of his remains, he — and at least some of the first modern settlers of Britain — had dark skin and dark, curly hair.

“It really shows us that these imaginary racial categories that we have are really very modern constructions, or very recent constructions, that really are not applicable to the past at all,” Tom Booth, an archaeologist at London’s Natural History Museum who was involved in the analysis, told The Guardian this week of the Cheddar Man findings.

Cheddar Man’s 10,000-year-old skeleton was discovered near the village of Cheddar in Somerset, England, in 1903. Researchers now say he was part of a group of hunter-gatherer immigrants from continental Europe who’d settled in Britain shortly after the last ice age. Today’s white Britons are descendants of that immigrant population — one that, until recently, had been assumed to be fair-skinned.

But, by sequencing Cheddar Man’s entire genome and reconstructing his face using cutting-edge techniques, scientists at the Natural History Museum and University College London have proved the assumption wrong.

“Cheddar Man had blue eyes, dark colored curly hair and ‘dark to black’ skin pigmentation. Previously, many had assumed that he had reduced skin pigmentation,” the researchers said in a news release Wednesday.

“The discovery suggests that the lighter pigmentation now considered to be a defining feature of northern Europe is a far more recent phenomenon,” they added.

The researchers, who extracted bone powder from Cheddar Man’s ancient skull to conduct the DNA analysis, said their study offers insights into the origins of the Stone Age man. His ancestors, they said, left Africa and moved to the Middle East before heading to Europe and, finally, Britain.

About 10 percent of white Britons today can trace their ancestry to this ancient population, the researchers noted.

Scientists involved in the research said they weren’t entirely surprised by the findings.

“It might surprise the public, but not ancient DNA geneticists,” Mark Thomas, a University College London scientist, told National Geographic.

Other recent genetic research, Thomas explained, shows that Europeans from Spain, Hungary and Luxembourg who lived during the same era as Cheddar Man also were dark-skinned.

Questions remain, however, as to when and why Britons started to develop lighter skin. Some experts have suggested that ancient humans in more temperate regions were exposed to less sunlight, and therefore evolved to have lighter skin, which absorbs more ultraviolet radiation ― necessary for the production of vitamin D.This Black History Month, Nas chose to honor the musicians who shaped — and continue to shape — black culture. The iconic rapper teamed up with Google to create “We Continue to Rise,” an open letter and video paying homage to the legends whose music embodied blackness in all its forms.

“I was raised to understand that every month was Black History Month,” he wrote. “That every day, my ancestors, contemporaries and everyday dreamers like myself can, shall, and continue to make history.”

The letter goes on to describe the unique hold music had on Nas’ life from day one. His father, a musician himself, decorated the house with instruments and surrounded his son with with the notion that music was an extension of black history and culture. The young rapper came to understand that black music, from jazz to folk to funk, tells a story.

In the accompanying video, Nas reads part of his letter, set against a montage of black artistic icons. The section he reads touches on the importance of music and how it gave him a deeper understanding and appreciation of his culture.

“Our music has been a relentless advocate for our story, which plays a crucial role in the American narrative: Red, white and blues, baby,” he says.

Nas wraps up the letter by naming those that influenced him directly. Individuals such as Robert Johnson, Sarah Vaughan and Slick Rick are just a few of the storytellers who inspired him by centering black experiences and preserving black culture, regardless of genre.

But he also emphasizes that these kinds of figures don’t exist solely in the past. Instead, Nas emphatically states that, like those that came before, modern black musicians continue to make history and shape culture.Uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration, the ride-hailing company’s chief legal officer Tony West announced in a blog post Tuesday morning.

Riders, drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company, wrote West, who was a top-ranking official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

“It’s important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims,” West wrote in the post, noting the company’s need to regain the public’s trust. “Whatever they decide, they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.”

The move comes less than three weeks after 14 women, who said they were sexually assaulted by their Uber drivers, penned an open letter to the company’s board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom, rather than in arbitration.

“Silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at Uber,” the women wrote. “This is not doing the ‘right thing,’” they said, alluding to the company’s new motto: “We do the right thing. Period.”

The letter drew widespread media coverage, including over the issue of forced arbitration. The app’s terms of service require any rider with a complaint against the company, even of sexual assault, to commit to arbitration, essentially private courtrooms where a company typically has the edge in any litigation.

West, who did a stint at PepsiCo before joining Uber, credits the new motto in his post on Tuesday, explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with “transparency, integrity, and accountability.”

Victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration, he wrote. And when survivors settle cases with Uber, the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal, he added.

Uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform.

The moves are effective immediately, the company said, and apply to all cases currently pending against the company. Those who previously signed non-disclosure agreements will still be bound by those NDAs.

“[Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi] recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner,” West wrote. “Our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on.”

One other tech company ― Microsoft ― has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits. But Uber’s move is sure to affect far more people, as millions use the service each year.

On Tuesday afternoon, Uber’s closest competitor, Lyft, followed its lead and made a similar announcement.

“Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies,” a Lyft spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost. “We agree with the changes.”

Lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims, whether they’re riders, drivers or employees. Like Uber, the company would still force class actions into arbitration. Lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults.

The company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending.

Uber’s new policy only applies to individual cases. Victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so. For its part, Uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level.

Other riders with complaints against the company ― outside the realm of harassment and discrimination ― will still be held to the fine print in the app’s terms of service agreement, requiring that disputes be settled via arbitration.

Uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination. A bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who was able to sue the company’s chairman and CEO despite an arbitration clause in her contract.

“I’m proud to see companies joining our fight to end arbitration to give more women a voice in harassment and assault cases and unveil the secrecy,” Carlson told HuffPost. “I’m hopeful more companies will follow suit.”

Earlier this year, Facebook told HuffPost it was considering whether to support that legislation ― and defended its use of arbitration. All 50 state attorneys general have expressed support for the bill, known as the End Arbitration Act for Sexual Harassment.

In the meantime, the fate of many of those women’s assault cases is far from clear. Nine of the 14 women who wrote that open letter are currently suing the company and have asked a California court for class-action status for their case.

The women will now be free to pursue their assault charges in court, but only on an individual level. They’re also suing Uber for misleading advertising and fraud ― and the company said those claims would still have to be arbitrated.

“Our hope is that Uber ending forced arbitration for victims of sexual assault will begin a process to reduce future suffering by women passengers,” Jean Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine victims. “Uber has made a critical step in this direction, but preventing victims from proceeding together, on a class basis, shows that Uber is not fully committed to meaningful change. Victims are more likely to come forward knowing they can proceed as a group.

“This is the beginning of a longer process needed to meaningfully improve safety.”

Moving to disclose data on rapes and sexual assaults is risky for the company, West acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times. He said he struggled with the decision because he knows it will be “disturbing,” according to the Times. Uber is a large company and it’s fairly easy to lodge a complaint against it. Also, there’s no standard on how to report such incidents, the company noted.

Uber still hasn’t made one key demand: Tightening its driver background checks by running fingerprints through FBI and DOJ databases.

Uber has “so much money that they are willing to allow customers to sue them in court for what happens to them, but they are not willing to make the changes which would make the customers safe,” said Christensen.

Uber disputes the usefulness of fingerprint checks and has pointed out that it has made a raft of changes to tighten up safety over the past year.

Uber also said it will continue to force other disputes into arbitration, including when a passenger is injured due to driver negligence.

Uber’s reputation took a serious hit in the last several years after a series of public gaffes, reports of sexual assaults by drivers that were mishandled and a sexual harassment scandal that felled Uber’s co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.

In light of the numerous high-profile sexual harassment and assault cases across industries in recent months, West’s post also references the Me Too movement and Time’s Up, the coalition of women in Hollywood formed to fight sexual harassment. Uber announced that it created its new policy by consulting with women’s groups and advisers including Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama’s former chief-of-staff and one of the founders of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund.A Republican candidate for an Illinois seat in Congress on Thursday openly denied the Holocaust and said, “You jews media, you’ve gone absolutely nuts,” during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day.”

Arthur Jones, the self-described former leader of the American Nazi Party, called the Holocaust a “scam” and an “extortion racket” as “New Day” host Alisyn Camerota challenged him. Jones, the sole Republican in the race for Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District, is set to capture the party’s nomination in the March primary election.

Camerota aired footage of an unhinged Jones speech at a neo-Nazi event, then posed a blunt question.

“Mr. Jones, It is shocking to hear how vocally and unapologetically racist you are. Are you a Nazi?”

Jones said he doesn’t call himself a Nazi because he has not formally been involved with Nazi organizations for the last “15, 20 years.”

“I call myself an American patriot and statesman,” he said.

Jones is challenging Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D), and has been denounced by the Illinois Republican Party and National Republican Congressional Committee.

“You’ve been part of anti-Semitic groups since the 1970s,” Camerota told him. “You’re part of the White People’s Party. You dress in Nazi garb, you celebrate Hitler’s birthday.

“You’re a Nazi.”

CNN

Camerota went on to say that Jones’ website ― which includes a section that calls Holocaust survivors peddlers of “propaganda” ― is “filled with the most vile, rancid rhetoric I think I’ve ever read.”

“It’s not vile and rancid, it’s the truth,” Jones replied.

“There’s nothing on that website that’s not true,” he continued. “You jews media, you’ve gone absolutely nuts. You think that Adolf Hitler’s revived from the grave or something. It’s one man, myself, that’s standing for the truth.”

Jones continued his rant, calling the Holocaust “poppycock,” a “scam,” and an “extortion racket” as Camerota read cold, hard facts about the Nazi genocide.

The argument went on for several minutes before Camerota tied it up with a prediction about Jones’ political future.

“You have a long track record of losing,” she told him. “You lose virtually everything that you run for. You’ve run for Congress and you’ve lost, for mayor, for alderman. And we’re not in the business of predicting the news, but I can say that you will lose this race. You couldn’t win dog catcher.”

“Chances are, you’ll go down in flames,” she said.

Many people on social media remarked about Camerota’s handling of Jones:

I’m a child of Holocaust survivors. Watching Alisyn Camerota interview Nazi Arthur Jones was bone chilling.



He denies the Holocaust. Says we’re “a Jew Party system.”

Jeanne Ives, who is running against Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in the Republican primary, acknowledged while speaking in Chicago Monday that the campaign ad was “edgy,” but said she was “a little bit surprised at some of the hysteria” the clip had prompted.

“I want to know why people are so offended by it,” Ives said while speaking at the City Club of Chicago, according to the Chicago Tribune. “The ad is a policy ad. That’s what it is. It’s an accurate depiction of the policies Rauner put in place.”

She went on to offer a cringe-inducing, not to mention misgendered, defense of the actor portraying a transgender woman: “The transgender man, that’s exactly what typically a transgender man looks like.”

When an audience member disagreed, Ives responded, “With all due respect, look, I’ve had him show up at my door.”

Titled “Thank you, Bruce Rauner,” Ives’ ad aimed to critique some of the policies Rauner put in place since taking office in 2015.

At one point, a deep-voiced actor wearing a red dress thanks the governor for “signing legislation that lets me use the girls bathroom,” and later, a woman in a pink “pussy” hat expresses gratitude for having Illinois families “pay for my abortions.”

Both Democrats and Republicans criticized Ives for releasing the ad, which deems Rauner “the worst Republican governor in the country.”

On Monday, Ives maintained that her commercial “does not attack people, it tackles issues.”Growing up, siblings Matt and Becca Hamilton ate meals together, played outdoors together, celebrated holidays together ...

Now, they’re sharing an Olympic dream together.

The Hamiltons, of McFarland, Wisconsin, will be going for the gold as the U.S. mixed doubles Olympic curling team.

Mixed doubles curling is one of four new events being introduced at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, according to Reuters.

Matt, 28, and Becca, 27, will also compete separately for the U.S. women’s and men’s teams.

Although the U.S. curling team is only ranked eighth in the world, Matt Hamilton believes he and his sis have a good chance in their opening match on Thursday against fourth-ranked Russia.

They face off against married curlers Anastasia Bryzgalova and Alexander Krushelnitskiy, but Matt suggests the connection he has with Becca is stronger than the bond between their competitors.

“I can’t divorce my sister,” he told Reuters.

Matt started curling 16 years ago, and Becca took up the sport two years later.

“He brought me into the game, so I guess what better partner can I find than someone that brought me up?” she told Inside Edition.

“She couldn’t find a better partner,” Matt quipped.

“I probably could,” his sister shot back.

Snappy patter like that may help the Hamiltons catch the attention of American TV viewers typically more interested in figure skating or ski jumping.

Matt describes the sport ― in which people push a 44-pound “stone” across the ice with a “broom” ― as a mix of shuffleboard, chess and bowling. “Oh, and Swiffering your floor,” he told Inside Edition.

Curling is the longest Winter Olympic contest: The first match starts before Friday’s opening ceremonies and the last game ends just hours before the Olympic torch is extinguished.

That means the Hamiltons will be spending a lot of time together in South Korea, which suits Becca just fine.Openly gay Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon apparently gave Mike Pence the cold shoulder last month when the vice president asked for a meeting.

USA Today reported Wednesday that, according to two sources, Rippon declined a meeting with Pence that the vice president tried to arrange with the help of the U.S. Olympic Committee.

On Wednesday night, Pence, who will lead the official U.S. delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony on Friday, sent the following tweet:

.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Don’t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get ‘em! — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8, 2018

Rippon’s mother, Kelly Rippon, defended her son on CNN on Thursday. She insisted that he did not “refuse” to meet with Pence, but preferred to wait until after he competes.

“I believe that you can say it many different ways. I don’t think he ever said ‘I refuse to do that,’ because that suggests a tone of intolerance and inflexibility,” she said.

“He conveyed to whomever, I don’t know the individuals, that any kind of communication would have to be done after the competition is over,” Rippon’s mother added.

Rippon hadn’t responded to Pence’s text as of Thursday morning, but he publicly criticized the vice president in a Jan. 17 USA Today story.

“You mean Mike Pence, the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy?” Rippon told the paper. “I’m not buying it.”

Rippon went on to say he’d rather not meet the vice president during the traditional meet-and-greet between the official delegation and U.S. Olympians that occurs before the opening ceremony.

“If it were before my event, I would absolutely not go out of my way to meet somebody who I felt has gone out of their way to not only show that they aren’t a friend of a gay person but that they think that they’re sick,” he said, pointing to Pence’s reported support of ex-gay “conversion” therapy while serving in Congress.

Rippon’s comments inspired Pence’s press secretary Alyssa Farah to send a rebuttal, claiming “Rippon’s accusation is totally false and has no basis in fact,” adding that the vice president “will be enthusiastically supporting all the U.S. athletes competing next month in Pyeongchang.”

Snopes points out that Pence has never publicly advocated gay conversion therapy, but once supported the use of federal funding to treat people “seeking to change their sexual behavior.”

The 28-year-old Rippon is the first openly gay U.S. man to qualify for the Winter Olympics, though a number of Olympic figure skaters have come out as members of the LGBTQ community after their competitive days have ended.“We’ve talked a lot about gender and pronouns on the show and I thought it was time to actually put a name to the concept,” New York-based host Lindsay Amer told HuffPost. “Words like ‘binary’ and ‘non-binary’ are not as difficult to understand as adults make them out to be and I think it’s important to use the correct words when we are communicating with young people. If they can’t pronounce it or fully comprehend the vocabulary now, that’s okay because the concept and idea of it are what matter most and that’s what sticks. What’s the harm in learning a new word?”On Wednesday, anchor Shepard Smith openly ridiculed the president’s proposed parade during a discussion with Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin.

“He could go see the tanks at a military base if he wanted to,” Smith offered as a more frugal alternative. “Or they could give him replicas. Little mini replicas. I mean, he wants to see what he has. I had some of those when I was a kid.”

Smith later added: “You can get the little plastic ones and lay them out on the table and say, ‘Here you go.’”

Griffin joined in the teasing.

“We can play Strategy and Risk,” she suggested.

The complete segment is below.

“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade is another Fox News personality skeptical about Trump’s grand parade.

On Wednesday, he broke ranks with co-hosts Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt, who supported the proposed event.

“I don’t know. It seems like a waste of money,” he said.“Dearest Kim, my love and condolences to you and yours and Godspeed to your beloved brother. Xx,” Parker wrote on Cattrall’s Instagram post that confirmed her 55-year-old brother Chris had been found dead in Canada.

Another of the “SATC” quartet, Cynthia Nixon, 51, also commented: “Hey Kim such awful news. So sorry to hear. Sending you love. XO.”

Cattrall posted thanks Tuesday on Twitter.

But the public show of support may not erase the bad blood that seemed to emerge over Cattrall’s decision to reject a third “Sex And The City” movie, which basically scrapped the project. Cattrall told Piers Morgan in October that Parker “could have been nicer about it.”

“I don’t know what her issue is,” Cattrall said. Parker said last week she was “heartbroken” by the remarks.

“It was a professional experience, but it became personal because it was years and years of our lives,” Parker said on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” recently. “I’m hoping that that sort of eclipses anything that’s been recently spoken.”

Jeremy Lin isn’t here to play games.

The Brooklyn Nets point guard responded to a Twitter user who called him a “chink” after the player tweeted about New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski during Sunday’s Super Bowl.

Being the respectful dude that he is, the point guard clapped back nicely, taking down the quiet, subservient Asian stereotype in the process.

Oh? Don’t do that. Asians are speaking out too...we aren’t doormats https://t.co/Ow6cMtxipg — Jeremy Lin (@JLin7) February 5, 2018

The offensive tweet and user profile have since been deleted. Several social media users have praised Lin’s handling of the situation.

Lin has been targeted with racial slurs and discrimination in the past. He revealed in an interview last year that when he was playing for Harvard University, fans at Cornell called him “chink” and referees failed to take any action. While playing Georgetown University, someone shouted “chicken fried rice,” “beef lo mein” and “beef and broccoli” throughout the game. The list goes on.A Black Lives Matter activist who made headlines last year when he leaped through police tape to grab a Confederate flag away from a protester was fatally shot in New Orleans early Tuesday morning.

Muhiyidin Moye, also known as Muhiyidin d’Baha, was riding his bike in New Orleans when he was shot in the leg by an unknown assailant around 1 a.m., WCSC reports.

Moye’s niece, Camille Weaver, told the station that her 32-year-old uncle rode more than five blocks after being shot to get medical help.

“He was transported to a hospital and subsequently died of his wounds,” New Orleans Police spokesman Beau Tidwell said in a statement to WCSC. “The incident is the subject of an active and ongoing investigation.”

Moye was a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement in Charleston, South Carolina, and close to the family of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by then-officer Michael Slager in 2015.

“I thank God for placing him here to be the soldier that he is, that he was,” Walter Scott’s brother, Anthony Scott, said to the station about Moye.

In February of last year, as a WCSC reporter was broadcasting, Moye took an impressive running leap through police tape to snatch a Confederate flag in Charleston. He was charged with disorderly conduct for his actions, but was hailed as a hero online.The Slow Mo Guys have succeeded where many NBA players have failed.

O’Neal says he’s the first openly trans man to graduate from Spelman College, America’s first private, liberal arts historically black college for women.

O’Neal shared two smiling snapshots of himself in his graduation attire on Twitter that subsequently went viral. HuffPost talked to the recent graduate about his journey at Spelman and what it’s like to be a trans man at an all-women college.

“My experience was up and down, much how I’d expect any college experience would be,” O’Neal said in an email.

O’Neal said he loved Spelman as a freshman, but he didn’t feel like he could come into himself, so he transferred to a predominantly white institution.

The 21-year-old had started Spelman identifying as non-binary and using they/them pronouns, but “no one could catch on to that so it was kind of hard to exist as myself,” O’Neal said. He added that in his experience, “black folks really only understood the binary.”

It was during the time at the predominantly white school that he “was able to grow and develop” himself the way he wanted to “without the pressures of other black folks telling me I couldn’t do or be something.”

“I came back to Spelman my junior year because although I could flourish in my queerness, I felt like I was denying my blackness and I was nothing more than a body to those folks,” O’Neal said.

Getting through junior and senior years was hard for O’Neal, who said that he received a lot of backlash from “current students, their parents and alum” after he came out during a convocation with author and activist Alice Walker, a Spelman alumna who was visiting as an artist-in-residence.

“Lots of people believed that because I was trans, I didn’t belong at Spelman but there was nowhere else I would rather be,” he said. “People still have their own opinions of me attending Spelman, but it’s because of Spelman why I am who I am.” The college did not immediately return a request for comment.

O’Neal said there were many who supported his decision to come out, which is only emphasized by the explosion of support from friends, family and fans on Twitter after his graduation photos went viral.

Odds are high that O’Neal will not be the only openly trans man to gradute from Spelman.

The school announced in September 2017 that it would revise its admissions and enrollment policy to “consider for admission women students including students who consistently live and self-identify as women, regardless of their gender assignment at birth.”

“If a woman is admitted and transitions to male while a student at Spelman, the College will permit that student to continue to matriculate at and graduate from Spelman,” read the letter from the college president about the change.

On what’s next for O’Neal, the South Plainfield, New Jersey, native said that he’s been accepted into a Ph.D. program for this fall, but is thinking about “taking some time off to work and establish” himself before going back to school.

“Right now, I’m on the job hunt! Not necessarily looking to stay in my major but I definitely want to do something I love,” he told HuffPost.

The graduate wanted to thank his supporters.

“I could not have made it this far without the encouragement of others,” he said. “It truly takes a village. For everyone who played a part in my successes, this is a win for all of us.”

O’Neal also hopes that his experience will teach others to “never give up, no matter what people tell you.”

“You have to believe in yourself,” he added. “It is so easy to get down and out but it takes a lot of courage to keep fighting and that courage has always been inside of you.”

Cheers to you, Keo. Congratulations!People with disabilities in Australia’s prison system are routinely kept in solitary confinement for up to 22 hours a day and are at serious risk of sexual and physical violence, according to an explosive report by Human Rights Watch that’s making political waves.

The report, titled “‘I Needed Help, Instead I Was Punished’: Abuse and Neglect of Prisoners With Disabilities in Australia,” calls for an urgent inquiry into the use of solitary confinement for disabled prisoners. The report says that one man with a psychosocial disability had been in solitary confinement in a maximum security unit for 19 years.

“People with disabilities, particularly psychosocial or cognitive disabilities, are dramatically overrepresented in the criminal justice system in Australia ― 18 percent of the country’s population, but almost 50 percent of people entering prison,” Human Rights Watch said in the report.

“However, prisons fail to adequately identify people with disabilities and are ill-equipped to meet their needs, often lacking the most basic services.”

Sen. Rachel Siewert of the Greens party called for swift action: “We already know that many people with disability are wrongfully detained in our prison system, so to hear about this utterly harrowing abuse and neglect highlights the need for a royal commission and for reform.”

HRW interviewed 275 people, including prison staff, medical professionals and 136 current or recent prisoners, from 14 facilities in the states of Queensland and Western Australia. It found that in most of the prisons, toilet facilities were not adequate for people with physical disabilities, who often had to wait long stretches for help to use a bathroom or take a shower.

“I can’t get my chair in. I have to pee in a bottle,” one man said.

“I have to wear a nappy every day. I don’t feel like a man; I feel like my dignity is taken away,” said another.

Of the 136 former or current prisoners interviewed, 41 said they had suffered physical violence. Thirty-two reported sexual violence at the hands of fellow inmates or prison staff. HRW reported the case of one man with a disability who was raped “on numerous occasions” by another prisoner who was meant to be his ‘prison carer,’ an inmate paid by the facility to help look after people with disabilities.

“In all 14 prisons visited, Human Rights Watch found that prisoners with disabilities are viewed as easy targets and, as a result, are at serious risk of violence and abuse, including bullying and harassment, and verbal, physical, and sexual violence,” the report said.

“It is terrifying,” Siewert said, “to hear that prisoners were appointed to look after other inmates with high support needs and that in one prison six out of eight ‘carers’ were convicted sex offenders. This is despicable and not a standard we would accept out in the community, and it has culminated in rape and sexual abuse of vulnerable people. It is time for the government to urgently address this issue.”

Many cells, like this one at Brisbane women's correctional center, are overcrowded as two or more inmates are jammed into a cell built for one person. Human Rights Watch

One man with a psychosocial disability, who was raped in prison and spent significant time in solitary confinement, said he contemplated suicide.

“I feel hopeless; life isn’t worth living and I’d be happier if I was dead. It has led me to self-harm; the physical pain doesn’t hurt as much as the emotional pain,” he said. “My self-harm increased after the rape. I put razor blades and glass in my penis. I wouldn’t do this if I had activities and therapeutic interventions.”

Another man, who has a cognitive disability, said he was raped, then threatened by guards when he tried to report his rape. He was then punished by fellow prisoners for attempting to report the incident.

“I was sexually assaulted [by other prisoners]…. I know at least one of them raped me, but I kind of blacked out. I was bleeding, I still bleed sometimes. I reported it the same day to two of the supers [superintendents], I filled out the medical request form,” the prisoner said.

“They told me if I report it, I would go to the DU [detention unit] for six months. So I ripped up the form in front of them. Then, when I went back to the unit, I got bashed up by some of the guys, not the ones who assaulted me…. They beat me up, stomped on me. Called me a dog [traitor].”

The HRW report included multiple reports of disabled inmates being subjected to long periods of solitary confinement. HRW said one prisoner with a psychosocial disability, named in the report only as Mary, spent 28 days in solitary confinement and was abused by prison staff during that time.

“After a week, when she was granted access to daily exercise, she was placed in handcuffs connected to a body belt that restricted her movement. During exercise time, correctional officers mocked her, whistled at her like a dog, and told her to crawl on her hands and knees. During her time in solitary confinement, Mary did not have access to a toilet and was forced to use cardboard urine test containers,” HRW said.

HRW called on state and territory governments ― which are responsible for the prisons ― to immediately end the use of solitary confinement as punishment for prisoners with disabilities and to provide “reasonable accommodations” for disabilities and adequate access to support and mental health services.

Queensland Corrective Services Commissioner Peter Martin told the Courier Mail newspaper that “multiple” investigations were underway into the state’s prison system following the cases cited by HRW. “It’s a taking of some extreme examples ... but in no way do I believe they are endemic of the state of prisons in Queensland.”

Western Australia’s independent Inspector of Prisons, Neil Morgan, told The Australian newspaper that his state too would investigate the claims. “But the most fundamental issue is inadequate screening of prisoners for disability, and a lack of records.”

On a national level, HRW called on the federal government to launch an inquiry into the use of solitary confinement, as well as commissioning studies to map the number of disabled prisoners in Australia’s prison system.

Sen. Jordon Steele-John, also of the Greens party, the third-largest in Parliament, called Wednesday for a royal commission, a parliamentary investigative body, to be established to report on the prison system.
