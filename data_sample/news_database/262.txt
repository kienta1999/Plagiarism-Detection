In a deeply personal new ad, Democrat Sol Flores talks about how the sexual abuse she endured as a child has helped inspire her to run for a U.S. House seat in Illinois.

The ad starts with an 11-year-old girl building a big wooden chest in an art class. Flores then reveals that there was a secret reason she was doing that project.

“I didn’t tell anyone that a man living with us would come into my bedroom when I was asleep and lift my nightgown. Well, I filled that chest with the heaviest things I could find, and I put it against that door, to wake me up so I could fight him off,” Flores says in the 30-second spot. (Watch the ad above.)

Flores is running for an open seat in Chicago, to replace Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D). In the March 20 primary, she’s up against Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, who has racked up major endorsements from progressives ― including from Gutierrez himself ― and is considered the frontrunner.

The Flores campaign plans to air her ad on the night of the Oscars ― March 4 ― when celebrities will be calling attention to sexual harassment. Flores has the backing of Emily’s List, the pro-choice Democratic organization, and she is the founder of La Casa Norte, a nonprofit helping families and young people who are homeless.

Flores also has a longer online version of her ad, in which she talks more about her background and experiences. She said when her abuser would push on her door, the sound of it against the heavy chest would wake her up, allowing her to scream at him to go away.

She returned to her childhood bedroom to shoot the ad.The hotly anticipated Marvel film “Black Panther” is expected to rake it in when it finally hits theaters this weekend.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, research firm NRG now estimates the film will bring in $165 million or more for the upcoming four-day Presidents Day weekend.

The first projections, from two weeks ago, forecasted that the film’s domestic opening would be $125 million. The number skyrocketed to $150 million-plus last week and has continued to grow.

If NRG’s prediction is correct, “Black Panther” would be among the top five or six domestic openings ever for a superhero film. It could also be the top February launch of all time, per THR.

“Deadpool” set the Presidents Day weekend record in 2016 with a $152 million opening, followed by 2015′s “Fifty Shades of Grey” ($93 million).

Even if “Black Panther” doesn’t hit its high predictions, the film has already set a slew of records.

“Black Panther” currently has a 97 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, the best rating of all titles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ― though it is worth noting it once held a 100 percent rating just a week ago.

For those who are late to the party and don’t know what “Black Panther” is about, it follows the story of T’Challa after his father T’Chaka is killed. He takes over as the king of the African tech-nation Wakanda where has to protect his people from harm as both king and, you guessed it, Black Panther.

Directed by Ryan Coogler, “Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong’o Michael B. Jordan, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. It hits theaters in the United States on Feb. 16.The father of U.S. snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim had a message for reporters after her spectacular Olympic gold medal win on Tuesday.

Pointing to himself, Kim Jong-jin said “American dream” before letting out a cheer, according to The Associated Press. A day earlier, the elder Kim told the “Today” show that his daughter was his American dream. It was a sentiment that had moved many fans to tears.

HELLO MY LITTLE AMERICAN DREAM IT’S TIME TO CRY pic.twitter.com/iXPcV1HZfP — extra guacamomole (@guacamomole) February 13, 2018

The younger Kim, who dominated women’s snowboard halfpipe event on Tuesday, told reporters after her victory that she “did it for my family.”

“My dad has definitely sacrificed a lot for me and I don’t know if I could do it, if I was in his shoes,” the 17-year-old said, according to Reuters. “Leaving your life behind and chasing this dream because your kid is passionate about this sport. I think today I did it for my family and I am so grateful to them.”

Kim’s dad, who emigrated from South Korea to California in 1982, quit his engineering job about a decade ago to support his daughter’s budding snowboarding career. Since then, he’s devoted himself to helping her succeed ― though he’s downplayed his sacrifices as “normal for all parents.”

When Kim was in middle school, her dad would drive her six hours to Mammoth Mountain every weekend so she could train there.

“What would happen is that he would carry me out of bed,” Kim recalled in a 2016 interview. “I would wake up in a new spot every time without even knowing what happened.”

When they got to the mountain, Kim’s dad would strap on his own board and ride by her side. “He never knew much about snowboarding, but he did everything he could,” Tommy Czeschin, a former U.S. Snowboarding coach, told Bleacher Report last month.

On Tuesday, Kim’s parents and extended family, including her 75-year-old grandmother, were there to watch the teen clinch the gold medal at Phoenix Snow Park in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

“To see Chloe compete in the Olympics, it’s going to be very exciting and happy,” her mom, Boran Kim, told The New York Times in the days leading up to the event. “I think it will be the best moment of my whole life.”

Kim’s dad won hearts with a handmade ― and laminated ― sign that he held up during his daughter’s runs. According to NBC, the poster was given to him by young snowboarders from California’s Mountain High resort, where his daughter used to ride and compete.

The elder Kim told NBC that, before Tuesday’s event, he texted his daughter, “Today is the day imugi turns to dragon,” a reference to a Korean legend.

“She was born in year of dragon,” he said. “To be a dragon in Korean tradition is to wait 1,000 years. Before [you are] a simple snake, like an anaconda. But they wait about 1,000 years, and then they turn to dragon. Go to the sky, and they make a big dragon with a gold pearl. She’s got a gold pearl in her mouth. I texted her this morning that this is the time to be dragon.”

“It turned out pretty well,” the younger Kim later told NBC. “If I’m a dragon, I’m down.”

On Monday’s episode of “Celebrity Big Brother,” the former White House Office of Public Liaison communications director warned her housemates that “as bad as y’all think Trump is, you would be worried about Pence.”

Newman said people wishing for Trump’s impeachment “may want to reconsider” their life.

“We would be begging for the days of Trump back if Pence became president,” she added. “(Pence is) extreme. I’m Christian. I love Jesus. But he thinks Jesus tells him to say things. I’m like, ‘Jesus isn’t saying that.’”

Newman also issued a warning about President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, which she claimed was “getting more and more aggressive.”

In an earlier episode, she explained to her housemates about how she’d been “haunted by tweets every single day” during her stint in the White House, which came to an acrimonious end in December 2017.

AdvertisementAmerican luger Emily Sweeney crashed during the women’s singles competition at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, and was reportedly taken to a hospital for evaluation.

Sweeney, 24, was speeding around a curve when she lost control, bounced off the walls and flew off her sled.

She was conscious and was able to walk off the ice with some assistance. She was later seen being escorted to an ambulance and taken to a hospital for evaluation, according to online reports.

According to an NBC reporter, citing a USA Luge source, the hospital evaluation is likely part of concussion protocol.

Though this is Sweeney’s first Olympic appearance, she is no stranger to the competition. She narrowly missed a spot at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Her older sister, Megan, ultimately nabbed that spot, NBC reported.Colbie Holderness, ex-wife of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, is “dismayed” by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway’s recent suggestion that only weak women are involved in abusive relationships.

Holderness published an op-ed in The Washington Post on Monday responding to Conway’s and President Trump’s comments about her recent allegations of domestic violence against Porter.

Both Holderness and Porter’s second ex-wife, Jennie Willoughby, publicly accused the former White House staff secretary of abusing them emotionally, verbally and physically during their marriages. Although Porter denies the allegations, he resigned last week.

Conway said she has “no reason not to believe” Holderness and Willoughby in a CNN interview on Sunday. She later added that she’s not worried about Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and current girlfriend of Porter, because she’s “rarely met somebody so strong with such excellent instincts and loyalty and smarts.”

In her essay, Holderness addressed this comment and rebutted Conway’s suggestion that only weak women find themselves in abusive relationships.

“Borrowing Conway’s words, I have no reason not to believe her when she says that Hicks is a strong woman,” Holderness wrote. “But her statement implies that those who have been in abusive relationships are not strong.”

Holderness explained that it takes strength to not only recognize an abusive relationship, but it also takes strength to escape one.

“Recognizing and surviving in an abusive relationship take strength. The abuse can be terrifying, life-threatening and almost constant. Or it can ebb and flow, with no violence for long periods,” she wrote. ” ... Telling others about the abuse takes strength. Talking to family, friends, clergy, counselors and, later, the FBI, I would often find myself struggling to find the words to convey an adequate picture of the situation.”

She added that it takes strength to face people who simply don’t believe your experience. It also takes strength to put “the pieces of your life back together” after leaving your abuser.

“Being strong — with excellent instincts and loyalty and smarts — does not inoculate a person against abuse. It doesn’t prevent her from entering into a relationship with an abuser,” Holderness wrote. “Abuse often doesn’t manifest itself early on — only later, when you’re in deep and behind closed doors. The really ugly side of Rob’s abuse only came out after we married, following three years of dating.”

Holderness also addressed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who declined to comment on whether she believes Holderness’ and Willoughby’s allegations.

“While I cannot say I am surprised, I expected a woman to do better,” she wrote.

The hashtag, created by Michael Harriot, a writer at The Root, imagined what Wakanda, the uncolonized black utopia and home to Black Panther, would look like in real life. Users ran with the idea and began creating a country that, through law and custom, reflected blackness at its best.

Some began with simple details like “Who made the potato salad?” and others gave shoutouts to classic African-American Vernacular English, such as “the itis.” Harriot was also sure to point out how the dangers of ashiness aren’t a problem in this perfect society.

The hashtag also addresses some of the basic struggles black people experience while living in predominantly white countries. For example, one tweet stated that in Wakanda there simply isn’t a need for STEM programs to teach science, tech, engineering and math to black girls because they already “go together like greens and cornbread.” A few others noted that the only Donald Wakandans acknowledge is Glover and that cultural appropriation might as well be a capital offense.

The hashtag takes, from the cookout-inspired to the socially conscious, all point back to a larger narrative that has encompassed black audiences’ “Black Panther” anticipation. They feel seen.

When Shuri, princess of Wakanda and head of the country’s technological advancements, casually flaunts her new inventions on screen, black women in science become a tangible idea. And as T’Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, navigates his newfound status as king, audiences see themselves reflected as both leaders and royalty.

In these tweets, Wakanda becomes more than a fictional utopia. It is, as Harriot pointed out, where black lives and black culture intrinsically matter.After New York Times writer Bari Weiss stirred up controversy on social media with a tweet about figure skater Mirai Nagasu’s historic performance at the Olympics, supermodel Chrissy Teigen weighed in and set the record straight.

Teigen, who’s Asian-American herself, politely responded to Weiss following a tweet in which the Times writer shared a video of Nagasu landing a triple axel with the words: “Immigrants: They get the job done.”

Nagasu, however, is not an immigrant.

Weiss deleted her original tweet after immense backlash, but later on defended her words, labeling the criticism as a “sign of civilization’s end.” She mentioned that she used the lyrics from the musical “Hamilton” to celebrate both Nagasu and her immigrant parents, claiming she tweeted “Immigrants: we get the job done.” But that didn’t sit right with Teigen.

It’s called perpetual otherism or perpetual foreigner syndrome. No one is ashamed of the word immigrant but it’s tiring being treated as foreigners all the time. You made a mistake. It’s okay. But people are really giving you calm, great insight. Just learn and breathe. All good. https://t.co/DmvdvBpG9Z — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2018

Teigen also clarified what Weiss’ original tweet really said.

Also you said they, not we. But it’s okay. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2018

Though Weiss shared articles from various outlets ― including HuffPost ― to defend her initial tweet, those sources emphasized the journey of Nagasu’s family, rather than characterizing Nagasu herself as an immigrant.

As Teigen points out, Asian-Americans are indeed stereotyped as perpetual foreigners, often portrayed as such in media regardless of whether they were born in the U.S. or how long they’ve lived in the country. The pervasive stereotype leads many people of color to feel their American identity is constantly being questioned, or even erased.

The trope isn’t innocuous, either, as it can have serious effects on Americans of color. Hate crimes against Asian-Americans in Los Angeles County tripled in 2015, with the majority targeting Chinese-Americans, and experts suspect the increase was connected with President Donald Trump’s labeling of China as a foreign enemy during his campaign.

Asians are also more likely than other groups to be charged with espionage in the U.S., according to a study published by nonpartisan Chinese-American organization Committee of 100, and experts feel the perpetual foreigner stereotype has something to do with it.Australia has marked 10 years since the Parliament apologized to its indigenous peoples for the decades-long policy of forced removal of children, known as the stolen generations.

But a recent update to the government’s strategy to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders shows the country is still lagging in key areas.

On Feb. 13, 2008, then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a historic apology to the stolen generations for the “profound suffering and loss” experienced under a decades-long government policy to remove indigenous children from their parents.

Between 1910 and 1970, Australia had a policy of forcing the indigenous children into state care. It was a policy of racial discrimination, and the decades of damage turned into painful memories that existed like a wound. Australia’s politicians had battled for years over whether an apology should be made.

In Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said what Australia had failed to understand was that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were proud people.

“We did not see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and peoples as the gift they are, a gift which should have been honored but which was cast aside, disparaged and ridiculed,” he said. “On the 10th anniversary of the national apology to the Stolen Generations, I extend my respect and on behalf of all honorable members to all those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who despite immeasurable pain have survived.”

For some, Rudd’s national apology was a sign of profound change.

“It was a magical moment for me,” Michael Welsh told Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC. Welsh was taken from his mother and siblings when he was 8.

“It’s made a big difference to me in my life, through my life, where I’ve journeyed, it’s made a difference to my children, and my brother and sisters,” he said.

But there are signs the country is losing momentum for change, with this week’s update to the federal government’s decade-long Closing the Gap Strategy showing a lack of progress toward some goals toward equality.

Announced shortly after Rudd’s apology, the policy for improving outcomes for indigenous Australians is on track to hit just three of its seven targets.

Targets such as closing the gap in life expectancy by 2031 are no longer on track, the report said. Nor are other goals, such as halving the gaps in employment, reading and math, as well as school attendance, by 2018.

Other statistics, beyond the Closing the Gap update, paint a grim picture.

In 2017, life expectancy for indigenous Australians was estimated to be 10.6 years lower than that of the non-Indigenous population for males and 9.5 years for females.

“This is a national shame,” said June Oscar, the Close the Gap campaign co-chair and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner.

“In 2018, it is still a fact that our people live nearly a decade less than non-Indigenous peoples in this country,” she said in a statement. “After 10 years of closing-the-gap work, we all expected to be further ahead than just managing to meet 3 out of 7 targets.”

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people also account for just over one-quarter of Australia’s prison population, with a 7 percent increase in indigenous prisoners in a year.

Labor Sen. Pat Dodson, who is indigenous, told The Guardian Australia on Monday that momentum for positive change had “crumbled away” in the years since the apology.

“Instead of actually building on that and transforming the social paradigm and the political paradigm and the economic paradigm for Indigenous peoples, we have gone backwards,” he said.

Reflecting on the national apology he delivered a decade ago, Rudd defended the Closing the Gap strategy and told journalists a reconciled Australia is “eminently achievable,”

“It is not the stuff of idle dreamers,” he said. “We’ve actually made progress on this road. We are actually bending the arc of history together. Change is possible. And on this, we should be encouraged.”

“Bob Mueller has no duty to tip his hand and show his cards until the end of his investigation, and he does have a duty to complete the investigation,” Napolitano, a former judge, told host Heather Childers on “America’s Newsroom.”

“It’s going to take a while until he gets all the evidence,” he added.

When Childers accused Mueller of expanding the scope of his investigation and therefore extending the timeline of the probe, Napolitano defended him.

“I don’t think he had any idea what he was going to stumble on,” Napolitano said, listing the charges against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and the investigation of his personal lawyer Michael Cohen.

“They can’t overlook these things,” he added of Mueller’s team.

Childers wrapped the segment up, but not before saying, “I know a lot of people disagree with you because they think this has gone on way too long.”Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi helped lead the bipartisan group demanding that sexual harassment victims get their day in court. Mike Segar/Reuters

During a time of rabid partisanship, somehow the Me Too movement has managed to bring together Democrats and Republicans (at least the ones outside the White House).

On Monday, every single state attorney general ― a majority of whom are Republican ― signed a letter to congressional leaders demanding that sexual harassment victims get their day in court.

The attorneys general want Congress to end the practice of forcing sexual harassment cases into mandatory arbitration, secret private courtrooms outside the public justice system. Companies favor arbitration because it’s cheaper ― victims typically don’t get much money ― and even more appealing, arbitration allows corporations to keep embarrassing cases secret.

“Ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims,” the letter says.

The veil of secrecy that often surrounds harassment claims keeps victims isolated ― unaware that someone else has already gone through a similar experience and unable to fight together, the letter notes. It serves the public interest to bring these claims out into the open.

The letter marks the first time in a decade that all state attorneys general have taken an action like this, according to a press release from Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican who until now was best-known for a controversy over a political donation from President Donald Trump and was last on the national stage at the Republican National Convention. She is leading this effort with North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat.

Stein told HuffPost that the growth of the Me Too movement has caused Republicans and Democrats to take a fresh look at the issue.

“There’s been a much greater understanding about how deep-seated and widespread sex harassment is,” he told HuffPost Tuesday. “The Me Too movement and all the attendant media coverage has really underscored just how grave this situation is in America’s workplaces.”

The idea to write to Congress, which is presently considering bipartisan legislation on the issue, came from one of his staffers, Stein said. Most state attorneys general signed on to the idea pretty quickly. He and Bondi worked together to wrangle the few who didn’t immediately respond.

“There’s been a much greater understanding about how deep-seated and widespread sex harassment is.” - North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein

The letter managed to shock advocates who have been fighting against forced arbitration.

“This represents an important turning point,” said Cliff Palefsky, an employment and civil rights lawyer in California who has been a leading advocate against the practice of forced arbitration since the late 1980s. The fact that Republicans have signed on to this letter is momentous, he said, as historically they’ve supported arbitration and blocked legislation on the issue.

“I hope the leaders of Congress recognize that there’s a wave coming and they should step up and do the right thing,” he said.

The bipartisan push is a direct outgrowth of the Me Too movement, a seemingly unending wave of credible sexual misconduct allegations against some of the most powerful political and business leaders in the country. Arbitration agreements and confidentiality clauses helped protect many of these men, perhaps most notably Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused by dozens of women for behavior dating back decades.

Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson succeeded in getting around the arbitration clause in her employment contract with Fox News when she took the extraordinary step of suing the company’s former chairman, Roger Ailes, directly in court.

Getting her case out into the light in 2016 was crucial in exposing Ailes, and ultimately resulted in his ouster from the company he co-founded. The reverberations around Carlson’s move also led to the ouster of Fox superstar Bill O’Reilly.

The suit turned Carlson into one of the leading proponents to end forced arbitration. In December, she helped senators from both parties introduce legislation in Congress that would end the practice in sexual harassment cases.

“Ending arbitration in these cases is the first step to give women and men the voice they deserve,” Carlson told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Harassment and retaliation at work is an apolitical issue — an issue that affects us all — an issue we should all care about — for our mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers and most of all our children. The myths and secrecy surrounding this serious issue must stop.”

It’s notable that the letter ― and legislation ― only addresses forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Cases involving racial discrimination, wage disputes and other employment issues would still wind up litigated in private. Even consumers are subject to mandatory arbitration if they have a dispute with a company after buying a product or using a service.

About 55 percent of private sector employees are subject to mandatory arbitration, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. That translates to 60.1 million workers, according to the data. Companies also use arbitration clauses to prevent employees from joining together in class action suits. That means if a group of female employees were all harassed by the same man, they would each have to sue the company individually. That’s a huge disadvantage to such women, already far less empowered than the company they’re fighting.

That’s what happened to four women suing the beverage company Monster Energy over harassment and other claims. All are fighting their cases separately in arbitration ― even though two of the cases involve misconduct by the same man.

“It’s unfair,” said Mary Frances “Fran” Pulizzi, who sued Monster for discrimination last year. The 43-year-old, who worked in business development for the company, said it’s been difficult to find a lawyer. Many have told her they can’t afford to take on arbitration cases, where plaintiffs typically don’t win large payouts. She’s also anxious about the limited amount of time she’ll have to present her case. In a public court she’d be able to submit more evidence.

“I have stacks of emails and documents that show patterns that prove what I’m saying happened, really happened,” she said. “I have to comb through and find the best pieces, I guess. I hope that it’s enough.”

Pulizzi remembers being presented with the arbitration agreement before she was hired by the company. At the time, she didn’t imagine she’d ever sue her employer.The campaign staff of Democrat Randy Bryce, who is challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), announced on Monday that they had unionized and ratified what is by all accounts the first collective bargaining contract negotiated by political campaign workers.

It was fitting that Bryce’s team would be the first to unionize: The man known on Twitter as “IronStache” is a union ironworker who has made support for organized labor a key component of his upstart bid against the second-most powerful Republican in the country.

But the first contract of the new Campaign Workers Guild is more than just a statement of values from a progressive Democratic candidate and his ideologically-minded workers. If the vision of the union’s founders comes to fruition, the union could transform campaign work from an often precarious, high-turnover job into a sustainable career path.

“The more folks we can help stay in the field, the better off the Democratic Party and the progressive movement will be,” said Meg Reilly, vice president of the Campaign Workers Guild.

Reilly, a veteran of multiple Democratic campaigns, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, currently makes a living as a representative for a labor union in Maine. She founded the all volunteer Campaign Workers Guild in October 2017 together with several alumni of Sanders’ and other progressive campaigns who were frustrated by the lack of protections for campaign workers.

It wasn’t that Sanders had mistreated his employees; on the contrary, in her telling, his was a “great campaign” for workers.

But precisely because Reilly “burned out,” even after a stellar run on Sanders’ team, she and peers with similar experiences concluded that campaigns were churning through some of their hardest-working and most experienced operatives.

“Campaign work is characterized by 80 to 100-hour weeks ― making much less than minimum wage, even when candidates pay well like Bernie does ― and immediately burning out,” Reilly recounted. “We don’t get to talk to our family. We get exhausted.”

“That leads to a lot of talented, well-trained organizers leaving the field,” she added.

“Sexual harassment is rampant on campaigns for all types of candidates.” - Meg Reilly, Campaign Workers Guild

In addition, political campaigns are often characterized by stiff hierarchies and a shortage of seasoned personnel that has made them fertile ground for sexual harassment and other forms of misconduct.

In November, HuffPost reported on two women who experienced sexual harassment while working for the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, respectively. Both women had trouble getting accountability for their tormentors. The alleged perpetrator on the Clinton staff was fired, only to continue working for the party in another capacity, which disappointed the victim.

“Sexual harassment is rampant on campaigns for all types of candidates,” Reilly said. “It’s something folks feel they have to put up with.”

The Campaign Workers Guild, which is not affiliated with an established national union ― an unusual move for a new local ― approached Bryce’s campaign staff about unionizing after Nate Rifkin, one of the union’s founders, went to work for Bryce as his campaign’s digital director. After winning his colleagues’ support for unionizing, Rifkin, a veteran of both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns, sought and received immediate voluntary recognition of the union from Bryce and campaign manager David Keith in December.

Since the union was dealing with a friendly manager, they were able to hammer out their first collective bargaining contract later that month. (The union announced the contract more than two months later, because they needed time to develop a communications strategy; Bryce campaign communications director Lauren Hitt only joined the team in January.)

The first political campaign union contract looks a lot like collective bargaining agreements in other fields. The contract, which applies to every campaign staffer except for Keith, the campaign manager, provided all eight bargaining unit members with a 1 percent across-the-board pay increase and a new minimum salary of $3,000 a month, as well as a stipend with which to purchase health care coverage, paid sick leave, paid holidays and other days of paid time off. Campaign workers are entitled to due process in the event of discipline or firing, including a warning and the chance to improve before being dismissed. And the campaign must give bargaining unit members 10 days notice before laying them off ― a key concern in campaigns that often end suddenly.

Crucially, the contract also creates a sexual harassment reporting procedure. The campaign must respond to an accusation of sexual harassment with an investigation from the campaign’s outside attorney to be presented within seven days of the complaint. Employees are guaranteed privacy and explicit protection against retaliation for reporting the incident.

And, like in other unions, employees can file grievances against management practices they perceive as unfair or as a violation of the contract.

“We’re all very excited to have the grievance process and the sexual harassment protection process ― not that we think we’re going to need them, but better to bring an umbrella in case it rains,” Rifkin said.

Although most unions collect dues as a percentage of employee pay, the Bryce campaign workers’ union dues are a flat rate of $30 a month. Organizers hope that as the Campaign Workers Guild grows to represent more employees and collect more dues, it can manage a fund that supports campaign workers between election cycles when many experience financial instability. The union might even grow to provide continuous insurance for members that hop from campaign to campaign, much in the way that Bryce’s Iron Workers Union provides him with insurance.

“Ultimately, that would be great for campaign workers to avail themselves of because they are also doing seasonal work,” Rifkin said.

Currently, the entire executive board of the Campaign Workers Guild is made up of volunteers like Reilly. That may change as the union tries to organize more campaigns. The guild claims it has hundreds of supporters and is in the process of organizing the staffs of other Democratic campaigns.

The guild is also open to organizing the workers on Republican campaigns. In what is perhaps a reflection of Democrats’ greater support for unions, however, there has thus far been more demand from Democratic campaign workers for representation, according to Reilly.It’s not surprising that John Oliver confronted Dustin Hoffman about sexual harassment allegations against the actor at a 20th anniversary panel for “Wag the Dog” last year. After all, the 1997 film itself is about the burying of a sex scandal.

It seems the only person unprepared for the question was Hoffman.

“That was a case of doing a favor for that charity and the ’Wag the Dog’ screening, and then feeling like I had to bring it up,” Oliver explained during a round table discussion with press for his HBO show “Last Week Tonight” on Monday. “It was kind of like an internal barometer again, right? I just felt it would’ve been very weird not to bring it up.”

While moderating the panel benefitting the Tribeca Film Institute, Oliver questioned Hoffman about the actor’s apology following allegations he harassed a 17-year-old intern on the set of the 1985 TV movie, “Death of a Salesman.”

Hoffman said his behavior wasn’t “reflective” of who he is, which Oliver said felt like a “cop out.” That’s when the panel discussion turned into a heated exchange.

The actor reportedly felt blindsided by Oliver’s questioning. And Oliver still doesn’t understand why.

“I was surprised that he turned up in the first place,” said Oliver.

“The Gotham Film Awards were the previous week, and they hadn’t done red carpet interviews, so it felt like he should’ve been aware that he was going to have to answer to this the next time he answered to anything,” Oliver said. “And then I’m staggered if he honestly thought I wasn’t going to bring it up. I don’t know how little he would have to think of me to think that I wouldn’t bring that up.”

Essentially, said Oliver, whoever ended up speaking publicly with Hoffman had a responsibility to bring up the allegations. That person just turned out to be Oliver.

He does not, however, think he did a better job of questioning Hoffman than a journalist, adding, “I have to believe most people would’ve asked him about it, and then the only reason the conversation kept going was that his responses were pretty bad.”

Oliver said he wanted to get Hoffman to a point of “self-reflection” to salvage something from their exchange, but it “didn’t happen.”

Following the panel discussion, Oliver faced his fair share of critics, including Alec Baldwin, who said late-night hosts are acting too much like “grand juries.”

On Monday, we pointed to Baldwin’s comments and asked Oliver if he felt a responsibility to address certain topics in the news.

Speaking about “Last Week Tonight,” he said, “I guess it feels like if there’s a particular aberration that has taken place, whether it’s like a Charlottesville comment or something ... it feels like we have to address it at the top of the show because to not address it would almost seem like an editorial decision.”

But there’s one issue the comedian is perfectly fine letting others handle: the legendary “Trump pee tape.” When asked whether the “Last Week Tonight” team is close to locating the alleged tape, Oliver replied:

We’re not that close. If I had it, I’d play it for you on my phone right now. Yeah, I don’t know. I will say we’ve not been looking. I think there are other people that really should be doing that.LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. singer Vic Damone, a crooner who found fame in the 1940s and 1950s, has died at the age of 89, his family said on Monday.

Damone, known for hits like “I Have But One Heart” and “You Do,” died in Miami Beach, Florida on Sunday surrounded by relatives, his family said in a statement.

Damone appeared in television shows and movies in the 1960s and also had hits with “An Affair to Remember” and “On the Street Where You Live.”

New York-born Damone was the son of an Italian-American electrician and was inspired to launch a singing career by Frank Sinatra, with whom he later became friends.

Damone was also a personal friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, the family said.

In 1962, he hosted his own television variety show “The Vic Damone Show” on NBC, after appearing in movie musicals “Hit the Deck” and “Kismet” in the 1950s.

In 1971, Damone began performing in Las Vegas casinos, and in 1972 he was offered the role of singer Johnny Fontane in “The Godfather” movie but turned it down. The role ultimately went to Al Martino.

Damone released his final album in 2002 and gave his final public performance in 2011 at the age of 82, when he sang to a sold-out crowd in Palm Beach, Florida.

His autobiography, “Singing Was the Easy Part,” was released in 2009.

Dame was married five times and is survived by his six grandchildren.

He died at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach from what is thought to be complications from respiratory failure.

After Damone’s death was announced, friends and fans took to social media to bid farewell:

#RIP Vic Damone, a singer ultra smooth; was married to actresses Pier Angeli and Diahann Carroll. https://t.co/Hz5a7BC2H2 — Mike Barnes (@MikeBarnes4) February 12, 2018U.S. Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon opened up to The New York Times about his fraught relationship with food, his lifelong journey to be “thin,” and the repercussions of starvation.

“I looked around and saw my competitors, they’re all doing these quads, and at the same time they’re a head shorter than me, they’re 10 years younger than me and they’re the size of one of my legs,” Rippon told the Times.

The 28-year-old said he has always wanted to look like fellow skaters Nathan Chen and Vincent Zhou, whose lithe frames enabled them to produce quadruple jumps. His desire was so strong that in 2016, as the Times put it, Rippon was “subsisting mostly on a daily diet of three slices of whole grain bread topped with miserly pats of the spread I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.” Those “meals” would be supplemented with three cups of coffee, each sweetened with six packs of Splenda.

Rippon, who landed two triple axels in his routine on Monday and earned a bronze medal in the figure skating team competition, said those sort of eating habits are likely what led to his breaking his left foot while hopping to warm up his legs last year. The break led to his changing his diet.

“I think I had a stress fracture before I broke my foot and I think that was absolutely because I was not getting enough nutrients,” he said.

We so frequently hear about the eating disorders that ravage female athletes, models, and actresses alike, but there’s typically a deafening silence when it comes to men. Yet according to the National Eating Disorders Association, 10 million American men will at some point struggle with a clinically significant eating disorder.

As the Times notes, even though eating disorders “are not discriminatory,” the silence among men is rooted in the cultural aspect of what it means to admit you have a problematic relationship with your body and food,

“Males are supposed to be stronger and not need psychological assistance,” Ron A. Thompson, a consulting psychologist for the Indiana University athletic department, told the publication.

In 2018, this desire to adhere to such social mores feels antiquated and explains why there’s now a commonly used phrase called “fragile masculinity.” It’s completely okay to be vulnerable and it doesn’t matter what your gender identity is.

The Times report also discussed other male figure skaters who have dealt with eating disorders, with a particularly heart-wrenching quote from 1988 Olympic gold medalist Brian Boitano.

“When I was hungry, it made me feel strong,” he said.

Boitano went on to say that the current weight-obsessed climate is “the same now as it was in my day, and I think it’s all figure skaters.”

“We all live during our Olympic careers, and after our competitive careers, with an interesting relationship to food.”A Massachusetts elementary school principal says she is “at peace” after coming out to students, parents and faculty as transgender.

Shannon Daniels opened up about her gender identity to her community at Swampscott’s Stanley Elementary School in a Feb. 6 letter, USA Today reported.

“After confronting a series of challenges last fall, I let myself imagine the possibility of being completely honest with myself and those around me,” Daniels’ letter, which can be viewed in full here, read. “I can now say it: I am transgender. For me, that means I identify as both a male and female, and I plan to move toward presenting myself and identifying as female.”

Calling the decision “intensely personal,” she added, “I know there will be questions, and I am aware of the likelihood that my transition won’t necessarily be easy for everyone. I will do everything in my power to ensure that there is no negative impact on our school community.”

Prior to making the announcement, Daniels sought advice from Asa Sevelius, principal of Heath School in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, who came out as transgender last year.

Sevelius’s advice? “Stay awesome at your job. At the end of the day, the school community just wants you to show up and do your best for your students and teachers,” he said, according to the Boston Herald. “If you can do that, it’ll help people come along on your journey with you.”

Daniels said she will use her middle name, Shannon, as her first name because “it is used by both males and females, perfectly denoting my fluid gender identity.” Students, she said, should continue to refer to her as Principal Daniels, but the pronouns “she,” “he,” and “they” are all acceptable to use.Since plans for a third “Sex and the City” movie were scrapped, things have been about as messy as that time the women all went to Abu Dhabi.

After series star Sarah Jessica Parker announced in September that the planned sequel was officially not happening, she’s been at odds with co-star Kim Cattrall, whose rumored on-set behavior and last-minute departure from the project reportedly caused the shutdown ― though Cattrall has insisted otherwise.

However, the story took a tragic turn when Cattrall’s brother Chris was found dead in Canada days after he went missing. Both Parker and co-star Cynthia Nixon expressed their condolences over social media, but the two received very different responses.

Instagram

Cattrall initially thanked her “Sex and the City” co-stars and fans for their support. But in a separate post days later, she specifically dragged Parker for “exploiting” the tragedy in an attempt to “restore [her] nice girl persona.”

“Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now,” Cattrall captioned the post. “Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend.”

A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 10, 2018 at 5:20am PST

Cattrall’s response to Nixon, meanwhile, was completely different:

“Cynthia, hearing your voice meant so much to me,” she wrote on the post before disabling the comments, according to Us Weekly. “Thank you for reaching out. Love Kim #SexandtheCity.”

While it’s not clear whether Nixon had some additional form of communication with Cattrall during her time of need, it’s evident that their relationship is on far better terms.

Us Weekly

Parker has been in the midst of a press tour ahead of the second season of her HBO series “Divorce.” Asked to comment multiple times about her relationship with Cattrall, Parker said she was “just heartbroken,” and added, “I found it very upsetting because that’s not the way I recall our experience.”

Parker’s close friend Andy Cohen has also come to her defense, saying he believes “there’s only one person fighting here.”

“When you’re doing press, you’re asked the same questions about what’s going on. So people, I’m sure, were like, ‘What do you think of what happened?’” he said on his radio show. “And she simply and concisely expressed her condolences. I would not call that exploiting a tragedy. What was she supposed to do? Say something bad? I don’t understand.”San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich gave a blistering criticism of racism in the United States on Monday.

Popovich was speaking to reporters prior to Spurs’ game against the Utah Jazz, where he was asked about the National Basketball League’s promotion of Black History Month. The decorated coach didn’t hold back, discussing the obvious ties the sport has to the monthlong celebration of historic black figures and their contributions.

“I think it’s pretty obvious the league is made up of a lot of black guys,” Popovich told reporters. “To honor that and understand it is pretty simplistic. How would you ignore that? But more importantly, we live in a racist country that hasn’t figured it out yet.”

Popovich continued, addressing those who criticize Black History Month and why its important to continue to promote the event.

“And it’s always important to bring attention to it, even if it angers some people,” Popovich told reporters. “The point is that you have to keep it in front of everybody’s nose so that they understand it, that it still hasn’t been taken care of, and we have a lot of work to do.”

This isn’t the first time the coach has been openly political in his comments. Popovich has taken on President Donald Trump in the past, calling the man in the White House a “soulless coward” and a “pathological liar.”

Popovich also commented on Trump’s claims that he was the “least racist” person in January, after the president referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole” countries.At a press briefing last week with International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams, there was stern talk about a country of cheaters so shot through with a gold-at-all-costs mentality that they countenanced the systematic exploitation of Olympic athletes.

And when they weren’t talking about the United States, they talked some about Russia.

“I join everyone by saying how appalling this is and how appalled as a parent you can be when you read these things,” Adams said to reporters, referring to the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case that has consumed USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee. Moments earlier, he had addressed a mild softening of the IOC’s ban on Russian athletes from the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, vamping about “democracy and liberty and freedom.”

It was a revealing moment, a pair of Olympic scandals meeting on the eve of the Winter Games, which began in earnest Friday. In Adams’ fluent institutionalese — his “guidelines” and “briefings” and “processes” and “agenda” — the grotesque particulars of the two cases fell away, and you could begin to see the essential similarities.

These were both scandals of entrenched abuse, born in one instance and deepened in the other out of a desire to win. Because of a wish for Olympic superiority, Russia’s Olympic Committee systematically drugged its athletes. Because of a wish for Olympic superiority, the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics failed to protect their athletes from the interweaving of emotional and sexual abuse.

So why not ban the United States? By what moral logic are the Russians any more deserving of punishment than Americans?

Part of the U.S.’s evasion of culpability here derives from how the country has structured its institutions. Americans have a well-established doping regime, too; it’s just privatized and corporatized, like America itself. By law, the USOC, which is said to have covered up more than 100 positive tests from 1988 to 2000, receives no public funding, and the job of exotic chemical experimentation on the athletes tends to fall to outfits like the Nike Oregon Project. The USOC itself operates according to a statutory federalism by which governing bodies oversee their own sports.

One result of such an arrangement is that the United States gets to distribute its guilt among its subsidiaries. No doping program could ever be “state-sponsored” here for the simple reason that the state doesn’t sponsor much of anything. Plausible deniability is America’s strongest Olympic event.

“I hold the USOC directly accountable. I’ve been trying to alert them to this problem. Their legal defense, if you follow the court cases, is, ‘It’s not our problem.’” - Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead-Makar

The Nassar cover-up, involving crimes vastly more heinous than doping, pierces our national impunity. It’s an even bigger affront to the preposterous ideal of “clean” and “pure” sport: a two-decade scheme, implicating Olympic officials and public officials alike, that allowed Nassar to continually sexually abuse and assault more than 250 female athletes ― including multiple gold medal-winning American gymnasts ― in his capacity as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. A phrase comes to mind: state-sponsored.

Nassar, in fact, was so ingrained in America’s Olympic program and so relentless in preying on young athletes that he abused gymnast Aly Raisman during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The USOC, meanwhile, turned a blind eye to Nassar’s abuse and ignored his victims, Raisman said in the victim statement she read in the courtroom during Nassar’s sentencing hearing in January.

“They say now they applaud those who have spoken out, but it’s easier to say that now,” Raisman said. “When the brave women who started speaking out back then, more than a year after the USOC says they knew about Nassar, they were dismissed. At the 2016 Olympic Games, the president of the USOC said that the USOC would not conduct an investigation and even defended USA Gymnastics as one of the leaders in developing policies to protect athletes. That’s the response a courageous woman gets when she speaks out? And when others joined those athletes and began speaking out with more stories of abuse, were they acknowledged? No. It is like being abused all over again.”

“I have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully, and both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,” she continued. “But did they reach out when I came forward? No. So, at this point, talk is worthless to me. We’re dealing with real lives in the future of our sport. We need to believe this won’t happen again.”

It wasn’t just that the USOC and USA Gymnastics didn’t listen. Certain members of the two organizations seem to have actively protected Nassar, while the policies the groups adopted continued to provide him the power and the platform to molest and abuse his victims.

Gymnasts for the national team were trained in the emotionally abusive environment of Karolyi Ranch in Texas, against which Nassar could pose as a kindly, sympathetic figure.

“I always felt like I got in trouble,” 2000 Olympian Jamie Dantzscher told “60 Minutes” a year ago. “I wasn’t working hard enough. I was told to lose weight. At one point, I started making myself throw up.” Nassar, she said, “was like my buddy. He was on my side.” Getting medical treatment from him “was kind of like a bright light,” she said, even though it was under the guise of treatment that Nassar was also sexually abusing her.

The USOC and USA Gymnastics required that gymnasts go through Nassar’s treatments. If they refused, they jeopardized their place on the team. USA Gymnastics officials and coaches, like Nassar’s close friend and top gymnastics coach John Geddert, continued to leave Nassar alone with girls and young women (Geddert is now the subject of a criminal investigation). And the USOC and USA Gymnastics continued to do nothing, even after women began coming forward years ago.

After Nassar’s sentencing in January, the USOC sent a letter of apology to Nassar’s victims. But until then it had taken almost no responsibility for its role in the scandal, and even its apology contained hardly any internal reckoning over the fact that the most successful period in U.S. women’s gymnastics history ― a team gold in 1996 and two more in 2012 and 2016 ― occurred under the specter of sexual abuse with which the USOC and USA Gymnastics were complicit.

“I hold the USOC directly accountable,” Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic swimmer who has spent years advocating for policy changes to protect female athletes, told HuffPost. “I’ve been working with the USOC for eight years, and trying to alert them to this problem. Their legal defense, if you follow the court cases, is, ‘It’s not our problem.’”

And even now, top USOC officials have refused to admit any culpability in Nassar’s crimes. CEO Scott Blackmun will keep his job, at least until the conclusion of an independent investigation, USOC Chairman Larry Probst said at a news conference in Pyeongchang on Friday, even though it’s unclear how independent that investigation really is.

“We are far from unscathed,” Probst said. “There’s been a tremendous amount of criticism about the USOC. We think that we did what we were supposed to do. Could we have done more? Of course, we could always do more.”

The entire board of directors for USA Gymnastics resigned in January. But before that, the organization asked a federal judge to dismiss a civil suit against it and said that information from Nassar’s accusers “did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred,” that it “never attempted to hide Nassar’s misconduct” and that, “while Nassar is liable to the plaintiffs, USAG is not.”

So far, beyond the courts, the only meaningful reckoning with the Nassar scandal is happening in Congress, of all places. The House passed a law in the wake of Nassar’s sentencing that will increase mandatory reporting requirements for officials at athletic federations, such as USA Gymnastics and the USOC. More congressional scrutiny could soon follow, especially given fresh awareness that similar problems exist in USA Swimming and across the U.S. Olympic program, too.

But Americans, brought up on the old impunity, loyal to their own flag, seem loath to see Nassar as evidence of the sort of far-reaching institutional rot they’re quick to ascribe to more centralized Olympic programs, such as Russia’s. Commenters almost universally cheered the banning of an entire federation over doping; not a soul has called for the banning of the United States over state-sponsored sexual assault. This gets things exactly backward.

Doping, like all crises surrounding drug use, is a moral panic. There’s little credible evidence that a ban like the one the IOC handed Russia will do anything to address the sort of illicit chemical enhancements that have always been the Olympics’ worst-kept secret. Prohibitionism hasn’t worked so far. Hard-line prohibitionism won’t work any better.

State-sponsored sexual assault, on the other hand, is a moral calamity — a failing that calls into question not just the integrity of the competition and of the organizations that engage in it, but their very existence. Nassar’s crimes were real crimes; our Olympics institutions enabled them and exacerbated them, and the rot spread beyond sports into the public realm.

A ban would make it clear, to Americans and to the world, that the people who run the USOC are complicit in the evil that happens on their watch, even if the structure of our Olympic project is explicitly designed to ensure their hands are always clean.

“Right now, you’re just an organization who allowed predators and abuse to happen,” 1996 gold medal-winning gymnast Dominique Moceanu said at a January news conference in Washington. She was talking about USA Gymnastics, but she might as well have been talking about the whole of the U.S. Olympics system. “You have to redefine, what are we moving forward? Let’s... have a fresh start, almost as if it’s a new organization.”

Some time away from Olympic competition might just help. Ban us.
