Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reportedly wishes he had never picked former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) as a running mate for his unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign.

According to The New York Times, McCain had considered Joe Lieberman, then an independent senator from Connecticut, for the job of vice president. However, advisors warned against picking the longtime member of the Democratic Party who still caucused with them.

“It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,” McCain wrote in his upcoming autobiography, “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights and Other Appreciations,” per the Times. “But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.”

In an upcoming HBO documentary, McCain described his decision to not select Lieberman as “another mistake that I made.”

Lieberman, who endorsed McCain and spoke at the Republican National Convention on the senator’s behalf, had run for vice president as a Democrat on the 2000 ticket headed by Al Gore.

In an excerpt of the book posted online by NPR, McCain called Palin “a popular, energetic and accomplished reformer.” But he also admitted there were some problems.

“She stumbled in some interviews and had a few misjudgments in the glare of the ceaseless spotlight,” McCain wrote. “Those missteps too are on me. She didn’t put herself on the ticket. I did.”

The duo ultimately lost to Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

Palin resigned as governor of Alaska the following year and became a leading voice of the “Tea Party” movement.

McCain, 81, is now battling brain cancer. “The Restless Wave” will be released later this month.

Urine trouble now!

A woman in Aurora, Colorado, has been cited for property damage after she allegedly used a 7-Eleven microwave to heat up a white plastic bottle filled with urine on Thursday morning.

The bottle blew up in the process, and the pee ended up dripping out of the microwave, according to Denver NBC affiliate KUSA.

When the bottle exploded, 26-year-old Angelique Sanchez allegedly left the convenience store.

As you might expect, the on-duty clerk was pissed.

She told police she threatened to call law enforcement if Sanchez didn’t clean up the mess, according to KOAA, the NBC affiliate in Pueblo.

According to the police report, Sanchez did come back and wiped up the microwave, but she apparently just took napkins and wiped the substance on the floor before walking out again.

That’s when police were called.

Responding officers found Sanchez at a nearby clinic where she was due to take a urinalysis test for a potential employer, according to the Associated Press.

When confronted, Sanchez reportedly told the police officer that “she had cleaned up the mess and did not understand the problem,” according to a police report obtained by KUSA.

“When I reminded her that urine blew up where people prepare their food, she told me it was not real urine,” the officer wrote in the report.Paige Patterson, who heads the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, is a leading figure among Southern Baptists. Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary

Evangelical women from the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. are publicly voicing their dismay over an influential leader’s “inappropriate” statements about domestic violence and women’s bodies.

Hundreds of women who attend churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention have signed a petition calling for “decisive action” in response to “damaging, sinful” comments made by Dr. Paige Patterson, president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and a prominent SBC leader.

The open letter, addressed to the seminary’s board of trustees, asks them to take a strong stand against “unbiblical teaching regarding womanhood, sexuality, and domestic violence.”

“The world is watching us all, brothers. They wonder how we could possibly be part of a denomination that counts Dr. Patterson as a leader,” the letter reads. “The Southern Baptist Convention cannot allow the biblical view of leadership to be misused in such a way that a leader with an unbiblical view of authority, womanhood, and sexuality be allowed to continue in leadership.”

Patterson has recently come under scrutiny after a 2000 audio clip resurfaced online in which he advised physically abused wives to stay in abusive relationships, “be submissive in every way” and try as hard as possible not to get divorced. He clarified early last week that at times, he has counseled abused women to leave ― albeit not divorce ― their husbands and report what was happening to the police. However, he said he still thinks that in cases of “non-injurious” abuse, women might choose to “pray through” the situation rather than leave their husbands.

HuffPost’s requests for comment from Patterson and the seminary were not returned. But on Friday, Patterson told The Washington Post that he couldn’t “apologize for what I didn’t do wrong.”

Some evangelicals’ overly broad reading of wives’ duty to submit to their husbands, coupled with the belief that divorce should be avoided at all costs, produces a “potent and literally deadly” combination that leads many women to keep enduring abuse, Katelyn Beaty, an editor-at-large at Christianity Today, told HuffPost last week.

“It leads pastors like Paige Patterson to justify or excuse domestic violence or to see it as the price of a godly marriage,” Beaty wrote in an email. “This is a gross departure from the biblical text as well as a grave departure from the pastor’s call to shepherd his members.”

In addition to the 2000 audio clip, the petition signers also referred to a video clip of a 2014 sermon, in which Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a young woman’s body. In the sermon, he talked about how God “beautifully and artistically” created women. To illustrate that point, he recalled a time when he spotted a 16-year-old girl after preaching at an event.

“She was nice,” Patterson said about the teenager, whom he also described as “a very attractive young co-ed.” He heard a young man near him comment, “Man, is she built.”

In his 2014 sermon, Patterson said he defended the young man by saying, “He’s just being biblical. That’s exactly what the Bible says.”

The women wrote in the petition that they were “shocked” by Patterson’s objectification of that teenage girl and the “inappropriate nature of his own observations of her body.”

Patterson appears in a promotional video for the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary below.

The online petition against Patterson was written to gather the signatures of Southern Baptist women, but Southern Baptist men and people from outside the denomination have also signed on ― including Rachael Denhollander, an evangelical Christian and the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse. As of Monday afternoon, over 2,000 individuals had signed the petition.

Karen Swallow Prior, a professor of English at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, told HuffPost that she signed the petition to call out a “blind spot.”

“There is a tremendous blind spot within the old guard of the Southern Baptist Convention, and that blind spot concerns the dignity and place of members who are not white men,” Prior told HuffPost in an email. “I don’t point this out in anger or bitterness, but in love, just as I would want my own blind spots pointed out to me.”

The petition had some early difficulties with false signatures, but Prior said the women behind the effort have since taken steps to remove clearly fake or duplicate names.

Patterson is a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, serving for two terms from 1998 to 2000. He’s credited with helping steer the SBC toward greater conservatism. He was elected to deliver the convention sermon at the SBC’s annual meeting in Dallas this June, which is considered an honor for a Southern Baptist pastor.

Other Southern Baptists have continued to offer their support. A petition defending Patterson had gathered over 100 signatures on Monday afternoon.

Roger “Sing” Oldham, a spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention’s executive committee, told HuffPost that the SBC’s current statement of faith ― which was revised under Patterson’s leadership in 2000 ― calls on Southern Baptists to “provide for the abused in society” and for “husband and wife to live up to the highest ideals of Christian conduct.”

Oldham said the SBC also affirms the right of Southern Baptists to express their opinions about convention leaders. However, he said the executive committee does not have authority over or choose to comment on the business of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary’s board of trustees.

On Sunday, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary announced that Patterson had asked the board of trustees to convene on May 22 “in light of recent events.”

Prior said she hopes Patterson and other SBC leaders are ultimately able to recognize and repent of the ways they’ve fallen short.Gloria Steinem in the first episode of Everlane's "Human Heroes" series. Everlane

Even Gloria Steinem is blown away by the recent wave of energy and activism that’s exploded since President Donald Trump took office.

“I’ve never seen this much activism in my life,” the iconic feminist and social justice activist told clothing company Everlane, referring to gun control activism, the Women’s March and the increasing number of women running for office. “It’s way, way more than anything I’ve ever seen,” she noted.

Steinem, 84, is the first activist to sit down with Everlane for the company’s new video series titled “Human Heroes.” The series debuted Monday morning and highlights people who “have dedicated their lives to empowering their communities and making a difference,” according to Glamour.

The historic activist, who got her start as a writer for New York Magazine in 1968, told Everlane that writing was an integral introduction to organizing.

“I always wanted to be a writer but thanks to the women’s movement especially my life came together because I realized that as a writer I could make visible that which had been invisible,” she said.

Steinem added that the most recent wave of young feminists gives her energy and, in turn, she brings them hope.

“It’s a great trade. We’re better together, right?” she said.

Alex Spunt, head of creative at Everlane, told Glamour that the series is promoting “radical transparency,” which is part of the clothing company’s mission statement.

“Defending human rights has been core to our mission of Radical Transparency from the very beginning,” Spunt said. “The Human Heroes series is our way of highlighting individuals who fight for those rights every single day ― and Gloria Steinem is the ultimate Human Hero. For over 50 years she’s fought on behalf of disempowered and disenfranchised women all over the globe and even now, at 84 years old, she still uses her voice to educate and inspire every day.”

Impoverished North Korea has been hit by a series of U.N. and U.S. sanctions in recent years in a bid to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed “complete denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula in the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade on April 27, but the declaration did not include concrete steps to reach that goal.

The North’s official KCNA news agency said Washington was “misleading public opinion” by claiming the denuclearization pledge was the result of sanctions and other pressure.

The United States should not “deliberately provoke” the North by moving to deploy strategic assets in South Korea and raising human rights issues, KCNA said, citing a foreign ministry spokesman.

“This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hardly-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.

It would not be conducive to resolving the issue of denuclearization if Washington miscalculated North Korea’s “peace-loving intention” as a sign of weakness and continued to pursue its pressure and military threats, KCNA said.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who plans to meet Kim over the next few weeks, has said he will maintain sanctions and pressure on the North and “not repeat the mistakes of past administrations” and has said his tough stance had led to the breakthrough.

Trump told the National Rifle Association’s annual convention in Dallas on Friday that he had toned down his rhetoric in anticipation of the talks after labeling Kim “Little Rocket Man” last year and threatening him with “fire and fury”.

Moon said Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the standoff with the North.

The White House said that Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, met his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, on Friday and both said there were no plans to change the U.S.–South Korea bilateral defense posture.

North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. South Korea said U.S. troops need to stay in the area even after a peace treaty is concluded to replace the armistice.

Hungary is more divided, and public debate more polarized. The country’s far-right populist leader rails against migrants, minorities and the media. Wages remain low, and much-vaunted tax breaks have come at a price. Critics say the government is raiding future benefits in a short-sighted attempt to pay for them.

“We have such a beautiful country. We have so many things we could be proud of,” said Imrenyi. “But we have to leave.”

She is not alone. A generation of young Hungarians has decided to move abroad as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has consolidated power in Hungary over the last eight years, remaking the country’s laws and cracking down on human rights groups.

Hungary, which has one of the world’s fastest-declining populations, is facing a demographic crisis. The United Nations projects there will be at least 15 percent fewer people in the country by 2050.

But rather than counter this crisis by taking in more migrants ― as Germany, for example, has done ― Hungary has effectively shut its borders. Meanwhile, economic opportunities abroad, divisive rhetoric and the rise of ethnonationalism are driving many young people away.

Some Hungarian Jews are particularly concerned. The country, home to between 35,000 and 120,000 Jewish people, has a long history of anti-Semitism, with anti-Jewish laws and violence preceding the Nazi occupation of Hungary. During the Holocaust, more than 440,000 Hungarian Jews were rounded up in less than three months and sent to their deaths in Auschwitz and other death camps.

Against this historical backdrop, some Hungarians are especially worried by the bigoted and anti-Semitic political rhetoric.

“You don’t really want to live in a country that’s full of hate,” said Adam Schonberger, leader of the Jewish community group Marom, which operates a hub for different minority rights organizations. “A lot of people either already left or are planning to leave. A lot.”

“You don't really want to live in a country that's full of hate.” - Adam Schonberger, leader of the Jewish community group Marom

A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found around 1 in 4 Hungarians wouldn’t accept Jews as members of their family and about 1 in 6 wouldn’t accept a Jewish neighbor. While the official number of reported hate crimes in Hungary is low, rights groups charge that the government rarely prosecutes hate crimes as such, so it’s hard to determine the exact extent of discrimination and violence against minority groups.

The Hungarian government has long demonized the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, alleging that the 87-year-old philanthropist has used his wealth to conspire against the government. Jewish groups say Orbán and other government officials have used classic anti-Semitic tropes in their attacks on Soros, who is Jewish.

“When he says Soros, what Hungarians on the right hear is ‘Jewish banker,’” said R. Daniel Keleman, a political science professor at Rutgers University. “In Hungary, he’s just a stand-in for age-old conspiracy theories.”

Orbán has also praised the self-described anti-Semite Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s leader from 1920 to 1944. And Orbán’s government erected a controversial statue in 2014 that depicts the country as a blameless victim of Nazi aggression, with an eagle embodying the German occupation attacking an angel, representing Hungary.

“Anti-Semitism [in Hungary] is very strong and getting stronger all the time,” said Maria Heller, a 65-year-old sociology professor who, along with a group of Holocaust survivors and Jewish activists, responded to the statue by building a counter-memorial where they continue to gather in protest of what they say is the government’s attempt to whitewash the country’s part in the Holocaust.

Orban’s spokesman Zoltan Kovacs called allegations of anti-Semitism “the last resort” of liberals.

At a recent morning service at a Budapest synagogue, 44-year-old mathematician Pal Hegedus was one of the few in attendance. He, too, is worried that the dark rhetoric could have even darker consequences.

“It builds up hatred in people and, if the wind changes in politics, it can be turned against anyone,” said Hegedus, who recently had to explain the government’s campaign against Soros to his two school-age children. “It’s not just Hungary. Everywhere you go, this fascist attitude is ... rising.”

“Anti-Semitism [in Hungary] is very strong and getting stronger all the time.” - Maria Heller, sociology professor

Beyond attacks on Soros, Orbán’s primary targets are refugees and migrants, whom he refers to as “Muslim invaders.” During the election campaign, his party put up posters throughout the country urging Hungarians to stop migration, while Orbán called for “ethnic homogeneity” in Hungary.

Kovacs, Orbán’s spokesman, told HuffPost that Islam is incompatible with Hungarian society and values.

“Islam represents a different culture – full stop,” Kovacs said. “You reach a ratio of Muslim people in a country ... the rules of the game are going to change and we want to avoid that.”

Only 0.4 percent of people in Hungary are Muslim.

While government officials often boast of having saved the country from a fiscal abyss, critics say that the country’s economic growth has partially been fueled by European Union funds and hides more structural inequalities.

And economic progress hasn’t stopped emigration.

Companies say they can’t find qualified workers, while Hungarians complain that social services such as health care lag behind other European countries. As many as half Hungary’s family doctors are projected to emigrate or retire in the next decade.

“There’s an effective brain drain in Hungary,” said Csaba Toth, an analyst at the Republikon Institute, a liberal think tank. “The highest skilled and most talented people are leaving the country.”

Julia Des, the director of the Haver Informal Jewish Education Foundation, has seen this firsthand.

When the 35-year-old mother of two throws a party, she has to turn on Skype to see the many friends who have already moved abroad. About half the people in her social circle have left the country, and her brother and his family intend to leave for Austria later this year.Pakistani miners carry an injured colleague to the hospital after the collapse of coal mine in Quetta on May 5, 2018.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - The death toll from Saturday’s coal mine blast and landslides in southwest Pakistan climbed to 23 on Sunday, officials said, after ending their rescue operation.

At least 16 miners died on Saturday and more than a dozen were trapped after an explosion in a mine in the Marwar coalfields in Baluchistan province, Director of Disaster Management Attaullah Khan said.

A methane gas build-up inside the mine caused the blast, Khan said. Chief inspector of mines Iftikhar Ahmad said the rescue operation overnight pulled out 11 injured miners.

He said two laborers died in a landslide on Saturday in another mine in Surrang coalfields. It was not immediately clear if that was caused by the explosion.

“Rescuers retrieved five more bodies from this mine,” he said.

Another official, Mohammad Atif, said authorities had opened an investigation after sealing both mines.

Accidents are frequent in the province’s mines, where safety measures are basic and many of the workforce come from other parts of Pakistan.

The mines are mostly owned by state-run Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, which leases many of them to private contractors.

The country has huge coal reserves estimated at more than 184 billion tonnes. It produces 4 million tonnes of coal annually, most of which is consumed by brick-making kilns.

The Marwar and Surrang coalfields lie east of Baluchistan’s capital Quetta.BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese voted in their first general election for nine years on Sunday, with the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group and its allies expecting to emerge stronger, a result that would affirm Iran’s regional ascendancy from its own borders to the Mediterranean.

Sunni Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri is frontrunner to keep his job and form a new coalition government after an election seen as vital to Lebanon’s economic stability, but his Future Movement was widely expected to lose seats.

For many younger Lebanese, Sunday brought a first chance to vote in a national election after parliament twice extended a term that expired in 2013, but Interior Ministry figures from early in the day suggested turnout would be low.

President Michel Aoun appeared on television late in the afternoon to urge people to vote. Voting ended at 7 p.m. to all except those already waiting in polling stations.

Although the election used a new proportional system, many voters said they expected the country’s entrenched, sectarian elite to remain on top but others were optimistic.

“We hope we will open a new era,” said Mahmoud Daouk, voting in Beirut in one of the areas where new faces were taking on the old sectarian elite.

Party flags flew from cars and mopeds, loudspeakers blared campaign songs and young people wore T-shirts bearing the faces of political leaders.

The vote was held under a new proportional system that has confused some voters and made the contest more unpredictable.

But it still preserves a sectarian power-sharing system and another coalition government including most of the major parties, like the one Hariri has led since 2016, looks likely, analysts say.

While foreign monitors gave a generally positive assessment, tensions flared in several locations. Missiles were thrown during street clashes in Beirut, a candidate claimed her car was attacked in the Bekaa Valley town of Zahle, and rival groups clashed in the northern city of Tripoli.In a potentially ground-breaking move, a British data watchdog has ordered Cambridge Analytica to turn over all the information it collected on an American voter, including any personal data from Facebook.

The firm, founded by key Trump supporters Robert and Rebekah Mercer and overseen by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, is closing shop following accusations that it helped itself to personal data allegedly collected by subterfuge from Facebook users for targeted political messages.

If the order by the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office isn’t shot down on appeal, it could open the way for court action in Britain by as many as 240 million Facebook users whose personal data was also believed to be collected by Cambridge Analytica.

The firm announced Wednesday it’s declaring bankruptcy and shutting down operations, but the U.K. information commissioner warned that ignoring the order would be considered a “criminal offense,” The Guardian reported. It has 30 days to provide the information or face an “unlimited fine.”

“The company has consistently refused to co-operate with our investigation into this case and has refused to answer our specific enquiries in relation to the complainant’s personal data — what they had, where they got it from and on what legal basis they held it,” Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham wrote.

Parsons School of Design associate professor David Carroll brought his case to the Information Commissioner’s Office under Britain’s data protection act after he found out that data had been gathered on him.

“This should solve a lot of mysteries about what the company did with data and where it got it from,” he told The Guardian.

Cambridge Analytica initially worked on Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) presidential campaign, then it switched to Trump’s campaign.

A whistleblower revealed in March that a University of Cambridge psychology professor gathered enormous amounts of personal information from Facebook users under the guise of personality tests in a Facebook app. The information was then sold to Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2015. Data may have been harvested from as many as 240 million Facebook accounts.

Facebook told Cambridge Analytica to destroy the information, but it never followed up, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Facebook said in a statement in mid-March that it had only discovered days earlier that not all harvested data had been destroyed by Cambridge Analytica. It then suspended the firm from its social media platform.

Cambridge Analytica denied improperly obtaining or hanging on to the data.

Facebook: Hey, delete that bro, okay?

Attacker: Okay, I guess.



Facebook: You really deleted it?

Attacker: Nah — Alt US Cyber Command (@AltCyberCommand) March 17, 2018

The suspected massive breach has raised some calls in Congress to institute tough new privacy protections concerning Facebook and other social media. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before committees in both houses of Congress last month as part of the fallout.

Wylie said Cambridge Analytica used the enormous amounts of personal data it harvested through Facebook to “fight a culture war in America.”When Di’Angelo Groves walked across the stage at his college graduation in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday, he was supposed to do it with DeEbony Groves, his sister.

Both of them were to get their diplomas from Belmont University, but instead, Di’Angelo was joined by his mother, Shirl Baker, who proudly accepted DeEbony’s diploma on her daughter’s behalf. DeEbony Groves, 21, was one of four people gunned down at a Waffle House restaurant two weeks ago.

“Almost two weeks ago our community suffered an unimaginable loss,” Robert Fisher, Belmont’s president, told the audience. “While our hearts were broken, today we have the chance to celebrate DeEbony’s life together.”

Baker marched across the stage to a standing ovation as she received her late child’s diploma, after briefly comforting her grieving son, the first graduate to walk.

DeEbony Groves was in her senior year studying social work when authorities said she was fatally shot at random alongside her friend, 23-year-old Akilah DaSilva, in the early morning hours of April 22.

At her funeral, Waffle House CEO Walt Ehmer recounted hearing from survivors how DeEbony had spent her last moments singing gospel songs inside the restaurant. The last song that DeEbony and her friend had been heard singing was “Jesus Loves Me,” Ehmer said.

Fisher mentioned that singing during Saturday’s commencement ceremony, suggesting that she had made it to “heaven’s gate.”

In her honor, Belmont has announced that it is renaming a social work scholarship after DeEbony Groves.

DeEbony Groves, 21, was one of four people who lost their lives in the April 22 shooting. FacebookOhio voters will decide Tuesday whether to reshape the way congressional lines are drawn in the state.

They’ll be considering Issue 1, a ballot measure to amend the state constitution that would make it much harder for state legislators to draw congressional districts to egregiously benefit whichever party is in power.

Proponents concede the plan isn’t perfect, but say it would be a vast improvement over the current system, which essentially lets the majority draw the map. And it has overwhelming bipartisan support, qualifying for the ballot after a landslide vote in the GOP-controlled Ohio Legislature this February.

“The issue that will be on the ballot this May will be a significant step forward for the state of Ohio,” state Senate President Larry Obhof (R) said at the time. “It will ensure bipartisan cooperation in future congressional redistricting processes. It will help keep communities of interest whole and in particular protect townships, cities, counties from being divided when they don’t need to be.”

The proposal represents an unusual consensus around gerrymandering. For decades, both the Republican and Democratic majorities have used the current system to their respective party’s benefit, often setting off nasty and protracted legal disputes.

It’s an issue that’s playing out in states across the country, and nationally at the U.S. Supreme Court as it tries to figure out if partisan gerrymandering can be so egregious that it violates the U.S. Constitution.

The Proposal

The Ohio measure offers a complicated solution that’s born of bipartisan compromise. The plan ― which would go into effect in 2021 ― is meant to ensure that both parties have a say, setting out four different pathways for the state to adopt a congressional map.

State lawmakers currently control the congressional redistricting process, and they would continue to do so if the proposal passes. However, they would need a 60 percent supermajority to pass a congressional map. Among that 60 percent, they would also need the support of 50 percent of lawmakers in the minority party.

If lawmakers fail to pass a map under those conditions, a seven-member bipartisan commission would take control. To help ensure bipartisan support, the commission could only pass a map if two appointees from the minority party in the Legislature support it.

If the commission can’t agree on a plan, lawmakers would get a second crack. They would still need the support of 60 percent of the Legislature to adopt a plan, but this time they would only need the backing of one-third of the minority party.

“You need to keep these political subdivisions whole. That reins in all kinds of shenanigans.” - Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio

And if all that fails, lawmakers could then pass a map with a simple majority vote ― with restrictions. A map that “unduly favors or disfavors” one political party or its incumbents would be prohibited. Likewise for any effort to “unduly split” localities.

Lawmakers would also have to provide a rationale for the map they adopt, and if they go Route No. 4 would have to do the whole thing again in four years ― after two congressional elections ― instead of the usual 10.

The proposal also includes safeguards intended to prevent lawmakers from “cracking” groups of voters among different districts. At least 65 of the state’s 88 counties must remain intact ― that is, they can’t be split between two or more congressional districts. As for counties that do get split up, no more than 18 can be divided between two districts, and no more than five can straddle three.

The public would also have a say, with the right to weigh in through hearings or even to submit outside plans. Advocates say this will make the redistricting process more transparent.

Bipartisan Support

Among the measure’s champions is a coalition called Fair Districts = Fair Elections, which includes good government groups such as the Ohio chapters of the League of Women Voters and Common Cause. They say the proposal will rein in egregious and extreme partisan gerrymandering.

But, importantly, the measure also has buy-in from Republicans, who control both chambers of the Ohio Legislature and currently benefit from gerrymandering.

The GOP controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and drew a congressional plan that heavily favored the party. In every congressional election since, Republicans have been able to win 12 of the state’s 16 congressional seats with only around 50 percent of the statewide popular vote. The Brennan Center for Justice estimates that Republicans have two to three additional seats in Congress because of gerrymandering in Ohio.

Richard Gunther, a professor emeritus at Ohio State University who helped draft the proposal, said “the only reason” Republicans were motivated to support the proposal was to head off a competing one. Activists had already collected 225,000 signatures for a separate measure that would have taken redistricting out of the hands of the Legislature entirely and given it to the bipartisan commission. If Issue 1 fails, Gunther said, there will be a push to get that proposal on the November ballot.

Some are uneasy about Issue 1 and question whether it will produce meaningful reform.

Mike Brickner, senior policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, wrote in April that the group was staying neutral. He expressed concern that Issue 1 would incentivize the party in power to propose a plan that could only be passed by majority vote.

“Although Issue 1 has some features that could improve redistricting in our state, we believe that it does not provide comprehensive reform and could open the door for future partisan manipulation,” he wrote, adding later: “Even under the methods that do demand some bipartisan support, there remains the potential for coercion of the minority party and deal-making that is not in the best interest of the voters.”

“If one party suspects that the plan favors one party over another, the bill will never pass and the parties will never agree.” - State Rep. Nino Vitale, who opposes Issue 1

State Rep. Nino Vitale (R), who was one of just 10 members of the Ohio House to vote against putting the plan on the ballot, wrote a Facebook post last month explaining his objections. He said the proposal would likely result in new congressional maps being drawn every four years and wouldn’t reflect the most up-to-date population data since the census is only conducted every 10 years. The proposal would also allow members of the commission to do the bidding of partisan elected officials, he argued.

“If one party suspects that the plan favors one party over another, the bill will never pass and the parties will never agree, almost guaranteeing that the plan with go to the unelected commission,” he wrote. “That’s not good representative government.”

Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio who has helped lead the Fair Districts = Fair Elections coalition in Ohio, admitted that the proposal didn’t eliminate “every possible shenanigan.” But she said it would impose strict rules that would limit just how partisan a majority map passed by majority vote could be.

“You have the four-year map, but the rules then become tighter,” she said. “It goes to basically saying you need to keep these political subdivisions whole. That reins in all kinds of shenanigans.”

Plus, she added, requiring lawmakers to provide a justification for the map they adopt would make it easier to challenge the map in court if it is unfair.

The League of Women Voters of Ohio has unsuccessfully pushed to get redistricting reform on the ballot four times since 1981. In 2015, Ohio voters overwhelmingly passed an initiative to put a bipartisan commission in charge of redistricting for the state Legislature.

Gunther recognized that the proposal was imperfect, but acknowledged that because it was a compromise it had “a very strong probability of passage.”

AdvertisementWoody Allen’s son Moses Farrow came to the filmmaker’s defense on Wednesday in a long essay that accused his mother, Mia Farrow, of child abuse.

Farrow, 40, disputed sister Dylan’s claim that Allen sexually abused her as a child and blamed their mother for years of turmoil in their household.

“I’m a very private person and not at all interested in public attention,” Farrow wrote in an entry on his blog titled, “A Son Speaks Out.” “But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.”

Allen has denied Dylan Farrow’s claims, and no charges were filed after an investigation. But the accusations have resurfaced amid the Me Too movement against sexual misconduct, and Allen has been reduced to a pariah in some circles. Some actors have denounced him or donated salaries they earned on Allen films.

Moses Farrow wrote that the abuse his sister alleges never happened, and pointed to what he said were inconsistencies in her claim. Of Dylan’s recollection that she was abused in an attic while Allen asked her to play with an electric train, Moses said there was no train in the attic and the space was too small for anyone to play there.

Mia Farrow, Moses wrote, had been telling the children for months that their father was a “monster,” he added. “None of us would have allowed Dylan to step away with Woody, even if he tried.”

It was Mia Farrow, Moses wrote, who was the abuser. He said she struck him multiple times, and once made him strip and stand in a corner. She dragged physically disabled siblings down a stairway and locked them into a closet, he claimed.

She punished her son Thaddeus, a paraplegic, by shutting him in an outdoor shed overnight, Moses said. She was especially hard on Soon-Yi Previn, Allen’s future wife, Moses wrote. Farrow threw a porcelain centerpiece at her head and beat her with a telephone, he alleged.

“For all of us, life under my mother’s roof was impossible if you didn’t do exactly what you were told, no matter how questionable the demand,” Moses wrote. “It was important to my mother to project to the world a picture of a happy blended household of both biological and adopted children, but this was far from the truth.”

Dylan Farrow responded to her brother’s claims with a statement on Twitter, calling them “beyond hurtful to me” and “easily disproven.”

A rep for Woody Allen declined to comment. Mia Farrow’s rep didn’t immediately respond.“Saturday Night Live” married the sheer terror of “A Quiet Place” with the horrifying comments of Kanye West in a hilarious monster mash.

But Glover can’t shut up about tweets he’s reading on his phone by Kanye.

“You guys, Kanye just tweeted,” Glover says excitedly. “He said he would have voted for Trump.” Thompson finally exclaims when he sees Kanye’s MAGA hat on Glover’s phone: “Oh, come on, Kanye!” And he’s snatched by a monster.

“Kanye is a distraction. We should only talk about what’s important,” Bryant insists.

“Like how to survive the monsters,” Bennett points out.

“And then I guess, also, like, the midterms because what’s happening with that?” Bryant asks.

Strong vanishes after she mouths off about Chrissy Tiegen’s friendship with Kanye and Tiegen’s baby shower. Then Bryant mulls aloud about the “poopity scoop” lyric in the new Kanye song “Lift Yourself” as she plays it on Glover’s phone. Gone.

Bennett is snatched when he can’t shut up about Kanye’s observation that slavery was a “choice.”

Glover’s the last to go.Tens of thousands of National Rifle Association members descended on Dallas this week for the gun advocacy group’s 147th annual meeting ― once again with an assist from President Donald Trump.

Ahead of the event, which ran from Thursday to Sunday, the NRA said that 80,000 members would be attending and billed it as the largest in the organization’s history. But outside the convention center, another crowd assembled to protest the NRA’s efforts to stifle gun control laws.

In the year since the last meeting, the U.S. had its deadliest mass shooting in recent history when a gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds in Las Vegas. And it saw a powerful uprising of young gun control advocates after a shooter gunned down 17 students and faculty members at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

The meeting was also a chance for commerce, with vendors taking orders for firearms, and it gave Trump a chance to address the crowd for the fourth year in a row. This year, people lined up hours early to get into the arena where he regurgitated many of his favorite pro-gun talking points.

Take a look at photos from the annual event below:

Britain’s homicide rate is a fraction of America’s.

Trump told the NRA convention in Dallas on Friday that a “once very prestigious” London hospital was “like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds.” He said London has “unbelievably tough gun laws,” adding, “they don’t have guns; they have knives and instead there’s blood all over the floors of this hospital.”

He then stabbed the air several times, pretending to hold a knife, as he uttered, “Knives, knives, knives.”

London political leaders and physicians condemned Trump’s remarks and called any implication that guns would stem a troubling increase in knife violence outlandish.

“To suggest guns are part of the solution is ridiculous,” said surgeon Karim Brohi of the Royal London Hospital in a statement. “Gunshot wounds are at least twice as lethal as knife injuries and more difficult to repair.”

Britain effectively banned handgun ownership after a 1996 school shooting.

According to figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the murder rate in the U.S. is approximately five times higher than Britain’s. There were 4.9 intentional homicides per 100,000 people in 2015 in the U.S. and .90 per 100,000 in 2014 in Britain, according to the U.N. statistics.

“Trump lies on everything,” former British justice secretary Charlie Falconer said before contrasting the nations’ murder rates. He also said such comments hurt relations between the countries.

“Trump makes Londoners dislike him more, and the U.S. dislike London more,” he told The Guardian. “Trump gives the impression he couldn’t give a fig.”

4.88 per 100000 murdered in US per annum, 0.92 per 100000 in UK. Implication UK has similar murder rate to US except knives not guns obviously false. Trump lies on everything, but lots of people in US now believe London a knife-armed war zone. https://t.co/4G9JGLeWBg — Charlie Falconer (@LordCFalconer) May 4, 2018

Trauma surgeon Martin Griffiths of the Royal London Hospital complained recently about the increase in knife crime — which rose 21 percent last year in the U.K. — in a BBC Radio interview that was picked up by Breitbart. That was likely the source of Trump’s comments. At least 35 people were fatally stabbed in London by April of this year.

But despite the recent spike, London remains safe compared to a number American cities, the BBC recently reported. In 2017, London’s murder rate per 100,000 people was 1.2. New York City’s rate was nearly three times higher. Baltimore’s rate was more than 45 times higher than London’s, according to FBI data.

In a tweet Saturday, Griffiths indicated that Trump missed his point about London violence entirely with an animation showing the words “the point” floating over the head of a stick figure. He offered to invite Trump to “my (prestigious) hospital” to meet with London’s police commissioner and mayor to discuss the city’s success in reducing violence.

Trump reportedly plans to visit London in July. He’s expected to be greeted with protests.

On Friday, Trump also managed to disgust the French by acting out the 2015 terror attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris. He used his finger as an imaginary gun and said, “They took their time and gunned them down one by one. Boom! Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom.” He insisted armed civilians could have stopped the attack that killed a total of 130 people.

Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo blasted Trump’s comments as “contemptuous.” Former French president Francois Hollande called his remarks “shameful” and “obscene” in a tweet.

Les propos honteux et les simagrées obscènes de Donald Trump en disent long sur ce qu’il pense de la France et de ses valeurs. L’amitié entre nos deux peuples ne sera pas entachée par l’irrespect et l’outrance. Toutes mes pensées vont aux victimes du 13 novembre. — François Hollande (@fhollande) May 5, 2018

France’s Foreign Office said in a statement: “France expresses its firm disapproval of President Trump’s comments about the Paris attacks ... and demands that the memory of the victims be respected. France is proud to be a country where acquiring and carrying firearms is strictly regulated.”A gunman who targeted cars on a Georgia highway on Friday, injuring three people, “idolized” the suspected shooter in the massacre in Parkland, Florida, according to police.

Rex Whitmire Harbour, 26, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after carrying out a sniper-style attack on motorists driving along a state highway in Gainesville, Georgia, Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch told reporters on Saturday.

Investigators searched Harbour’s home in Snellville, Georgia, and discovered a manifesto in which he stated his admiration for Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old who Florida police say confessed to fatally shooting 17 people on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to Couch.

“We found handwritten documents written by Mr. Harbour and they were very disturbing,” Couch said. “He indicated that he idolized the mass shooter in the Parkland, Florida, shooting. ... He called Nikolas Cruz a ‘hero’ and that Cruz gave him ‘courage and confidence.’”

“The remainder of the documents that I saw are very hate-filled in that regard,” he continued. “It appeared that he was targeting all Americans. Why? That I don’t know.”

Harbour used a handgun to fire at least 17 bullets from a wooded area along Georgia 365, roughly 60 miles northeast of Atlanta, shortly before noon on Friday before turning the gun on himself, according to police.

At least seven vehicles were shot, Couch said. Three people were injured in the attack, including two people who sustained gunshot wounds and another person who suffered minor injuries when a bullet shattered the windshield of her car. None of the injuries were life-threatening.

While searching Harbour’s car, investigators found three handguns, a bolt-action rifle, a shotgun, a BB gun and “a lot of ammunition,” Couch said.Continuing a blustery media tour to clean up a series of comments he’d made days ago that contradicted his new client, President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani appeared on Fox News on Saturday night to further clarify his remarks.

Giuliani, hired recently as Trump’s lead attorney for the investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election, said in an explosive Wednesday interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity that the president had reimbursed his longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 hush payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels shortly before the election.

The comments contradicted Trump’s assertion last month that he was completely in the dark about the payment. On Friday, Trump undercut Giuliani, saying his attorney had “just started [on the job] yesterday,” and would eventually “get his facts straight.”

The former New York City mayor appeared to echo his boss’ sentiments on Saturday.

“I’m still learning [the facts] ... I’ve been in the case for two weeks ― virtually one day in comparison to other people,” Giuliani told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro when asked whether he had misspoken when discussing the payment to Daniels. “I’m not an expert on the facts yet. I’m getting there.”

The attorney stressed, however, that there was no way his client violated any campaign finance laws.

“Every campaign finance expert, Republican and Democrat, will tell you that if it was for another purpose other than just campaigns, and even if it was for campaign purposes, if it was to save his family, to save embarrassment, it’s not a campaign donation,” Giuliani said.

“Even if it was a campaign donation, the president reimbursed it fully with a payment of $35,000 a month that paid for that and other expenses. No need to go beyond that. Case over,” he added.

Giuliani had said in a statement Friday that his comments had not reflected “my understanding of the President’s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.”

Also on Friday, Giuliani reiterated in an interview with The Washington Post that the president had re­imbursed Cohen by paying him a monthly retainer of $35,000, but suggested Trump did not know what the money was specifically being used for.

“The monthly bill was paying down the expenditures ... it was not a loan,” Giuliani said. “Some of it was for taxes, some of it was for incidental expenses, it covered things that might come up.”

Giuliani also told the Post that despite the firestorm over his comments, Trump was not angry with him. “He said he loves me,” Giuliani said.Leah Millis / Reuters

President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last month that he didn’t know about a $130,000 payment made by his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election. That statement was contradicted last week by another Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who said the president had reimbursed Cohen for the expense.

Speaking on CNN on Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway claimed there’s an explanation for that discrepancy: Trump wasn’t telling reporters he didn’t know about the payment. He was saying he didn’t know about it when it was made.

“In speaking with the president just yesterday, when the president said “No” on Air Force One, he was talking about he didn’t know when the payment occurred,” Conway told Jake Tapper. “It was a very fast-moving exchange… He’s saying he didn’t know about when the payment occurred. He found out about it after the fact.”

In the Air Force One exchange, Trump was asked, “Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” He responded, “No. No. What else?”

He was then asked, “Do you know where he [Cohen] got the money to make that payment?”

Trump responded, “No. I don’t know.”

As Tapper noted in his interview with Conway, the president was speaking in the present tense, claiming ignorance.

“That’s present tense,” Tapper said. “But he did know.”

Conway responded by referring Tapper to the president’s Twitter feed.

“You have to look at president’s three tweets,” Conway said. “I’m going to relay to you what the president has told me, which is the best I can do. He didn’t know it at the time the payment occurred.”

Daniels has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 after meeting him at a celebrity golf tournament. She signed a nondisclosure agreement and accepted the $130,000 just before Trump won the White House.Gina Haspel, center, is facing questions about her role in the CIA's past use of torture as the Senate now considers her nomination to lead the agency. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, sought to withdraw herself from consideration to avoid any potential damage to the agency’s reputation and her own, The Washington Post reported Sunday.

Haspel is a 30-year CIA veteran widely respected by her colleagues as deputy director. But her past role in the CIA’s use of brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects has generated bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill, where she is scheduled to answer questions during a confirmation hearing next week.

As the head of a clandestine base in Thailand in 2002, Haspel oversaw the interrogation of one terror suspect that reportedly included techniques like waterboarding. The torture sessions were videotaped, and Haspel also reportedly played a part in the tapes’ destruction in 2005. The CIA has disputed this, however, saying her superior was responsible for the decision to do so.

Haspel was summoned to the White House on Friday to review her role in the controversial program, where she faced “urgent questions” from administration officials about “material being raised in questions from Congress,” according to the Post. Some records from the program, the newspaper reported, show that Haspel “was an enthusiastic supporter of what the CIA was doing.”

During the meeting, the report added, Haspel told White House officials she wanted to withdraw her nomination in order to protect the reputation of the agency and so as to not become what she called “the next Ronny Jackson,” referring to the White House physician Trump nominated for secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs who withdrew over allegations of misconduct.

The suggestion alarmed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and legislative affairs director Marc Short, who reportedly rushed to the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Friday to meet with Haspel after she left the White House in order to talk her out of pulling out. By Saturday, the deputy CIA director had agreed to stick with it.

Haspel’s last-minute second-guessing of whether to maintain her bid is indicative of the uphill climb her nomination faces in Congress. The prolonged absence of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and the previously stated opposition of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) would give Democrats leverage over her nomination ― if they stick together, that is.

According to the Post, Short told Haspel she could still be confirmed despite the questions over her role in the interrogation program.

Sanders, meanwhile, tweeted an endorsement of Haspel on Friday. The senior White House aide also accused Democrats of hypocrisy over their opposition to a female nominee.ORLANDO, Fla. ― Adam Putnam goes to fish fries and strawberry festivals to talk about Florida’s schools and roads. Fellow Republican Ron DeSantis goes to the Fox News studios in Washington to talk about why Robert Mueller’s investigation of the president should be stopped.

Putnam was a state legislator and congressman, and is now the state’s elected agriculture commissioner as he seeks the governor’s office. He has the backing of the remnants of the old-line state Republican Party, the one fashioned by former Gov. Jeb Bush.

DeSantis was a Navy lawyer who served in Iraq and entered politics six years ago when he won a Daytona Beach-based congressional seat. His gubernatorial bid has the backing via tweet of President Donald Trump.

Which one wins the GOP nomination in the Aug. 28 primary for the open seat will likely offer a strong clue as to Trump’s hold over the Republican voting base ― as well as show whether a large swing state’s governorship can be successfully nationalized via cable news.

“The next governor of Florida needs to know Florida,” Putnam said Saturday night at a Florida Family Policy Council forum, the first time he and DeSantis have appeared at the same event.

Putnam, 43, has been running his campaign the way statewide races have been run in Florida for generations, with visits to community events, fairs, barbeques and so on, adding up to hundreds of such stops.

DeSantis’s campaign argues that it, too, has been staging local campaign visits, but points out that the congressional schedule requires him to be in Washington for the majority of most weeks. DeSantis, 39, himself conceded in his Saturday session on stage that many Floridians know little about him.

“They see me on Fox, but they don’t know who I am,” he said.

But one campaign official acknowledged that the Fox News strategy ― DeSantis does multiple brief appearances on the network each week, typically defending Trump on whatever national issue is spotlighted ― was deliberate.

“When he goes on [Sean] Hannity ― 3 million viewers, 300,000 of them in Florida, 280,000 of them are probable GOP primary voters,” the official said on condition of anonymity. “It would take 30 local events to reach that number of people.”

That strategy also won DeSantis an endorsement from Trump, an avid viewer of Fox programming, weeks before the lawmaker officially announced his candidacy.

“Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!” Trump wrote in a Dec. 22 tweet.

How much follow-through will occur beyond that remains to be seen. Trump mentioned DeSantis recently during a phone call to Fox and Friends as an “absolute warrior” on a list of allies that included former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. But beyond that, there has been no campaign appearance, no fundraising help.

Putnam’s campaign, which was disappointed by Trump’s endorsement tweet but not surprised by it, is working behind the scenes to keep the president out of the primary.

“We’re doing our best to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” said one Putnam adviser on condition of anonymity, referring to any additional Trump aid to DeSantis.

Of course, having Trump’s endorsement, while it most likely helps in the GOP primary, could be far less helpful ― and perhaps hurtful ― in the general election. In Florida, the gap between the two events will be barely two months, making it difficult for the GOP nominee to distance himself from remarks designed for a primary audience.

Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the state Republican Party, said that balancing act will be even more difficult with Trump in the mix, given his deep unpopularity with non-Republicans.

“The way things work is you’re really not thinking about the general election,” he said. “You’re just hoping to win the primary and hope for the best.”

Brad Herold, DeSantis’ campaign manager, said he expects Trump to follow through on his commitment to help DeSantis in the primary, and that the candidate would welcome his support even after that. “I don’t think the president’s support is something we’ll shy away from, even in the general election,” he said.

He added that trying to run away from Trump leading into the general election would be pointless, given that Democrats will be treating every Republican as a Trump stand-in. “If you have an ‘R’ next to your name, they’re going to tie you to him anyway,” he said.
