(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving vehicle unit and ride-hailing firm UberTechnologies Inc have settled their legal dispute over trade secrets, the two companies said on Friday.

A trial to decide the case, which started earlier this week, has been dismissed by the judge.

The settlement includes an agreement “to ensure that any Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated in Uber Advanced Technologies Group hardware and software,” a Waymo spokesperson said.

Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: “While we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo’s proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work.”

No further details of the settlement were immediately available.

According to Wired, the LED-lighted, foot-long quadcopters were guided into their intricate formations by Intel’s Shooting Star platform. An Intel spokeswoman confirmed to HuffPost that the maneuvers over Pyeongchang were prerecorded. A live performance was scrapped because “there were too many spectators standing in the area where the live drone show was supposed to take place,” the Pyeongchang organizing committee said in a statement.White House Counsel Don McGahn knew for a year about damaging accusations against staff secretary Rob Porter by both of his ex-wives — yet kept him on the job without investigating the claims, The Washington Post reported late Thursday.

Chief of Staff John Kelly also learned in the fall that the domestic violence allegations was holding up Porter’s security clearance, according to the Post, citing unnamed sources. Porter continued to have access to classified information and to control the flow of information to President Donald Trump.

Porter resigned Wednesday, but denied the abuse accusations.

“These outrageous allegations are simply false,” Porter said in a statement. “I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign.” Porter reportedly has been dating White House communications director Hope Hicks, who helped write statements this week defending him.

McGahn and Kelly now face questions about why they allowed Porter to stay in his high-level post despite the accusations.

McGahn wanted Porter to stay in his role because he believed Porter was a “steadying” influence, sources told the Post. McGahn continued to support Porter even though he later learned that the allegations were serious enough to complicate Porter’s security clearance, and was contacted by one of Porter’s ex-girlfriends, who also accused Porter of being violent, according to the Post. The ex-girlfriend was working in the administration.

Kelly defended Porter after the accusations were reported, calling him a man of “honor” and a “trusted professional,” and implored him not to resign. After photos were published of Porter’s first wife, Colbie Holderness, with a black eye that she told the FBI that Porter had given her in 2005, Kelly said he was “shocked” by the “new” allegations.

Porter’s second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, said he emotionally, mentally and physically abused her. She said Porter once visited her in her home, violating a restraining order, and broke a window with his fist in anger, the Post reported. Willoughby said Porter called her, angry he had not yet received his security clearance, after she spoke to the FBI.

Willoughby told Anderson Cooper Thursday that Porter called her recently, asking her to release a statement “downplaying” a blog post she wrote about abuse she said she endured during their marriage. Willoughby also told Cooper that Porter was intelligent and could be kind, but he was also “deeply troubled and angry and violent.”

Both women said they divorced Porter because of his violence. Both also said they were contacted in 2016 by a women who said she was a girlfriend of Porter and was being abused by him, CNN reported.

White House spokesman Raj Shah said Wednesday that administration officials relied on the FBI’s security review to address the matter.President Donald Trump points to a detail on his flight jacket while on stage at a U.S. Air Force base on the outskirts of Tokyo, Japan, on Nov. 5, 2017.

WASHINGTON — For the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who would be tasked with making it happen, a military parade like the one President Donald Trump envisions would be a colossal pain in the rear guard.

Trump has long fantasized about being in the center of a celebration involving thousands of soldiers marching in formation alongside tanks and missile launchers. And in January, after watching 6,000 soldiers march through Paris last summer to commemorate a turning point in the French Revolution, he told military brass to start planning a parade “like the one in France,” The Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Unlike France, the U.S. is ill-prepared to host a massive display of military might — in large part because it doesn’t do so very often. With the exception of small local celebrations, the last military parade in this country was at the end of the Persian Gulf War nearly 30 years ago. The one before that was to celebrate the end of World War II.

HuffPost asked some current and former members of the military what they thought of a potential parade. Their views aren’t necessarily representative of everyone in the military, but the people who were willing to talk thought the parade was a pretty dumb idea — and that it would be much harder to pull off than the commander in chief might imagine.

U.S. troops are out of practice marching in formation

For Trump to have a huge parade in Washington, D.C., the military would likely have to shuttle in units from other parts of the country, find places for them to stay, provide them with meals, and secure their weapons. The U.S. military employs lots of people — about 2 million active duty and reserve service members — so it’s possible to cobble together a few thousand troops to match France’s parade. But those people all have jobs that don’t involve marching around in a straight line for the president’s amusement.

There are some regiments in the D.C. area with service members who are well-trained in marching and ceremonies. The 3rd U.S. Infantry, known as the Old Guard, conducts ceremonies at the White House and the Pentagon, maintains a 24-hour vigil at the Tomb of the Unknowns, and provides military funeral escorts at Arlington National Cemetery. But a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue consisting only of troops from the Old Guard would look “laughably small,” said Jonathan Hollis, who served in special operations forces and completed four deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. “It’s not what Trump has in mind.”

And these days, most members of the military don’t spend a lot of time marching.

“Drill and ceremony was not a priority compared to training for combat deployment when I was in the Army, and as a company commander, I’d rather have been in the field,” said Benjamin Lee, who served as an Army Civil Affairs officer.

“If I had to choose between getting my soldiers more time on the range and shooting straight, and using their equipment, such as drilling on radios, versus drill and ceremony, I would always choose that training that made them better prepared for the mission and better able to survive,” added Lee, who is now a Democratic member of the board of representatives in Stamford, Connecticut.

“Personally, I think we’d look terrible,” said Jonathan B., a former member of the Navy who requested HuffPost not include his last name because he is still involved with organizations that work with the military. He said he hadn’t marched in formation since boot camp.

“We have all these ceremonial units that do this on the regular,” he said. “I don’t know why we need to get everyone else in a room together and just suck.”

“Do you really wanna say, ‘Hey guys, your vacation is canceled, come back and practice marching’?” - Benjamin Lee

Preparation for a parade of the scale Trump seems to want would require participants to practice for about a week in advance, several current and former members of the military estimated.

“Just marching, just practicing, because it’s not something that you do every day,” Hollis said. “For something like this, that’s going to be on national television, it’s going to be live-fed worldwide, if people are out of step … all it takes is one person screwing up and somebody takes a picture of it and it becomes a meme, and that’s all anyone remembers.”

If Trump wanted the military’s biggest, most badass-looking military equipment on display during the parade, it would likely require the participation of active duty service members who are either preparing for deployment or have recently returned from a combat zone. National Guardsmen have some heavy equipment, but their weaponry tends to be older — and unless Trump federalized the National Guard for the purposes of his parade, he would need a governor to volunteer the state’s troops.

“Trump still doesn’t have the faintest idea of what meaningful patriotism looks like.” - Luke Thomas

Active duty soldiers often operate on training schedules that are planned out years in advance in order to ensure a rotation of troops who are prepared to go in and out of combat.

“Stopping everything and extensively practice marching is going to disrupt those missions,” Lee said. “You would likely be taking combat units off of combat training. Or you’ll likely have to take soldiers who just got back from Afghanistan or Iraq who are on a ‘rest’ cycle for training. Do you really wanna say, ‘Hey guys, your vacation is canceled, come back and practice marching’?”

Jonathan said he wouldn’t have disobeyed a direct order if he’d been asked to participate in a military parade while in the Navy — but he also said he would have tried to find a way out of it.

“I am not wasting a day standing and marching around in my freaking uniform so that somebody can get their rocks off,” he said.

Transporting military equipment is expensive

Trump would probably want his military parade to outdo the one he attended in France. That means he would ask for equipment like tanks, mobile missile launchers and anti-aircraft rocket launchers ― much of which is located on bases in states like North Carolina, Georgia and Texas.

It costs a lot of money to move heavy weaponry. When the U.S. prepared to send vehicles and equipment home from Afghanistan, the estimated cost of transportation was about $6 billion, the Guardian reported in 2013.

And you can’t exactly drive tanks down the interstate. They would tear up the roads and get terrible mileage: less than one mile per gallon. That means the heavy equipment would have to be flown in on a military transport aircraft, shipped in on a cargo ship, or loaded onto a train or transporter truck.

Once the equipment made it to D.C., the people transporting it to the site of the parade would have to figure out how to do that without ruining the city’s roads.

“None of these weapons systems were designed to be moved through civilian streets unless you are invading them,” Lee said. “They are not meant to be moved through friendly civilian streets for giggles.”

What’s the point?

The point of a military parade would be to “honor our service members,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told reporters Thursday. But when HuffPost asked veterans if they felt honored by the idea of a military parade, the response was mostly a collective eye roll.

“The only people that like this stuff are the VIPs,” said one 20-year veteran of the Army who requested anonymity because he still works for the military.

“Everybody hates life preparing and executing these dog-and-pony shows,” he added, using a term that two other veterans used to describe the parade.

Several veterans bristled at the idea that the U.S. needed to show off its military prowess in a big parade. “We demonstrate our military strength in joint military exercises that we do pretty much all the time all over the world,” Jonathan said.

“The U.S. may not be first in a lot, but it’s certainly the most powerful military in the world,” said Taylor Mickal, a former Navy corpsman, adding that a big military parade would just exude insecurity.

A better way to show respect for the troops would be to devote more resources to job programs and suicide prevention for veterans, said an Army reservist who requested anonymity because he is still in the military.

Some veterans considered it particularly absurd that Trump, who dodged military service and mocked a prisoner of war during the campaign, would order a military parade.

“Trump still doesn’t have the faintest idea of what meaningful patriotism looks like. It’s why we’re having this inane debate over athletes kneeling before a football game,” Luke Thomas, who served in the Marine Corps and is now a journalist covering mixed martial arts, wrote in an email. “Turning service members into props is reprehensible on its own, and even more enraging when it comes from a man who paraded his own disdain for military service.”

HuffPost asked the Pentagon to respond to current and former members of the military who think the parade would be a big waste of time.WASHINGTON ― On Friday, President Donald Trump weighed in publicly for the first time about the domestic violence allegations leveled at one of his closest aides.

Trump said he was “sad” to hear the news about Rob Porter, who was White House staff secretary until this week, but he never once condemned Porter or offered words of support to his victims.

Instead, Trump wished him well and made a point to remind everyone that Porter has said he’s innocent:

We wish him well, he worked very hard. We found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well, and it’s a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House. And we hope he has a wonderful career, and he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it, and certainly he’s also very sad now. He also, as you probably know, says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he’s innocent, so you have to talk to him about that.

Porter resigned this week after his two ex-wives came forward and said he had physically and verbally abused them while they were married. One woman even provided photos of the violence she said he inflicted on her during a vacation.

Porter initially received support from White House chief of staff John Kelly, who put out a statement praising him as “a man of true integrity and honor.” Only a day later, after significant public backlash, did Porter announce his resignation.

White House officials then said they were stunned to learn the extent of the allegations, even though Porter’s ex-wives had told the FBI he’d abused them and Kelly reportedly knew about the claims for months. Porter was also unable to get a security clearance because of the incidents.

Trump’s reaction is consistent with the way he and his supporters have handled other sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men.

During the special election for U.S. Senate in Alabama, Roy Moore was accused of pursuing teenage girls ― including sexually assaulting them ― while he was in his 30s. Numerous women spoke out, on the record, about what he had done.

Nevertheless, Trump backed Moore ― because Moore had denied the charges.

“He says it didn’t happen,” Trump said of Moore. “You have to listen to him, also.”

Steve Wynn

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that dozens of employees who had worked for hotel magnate Steve Wynn described behavior “that cumulatively would amount to a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.” In one instance, Wynn paid a $7.5 million settlement to a manicurist who says he demanded she have sex with him.

Wynn was also finance chair of the Republican National Committee. Trump has yet to speak out about Wynn. Although Wynn stepped down as finance chair, the RNC refused to give up the money he had donated to the committee over the years. The RNC chair again cited the fact that Wynn had said he’s innocent.

“Steve has denied these allegations. Unlike Harvey Weinstein and [former Democratic Sen.] Al Franken and others, Steve has denied them,” RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel said. “There is an investigation that’s going to take place. He should be allowed due process. If he is found of any wrongdoing, we’ll return 100 percent of that money.”

Roger Ailes

Roger Ailes stepped down as chairman of Fox News after two dozen women accused him of sexual harassment. Trump defended his longtime friend and attacked the women who had spoken out against him.

“I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he’s helped them, and even recently,” Trump said. “And when they write books that are fairly recently released, and they say wonderful things about him. And now, all of a sudden, they’re saying these horrible things about him. ... It’s very sad because he’s a very good person. I’ve always found him to be just a very, very good person. And, by the way, a very, very talented person.”

Mike Tyson

In 1992, when a jury convicted boxer Mike Tyson of raping an 18-year-old woman, Trump came to his defense. He argued that Tyson should avoid prison time and seemed to blame the woman for what happened.

“You have a young woman that was in his room, his hotel room late in the evening at her own will,” Trump said. “You have a young woman who was seen dancing for the beauty contest [the next day], dancing with a big smile on her face, looked happy as could be.”

Bill O’Reilly

Fox News forced out host Bill O’Reilly in April, after it became public that had stood by him and helped settle several sexual harassment lawsuits over the years. An internal investigation reportedly turned up even more allegations.

Trump said that despite all this, he believed O’Reilly was innocent.

“I think he’s a person I know well – he is a good person,” Trump said. “I think he shouldn’t have settled; personally I think he shouldn’t have settled. Because you should have taken it all the way. I don’t think Bill did anything wrong.”

Paul, who became embroiled in international controversy last month for a video filmed in Japan’s so-called “suicide forest,” drew outcry again this week for tweeting about eating Tide Pods and posting a video where he uses a stun gun on dead rats and takes a fish out of a koi pond and puts it on the ground.

⚡️ “PETA slams Logan Paul for using Taser on dead animals”https://t.co/tY9312bLrh — peta2 (@peta2) February 9, 2018

YouTube said this week that Paul’s behavior could be “damaging to the broader creator community.”

Paul previously faced an uproar after he posted a video on Dec. 31 that showed the body of a man who’d died by suicide in Japan’s Aokigahara forest. Following immense backlash, Paul publicly apologized and pledged to donate $1 million to suicide prevention organizations. He also halted production of his daily vlog for a few weeks.

In response to the forest video, YouTube removed Paul from the Google Preferred platform, which gives premium advertisers easy access to the most popular 5 percent of YouTubers, and suspended his content deals with the paid streaming service YouTube Red. Many critics said YouTube should have banned Paul outright.

This time around, the streaming service acknowledged that Paul’s actions had rendered his channel “unsuitable for advertisers” and potentially a liability for the site as a whole.

“After careful consideration, we have decided to temporarily suspend ads on Logan Paul’s YouTube channels,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement sent to HuffPost.

“This is not a decision we made lightly,” the statement continued. “However, we believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers, but also potentially damaging to the broader creator community.”

In a video posted on Feb. 4, Paul bragged about gaining “a million subscribers” during his “three-week break” and did not appear noticeably humbler than before his hiatus.

“I know for a fact everything I do from this point on will get criticism, it will get backlash, because I’m a very polarizing dude. You either love me, or you hate me,” he says toward the end of the video. “So internet, please, use me, bro. Crucify me, vilify me, and I can promise you one thing, guys. I’m not going anywhere. I’m going to be here for a minute.”An undocumented couple who have called the U.S. their home for more than 20 years is facing deportation. But their community is fighting back.

Residents of Simsbury, Connecticut, with the support of several legislators, participated in a rally on Sunday to protest deportation orders given to nail salon owners Zhe Long Huang and Xiang Jin Li, who are from China but are ethnically Korean.

With the couple scheduled to leave for China on Feb. 16, the rally-goers made a last-ditch push to allow the pair to stay in the U.S with their two sons. An additional rally for the couple is being held on Friday outside the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office.

“Give me time to give my children a beautiful life,” Li told NBC Connecticut through tears. “Don’t split my family,”

Huang and Li came to the U.S. illegally back in 1999. Family friend Laurie Kane told Fox 61 that the couple had obtained work permits and have been paying taxes. They do not have criminal records.

The couple were given orders of removal about five years, ago but were granted stays, their lawyer Erin O’Neil-Baker explained to NBC. However, their orders of removal are now being enforced. And though both filed for permanent residency, an immigration judge denied their requests.

Their children, ages 5 and 15, were born in the U.S., only speak English, and are unfamiliar with Chinese culture. O’Neil-Baker told NBC that if the couple don’t take their kids with them to China, the children will be placed in state custody.

ICE said in a statement to Fox61 that the pair must leave the country.

“Both Mr. Huang and Ms. Li have previously been ordered by immigration judges to be removed from the U.S. to China, their country of origin,” the statement read. “Both have filed unsuccessful appeals to these orders and must depart the country.”

About 100 protestors gathered outside the couple’s salon for Sunday’s rally, which was organized by state Rep. John Hampton (D) and Simsbury First Selectman Eric Wellman. Several people held signs in support of the couple, and others criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, the Hartford Courant reported. Huang and Li told people at the rally about their immigration status and journey.

Community members also have been standing with the pair in other ways. Kane, who also helped organize the rally and is collecting letters of support for the family, told NBC Connecticut that she’s received hundreds of messages from community members. A petition protesting the couple’s removal has garnered more than 5,300 signatures.

Other legislators also have expressed opposition to the scheduled deportation.

“I am doing all that I can to fight this cruel deportation ― a reckless and heartless action that would rip loving parents away from their two U.S. citizen children,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told Fox 61.

Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.) also spoke against the deportation order.TONIGHT: The president couldn't be there in person so he sent members of his family to help open America's new embassy in Jerusalem. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/YvhD5SEvjZ

Lorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC via Getty Images

What would it look like if “The Bachelor” and the Winter Olympics got some alone time in the fantasy suite? America is about to find out ― and not just because Season 22 of “The Bachelor” will continue airing amid the hubbub of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

If toggling channels to enjoy both winter sports and structured dating seems like too much work, ABC has helpfully combined them in “The Bachelor Winter Games,” a dating and athletic competition show that will premiere Tuesday.

For months, ABC has been coy about the details of the “Bachelor” spinoff. The show, set to air Tuesdays and Thursdays for the next two weeks ― in direct competition with the Olympic Winter Games ― promises to feature snow sports, brightly colored parkas and, per promos, a great deal of crying.

But what can we really expect from the latest “Bachelor” franchise offering? How much athletic competition and how much searching for love? How would the two be combined into the perfect wintry mix of reality TV? Will it be worth missing, for example, a good chunk of the pairs figure skating short program?

On a “Winter Games” bonus episode of HuffPost’s “Here to Make Friends” podcast, we got the scoop on the new “Bachelor” show from contestant Lesley Murphy, a travel blogger who also made a splash on Season 17 of “The Bachelor.”

Emma Gray: What roles do love and dating play in this show?

Lesley Murphy: It’s “The Bachelor” at the end of the day, come on! It’s always going to be right there at the center. It’s a good balance of competition, winter games, falling down hills, bad athletes on your TV screens, but also finding love. I think there’s some love to be found on “Winter Games.”

Emma: Can we ask if you might have found a love connection?

Lesley: Um... yeah, it’s progressing into something like that. We’ll see what happens.

Claire Fallon: That sounds like a yes.

Lesley: Yeah, it was... I went into it with a really open mind and came out with... with a boyfriend!

Claire: That’s the best advertisement for the show!

Emma: And you don’t seem to have broken any bones in the physical competition, so I think that’s the best way you could leave the show.

Lesley: Well, yeah. Things heat up, but you’ll have to see how it all plays out, because I think there is some drama, there’s some love triangles.

Emma: What would a “Bachelor” show be without a few love triangles?

Lesley: Right?

Claire: So, is the love woven into the competition? Are we going to see some sort of “win the downhill skiing and you will get a date” sort of thing?

Lesley: Yes, that’s kind of how it happens. There’s a women’s heat and a men’s heat, and whoever wins each gets a date card. That’s how that happens. And then you can ask whoever you wish.

Emma: So are people encouraged to date across country lines?

Lesley: Oh, yeah, international couples are a thing.

Claire: Practicality has never been a big thing for “The Bachelor.” It’s like, “You’re from Arizona, she’s from Maine ― I think you guys could really make this work!”

Lesley: And that was really awkward/hard at the end of it, because there are a few couples that leave the show together and a lot of hard conversations have to take place. Because it’s like, “OK, we live so far away from each other. How are we going to make this work?”

Claire: Would “The Bachelor” sponsor their immigration? How much are they willing to commit?

Lesley: It’s possible!

Emma: I want to see that commitment. Not just a televised wedding ― televised immigration proceedings.

Claire: It would be a quid pro quo. They’d be like, “You can be part of a five-part, quintuple wedding, and in exchange we will sponsor all your immigration paperwork and take care of you, but you have to get married on TV for us.”

Lesley: I mean, twist my arm! Free wedding!

Claire: So are you going to show us any surprising skills? Are you a winter sports enthusiast?

Lesley: You will see me do pretty terribly at riflery. It’s not even really a winter sport, but it was in Vermont, so... there’s all kinds of crazy stuff.

Claire: Well, I think it is part of the Winter Olympics, right, because there’s also the thing where they cross-country ski and then they shoot?

Lesley: Right, it’s called the biathlon of the Winter Games. It is part of cross-country skiing. I thought I would do really well. But you’ll have to see... but I think some other people were way, way behind me. It was actually really funny to see the guys do it, because I competed against all the women, so I [was] totally focused on getting across that finish line, not really looking at anybody else. But it’s really funny to see the guys just fall face-first and go so slow that, actually, the interviewer was walking right alongside them, because they just had no skills.

Emma: I don’t think it would be as fun if everyone was really good at the challenges. I want to watch “The Bachelor Winter Games” to see men embarrass themselves.

Lesley: It’s going to be amazing, because we ski ― a lot of these guys haven’t even put on skis before.

Claire: Did you get any coaching?

Lesley: Oh, yeah, we practiced for a good hour or two before.

Claire: Oh, that’s enough!

Lesley: You can only do so much in a day, with so many people around! But yeah, I’m sure you’ve seen it from the “Winter Games” promo, just people flying down ski hills. It’s great.

To hear more about what to expect from “The Bachelor Winter Games,” check out the full episode:There’s a whole lot of talent headed to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. From breakout stars to seasoned medalists, there are plenty of athletes from many different countries to watch out for.

Here are some of the first-timers and potential record-breakers to keep an eye on this year:

Marit Bjørgen, Norway

With 10 medals under her belt, the Norwegian cross-country skier is the most decorated athlete competing in this year’s games. She also holds the most medals of any female winter athlete. She won three gold medals in each of the past two Winter Games.

Claudia Pechstein, Germany

With nine medals, this German athlete is the most successful Olympic speedskater in history. She will be the first woman to compete in seven Winter Olympics. Pechstein could also become the oldest Winter Olympic medalist in an individual event and the first person to win the same individual Winter Olympic event four times ― she previously won the 5,000 meters in 1994, 1998 and 2002.

Ireen Wüst, The Netherlands

The Dutch speedskater won two gold medals and three silvers at the Sochi Games in 2014 ― more than any athlete in any sport that year. Wüst is one gold medal short of having the record for most golds ever won by an Olympic speedskater. In 2006, at the age of 19, she become the youngest Dutch Olympic champion in Winter Games history.

Mikaela Shiffrin, U.S.A.

Many view the 22-year-old American as the best skier in the world right now. At 18, she became the youngest-ever Olympic alpine gold medalist. She already has 41 World Cup wins under her belt. If she manages to take home more than two gold medals in alpine skiing this year, she would beat Janica Kostelić of Croatia’s 2002 record.

Noriaki Kasai, Japan

The 45-year-old Japanese ski jumper has the most Winter Olympic appearances of any athlete competing this year. This will be his eighth time at the Winter Games. He is the oldest ski jumper to medal at the Olympics ― he’s won three medals but no gold. He’s said his goal is for his two-year-old daughter to see him win gold.

At 28, the American athlete is the oldest U.S. figure-skating Olympic rookie since 1936. Rippon is also the first openly gay man to compete for the United States in the Winter Olympics.

He found himself without a seat after showing up late, after the dinner started, The Washington Post’s Anna Fifield reported.

The veep, who is representing President Donald Trump’s administration at the games, was supposed to dine with the U.S. athletes instead.

Then it got even more awkward.

Kim was seated between United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach, so the apparent snub likely created a bit of tension.The Winter Olympics may have just started, but the U.S. figure skating team has already set a record.

Out of its 14 members, a record-breaking seven skaters, half of the team, are Asian-Americans. Among them are several Olympic favorites, including men’s gold medal prospect Nathan Chen and Kristi Yamaguchi mentee Karen Chen.

Asians across the internet are ecstatic over the representation.

This is just to say

Record number of Asian-American figure skaters at Winter Olympics https://t.co/gJcS9QhAWn — shinnara (@shinnara) February 9, 2018

Other Asian-American team members include Olympic veterans Maia and Alex Shibutani, Madison Chock and Mirai Nagasu, as well as Vincent Zhou. Asian-American representation is up from the last Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in which four Asian-Americans were on the 15-member figure skating team.

As a whole, this year’s Team USA stands as the most diverse U.S. team in Winter Olympics history. In addition to 11 Asian-Americans, the group also includes 10 black athletes and two openly gay team members, according to the team’s data. However, Jason Thompson, the U.S. Olympic Committee’s director of diversity, says there’s far more work to be done.

“We’re not quite where we want to be,” he told NPR. “I think full-on inclusion has always been a priority of Team USA. I think everybody’s always felt it should represent every American.”

Advertisement“Scandal” seemed all too familiar this week when White House Chief of Staff Olivia Pope was out and NSA Director Jake Ballard was in.

“You have until the end of the week to announce your resignation,” President Mellie Grant told Olivia. “If, for some reason, you choose not to do that, I march into the briefing room and I announce your termination. You have to go.” However, Olivia wasn’t going to leave quietly.

Olivia, obviously, had a plan up her sleeve, and it involved framing Jake’s wife’s lover as a Russian spy. “My wife is not a spy, and Bob Bacall has never freelanced for the Russians,” Jake told Mellie and David Rosen, the latter of whom asked, “Then how did that money get in his account?” Jake told Rosen that it was from Olivia, who was framing him for espionage.

As juicy as this all was, alleged Russian interference wasn’t even the only similarity in this week’s episode. There was also — wait for it — a controversial memo.

Vice President Cyrus Beene convinced Mellie, Jake, and his wife, Vanessa, to cover up the truth by saying that Vanessa was part of a sting operation — hired by the NSA to expose Bacall for working with the Russians. Beene then went straight to Olivia with a folder, saying, “A private memo written by Mellie to the CIA director, asking her to corroborate the story Vanessa Ballard told Noah Baker last night. It’s what the law calls obstruction of justice, and what we fans of werewolf literature call a ‘silver bullet.’” Olivia pointed out to Cyrus that he didn’t need her to impeach Mellie; he could go to the press with the memo himself. Nevertheless, Cyrus explained, “You’re the better story. Recently deposed chief of staff calls a press conference. Instead of resigning, she says she’s being forced to step down as punishment for uncovering a conspiracy. You hold up this memo, wave it in front of the cameras. Committees are formed, charges are filed. Next thing you know, I’m being sworn in as president.”

However, in the end, Olivia chose not to use the memo that could impeach the president, and instead decided to take herself out of the drama completely. For now. (We hope.)

Read more from Yahoo! Entertainment:Trinity, an 11-year-old with locs, isn’t letting bullies stop her from loving her natural hair. Photo: Twitter/ToshiaShaw

Author and life coach Toshia Shaw shared a photo of her daughter Trinity on Twitter the day after she was harassed at school. “My sweet 11yr old was teased in school today by boys because of her hairstyle,” Shaw wrote. “She loved it and stood up to them for bullying her. She goes to a predominately white school but wears locs like me. She said she refuses to allow kids to make her feel bad about her culture.”

In three days, Shaw’s story has been retweeted almost 20,000 times, with thousands of responses cheering Trinity on. Fans are writing in to congratulate Shaw for “A+ parenting” and raising a “strong young woman.” After the outpouring of responses, Shaw followed up with a thank-you from Trinity.

She said, “Thank you,” to the nice, supportive, and beautiful comments because it shows her there is way more love than hate in this world. #StopBullying #blackhairisbeautiful pic.twitter.com/sRqngUo0l0 — Toshia Shaw (@Toshia_Shaw) February 6, 2018

“As a mom, I want what’s best for my daughter. As a woman, I remember being that 11-year-old girl being bullied for just being myself, but I didn’t have the strength or courage to stand up to my bullies the way Trinity does,” Shaw tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I vowed that if I ever had a daughter, I would instill self-esteem, pride, and courage in her.”

According to Shaw, self-love starts in the home, so she has worked to create an environment where her daughter can feel free to be herself. Their home is filled with positive affirmations — written in the bathroom and in Trinity’s room — and as a mother, she reinforces the mantra of self-love with homemade YouTube videos. She also fills their home with role models for Trinity to look up to.

“I show her examples of strong women in books, articles, and we study the strong women of the past,” she says. “I show her that this world has always been tough, especially for women of color, and that it probably always will be; but she has the strength and support to make it anyway. She knows strength is in her DNA, and she believes it.”

Ironically, Shaw herself chose February to start a “self-love challenge.” She’s teaching a course, with new videos every week, to “help you reach beyond yourself and connect with something greater, wider, and deeper.” With self-love as part of her outlook, it’s no wonder that Trinity was more than equipped to handle a few bullies.

Self-love is a thing, and you should really try it. https://t.co/9TTB0T8Yv0 — Toshia Shaw (@Toshia_Shaw) January 30, 2018

With so many supporters — and, yes, a few trolls — on Twitter, it’s clear that the Shaws aren’t the only family focused on lessons of self-love.

Shaw dismissed the haters and thanked the fans taking up Trinity’s story on Twitter. “I’m so happy to have a child who knows who she is and that her future is bright in spite of morons,” she wrote. “God bless all the wonderful people who understand why her speaking out against being bullied for her hair matters. All others, good luck.”

Trinity is feeling proud of her moment in the spotlight, says Shaw. “She didn’t think that her actions mattered, but after seeing the overwhelming response, she realizes that this moment is bigger than she is,” she said. Shaw is right; today’s culture of bullying makes even one inspirational story all the more powerful.

Schools are increasingly under scrutiny for their roles in disciplining this type of behavior. Last week, Lauren Williams, a high school student in Tennessee, fought back after fellow students ripped off her wig and posted the video on Snapchat. The Williams family shared the damage the students had done to her scalp, and the school is now investigating the incident. In North Carolina, 14-year-old Alex Davis was forced to withstand insults about his long hair from a teacher who told him he “can’t have my hair up like that because I’m not a girl, or I’m not a fag.”

Thankfully, Trinity has her self-esteem and her mom “on standby,” and there are a whole bunch of videos about self-love to watch. How about sending one to the bully in your life?A Change.org petition is calling on Marvel Studios and The Walt Disney Company to invest 25 percent of the profits for the hot new film “Black Panther” into the black community.

Created by a user named Chaz Gormley, the petition’s description said that Marvel and Walt Disney Co. have “targeted the black community with their advertisements” for the film.

“Through a clever, well-manufactured marketing campaign Marvel Studios and their parent company The Walt Disney Company have targeted the Black community with their advertisements for the upcoming ‘Black Panther’ film, due to release on February 16, 2018. As marginalized groups have become more vocal, corporations and their savvy public relations departments have turned to catering to these groups - to turn a profit - and this film by Marvel Studios is no different,” the petition reads.

Changeorg

Gormley goes on to say that while it is a “symbolic victory” to see a major studio film with a majority black cast, black director and art direction helmed by black artists, this achievement doesn’t gain anything for the black community. He cites that Marvel’s marketing campaign has targeted black customers specifically by releasing the film during Black History Month and jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron’s “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” playing in the background of the film’s initial trailer.

The petition asks that the studios stop simply asking for money from black customers with a film like this, but rather put their money where their mouth is and agree to set aside 25 percent of their worldwide profit “to be allocated for investment in black communities, and in programs within these communities that focus on S.T.E.M.”

“We cannot continue to recklessly support these conglomerates, allowing them to profit off of us without demanding something more than just their products in return,” Gormley writes. “We have the ability to change the conditions our communities and us as a people face, by leveraging the strongest resources we have: our strength in numbers, and our combined ‘spending power.’”

Additionally, the petition states that those who sign are “taking a stand” and refuse to see the film unless Marvel and Walt Disney Co. agree to these demands.

“You have the ability to not only be entertained, but to leave the theater in February knowing that a portion of your money will be coming back into your community,” Gormley wrote.

“To not only go see a film about a fictitious country in Africa with advanced technology, but the opportunity to invest in programs which focus on the fields - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - that make such advancements possible, in real life.”

The petition currently has over 600 signatures and many have remarked on what it’s asking for on Twitter and YouTube:

Marvel and Walt Disney Co. did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the petition, which is asking supporters to use the #BreakBreadMarvel/#BreakBreadDisney hashtags.

Gormley also writes at the end of his petition description that while you could go to the theater and make “wealthy companies even wealthier,” it’s crucial to understand this:Aaron Bernstein/Reuters

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) pushed back against a Fox News report that implied Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) had engaged in misconduct by texting with a lobbyist associated with a Russian billionaire last year. But his efforts to defend his colleague were thwarted when President Donald Trump shared the Fox News claims on Twitter hours later.

Fox’s “exclusive” Thursday report said Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, had “extensive contact last year” with lobbyist Adam Waldman to set up a meeting with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote a dossier on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Waldman runs the Endeavor Group, a Washington lobbying firm that worked with a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska in 2009 and 2010.

Waldman offered last March to connect Warner with Steele to discuss the infamous dossier. The article states that “secrecy seemed very important to Warner” and that the senator “seemed particularly intent on connecting directly with Steele without anyone else on the Senate Intelligence Committee being in the loop ― at least initially.”

But as the Fox News story eventually acknowledges, Waldman informed the intelligence committee about the messages months ago, and the communication appears to fall in line with Warner’s duties on the intelligence committee.

Rubio pointed this out in his tweet Thursday.

“Sen. Warner fully disclosed this to the committee four months ago,” he wrote on Twitter, with a link to the article. He continued to note that the text messages have had “zero impact on our work.”

Sen.Warner fully disclosed this to the committee four months ago.Has had zero impact on our work. https://t.co/bnmI2Thedt #FoxNews — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 9, 2018

But then Trump addressed the report late Thursday on Twitter. He did not note that the committee had been informed about the contact months ago.

Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2018

Warner and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the intelligence committee, told Fox News in a joint statement that the pair had been working together “in a bipartisan way” from the beginning of the investigation and slammed the release of “incomplete information” as unacceptable.

Rubio has also been one of a handful of congressional Republicans to defend special counsel Robert Mueller as many of his colleagues have launched blistering attacks about Mueller’s Russia investigation, including the president. In a December interview with Florida’s News-Press, Rubio defended Mueller’s reputation and said he believed the “best thing” would be for the investigation to be completed “as thoroughly and as completely as possible.”UPDATE: Feb 9. — Fox News has taken down executive editor John Moody’s controversial op-ed from its site. “John Moody’s column does not reflect the views or values of FOX News and has been removed,” a spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement.

Previously:

Fox News’ Olympics coverage has started, and it’s already a doozy.

John Moody, the network’s executive editor and executive vice president, published an op-ed Wednesday lamenting Team USA celebrating its diversity.

“Unless it’s changed overnight, the motto of the Olympics, since 1894, has been ‘Faster, Higher, Stronger,‘” Moody wrote on FoxNews.com hours before official competition would begin at the Winter Games. “It appears the U.S. Olympic Committee would like to change that to ‘Darker, Gayer, Different.’ If your goal is to win medals, that won’t work.”

While its 2018 winter team is still overwhelmingly white and far less diverse than the 2016 summer team, the U.S. Olympic Committee told The Washington Post on Sunday that the winter team includes more African-American and Asian-American athletes than in previous years. The team also includes two openly gay athletes, including figure skater Adam Rippon, who has already called out Vice President Mike Pence for leading the U.S. delegation while publicly opposing LGBTQ policies.

Moody railed against the USOC for highlighting that it’s bringing the most diverse team ever to the Winter Olympics, writing that it raises an “uncomfortable” question.

“No sport that we are aware of awards points ― or medals ― for skin color or sexual orientation,” he wrote. “So, while uncomfortable, the question probably needs to be asked: were our Olympians selected because they’re the best at what they do, or because they’re the best publicity for our current obsession with having one each from Column A, B and C?”

U.S. athletes competing in Pyeongchang are already setting records, making history and breaking barriers ― and celebrating those milestones does not take away from their eventual and inevitable bronze, silver and gold medals.

Folks on Twitter were swift to call out the absurdity and anti-diversity stance of Moody’s column. Check out some of the responses below.

If so, maybe start w/"95% of Americans can ignore." https://t.co/HlTQM5sYGxCatt Sadler says she left E! in December for bigger reasons than getting only half the salary of her male co-star.

In an essay for Coveteur, the former E! News co-host said she knows that staying on the job after learning that Jason Kennedy made close to double her salary ″would mean collaborating with an evil system.”

Sadler, who the network employed for more than a decade, said she never intended to “be a voice for gender equality in the workplace.”

“I didn’t have grandiose plans to organize powerful people and roar about equal pay,” she wrote. “For me, at that time, it started out as simply the ‘right thing to do.’”

When Sadler discovered the salary discreprancy with Kennedy, she asked for a raise and was denied.

She explained her decision on her website TheCattwalk.com:

“How can I operate with integrity and stay on at E if they’re not willing to pay me the same as him?” she wrote. “Or at least come close? How can I accept an offer that shows they do not value my contributions and paralleled dedication all these years? How can I not echo the actions of my heroes and stand for what is right no matter what the cost? How can I remain silent when my rights under the law have been violated?”

Last month, Frances Berwick, president of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment’s lifestyle networks, claimed that the salary difference between Sadler and Kennedy wasn’t because Kennedy is male.

“Catt Sadler and Jason Kennedy had different roles and therefore different salaries,” Berwick said. “Catt was focused on daytime, Jason is on prime evening news plus red carpet. Our employees’ salaries are based on their roles and their expertise, regardless of gender.”

Many female celebrities disagreed, including Debra Messing, who called out E! News for mistreating Sadler during an interview with E! News at the Golden Globe Awards.

“I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn’t believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host,” Messing said. “I miss Catt Sadler. So we stand with her. And that’s something that can change tomorrow. We want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.”

In her essay, Sadler said their actions amazed her.

“I was completely stunned, humbled, and frankly moved to tears more than once that day,” Sadler wrote. “The injustice that I was experiencing and naively thought was merely my own became a collective awakening in many ways.”

Sadler is quick to point out that her experience isn’t something that “happened in a vacuum”

“Countless women around the world experience workplace discrimination, and it must end,” she wrote. “Women are now, more than ever, fighting this fight out loud. They’re refusing to be silenced and are banding together to make change.” “It’s awe-inspiring to witness Hollywood heavyweights organize and fight for what’s right in such a public way. Females in all industries are challenging the system and joining the movement.”

Sadler added:Nashville Mayor Megan Barry is facing an investigation after admitting last week to having an affair with the former head of her security detail, Metropolitan Nashville Police Department Sgt. Robert Forrest.

Both Barry and Forrest, who has since retired, have spouses.

On Tuesday, the Nashville City Council approved the establishment of a special committee to determine if the mayor misused public funds (which is a crime in Tennessee) as a result of the affair.

Per the Tennessean, Forrest accompanied Barry on 19 trips for city-related business between January and October 2017 at a cost of more than $30,000. Records show that on nine of the trips, including a seven-day visit to Athens, Greece, Forrest was Barry’s sole companion.

The mayor is also facing an ethics complaint speculating that her affair with Forrest may have factored into her decision not to support a civilian review board of the force.

The mayor’s office released a statement earlier this week welcoming any investigation into the affair and disputing claims that the mayor may have misspent money on travel.

“Mayor Barry has never sought reimbursement for meals or other expenses related to travel,” Barry’s communications director, Sean Braisted, said in a statement. “She has never sought to financially benefit from any of the travel she has taken on behalf of the city. We believe that at no time did Mayor Barry or Sgt. Forrest ever attempt to use taxpayer dollars to support their extramarital affair.”

“I just want to make it right,” Barry told Nashville’s NewsChannel 5 in an interview Thursday. “Whatever ‘right’ looks like for the citizens.”

In a statement issued through his lawyer last week, Forrester apologized to his family for his extramarital relationship, but denied any wrongdoing during his time as an officer.Barb’s tragic disappearance from the “Stranger Things” universe is still a sore point for Canadian barista Abigail Bahnman.

So, when Shannon Purser — who played the ill-fated Barbara Holland on the Netflix sci-fi series — walked into the Vancouver Starbucks where Bahnman works this week, she wrote her a message of support:

Yes, Bahnman scribbled “Barb deserved better” onto Purser’s cup. Purser shared a snap of the message to Twitter, and it’s now going viral.

“Whenever an actor comes through that I know of and am a big fan of, I like to send them a little message as my way of fangirling silently and not making a scene,” Bahnman told HuffPost.

“I was definitely not expecting it go blow up and for all of Twitter to see it,” she added.

The message went down well on Twitter, where many people referenced the tongue-in-cheek “Justice for Barb” campaign, which swept the internet following the character’s untimely death in the first season of the show.
