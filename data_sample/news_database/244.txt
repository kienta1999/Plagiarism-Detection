In wake of last week’s deadly shooting at a Florida high school, Neil deGrasse Tyson has weighed in on politicians offering prayers instead of proposing legislation.

The astrophysicist, author, podcaster, TV host and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York tweeted on Friday:

Evidence collected over many years, obtained from many locations, indicates that the power of Prayer is insufficient to stop bullets from killing school children. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 16, 2018Fergie’s rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday has been widely judged a colossal flop, with some people calling it one of the worst performances of the national anthem ever.

The singer attempted to give the song a breathy, bluesy edge, but her take was decidedly unsexy, with social media users comparing it unfavorably to Marilyn Monroe and Jessica Rabbit.

One star, however, seemed to take comfort in the backlash. Early Monday, Roseanne Barr joked on Twitter that Fergie’s “Star-Spangled Banner” was worse than her own lambasted version, which she performed nearly 28 years ago.

Who saw Fergie's national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game? I think mine was better lowkey — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) February 19, 2018

Barr, in case you’ve forgotten, screeched her way through the national anthem at a San Diego Padres game in July 1990. The Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning comedian set off a chorus of boos from the crowd with her off-key performance, which concluded with her spitting on the pitcher’s mound and grabbing her crotch.

Revisit Barr’s vocal stylings in the clip below.

Although Barr’s effort was slammed by President George H.W. Bush as “disgraceful,” she later said that she had, in fact, planned to give a good performance.

“I was singing in my act at the time ― and I am a good singer ― I was flattered and fully intended to sing a good version of the song,” she told The Washington Post in 2015.

“I started too high,” she explained. “I knew about six notes in that I couldn’t hit the big note. So I just tried to get through it, but I couldn’t hear anything with 50,000 drunk assholes booing, screaming ‘you fat fuck,’ giving me the finger and throwing bottles at me during the song they ‘respect’ so much.”As our internet-impaired attention spans shrink, baseball games in recent decades have gotten longer. That’s a problem for Major League Baseball, which is struggling to attract younger fans.

On Monday, the league announced rule changes for the 2018 season intended to increase the speed of play and shorten games.

The most drastic revision will be a limit on the number of visits to the pitcher’s mound per game. Until this season, coaches, managers and other players could confer with their pitcher as much as they wanted. They’ll now be limited to just six visits per nine-inning game. Teams will be allotted one additional mound visit for each extra inning.

There are some exceptions to what qualifies as a mound visit, according to MLB’s new rules, including:

A. Discussions between pitchers and position player(s) that (i) occur between batters in the normal course of play and do not require either the position player(s) or the pitcher to relocate;

B. Visits by position players to the mound to clean spikes in rainy conditions;

C. Visits to the mound due to an injury or potential injury of the pitcher; and

D. Visits to the mound after the announcement of an offensive substitution.

The MLB also said it plans to set two-minute limits on breaks between innings and at pitching changes.

To the relief of players, the MLB won’t implement a 20-second pitch clock or a between-batter timer, though Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated those steps may be considered in the future if Monday’s changes aren’t sufficient.A 15-year-old high school soccer player used his own body to shield classmates from a gunman’s rampage in Florida last week that killed 17 people, said a fellow student who credited the heroism with saving his life.

Anthony Borges, who is recovering from multiple gunshot wounds, protected classmates at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland during the gunman’s Feb. 14 attack, fellow student Carlos Rodriguez told “Good Morning America.”

“None of us knew what to do. So, he took the initiative to just save his other classmates,” said Rodriguez.

Rodriguez said Borges was the last of 20 students to flee into a room as the gunman, firing randomly, approached. Borges was trying to lock the door, and remained in the doorway as the killer shot him repeatedly, Rodriguez said. None of the other students cowerin in the room were hurt.

Borges, shot in the back and both legs, was in stable condition after hours of surgery, his father, Royer Borges, told ABC News.

“He’s my hero,” Royer Borges said after learning of his son’s actions. “I only ask that people pray for him.”

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel on Sunday visited Anthony Borges in the hospital, and posted an emotional photo shaking the teen’s hand on Facebook.

“Fortunately, he is recovering ― but has a long road ahead with more surgeries needed,” the sheriff’s post says.

A GoFundMe page to help Borges’ recovery has raised more than $80,000.

Many people shared their appreciation for the teen’s heroism after the sheriff’s photo made the rounds on Twitter and Facebook:

Winfrey first appeared on the CBS news program last autumn to talk politics with a group of Michigan voters. On Sunday, she revisited the group to continue the discussion.

Trump was apparently watching ― and fuming. He stewed over what he called “biased” questions, tweeting:

Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2018

Winfrey was mentioned as a potential 2020 candidate last month after a show-stopping speech at the Golden Globe Awards. However, she previously said that she didn’t intend to run for president.

“I don’t have the DNA for it,” Winfrey told InStyle last year. “That’s not for me.”

Winfrey appeared to reaffirm that sentiment last week.HuffPost

ABOUT HUFFPOSTPennsylvania’s Supreme Court on Monday issued a new congressional map to replace the state’s current one, which the court said is so partisan it violates the state’s Constitution.

The Supreme Court drew the map after Republican lawmakers and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) failed to come up with an agreement by the Feb. 15 deadline.

Here's the PA congressional map that's been in place since 2011 (left) and the new one (right) pic.twitter.com/hdjk0Qx8Bg — Sam Levine (@srl) February 19, 2018

In an opinion earlier in February, the state Supreme Court wrote that Pennsylvania’s congressional districts need, at minimum, to be compact and contiguous, to contain roughly the same number of people, and to not split counties and other communities unnecessarily. A map was unconstitutional, the court said, when it prioritized partisan advantage over those criteria.

In a Monday order, the court wrote that its new map splits just 13 counties. (The earlier plan, devised in 2011, split 28.) Nine of these counties are split among two congressional districts, while the other four counties are split among three. The court wrote that its plan “draws heavily” from proposals submitted by Republican lawmakers, Democrats, the plaintiffs and others, but said this map’s compactness is “superior or comparable.”

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

Republicans controlled the redistricting process in the state in 2011 and drew a map that gave their party a considerable advantage. In 2012, 2014 and 2016, they won 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats, even though the party only won about 50 percent of the popular vote. GOP voter registration also lags behind Democrats significantly in the state. In a 5-2 decision last month, the state Supreme Court said the map “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s Constitution.

Democrats have been closely watching the redistricting battle, because it could offer a chance for the party to pick up a handful of seats in Congress. The Brennan Center for Justice estimated that the old map had accounted for an additional three to four GOP seats in Congress.

Preliminary analyses of the new map showed congressional races in the state being much more competitive for Democrats.

Republicans have already signaled they will likely file a federal lawsuit challenging the state Supreme Court’s map. They argue that only lawmakers and the governor can draw congressional lines, not courts. The lawmakers made a similar argument in a request to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the argument was rejected by Justice Samuel Alito.

Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R) and House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) criticized the court’s map in a joint statement Monday and said implementing the plan would put the state into a “constitutional crisis.”

“Implementation of this map would create a constitutional crisis where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is usurping the authority of the Legislative and Executive branches. We anticipate further action in federal court,” the statement said. “This entire exercise, while cloaked in ‘litigation,’ is and has been nothing more than the ultimate partisan gerrymander – one brought about by the Democrat Governor acting in concert with liberal politically-connected litigants.”

Wolf praised the court’s decision in a statement Monday and said he would work with election officials to make sure contests run smoothly.

“Over the last month, I have personally heard from thousands of Pennsylvanians and they are sick and tired of gerrymandering, which perpetuates gridlock, alienates citizens and stifles reform,” Wolf said. “I have stood for fairness and rejected a proposed map that was universally seen as another partisan gerrymander. I applaud the court for their decision and I respect their effort to remedy Pennsylvania’s unfair and unequal congressional elections.”

Mimi McKenzie, legal director at the Public Interest Law Center, which helped represent the 18 Democratic voters who filed the suit, said voters in other states should be encouraged to bring similar suits.Meanwhile back in the states... I leave for a couple of days and y’all lose your muthafucking mind!! Why did this happen? Not everyone supposed to do this y’all! You might as well should have ask me to sing. Wtf?!https://t.co/M7eIzgGBrkThe couple who took in Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old who confessed to opening fire at a South Florida high school last week, say he seemed “normal” the morning of the deadly shooting.

Kimberly and James Snead of Coral Springs, Florida, allowed Cruz, a friend of their son, to live in their home after his adopted mother died in November. The couple spoke out about their relationship with Cruz on Monday in their first TV interview since the shooting, which left 17 people dead and more than a dozen others injured.

“The only thing that was maybe different was that he didn’t go to school ... that particular morning,” Kimberly Snead told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Cruz told the Sneads that he “didn’t go to school on Valentine’s Day,” James Snead said.

“I still can’t process it because this isn’t the person we knew,” Kimberly Snead continued. “Not at all.”

Cruz, previously expelled from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, told police that he used an assault-style rifle to carry out the attack on the school Wednesday.

The FBI admitted Friday that the agency had failed to follow protocol after receiving a tip from a caller in January who claimed Cruz had a “desire to kill people” and “the potential of him conducting a school shooting.”

The law enforcement agency was also alerted to Cruz’s behavior in September, when a Mississippi man reported a comment that a YouTube user named “nikolas cruz” had left on a video. The comment said, “Im going to be a professional school shooter.”

Cruz’s classmates said he bragged about his “arsenal” of weapons and killing toads on his social media accounts, according to The New York Times.

But the Sneads said Monday that they weren’t aware of any apparent red flags.

“Everything everybody seems to know, we didn’t know,” James Snead said on “Good Morning America.” “We had rules and he followed every rule to the T. ... He was very polite. He seemed normal.”

“As far as the animal killings, he never did anything like that at our house,” he said. “We have animals and he loved our animals. Our animals loved him.”

Cruz was charged Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder. He is being held without bail. Kimberly Snead described being overcome with emotion when she first saw Cruz at the police station after the shooting.

“I really wanted to strangle him more than anything,” she said. “I tried to reserve myself. I said, ‘Really, Nik? Really?’ I yelled at him. He mumbled something, but I didn’t hear him. He said he was sorry. ... I was just furious and heartbroken.”WASHINGTON ― Dozens of students gathered in front of the White House on Monday to demand changes to gun laws, just days after a mass shooting at a Florida high school left 17 people dead.

The demonstration was organized by Teens For Gun Reform, an organization created by students in the Washington, D.C., area in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

Protesters participated in what they said would be a three-minute lie-in, which began around 12:30 p.m. on Presidents Day. They lay down in front of the White House “in representation of the victims of school shootings,” according to a post on the group’s Facebook page.

“By doing this, we will make a statement on the atrocities which have been committed due to the lack of gun control, and send a powerful message to our government that they must take action now,” the group wrote on Facebook.

Following the lie-in, protesters continued to hold signs in support of stricter guns laws and shouted phrases including “Shame on you” and “Disarm hate” toward the White House. The group also chanted “No more deaths,” “Am I next?” and “Hey, hey, NRA, how many kids have you killed today?”

Last week’s massacre at the South Florida high school, in which a 19-year-old former student opened fire using an assault-style rifle, sparked protests and calls to action from students nationwide.

A group of students who survived the Parkland shooting have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump and lawmakers who receive financial contributions from gun lobbying groups such as the National Rifle Association.

On Sunday, the students announced plans for a march on Washington to demand congressional action on gun violence. The event, dubbed “March For Our Lives,” is scheduled for March 24.

Whitney Bowen and Eleanor Nuechterlein, both 16-year-old high school students from the D.C. area, started Teens For Gun Reform just two days after the Parkland shooting.

“We might be 16 now and we might not be able to vote, but we can protest and we can use social media and we will make our voices heard.” - Whitney Bowen, co-founder of Teens For Gun Reform

“You never wake up thinking it’s going to be your school or it’s going to be your friends or family,” Bowen told HuffPost. “The Parkland kids didn’t either. ... They woke up and went to school for the last time because there’s not enough gun control.”

Monday’s protest at the White House was planned on Presidents Day for symbolic reasons, Nuechterlein said. It’s not enough for President Donald Trump and other politicians to say “sorry” after school shootings, she said, they also need to start taking real legislative action to prevent them from happening.

Both Bowen and Nuechterlein said they plan to attend next month’s march on Washington.

“We might be 16 now and we might not be able to vote, but we can protest and we can use social media and we will make our voices heard,” Bowen said. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t come down to politics. It comes down to kids dying in classrooms.”

Elodie Camus, a 15-year-old student at the British International School of Washington, D.C., participated in the White House protest Monday with her mother.

U.S. gun laws “have put so many people in danger over the years in this country and there needs to be reform,” Camus told HuffPost, adding that she no longer feels “safe at all” at school.

“Something needs to be changed so not as many people are harmed,” she said.

Felicia Garber, whose two daughters survived the Parkland shooting, was in D.C. with her family when she heard about Monday’s protest and decided to attend the demonstration.

“We felt it was important to be present and thank the people who felt it was worth coming out here on this cold, dreary, rainy holiday to help let whoever is in this beautiful White House know that we will not take this any longer,” Garber told HuffPost.

“These legislators need to step up for our children and not just for these lobbyists,” she continued. ”[Parkland] kids are smart, educated, savvy ... and they are outraged. These are young adults who are ready and unforgiving, and I can only hope this is the beginning of the change they can create for our country.”

Several other student-led protests against gun violence erupted across Florida on Monday. Students staged a walk out at Olympic Heights Community High School in West Boca Raton, while parents joined their kids in front of American Heritage School in Plantation just 30 miles to the south.

The trailer promptly set off controversy.

“Bohemian Rhapsody” stars Rami Malek as Mercury and, based on the trailer, traces its subject’s rise from aspiring singer-songwriter to era-defining superstar. But one Hollywood heavyweight cited the current publicity as indicating that the film, due out this fall, may downplay the Queen frontman’s sexuality as well as his battle with AIDS.

Writer-producer Bryan Fuller, who created the television series “Pushing Daisies” and “American Gods,” tweeted his distaste for what he perceived as the “hetwashing” of Mercury’s story on Tuesday. The real-life Mercury was, by varying accounts, gay or bisexual.

ANYONE ELSE MILDLY ANNOYED (enough to tweet about it) THAT THE #BohemianRapsody TRAILER FEATURES GAY/BI SUPERSTAR FREDDIE MERCURY FLIRTING WITH AND TWIRLING WITH A WOMAN BUT NO INDICATION OF HIS LOVE OF MEN? — Bryan Fuller (@BryanFuller) May 15, 2018

In a second tweet, Fuller attached a screenshot of 20th Century Fox’s synopsis for the film. The studio’s description notes that Mercury faced “a life-threatening illness,” but does not specify HIV or AIDS.

The star died in 1991 at age 45, just one day after publicly coming forward about his long-rumored diagnosis.

DEAR 20TH CENTURY FOX... Yes, it was a life-threatening illness, but more specifically it was AIDS. From having gay sex with men. Do better. #HETWASHING #BohemianRapsody pic.twitter.com/sz8QJU7cCA — Bryan Fuller (@BryanFuller) May 15, 2018

Responding to fans who took issue with his criticisms, Fuller, who is openly gay, suggested that the creative team behind “Bohemian Rhapsody” did not “respect [Mercury’s] identity.”

It seems that the filmmakers do not respect his identity. — Bryan Fuller (@BryanFuller) May 15, 2018

I hear you. The bigger issue is using "bi" as an excuse to emphasize one aspect of his sexuality over another - i.e., the part that can be identified in marketing as "heterosexual" not bi. — Bryan Fuller (@BryanFuller) May 15, 2018

My point is for marketing people at Fox. FM is a queer artist. Showing him only romantic with a woman is erasing a huge facet of what made him a queer artist. You may know FM was bisexual, but most of America doesn't. They see a man romantic with a woman. That does not say "bi." — Bryan Fuller (@BryanFuller) May 15, 2018

When contacted by HuffPost, a spokeswoman at 20th Century Fox had no comment on Fuller’s remarks.

The latest criticism, whether premature or not, follows a series of hiccups that “Bohemian Rhapsody” has experienced in its journey to the big screen.

“Borat” star Sacha Baron Cohen had long been slated to play Mercury, but reportedly left the project in 2013 over disagreements as to how the movie ―

which includes Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor on its roster of executive producers ― would portray the singer’s private life.

“Not one person is going to see a movie where the lead character dies from AIDS and then you see how the band carries on,” Cohen later told radio host Howard Stern.Facebook

Children in a Missouri town are selling raffle tickets offering an AR-15 assault-style rifle as the prize to raise money for their baseball team. The rifle is the same type of weapon used last week in the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people.

The raffle was launched before the shooting, but Levi Patterson, the coach of the team in Neosho for boys 9 and younger, told The Kansas City Star he plans to continue with the fundraiser.

Patterson said he decided to “turn it into a positive thing” after “getting the hate” in the form of angry Facebook posts after the raffle was first reported.

The weapon was donated as a prize by a team father and co-founder of Neosho gun manufacturer Black Rain Ordnance Inc., which is currently pitching a Spec15 AR pistol on its Facebook page.

“Are you all tone deaf?” a Facebook user asked in a since-deleted post on Patterson’s Facebook page. “AR15 kills seventeen so you raffle a gun for child sports? Lord, people wake the hell up.”

There was also some criticism on Twitter:

Opening Day in #Neosho. Ammo Night. First 500 patrons get free bullets and chewin' tobacco. https://t.co/c3QwrAIZoL — Jack Donohue (@DonohueSports) February 18, 2018

Patterson said “our hearts break” for the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But he added that gun raffles “have been going on for years. Evil has and will always exist.”

Patterson said none of the children on his team will be forced to sell raffle tickets for the weapon if they’re uncomfortable doing so.

“I just think they have feelings to this specific type of gun [that are] different than people around here do,” he told the Star.

Patterson said supportive donations have been pouring in as well.

Kansas Republican Tyler Tannahill, who is running for a congressional seat, and Missouri GOP U.S. Senate candidate Austin Peterson have also been criticized for each offering an AR-15 giveaway to draw attention to their campaigns, KMOV-TV reported.

Another gun raffle in Michigan has been cancelled, the Detroit Free Press reported. The raffle, which was to raise money for the football team of South Lyon High School, also featured an AR-15.A top state election official pressed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Friday to explain why President Donald Trump continues to downplay the threat of Russian hacking while the nation’s intelligence agencies and members of the president’s Cabinet warn that Russians are likely to interfere again.

The exchange came Friday during a meeting between a handful of secretaries of state and Nielsen. Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos (D) said he told Nielsen it was good to hear top intelligence officials warn of Russian hacking this year, but that Trump was sending a confusing signal by seeming to buck their assessment.

Nielsen said the president recognized the interference, but declined to further elaborate, according to Condos. The Vermont secretary of state, who is the president-elect of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said he had a similar exchange with Christopher Krebs, a DHS official who oversees cybersecurity for the department. Condos has previously made similar public comments about the contradicting messages sent by the intelligence community and White House.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the exchange.

The exchange underscores the frustration state election officials face as they gear up to try and protect elections from potential Russian interference this year. Russians scanned election systems in 21 states in 2016 and penetrated systems in a small number of states, but did not change any vote totals, DHS cybersecurity head Jeanette Manfra told the Senate Intelligence Committee in June. In January of 2017, the FBI, CIA and NSA released a joint assessment saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed hacking of the 2016 U.S. election.

Top intelligence officials told Congress last week that Russia is already interfering in the 2018 midterm elections and held a classified briefing over the weekend for election officials across the country on electoral threats. Several legislative proposals to improve U.S. election security have stalled in Congress since the 2016 election.

Unlike members of the intelligence community and his Cabinet, Trump has declined to issue a similarly clear warning about Russian interference. He has said both that Russia meddled in the 2016 election but also that he believed Putin when he denied interfering. He has also said Russia could have interfered, but that it also could have been a “400 pound genius.”

After special counsel Robert Mueller detailed Russian interference in a 37-page indictment Friday, the White House released a statement that seemed to acknowledge the idea of some Russian interference. In a Sunday tweet, Trump said he never denied that Russia meddled, a claim numerous fact-checkers have debunked.Kukors said Hutchison waited to have sex with her until she was 18, and the two later moved in together. The swimmer described Hutchison as manipulative, jealous and verbally abusive. Hutchison has reportedly denied the allegations.

Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic swimmer and founder of the advocacy group Champion Women, told SCNG it’s somewhat common for top coaches to marry swimmers they once coached. That culture, she says, is wildly problematic.

“When the organization allows for marriages, allows for the 11-year-old to see her 18-year-old teammate who she thinks is a peer, she thinks they are the same, they go to the same meets, they’re staying in the same hotel, they are working out together, then she sees that [older swimmer] marrying their coach so she thinks this is true love and doesn’t recognize what an inappropriate situation this is,” Hogshead-Makar said.

President Donald Trump signed a bill into law last week that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual abuse by regulating the governing bodies of amateur athletics, like USA Swimming. The legislation requires coaches and other sport officials to report any abuse allegations to police within a 24-hour period, and extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a person realizes they were abused. The bill also limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn’t their parent.

“[This bill] goes across all amateur sports, not just gymnastics, not just swimming ― it’s all amateur sports to protect all kids,” Jeanette Antolin, a former gymnast who was abused by Nassar, told HuffPost in January. “Because all kids should be able to go and do sports without having to worry about adult predators.”

Head over to the Orange County Register to read the report in full.Mark Janus doesn’t want to pay fees to the labor union that represents him. If the Supreme Court gives him the chance to opt out, the Illinois state employee will gladly take the justices up on their offer.

So, too, could millions of other public sector workers across the country, which would be a huge blow to the U.S. labor movement and, by extension, the Democratic Party.

Janus, a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, is at the center of what could be the most consequential labor case the court has heard in years. He works under a contract negotiated between the state and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union he wants nothing to do with. But AFSCME has to advocate for Janus whether he wants it to or not, because the law requires a union to represent everyone in a bargaining unit equally.

The contract stipulates that each worker in Janus’ unit must chip in to cover the costs associated with collective bargaining ― commonly called “fair-share” or “agency” fees. No one can be forced to be a full-fledged member of a union or to help pay for its political activities. But in Illinois and many other states, workers like Janus can be required to pay these mandatory fees if a union represents them.

After Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) tried to challenge the state’s law allowing fair-share fees, Janus joined the lawsuit as an injured party. The Supreme Court will hear his case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, on Feb. 26.

Although fair share fees have been upheld as legal for decades, the high court’s conservative majority is likely to strike them down as unconstitutional. If the court rules against AFSCME, the entire U.S. public sector would essentially be a “right-to-work” zone ― meaning employees could no longer be required to pay anything to the unions that bargain on their behalf. There are already 28 “right-to-work” states; the Janus case would affect the other 22 states, which have an estimated 5 million public sector workers.

A ruling in Janus’ favor would squeeze a critical revenue stream for organized labor at a time when overall union membership rates are already hovering near historic lows.

“I think for some unions it will be existential, in the sense that they haven’t prepared for it and don’t have the solidarity to survive it,” said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University Law School. “The unions that are run well and have dedicated members will come out okay, and those that are just relying upon the mandatory fees will not.”

Conservative groups have planned for this moment for years. Their chance nearly came in 2016, after the Supreme Court took up a similar case involving a group of public school teachers in California who were paying agency fees to their union. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia led to a deadlock on the court and a reprieve for labor. But the confirmation of President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch ― after the stonewalling of President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland ― gave union opponents the conservative majority they needed for another shot.

Janus declined an interview request with HuffPost through his lawyer, Jacob Huebert, of the Liberty Justice Center, an Illinois legal group with libertarian leanings. According to Huebert, Janus doesn’t support AFSCME partly because he believes the union is trying to secure too much pay and benefits for workers like himself, at too great a cost to Illinois.

“I can’t speak for his political views,” Huebert said. “But I do know he objects to the positions AFSCME has taken in bargaining, in part because he thinks AFSCME demands would impose an unreasonable financial burden on the state, at a time when the state already can’t pay bills.”

“I’m definitely not anti-union. Unions have their place and many people like them. … I was never given a choice,” Janus told the Washington Free Beacon in October. “I really didn’t see that I was getting any benefit [from union membership]. I just don’t think I should be forced to pay a group for an association I don’t agree with.”

The Supreme Court upheld the legality of fair share fees in the landmark 1977 public sector union case Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. The court reasoned that since all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from union representation, then a contract can require all the workers to pony up for it. Such an arrangement, the court decided, would promote labor peace. What workers don’t have to pay for is the union’s political expenditures ― campaign donations, election canvassing and the like. That’s why workers can opt to pay only the fair share fees, which are normal dues minus the portion that would go to politics.

But the conservative groups that have funded the lawsuit and filed briefs in support of Janus argue that workers should not have to pay any fees at all on First Amendment grounds. Drawing a distinction between private-sector and public-sector unionism, they claim that collective bargaining for government workers is inherently political, as what the union bargains for ― salaries and benefits for their members ― impacts state budgets and the use of taxpayer dollars. Therefore, the reasoning goes, being required to pay fair share fees amounts to compelled speech.

If the court accepts that argument, it could be harder for public sector unions to survive.

There are plenty of reasons a worker might want to opt out of supporting a union that represents them. Maybe they don’t like the union’s politics. Maybe they think the union’s leadership is lousy. Maybe the union got them a weak contract. But there will be workers who know they benefit from the union but choose to opt out anyway, for the simple reason that it’s in their economic self-interest to do so. After all, the union will have to continue representing them whether they pay fees or not.

Unions call this the “free-rider” conundrum.

“It’s a collective action problem,” explained Martin Malin, a labor law expert at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. “It’s a rational decision ― even for someone who wants to be represented in collective bargaining ― to not become a member, because their dues wont make any [noticeable] difference, and the benefits of collective bargaining are collective goods.”

In other words, the real problem for unions is not workers like Mark Janus, whose personal aversion to AFSCME was strong enough to sustain a yearslong lawsuit. Unions could lose the much greater number of workers who are simply indifferent toward their union and suddenly have the chance to bow out.

Part of the problem for unions is that many of them have had a relatively easy road unionizing workers in the public sector. Local governments, particularly in labor-friendly strongholds like the Northeast, can be far less hostile to collective bargaining than private employers, who often spend large sums of money on union-busting consultants. So a lot of public employee unions haven’t had to continuously fight and organize the way, say, a union of meatpacking workers would have to in the South.

“When you organize so easily, you don’t really build a union. You’re not used to fighting the employer,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor research at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “Now they are going to have to fight the employer. Now they are going to have to fight for every single member. And that’s like private-sector organizing. Their organizers are going to have to be trained. If they don’t do it, they are going to have a lot less money.”

For all the problems Janus’ case presents unions, a ruling against them could force them to be better at what they do. On that, both sides agree: If workers can stop paying fair-share fees, unions will have no choice but to prove their value to those workers. Inattentive and undemocratic unions could no longer afford to coast. The mere specter of Janus ― and the Friedrichs case before it ― has already compelled unions to reflect on their missions in a way many hadn’t before.

The largest public sector unions have undertaken “internal organizing” campaigns to prepare for the case, trying to make committed union members out of the workers they already represent. The hope is that engaging with these workers now will make them much more likely to support the union when they no longer have to.

“Would it have been better if people had taken the issues ― and I hold myself responsible, too ― of member engagement and community involvement as seriously 15 years ago as we are taking it right now? Yeah, of course,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers, a prime target of the Janus case. But “people are pretty transformed by the experience right now.”

Peter MacKinnon, president of the Services Employees International Union Local 509, in Massachusetts, said his union has tried to touch base with every one of its 8,300 public sector members and have them sign “recommitment” cards to the union. So far, they have rounded up roughly 5,000 signatures. In many cases, the conversation has been as simple as asking a member what the union means to them and what it could be doing better.

“It’s a shift that’s been really, really helpful,” said MacKinnon, a social worker. “There’s been some skepticism with members: Wait, you’re actually asking me what I care about? Because we hadn’t done that. And I think that’s the case with a lot of unions. But members are seeing now that this is their union.”

For all the solidarity it builds, the internal organizing comes at a cost. Whatever resources unions are pouring into maintaining their current membership rolls are resources not put into growing them. Much like the state-level attacks organized labor has been fending off ― the rollback of public-sector collective bargaining in Wisconsin, and the right-to-work battles around the country ― a loss in the Janus case will force unions to devote time and money to holding onto the status quo.

“Now they are going to have to fight for every single member.” - Kate Bronfenbrenner, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations

And the status quo isn’t so rosy. A mere 10.7 percent of U.S. workers belong to a union now, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s roughly half the membership rate in 1983, the first year for which government data is available, and far below the rate in the 1950s, when roughly 1 in 3 workers were in a union. The particularly high rate of public sector union membership ― precisely what’s threatened by the Janus case ― has helped to prop up organized labor as a whole. The membership rate for government workers is a robust 34.4 percent, compared to just 6.5 percent in the private sector.

Driving those numbers down helps the Republican Party. Unions not only steer far more money to Democrats than to Republicans, they also provide a lot of the ground game for Democratic candidates, in the form of phone banking and get-out-the-vote operations. A new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that right-to-work laws cost Democratic candidates dearly. Comparing presidential election results in adjacent counties across state lines, researchers found that the implementation of a right-to-work laws cuts Democrats’ share of the vote by 3.5 percentage points.

A weakened Democratic Party, in turn, puts unions in an even more precarious spot, as they have fewer defenders in Washington and in statehouses, making it easier for Republicans to pass laws that hurt labor. So as Janus looms, unions are rethinking not only what sort of candidates they need to support for office, but what exactly unions are supposed to be for their members.

“I think there are things we can do to not only survive but thrive, but it’s going to require changing what we do as a movement,” said MacKinnon. “If we’re viewed as more than just a contract enforcement organization ― as an organization that stands for the values our members care about ― then that’s where the hope is.”“Then that led to more anxiety when I got home because I was like, ‘What have I done? I don’t know.’ And he was married. And it was going to be my first time kissing a married man, and guilt is the worst feeling in your stomach,” Lawrence said during a roundtable discussion with The Hollywood Reporter in 2017.

“And I knew it was my job, but I couldn’t tell my stomach that. So I called my mom, and I was like, ‘Will you just tell me it’s OK?’ It was just very vulnerable,” the actress added. “And you don’t know what’s too much. You want to do it real, you want everything to be real, but then. ... That was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been.”

Just last week, the actress said she accidentally revealed a little more than she intended when she was at comedian Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding in Malibu, California. Lawrence wore a pink Dior dress to the nuptials, but it came “accidentally undone” at the ceremony.A 10-day Carnival cruise of the South Pacific turned into a floating fight club last week when a series of brawls broke out on board.

Up to 30 passengers were injured on what some have described as the “cruise from hell,” the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The cruise line later apologized.

Some guests essentially locked themselves in their rooms aboard the Carnival Legend to avoid the violence, several outlets reported.

“Fights have been going on for a few days now,” Kellie Petersen, who was on board with her husband and three children, told radio station 3AW. “We’re scared. We’ve been told to watch our backs by this group so we’re scared to go anywhere alone in the ship.”

Twenty-three passengers were removed by police during an unscheduled stop in Eden, Australia, for “disruptive and violent acts,” per Reuters. At least one can be seen on video giving the finger to the ship from a police boat. In addition, 14 passengers left the ship, Australia’s 9News reported.

One passenger told 9News that there were multiple fights, with aggressors threatening to stab people and throw them overboard.

“We are so scared after witnessing a traumatic experience with yet again the same offenders,” the passenger was quoted as saying. “It was a bloodbath.”

Several passengers also complained about the behavior of the ship’s security team.

“They were punching women, 16-year-old kids, everything. We saw it, we saw it,” Michael Haddara told the Herald. “They called up the mechanical people from down the bottom, the big boys, to intimidate and basically do what they want.”

Haddara said the crew also threatened passengers with broken bottles. Another passenger told 3AW that security was trying to take cellphones from passengers and delete images of the incidents.

Several people posted complaints about the security team’s behavior on the company’s Facebook page. Carnival responded by saying it was investigating and will take “appropriate corrective action as necessary.”

The company also said that it was offering passengers a 25 percent credit on future cruises. Several travelers have already declined that offer.There’s a reason you haven’t heard new music from Phillip Phillips in a while.

The Season 11 “American Idol” winner was snarled in a lawsuit for years with the show’s production company 19 Entertainment, stalling his music-making. It started in January 2015, when Phillips challenged what he said were “oppressive” contracts for the Fox series, and alleged the production company “manipulated” him into accepting jobs. 19 Entertainment then filed a complaint saying that Phillips owed it upwards of $1 million.

The two parties settled in 2017, allowing Phillips to officially begin work on new songs ― his first since 2014.

Now out with his third album, “Collateral,” Phillips is eager for a fresh start.

“It was scary at first … Before we released the first song — it was like, ‘God, are people going to care anymore?’ Then there are still some people who cared. So it felt good,” Phillips told HuffPost at Build Series.

But there was a point when Phillips didn’t know what his future would hold.

“I felt lost. You don’t know where to belong,” he revealed, adding, “It was a really tough time in my life … I was just sitting at home ... A few months go by, then a year goes by. I’m writing, but it was really tough to write at first because I knew what I was wanting to say, but I couldn’t really say it. I had this block. I got with a couple of people, a couple of people I trust, and we just started writing songs — songs that didn’t even make the album … And they really helped me get through that.”

Also on hand to guide him through the tough time was Phillips’ wife Hannah. The longtime couple tied the knot in 2015, and went through the lawsuit together.

A post shared by Phillip Phillips (@phillphill) on Jan 8, 2018 at 4:26pm PST

“I look at that lawsuit stuff almost as a blessing in a way because a lot of couples go through that first year of marriage — and we’re really blessed to be where we’re at,” Phillips said. “Also, all we had was time … I was still writing, staying busy doing shows. But we were home a lot. We got to know each other in that first year of marriage really well … We got to figure out more things that we like and don’t like about each other.”

It was during that time that Phillips penned a love song for his wife called “Dance With Me,” which is included on “Collateral.”

“I wrote that for my wife for our first dance and she was crying like a baby,” he revealed. “So I won that one. I cried before that. I was crying when I was trying to read my vows, but I couldn’t make it through it. And she was like, ‘Suck it up. Stop crying. This is my moment.’ Then she was crying because it was the first time she heard the song. And I was like, ‘Stop crying. Suck it up. This is my moment.’”

Phillips has come a long way since appearing on “American Idol” in 2012. The “Home” singer said the series not only gave him a platform to showcase his skills, but also allowed him to grow as a performer. Still, he remembered the competition being very competitive.

“Some people are very cutthroat in that competition. I didn’t know what I was getting into. There have been people there that have tried out for it for many years. Some people are really hard core into it. It’s like ‘The Hunger Games.’ … For me, it was a good learning experience being on live television. I just went from playing fraternities and bars and anywhere else that would take me,” he said, adding, “It was a good step because I know what it was like to have no one there to go listen to you. I think it’s good … to know how it feels to suck and not have anyone to listen to you. Because it makes you appreciate when people show up and sing songs that you write.”

These days, Phillips’ fans come to his shows and sing along to his songs ― the new ones included. No longer stuck in a rut, Phillips plans to spend the bulk of 2018 on tour, with his wife by his side.

“I got married with a lawsuit. Then when it was finally over we were like, ’OK, so, we can be married without being in a lawsuit? Sweet. How do we do this?′ ... We smoked a cigarette. We don’t smoke. And we had good cigarette outside.”Washington Capitals hockey player Devante Smith-Pelly blasted the “disgusting” racist chant directed at him during an NHL game in Chicago Saturday night that led to the ejection of several fans.

The incident occurred during a game between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Capitals, in which forward Devante Smith-Pelly was sent to the penalty box after fighting with Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy.

Sitting in the box and surrounded by hometown fans, the 25-year-old Smith-Pelly, a black Canadian, soon became incensed after four Blackhawks fans began racially taunting him with a chant of “basketball,” a Capitals spokesperson told ESPN.

“It’s pretty obvious what that means,” Smith-Pelly told reporters Sunday. “It’s just one word, and that’s all it takes. I got the idea.”

We need to properly educate our country about black history. I’ve seen too many NHL players have to deal with racism. February needs to stay Black history month not “Hockey is For Everyone month” in the NHL. What happened to #Capitals Devante Smith-Pelly is unacceptable but I.... pic.twitter.com/WXqNAyUWyI — Darren M. Haynes (@DarrenMHaynes) February 18, 2018

“It’s disgusting,” Smith-Pelly said. “It’s sad that in 2018 we’re still talking about the same thing.”

The four fans were ejected from the arena after Smith-Pelly told a nearby official, according to ESPN.

The Blackhawks apologized for the actions of their fans.

“The fans were immediately removed and we apologize to Smith-Pelly and the Washington Capitals organization,” the organization said in a statement. “We are committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone who attends our games and these actions will never be tolerated.”Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has reportedly apologized for defending his former chief of staff Rob Porter, who recently resigned from President Donald Trump’s administration following allegations that he abused his two ex-wives.

Hatch sent letters of apology to Jennifer Willoughby and Colbie Holderness, the women told CNN.

“It was a sincere apology for pain he may have caused us,” Willoughby told CNN. Neither woman disclosed the letters.

Porter worked for Hatch before joining Trump’s White House as staff secretary. Hatch defended Porter after The Daily Mail broke the story that Porter had been verbally and physically abusive to Willoughby and Holderness, and confirmed a blog post Willoughby published in 2017 was about Porter.

“It’s incredibly discouraging to see such a vile attack on such a decent man,” Hatch told The Daily Mail at the time. “Shame on any publication that would print this ― and shame on the politically motivated, morally bankrupt character assassins that would attempt to sully a man’s good name.” He called Porter “honest” and “principled.”

A day later, Hatch issued a second statement, saying he was “heartbroken” by the allegations and condemning domestic violence as “abhorrent and unacceptable.”

In his apology to Willoughby, Hatch “reiterated his explanation as to why his statement changed between the two Daily Mail articles,” she said.

“I appreciate his apology,” Holderness added.

Holderness and Willoughby both have described abuse at the hands of Porter. Holderness released photos of a black eye she said Porter gave her punching her in the face while on vacation in Italy. Willoughby said she had to file a temporary protective order after Porter refused to abide by their separation agreement.Last Wednesday, siblings Taryn and Zach Hibshman went to class together at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School like they did every other day.

But Feb. 14 was not like every other day. At least 17 people were killed when a former student entered the halls with an AR-15, marking the 17th shooting incident at a school this year.

Taryn, a 17-year-old senior at the school, shared her account of the tragic day in an essay she posted to Twitter on Monday.

She had left school early last Wednesday to visit a friend, claiming she felt something “so persistent” that told her to leave. Had she stayed at school, she would have been in one of the classrooms where two of her classmates died.

“It felt as though my world had turned black and my legs no longer could perform their sole function and keep me upright,” she wrote about hearing that a shooter was terrorizing her school. She said she felt panicked about her brother, friends, classmates and teachers.

“You see these things on the news and you never expect them to happen near you ― to you ― until they do,” she added. “We have been robbed of the one place we knew to be safe ― home.”

My experience on that terrifying day is different- words cannot begin to describe how I feel, but this is a start. We are the change. #NeverAgain pic.twitter.com/lTkMHv6btT — Taryn (@tarynsara) February 19, 2018

Taryn ended her emotional essay by saying:

We cannot let this happen again. We are united and we are stronger than ever before. We will not be silenced. We will channel our anger and our sadness into motivation to change the society that allowed this to happen. Never again should children fear going to school. Never again should we spend our Saturdays at funerals. Never again should anyone feel how my community, my home, feels right now. NEVER AGAIN.

She also asked readers to join the student-led March for Our Lives protest in Washington, D.C., on March 24 to speak out against against gun violence and mass shootings.

Taryn’s brother, 16-year-old junior Zach, also tweeted his account of the day. Zach wrote that he was “scared, hopeless, confused” and “had no idea what to do” when he heard gunshots ring out in the hallway, so he called his mom.

Zach hid in a closet with several other students “for what felt like 10 hours, but was actually about two and a half.”

“We didn’t know who was outside that door, we didn’t know if the shooter was going to start shooting at us, we had no idea,” he wrote.

My experience on that horrific day. Important political figures need to understand our thoughts and feelings... us students are the catalysts for change ❤️🙏 pic.twitter.com/Ajuzsg89Tz — Zach Hibshman (@ZachHibshman) February 18, 2018

Zach’s wrote that a piece of his soul was taken “and will never be returned.”

“I am just hoping that this will never happen again anywhere; no one should have to experience something of this magnitude,” he added. “This is the last school shooting that’s going to happen. Never again shall we allow this to happen. NEVER again.”

The day after my school got shot up I said to myself “Nothing will ever be the same...” I realized I was right. Nothing will ever be the same. Because of our community’s fellowship and powerful desire to protest for change, we will forever fight for new gun laws... #NeverAgain — Zach Hibshman (@ZachHibshman) February 18, 2018

Taryn told HuffPost that she and Zach shared their stories because they realized what kind of impact they could have.

“It is not always pretty, but people need to hear the horrifying, terrible, and unforgettable truth in order for change to occur,” she said. “We also were not physically injured, so we need to start speaking up for the people who were.”

Zach Hibshman, 16. Tracy Hibshman

Tracy Hibshman, Taryn and Zach’s mom, told HuffPost that it was important for people hear from the kids.

“The power thats coming out of their mouths ... it gives me shivers,” she said.

Taryn also said she wants people to “know that this is not about conservative or liberal or [President Donald] Trump or any of that.”
