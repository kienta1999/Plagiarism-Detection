Rihanna and Prince Harry have hung out together a few times. But as one reporter found out the hard way, that doesn’t mean the “Work” singer is attending the upcoming royal wedding.

In an interview with Access a few days ago, a reporter asked her if she was invited to Harry and Meghan Markle’s big day.

“Why would you think I’m invited?” Rihanna said, giving the reporter a look.

“I don’t know. You met him,” the reporter said.

“OK, you met me. You think you’re coming to my wedding?” she said with a laugh. “Am I coming to yours?”

At the beginning of the interview clip, Rihanna made it clear she didn’t know much about the royal wedding.

“So it that really coming up, like, soon or something?” the Fenty designer asked.

“It’s in a week,” the reporter said.

“Oh, shoot! See, I need to stay on the internet more,” Rihanna said.

Though Rihanna unfortunately won’t be making an appearance (just think about what she would wear!), there will be a few famous faces at the wedding.

Markle’s good friend Priyanka Chopra of “Quantico” has said she’ll be there. Tennis superstar Serena Williams will likely attend as well, though she’s still playing coy about it.

“I don’t know. I think it’s during one of the tournaments, so we’ll see if I can make it,” she said in an interview with Robin Roberts for “Good Morning America.”

Still, Williams offered her friend Markle some handy wedding advice.

“I just think it’s so important to enjoy the moment. And eat the cake. I didn’t get to eat mine at [my] wedding,” Williams said. “We were just having so much fun.”

We suspect he will be making this face.Side note: If the Democrats retake the House in November, Nancy Pelosi could well become speaker again.

That might elicit a different face.Alex Reimer used those words on Thursday commenting on a Facebook documentary about Brady in which the child informs her father she’s going to play soccer. Reimer was suspended indefinitely by the station. Brady on Monday morning cut short his weekly interview on another WEEI show to express his dismay over the comment and said he’s considering whether to stop appearing on the show.

But Brady struck a magnanimous tone later Monday in Minneapolis, the site of Sunday’s Super Bowl between the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles.

“We all have careers and we all make mistakes,” he said at a press conference in the segment above from Boston’s CBS affiliate. “I’d hate for someone to have to change their life because of something like that.

During an appearance on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today,” Eggert became emotional as she described how Baio allegedly began sexually abusing her when she was 14 years old and he was 26. She said Baio continued to molest her “probably once a week” until she was 16.

“We started filming the show in September of ’86 and he immediately took to me and befriended me and earned my trust,” Eggert said. “And then he started expressing his love for me and... talking about marriage in the future.”

“I was still 14, before my 15th birthday,” she said. “We were at his house in his car, in his garage, and he reached over and he penetrated me with his finger. And that is when the sexual touching and abuse started after that... He was also telling me, ‘You can’t tell anybody. This is illegal. I’ll go to jail. The show will be over.’”

Eggert’s interview with Kelly was her first TV appearance since she accused Baio in a series of tweets Saturday of being a “creep” when she was a minor.

Eggert said Tuesday that she lost her virginity to Baio when she was 17, which would have been illegal since the age of consent in California is 18. She first publicly spoke about this around 2012.

Baio responded to Eggert’s tweets in a 16-minute Facebook Live video on Saturday, vehemently denying the allegations and claiming he could prove Eggert was 18 when they had sex.

“My reputation is being damaged, my family is being put through this, and I am done,” Baio said in the video. “What I am being accused of is horrible... She’s my best friend in the world and now all of a sudden I’m the boogeyman.”

Baio, on “Good Morning America” on Wednesday, again denied Eggert was underage during their encounters. He also questioned Eggert’s credibility because she admitted changing her timeline.

Eggert, in a 2013 interview with Nik Richie of The Dirty, said she had sex with Baio after “Charles in Charge” had ended and she was 17. Baio has since pointed out that the show ended in late 1990, when Eggert was 18.

“I’m trying to figure out which time she’s lying and which time she’s not lying because the story seems to change a bit, and I can’t keep up with it, quite honestly,” Baio said on Wednesday.

Eggert has admitted that she lied in her interview with Richie, explaining that she was worried about damaging the reputation of “Charles in Charge.”

She acknowledged on Tuesday that she had appeared on Baio’s reality show, “Scott Baio Is 45...and Single,” in 2007, but said it was to address his issues with “womanizing.” She also addressed a 2013 interview with Yahoo in which she said she would “love” to work with Baio again.

“There are a lot of weird, strange rumors about things that went on between us, but we became really good friends and everything is way more innocent than it was made out to be,” Eggert told Yahoo then.

But Eggert said Tuesday that she wasn’t ready to come forward until recently.

“Shame plays such a weird part and such a strong voice, and you lie,” Eggert said. “I didn’t want anyone to look at me and think I was weak.”

Eggert said she told a few “close, close friends” about the alleged molestation at the time. But, she said, they didn’t have “a good reaction.”

Alexander Polinsky, who also starred in “Charles in Charge,” told “Megyn Kelly Today” that he had witnessed “inappropriate cuddling” between Eggert and Baio on the set.

“Everybody knew the attention that he gave me,” Eggert said. “Everybody was suspect of that... It wasn’t until I was a bit older that I realized, this is not love.”

She went on to lambaste Clinton for bringing “every A-list, B-list, C-list celebrity she could find to help her build crowds,” saying “it didn’t matter” because Americans wanted someone who would “shake up” Washington.Amer Othman Adi, fourth from left, with his wife and daughers. Haneen Adi

Weeks of confusion and inconsistencies from immigration officials ended on Monday after authorities deported a Palestinian man who had been living in the U.S. for nearly 40 years.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement had kept Amer Othman Adi, 57, in detention for two weeks, ignoring a House Judiciary Committee request that the Department of Homeland Security review his case, which would have allowed him to temporarily remain in the U.S.

“In a highly irregular rebuke of Congressional authority by ICE, Amer Othman was ripped from his four daughters, his wife, and the country that he has called home for over thirty years,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who had been fighting his deportation, said in a statement. “Amer was a pillar of the community and brought commerce to a downtown that craved investment. He hired members of our community. He paid taxes. He did everything right. There are violent criminals walking the streets, yet our government wasted our precious resources incarcerating him.”

Othman Adi, who arrived in the U.S. 39 years ago and whose wife and three daughters are all U.S. citizens, had his green card revoked after authorities accused him of marriage fraud. He was never granted a day in court to fight the charge, despite his ex-wife signing an affidavit confirming that the marriage was indeed legitimate and claiming that authorities had pressured her to previously say the marriage had been fake. He and his current wife, Fidaa Musleh, have been fighting the charge for years without success.

Facing a deport order since 2009, he was spared under President Barack Obama’s administration, thanks to a “private bill” passed in the House of Representatives.

President Donald Trump did away with that provision, and in September, Othman Adi attended what he thought was a regular ICE check-in meeting. Instead, agents placed an ankle bracelet on him and told him he had until Jan. 7 to exit the country. He and his wife sold their house in Youngstown, Ohio, and purchased plane tickets to Amman, Jordan ― where he is a citizen. Early this year, he was told that the deportation had been called off.

When he showed up for another routine ICE meeting on Jan. 16, he was detained with zero explanation and placed in jail.

On Jan. 18, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security voted to request that DHS review Othman Adi’s case, which would have placed a six-month stay on his deportation. ICE ignored the request.

“They didn’t comply, they didn’t release him,” one of his daughters, Haneen Adi, told HuffPost last week. “They denied him a stay and now they are just keeping him in prison and not saying when they will let him out.”

Othman Adi’s wife grew increasingly concerned when, on Monday morning, she didn’t receive her daily call from him, she told WKBN. Later that night, around 8 p.m., the family said they finally learned he had been moved from Youngstown to Chicago, where he was awaiting a flight to Amman. Just three hours later and after only a quick goodbye, he left.

Othman Adi’s case is one of several recent key moments for Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, where Americans are seeing not just violent criminals deported, but valued members of their communities as well.

“His story is in so many ways what Youngstown stands for,” Mayor Tito Brown told WOSU of Adi, a successful small business owner. “He’s what Youngstown needs more of.”

Youngstown residents have come out in droves to support Adi, organizing vigils and protests. Former congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich even joined the demonstrations.

“I hope President Trump comes to realize that when his words become public policy in places like Youngstown, families like Amer’s are ripped apart,” Ryan said. “I’m sad that America, and the American Presidency has become a place where politics outweighs doing what is right.”Byrdyak via Getty Images

WASHINGTON — Most trophy hunters consider displaying the head, hide or tusks of a kill just as important as bagging the big one. And advocates of this controversial sport wasted little time asking Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to change some policies that would ensure hunters could bring exotic wildlife killed in other countries into the United States.

In a July letter, which HuffPost obtained last week as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, eight trophy hunting organizations urged Zinke ― who talks often about the hunting community’s contributions to conservation and was quick to outfit his office with taxidermied creatures ― to take swift action to right the perceived wrongs of the previous administration.

Conservation Force, a trophy hunting advocacy group based in Louisiana, spearheaded the July letter. In it, the nonprofit’s president, John J. Jackson III, and executives at several safari clubs and sport hunting advocacy groups called on Zinke to walk back several Obama-era regulations.

First, they asked the interior secretary to roll back a pair regulations that prevented U.S. hunters from importing the trophies of lions and elephants killed for sport in certain African countries. The organizations also petitioned the new administration to reform how the Endangered Species Act is applied to species outside the U.S., and to reject a petition calling on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list all African leopards as endangered under the ESA and restrict hunters from importing their parts. They also called for Zinke to revise seizure and forfeiture practices that they say “discourage lawful tourist hunting.”

The letter writers noted the groups’ members annually “contribute tens of millions of dollars to the conservation of wildlife and protection of habitat across the globe.” They warn that failing to implement the recommendations could hurt African economies, incentivize poaching and threaten the survival of iconic species.

“This is not an ideological issue to us,” Jackson told HuffPost. “It’s traditional conservation practices.”

He called the letter to Zinke an “emergency request” and “an urgent wish list.”

A little more than three months after the letter landed on Zinke’s desk, FWS started fulfilling that wish list — be it strategic or by coincidence.

FWS quietly began issuing trophy import permits for lions hunted in Zimbabwe and Zambia. And a few weeks after that, in mid-November, the administration lifted a 2014 ban on importing elephant trophies from those African countries. It determined that sport hunting of elephants there would “enhance the survival of the species in the wild,” a spokesperson for the FWS said at the time.

The decision sparked widespread public outrage, including from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

But then President Donald Trump tweeted that he was putting elephant trophy imports on hold ― reversing his own administration’s decision less than 15 minutes after FWS released an official announcement. He called trophy hunting a “horror show” and said he was unlikely to allow for such imports.

More than two months later, neither the administration nor the Interior Department has made an official announcement. But in an interview with Piers Morgan that aired Sunday, Trump indicated that the ban on importing elephant trophies will remain in place.

Jackson is among those who argues that expensive safari hunting is crucial to the conservation of big game species. He says the Obama administration failed to protect African species, interrupting the flow of money that groups in Africa use to fight poaching and protect habitat.

“If these elephants’ survival is dependent upon that revenue — those incentives to the government, to the local people — then any delay is detrimental,” he said. “We’re talking about hurting the species.”

Jackson said the Trump administration has not lived up to his expectations.

“We’re disappointed in the progress that’s been made so far,” he said. “Part of it is because of the president’s hold on the progress that had been made [by Fish and Wildlife].”

That Trump would side with the conservation community over gun rights and hunting advocacy groups is surprising. His sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid big game hunters. In a photo that surfaced in 2012, Trump Jr. can be seen holding the tail of an elephant he shot and killed in Africa.

Jackson isn’t alone in his frustration. A day after Trump suspended his administration’s decision to allow elephant imports, the Safari Club sent out a “call to arms,” in which the group encouraged hunters to complain to Trump and Zinke and blasted “hysterical anti-hunters and news media outlets.”

Conservationists and animal rights advocates applauded Trump for stepping in.

“This is the kind of trade we don’t need,” Wayne Pacelle, CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, tweeted in November.

The Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit against the administration Nov. 20, seeking to clear up any confusion about where things stood and to block the Trump team’s effort to roll back the bans on importing elephants and lions. The government’s actions are “arbitrary and capricious,” the conservation groups wrote in their complaint.

African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978. African lions were listed in 2015. A provision of the law, which is intended to safeguard threatened species and the habitats critical to their survival, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population. The FWS concluded that Zimbabwe, for example, had made strides to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts, according to a notice published in the Federal Register.

The decision on elephant trophies has raised questions about Zinke’s close relationship with the sport hunting community, in particular the Safari Club. The organization’s political action committees donated a collective $24,500 to Trump’s presidential campaign and Zinke’s 2014 and 2016 congressional bids, according to Federal Election Commission data.

Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS — who broke the news about the elephant decision to the Safari Club during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum in Tanzania — is a member of the hunting organization.

“It would seem that Zinke is letting Safari Club set Interior’s agenda on wildlife just like other industry representatives are setting the rest of Interior’s work, which is a travesty for wildlife and wild places,” Tanya Sanerib, the international program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told HuffPost via email.

The Trump administration has not yet moved to fulfill any other demands from the sport hunting groups.

But in his time at Interior, Zinke has worked to promote and increase opportunities for hunting and fishing. He installed a “Big Buck Hunter” arcade game in the cafeteria of Interior Department headquarters, which he said would highlight the contributions that hunting and fishing communities make to conservation. And in November he announced the creation of a so-called International Wildlife Conservation Council to advise him on “the benefits that international recreational hunting has on foreign wildlife and habitat conservation, anti-poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking programs.” Jackson told HuffPost he is among department’s nominees to serve on the council.

During his interview with Morgan, Trump said “a very high-level government person” was responsible for the “terrible” decision to lift the Obama-era ban, but he didn’t specify who that was. “I totally turned it around,” he boasted.

Neither the White House nor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded to HuffPost’s request for comment on which high-ranking official made the decision and on whether Trump is planning to keep the trophy import bans in place.

[Obama] at least tries to nuance his unlawfulness...

Donald Trump has said many, many times they want... ‘I’ll do this, I’ll do that.’ And those things that he’s mentioned cannot be done. I think executive orders with Donald Trump would be a very blunt instrument with respect to the Constitution...

[If] Donald Trump is the nominee and eventually the president, he would take, I think, unapologetic steps to use executive power to confront Congress in a way that is truly unconstitutional...

I think he has tendencies that we see in emerging countries around the world, where he goes to the disaffected, those individuals, and says, ‘Look, you give me power and I will give voice to your concerns.’ And that’s a dangerous place to be. And rule of law today ― this president has done more to injure rule of law ― he owes President Nixon an apology with respect to the use of executive power. But President Obama, we don’t need to replace him with another individual ― as you said, our bully ― in the White House, to do what he’s done from the Republican side of things.”Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser in the Lifetime movie “Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance.” Courtesy of Lifetime

No one saw this coming. Not me, and therefore, I assume, no one else. In our defense, the teaser for “Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance” provided no evidence — or even much justification for optimism — that the movie itself would be low-key amazing.

The brief trailer captured all the most cookie-cutter Lifetime moments (like Harry telling Meghan, “I don’t need my life to be this perfect royal picture. I just need you”) and passionate bedroom interludes. This had a haunting appeal of its own, to be sure. It’s ghoulish, but if Lifetime wants to show us fake Harry and fake Meghan smooching topless in bed, I will not turn away.

But approximately every third Lifetime rom-com features a prince going down on one knee in front of a comely American. What makes “Harry and Meghan” different from the usual offering of “handsome-ish barista from Wisconsin portraying the crown prince of Mendavia woos onetime network sitcom child star playing an aspiring fashion designer” — aside from how much wine I drank while watching (about half a bottle)?

The script, for one thing, which hopscotches wildly from schmaltz to snark. After Princess Diana’s funeral, Prince Charles takes his sons to Botswana, where he begins lecturing them on the importance of reflecting on the broader sweep of history by visiting the “birthplace of mankind.”

“You’re not going to start quoting ‘Lion King’ again, are you?” Prince William says with a sigh. Yes! William’s first line in the movie is a crack about the 1994 Disney movie “The Lion King.” Reader, I was done for.

And that’s before we even meet the grown-up William, portrayed by Burgess Abernethy. How striking the resemblance — to your 43-year-old tax accountant. Grown-up William says things like “I’m just having a giggle” and uses a coffee mug that reads “World’s Best Dad.”

Not every royal fares well in the script. The fake Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge (Laura Mitchell), takes on the tough but necessary job of making married life look miserable (“Marriage isn’t so bad, is it, Will?” she asks her husband pointedly, as he evades her gaze), and the members of the royal family look calculating and cold. She doesn’t like that Americans are “so loud,” and sniffs her doubts that this upstart actress could handle the rigors of royal life. By the time we see her assuring Meghan that “us commoners have to stick together” and confiding in her about feeling like a “baby-making machine,” it’s too late: I hate Kate now.

It wasn’t all sunshine and English tea roses for the real Harry and Meghan Markle either. I feared that Lifetime would gloss over the racist reaction Markle faced when their relationship became known and superimpose a more palatable, standard-issue rom-com conflict. But instead of giving us a lame storyline about Meghan — I don’t know — seeing Harry kiss an ex-girlfriend’s cheek and fleeing to Toronto in tears, Lifetime gave us some real talk about race.

OK, sometimes this real talk feels … not so real. At the end of the movie, Queen Elizabeth shows Harry and Meghan a portrait of her ancestor Queen Charlotte, a German princess with Portuguese roots who may have had African heritage. “Oh, yes, you’re of mixed race, Harry,” says Elizabeth. “And so am I!” A very sweet scene that also seems a tad out of character for the matriarch of the royal family, which has long been cool about research into Charlotte’s racial background.

Other moments feel more painfully honest. After a royal hanger-on at a tea makes a snide comment about Meghan’s hair, then tries to touch it, Harry becomes righteously incensed. This is just how things are, she tells him. “Let’s fight how things are!” he exclaims. “If anyone can, it’s you and me.” She replies, calmly, “You have never seen how ugly people can get about this.” To enlighten him, she relates a painful story from her childhood about being out with her mother, who is black, and seeing a white man call her the N-word.

But fake Meghan does not say “the N-word.” She fully drops the word, in the middle of this primetime, soft-filter Sunday romance. Jesus, Lifetime, I hope you plan to pay the dry-cleaning bill for my wine-stained couch.

This could all have gone wildly awry; a script is only as good as the actors who bring it to life. Often Lifetime movies are fronted by former teen soap stars who check only one acting skill box, like “sexy squinting” or “natural-seeming laugh” or “looks like she’s really drinking coffee even though it’s an empty cup.”

But Parisa Fitz-Henley, as Meghan, and Murray Fraser, as Harry, are top-shelf Lifetime talents.

(Fun aside: Fraser is only 23, just a couple of years out of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Fitz-Henley is 41! Talk about goddamn female empowerment. Let’s cast more movies in which the woman is decades older than her male costar.)

When Harry and Meghan engage in first-date banter about his showing up 40 minutes late, it could easily have been a cringingly wooden exchange of quips. I mean, “It would really hurt my street cred to be seen in public with a guy who can’t tell time” is barely even a joke. But Fraser and Fitz-Henley deliver their lines like two people actually trying to impress each other on a date, not like two community theater actors doing a first table read, and I ate up every second of it. When they laughed, I laughed. When they caught their breath and leaned in for a kiss, I caught my breath and leaned toward the TV, which was unreceptive to my advances.

Or maybe it was the wine.

Look, “Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance” is the type of movie best enjoyed with basement-level expectations. Do not cue this up on your DVR and head in expecting a special episode of “The Crown.” This is, as promised, just for the real monarchy trash out there. Only cornballs welcome here! An entire subplot of the film follows Harry’s mystical lion sightings in Botswana, which may or may not be visitations from his late mother. Or, in my mind, Aslan. It’s bonkers!

The edges are rough, production-wise. Who can blame them? A top-quality movie doesn’t get made and released in the six months between a royal couple’s public engagement and their nuptials. At one memorable moment, the two’s first blind date is interrupted by “sunrise,” which arrives with the abruptness of a powerful lamp being switched on offstage. At another, the film noticeably cuts to news footage of a car going into the real Buckingham Palace. Hey, they tried their best.

The movie, in general, leans heavily on their target audience’s knowing the general arc and milestones of Harry and Markle’s relationship, which relieves its creators of the obligation to transition smoothly from scene to scene. Why not just jam in a scene in which Harry confronts a crusty old British lady wearing a racist Blackamoor brooch at Pippa Middleton’s wedding? Princess Michael of Kent did once wear a Blackamoor brooch at a lunch with Markle, and royal fans will be excited to see that tidbit pop up in the fictionalization.

The movie takes certain liberties with the timeline and the actual events in order to squeeze it into a rom-com template, but mostly it’s just a checklist of aww-able moments: The engagement chicken! The public statement from Harry defending his new girlfriend! Meghan bonding with Elizabeth’s corgis! Botswana!

I thought “Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance” would be terrible as well as intoxicating, but instead it was perfect as well as intoxicating. I loved the weird spirit lions. I loved the no-holds-barred approach to race and Meghan’s feminist activism. I loved our new accountant uncle, William. I loved Kate’s rebirth as the British Regina George. I loved when fake Harry told his family that he wouldn’t make Meghan shut down her blog, The Tig, because “that blog is part of her identity.” (Anyway, she totally did shut down the blog, but I appreciate the sentiment.)New York City first lady Chirlane McCray, shown here in September, spoke Monday at the local school system's first Gender and Sexuality Alliance summit.

New York public high school students had the day off Monday, but a group of about 630 students and teachers still gathered at Stuyvesant High School. They were participating in city’s first Gender and Sexuality Alliance summit, sponsored by the local Department of Education.

In the school’s auditorium, student whispers echoed from wall to wall. On stage, openly gay former professional football player Wade Davis told how he spent years as a closeted athlete, before eventually coming to terms with his sexual identity.

“When did you learn you were enough for yourself?” a teenager timidly stood up to ask him.

“Honestly, I’m still learning if I’m being honest,” Davis responded.

It’s been a bleak year for LBGTQ youth around the country. Hate crimes against LGBTQ people have creeped upwards. The Trump administration has worked to actively dismantle the rights of trans students.

But in New York, the education department has been working to help LGBTQ students better advocate for themselves.

The summit was organized by the city school district’s first LGBTQ community liaison, Jared Fox. It featured dozens of workshops on topics such as interacting with police, body image, grassroots organizing, and consent in sexual encounters. Classrooms were labeled with names of LBGTQ icons, like author James Baldwin and tennis star Billie Jean King. A school hang out spot became a coffee shop named for feminist writer and civil rights activist Audre Lorde.

In a workshop hosted by LGBT New York Police Department officers, teens asked officers about their experiences being gay in the force.

“There’s a stereotype of what are you doing here, this is not the place for you,” said officer Aaron Ayala, before telling the students about the department’s internal fraternal societies.

“Ours is an adult GSA,” Ayala said.

The day’s participants included middle school students. They did not have the day off from classes, so they attended as a field trip.

The afternoon’s events topped off with a drag queen story hour, dance party, and appearance by New York’s first lady, Chirlane McCray.The Boring Co. flamethrowers emit a flame less than the 10 feet that would qualify them under federal regulations as an illegal flamethrower. Instagram/Elon Musk

Entrepreneur Elon Musk has captured the world’s imagination with his electric cars, space rockets and renewable energy systems, and now the billionaire is looking to corner the market in a slightly less benevolent area: flamethrowers.

Musk, the founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has recently made headlines with the launch of his company’s Falcon 9 rocket late last year and the impending launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket in February. But besides sending spacecraft into the sky, preparing for the release of the Tesla Semi electric truck and all the other things a genius billionaire businessman does in his day-to-day life, Musk has also launched an actual functional flamethrower for consumers, and he claims he has already sold 10,000 of the $500 weapons.

The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 28, 2018

One of Musk’s newest endeavor is The Boring Co., which aims to quickly dig tunnels while “dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more,” according to its website. Tunnels might sound, well, boring, but the company is linked to Musk’s vision for a rapid-transit Hyperloop system that would use tunnels.

So far, however, The Boring Co. hasn’t been digging as much as it’s been joking. In late 2017, Musk started selling branded caps through the company’s website, raising $1 million from the sale of 50,000 hats. At the time, he made what was thought to be a joke; now it appears to be very real.

I know it’s a little off-brand, but kids love it — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 11, 2017

And so it has come to pass. Over the weekend, Musk tweeted about the flamethrower several times, including posting an Instagram video of himself using the gun to produce a flame about 2 feet long. The short flame length keeps it from meeting the federal definition of an illegal flamethrower, Musk claimed.

“ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife,” he tweeted.

In response to a question posed to them online, the Australian Federal Police advised potential buyers to “check with your local police for local laws.”

But it’s nothing but enthusiasm on the Boring Co. site: “World’s safest flamethrower!” the product description reads.

“Before shipping, aspiring flamethrower aficionados will be sent a terms and conditions rhyme for review and acceptance. Starts shipping in spring.”

In more tongue-in-cheek descriptions, the company advises the flamethrower “may not be used on Boring Company decorative lacquered hay bales or Boring Company dockside munitions warehouses” and “fire extinguisher sold separately (for exorbitant amounts of money).”

A $30 “overpriced” fire extinguisher is also available on the website. After tweeting about hitting the 10,000 flamethrower sales mark, Musk added that only 3,000 of its fire extinguishers had been ordered.

“You can definitely buy one for less elsewhere, but this one comes with a cool sticker,” the website said.

A Californian lawmaker isn’t amused, though. He’s criticized Musk’s incendiary new product and has vowed to push for it to be made illegal in the state.

If this is real, I’m outraged and you should be too. If this is a joke, then it’s a terribly insensitive one given that we’re coming off of the worst wildfire season in history. Either way: NOT FUNNY. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. https://t.co/DCC2xyVsn4 — Miguel Santiago (@SantiagoAD53) January 29, 2018

Ahead of Donald Trump’s first State of the Union on Tuesday, a handful of Democrats, including civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), have chosen to boycott it over the president’s recent racist comments deriding Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries.”

Pointing to Trump’s decision to end protections for so-called Dreamers under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who will skip the speech, announced that Dreamer Aldo Solano will attend in his place.

Many of the Democratic senators and representatives who will be in attendance have also chosen guests who will serve as a rebuke to Trump and draw attention to issues such as immigration, hurricane relief in Puerto Rico, sexual assault and the #MeToo movement, and Trump’s attempt to ban transgender members of the military.

Immigration

Immigration policy will undoubtedly take center stage Tuesday night as Trump and congressional leaders scramble to find a legislative solution to protect the Dreamers program initiated under President Barack Obama. HuffPost counted nearly 30 Democratic lawmakers who are bringing Dreamers as their guests.

Several other lawmakers have invited family members of undocumented immigrants who have been deported under Trump, such as Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), whose guest will be Cindy Garcia. Garcia’s husband, Jorge, was recently deported to Mexico after living in the U.S. for nearly 30 years.

In addition to DACA, Trump administration officials have also announced plans to eliminate temporary protected status (TPS) for thousands of immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and have created uncertainty for immigrants from other countries included in TPS — underscored by Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), who have all invited immigrants who fall under TPS protections.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) invited Jean Bradley Derenoncourt, a city council member in Brockton, Massachusetts, who is originally from Haiti, one of the countries Trump reportedly referred to as a “shithole” in a meeting about immigration issues.

“His story embodies American values of hard work, service, and persistence,” Warren said in a statement.

Sexual misconduct

The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements will also be represented on Tuesday night. Many Democratic women plan to wear black to show solidarity with survivors of sexual misconduct, inspired by the Golden Globe Awards earlier this month.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who has been outspoken about the issue of sexual misconduct in Congress, is bringing Travis Moore, a former congressional aide who helped organize a petition that led lawmakers to begin re-evaluating the byzantine process for reporting misconduct on Capitol Hill.

Speier had previously invited #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, but Burke said that she declined the invitation in favor of participating in a counter-event Tuesday evening with fellow activists.

Multiple lawmakers have invited sexual abuse survivors who have become activists in their states.

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) invited Rose Gunter, niece of Recy Taylor, a black woman in Alabama who was raped by six white men in Alabama in 1944, an event that helped catalyze the civil rights movement. Taylor, who died in December, has now become a symbol of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, and was recently honored by Oprah Winfrey in a stirring speech at the Golden Globes.

Danielle McGuire, a historian whose 2010 book about Taylor brought renewed public attention to her story, will also attend Tuesday’s speech as a guest of Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.).

Members of the Congressional Black Caucus will wear red pins in Taylor’s memory.

Hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico

Several representatives from New York and Florida, states with significant Puerto Rican populations, have invited guests who were displaced from Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria last year, or who have helped the island’s residents with relief efforts.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) invited San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz (D). Not coincidentally, Trump has attacked both women, two of his strongest critics, on Twitter.

Transgender military ban

Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), who will give the Democratic response to Trump’s address Tuesday night, announced that he invited Staff Sgt. Patricia King, a transgender soldier who said that she was the first service member to have the military pay for her gender reassignment surgery.

The Trump administration last year announced that it would ban transgender military service members, a decision that has been temporarily blocked by a federal court.

“I want her to be there as a real person, and the face of an inhumane policy,” Kennedy told The Boston Globe.

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) is also bringing a transgender military service member, Lynda Bengtsson-Davis, a Marine Corps veteran, as his guest.WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday it would not immediately impose additional sanctions on Russia, despite a new law designed to punish Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, insisting the measure was already hitting Russian companies.

“Today, we have informed Congress that this legislation and its implementation are deterring Russian defense sales,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “Since the enactment of the ... legislation, we estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions.”

Seeking to press President Donald Trump to clamp down on Russia, the U.S. Congress voted nearly unanimously last year to pass a law setting sweeping new sanctions on Moscow.

Trump, who wanted warmer ties with Moscow and had opposed the legislation as it worked its way through Congress, signed it reluctantly in August, just six months into his presidency.

Under the measure, the administration faced a deadline on Monday to impose sanctions on anyone determined to conduct significant business with Russian defense and intelligence sectors, already sanctioned for their alleged role in the election.

But citing long time frames associated with major defense deals, Nauert said it was better to wait to impose those sanctions.

“From that perspective, if the law is working, sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent,” she said in a statement.

The measure, known as the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,” or CAATSA, required the administration to list “oligarchs” close to President Vladimir Putin’s government and issue a report detailing possible consequences of penalizing Russia’s sovereign debt.

WOULD TRUMP CLAMP DOWN ON RUSSIA?

Monday’s deadline to release those reports was seen as a test of Trump’s willingness to clamp down on Russia. Critics blasted him for failing to announce any sanctions.

“The State Department claims that the mere threat of sanctions will deter Russia’s aggressive behavior. How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that’s already underway? It just doesn’t make sense,” said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.

“I’m fed up waiting for this Administration to protect our country and our elections,” he said in a statement.

Members of Congress, including Democrats and some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, have been clamoring for his administration to use sanctions to punish Moscow for past election interference and prevent future meddling in U.S. polls.

Shortly before midnight (0500 GMT) on Monday, the Treasury Department released an unclassified “oligarchs” list, including 114 senior Russian political figures and 96 business people.

Those named on the list will not immediately face any immediate penalties like asset freezes or visa bans. But the law mandated that the U.S. Treasury and State Departments, and intelligence agencies, compile a list of political figures and businesspeople close to Putin’s government and network, for potential future sanctions.

Several U.S. congressional committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November’s election in Trump’s favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats and promoting divisive social and political messages online. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion.

Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the main congressional architects of the sanctions law, said he was not concerned that the administration did not announce sanctions by Monday’s deadline.

“This is when sanctions season begins, and so they’ll be rolling them out,” he told reporters.John Leguizamo speaks about immigrant rights at The People's State of the Union. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images

The PSOTU, held on the eve of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, allowed activists and celebrities to discuss several progressive movements. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Moore, Common, Amy Schumer, Rosie Perez and others either performed or spoke at the New York City event.

Snippets of Leguizamo’s speech were shared by BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kimmel via Twitter. The actor spoke about immigrant rights ― calling America “the best country ever stolen” ― and breaking down why everyone needs to vote in this year’s midterm elections.

“As Americans, we are not free unless we are all free and equal,” Leguizamo said. “And until we are all equal ― Latinos, African Americans, Native Americans, Muslims, Jews, Asians, women, LGBTQ ― then we are not truly free. We are still the wretched refuse, we are still the tired, the poor and we yearn to be free. That is the promise of America. That is why we all came to this great country.”

Leguizamo then took on Trump, referencing his presidential campaign slogan.

“Make America great again, really great ― not just for the white and the wealthy and the male and for a stupid slogan on a hat,” he said. “But for all of us.”

Mike Blake/Reuters

WASHINGTON ― The Republican National Committee said Tuesday that it plans to keep donations from hotel magnate Steve Wynn, even though he is accused of sexually harassing and assaulting women who worked for him.

The RNC’s insistence that it is entitled to Wynn’s contributions comes after the party argued that Democrats absolutely had to give back money they received from media mogul Harvey Weinstein, who also faced claims of sexual harassment and assault.

Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that dozens of employees who had worked for Wynn described behavior “that cumulatively would amount to a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.” In one instance, he paid a $7.5 million settlement to a manicurist who says Wynn demanded she have sex with him.

RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel told Fox News on Tuesday that she found the stories “troubling,” but she’s willing to give Wynn the benefit of the doubt for now because he says the allegations aren’t true.

“They were so troubling that within 24 hours, Steve was no longer our finance chair,” McDaniel said. “But Steve has denied these allegations. Unlike Harvey Weinstein and [former Democratic Sen.] Al Franken and others, Steve has denied them. There is an investigation that’s going to take place. He should be allowed due process. If he is found of any wrongdoing, we’ll return 100 percent of that money.”

Wynn wasn’t just any donor to the Republican Party. He was the finance chairman for the RNC and part of President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee, and he has donated millions over the years (primarily to GOP candidates and committees).

McDaniel insists there must be “due process” for Wynn, although the party had no problem pushing him out as finance chair ― because it did, indeed, look bad for the RNC to have him running its fundraising. But due process is evidently very important when it comes to money he’s donated to the RNC. Wynn has given roughly $1.3 million to GOP campaign committees.

The RNC also aggressively went after Democrats ― particularly the Democratic National Committee ― when the Weinstein allegations came out. The RNC insisted that its Democratic counterpart return the $300,000 Weinstein donated.

McDaniel said the difference between Weinstein and Wynn is that Wynn is insisting he’s innocent. It’s a distinction the party has made repeatedly, including with Trump, the man at the top of the Republican Party who has also been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women.

The RNC also decided to stand by Republican Roy Moore in Alabama’s recent special election for Senate, even though Moore was accused of pursuing ― and assaulting ― teenage girls when he was in his 30s.

In other words, it appears the RNC will stand by any man as long as he denies whatever he’s accused of doing.

Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who runs the group in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate, told MSNBC on Tuesday that he doesn’t know what his National Republican Senatorial Committee will do with the $100,000 Wynn has given them.

“We’ll make sure we do the appropriate action,” Gardner said.

When pressed, he said he still wasn’t sure what that was.Republicans from Pennsylvania and six other states on Monday offered a slew of reasons why the U.S. Supreme Court should give the Keystone State permission not to comply with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s order to draw new congressional districts ahead of the 2018 election.

Their briefs were part of a long-shot Republican effort to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to review the state court’s ruling that Pennsylvania’s latest congressional map so egregiously benefited Republicans that it “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state constitution. While top GOP state lawmakers say that the high court can review the case because there are federal issues at stake, lawyers for the plaintiffs say that the justices cannot because the case only presents a question under Pennsylvania law.

But first the state lawmakers and their allies need an emergency stay of the Pennsylvania court’s redistricting order, the pleas for which are hitting Justice Samuel Alito’s desk. Alito is responsible for overseeing such appeals from the 3rd Circuit.

Six Republican secretaries of state ― from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and South Carolina ― filed a joint amicus brief on Monday arguing that Pennsylvania could reasonably wait another few years to fix its congressional map. They said that Pennsylvania lawmakers could abide by any new restrictions on partisan gerrymandering during the next round of redistricting in 2021.

That would mean that two more federal elections ― in 2018 and 2020 ― would take place under a congressional map that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found unconstitutional.

Drawing new congressional boundaries just a few weeks before the state’s election process begins would cause chaos and confusion among voters, the Republican officials said.

“The Census will be conducted in 2020, the results distributed in the first quarter of 2021, and the states will have to put new congressional plans in place for 2022,” they wrote in a brief funded by the Republican State Leadership Committee and the National Republican Redistricting Trust, a group that supports GOP redistricting efforts. “In that next round of redistricting, any newly-developed parameters of any limitation on political gerrymandering can be taken into account.”

“Put simply, there is no need to hurry,” they added.

The brief was striking because Pennsylvania election officials themselves have said they could keep the election on schedule as long as the new maps were in place by Feb. 20.

At oral argument before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court earlier this month, the plaintiffs’ lawyers said it would be unacceptable to wait any longer for new maps. Pennsylvanians have already gone through three elections with the current maps in place, they noted. In each of those elections, Republicans took 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats while winning only about 50 percent of the total vote.

The Republican Party of Pennsylvania and 11 of the state’s GOP congressmen similarly filed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block the lower court’s order. They said the new maps would cause confusion and make it more difficult for them to circulate petitions and campaign for office.

The lawmakers also argued that new maps would harm donors and that their campaigns would have to spend more money.

“In the 2018 election cycle, Pennsylvanians contributed over $1.2 million specifically to congressional candidates running in their congressional districts. Conventional wisdom and common experience dictate that a significant portion of these contributors donated as an expression of support for a candidate to represent them in Congress,” the House members wrote. “If the State Court’s [order] is not stayed, the effort and monetary contributions of many Pennsylvanians will have been made to support individuals who do not and/or cannot represent them in Congress.”

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court wants the state legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, to come up with a revised redistricting plan by Feb. 9 and Gov. Tom Wolf (D) to decide whether to veto it by Feb. 15. On Friday, the court announced it would appoint Stanford professor Nathaniel Persily as a special master to draw the maps should the legislature and the governor not comply.

Wolf told HuffPost on Monday that he wasn’t concerned with the quick timeline.

“It takes a heck of a lot more effort to draw a gerrymandered map than it does to draw a fair one,” Wolf said. “Can we come up with the maps on a timely basis? I think we should.”Pink was seeing red over recent remarks from Recording Academy president Neil Portnow.

In response to criticism that only one solo female artist won an award at the 2018 Grammys on Sunday, Portnow suggested that if women in music want to win more awards, they need to “step up.”

He later said his words were taken out of context, but not before sparking plenty of backlash.

On Monday, Pink made her thoughts public online.

“Women in music don’t need to ‘step up,’” the “What About Us” singer said in a handwritten letter posted to Twitter. “Women have been stepping since the beginning of time. Stepping up, and also stepping aside. Women OWNED music this year. They’ve been KILLING IT. And every year before this.”

She continued, “When we celebrate and honor the talent and accomplishments of women, and how much women STEP UP every year, against all odds, we show the next generation of women and girls and boys and men what it means to be equal, and what it looks like to be fair.”

Pink’s letter seemed to get the party started online. Shortly after she posted her thoughts, pop star Katy Perry spoke out against Portnow as well.

👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Another powerful woman, leading by example. We ALL have a responsibility to call out the absurd lack of equality everywhere we see it. I'm proud of ALL the women making incredible art in the face of continual resistance. ✊🏻

On Sunday, Alessia Cara was the only solo female artist to win an award at the 2018 Grammys, sparking the hashtag #GrammysSoMale. The criticism prompted Portnow to defend the decision to Variety, telling the publication in part:

It has to begin with … women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level … [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome.

Portnow said in a statement Monday night that his comments had been misinterpreted. He asserted that he believes “women in music face barriers that men have never faced.”

He called for these barriers to be knocked down and that the music industry “must welcome, mentor, and empower” women.
