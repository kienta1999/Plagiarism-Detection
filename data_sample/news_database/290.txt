The boys of BTS can add yet another achievement to their growing list of accolades.

It looks like the band’s “Mic Drop” remix with Steve Aoki, featuring rapper Desiigner, was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The rapper revealed the news in a tweet on Saturday, and a representative from RIAA confirmed the information with HuffPost. A rep for BTS did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

“Mic Drop” has been on the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, peaking at No. 28.

The group is the first K-pop band to attain the distinction.

After Desiigner dropped the news, the band’s fiercely loyal fans, known as the BTS Army, created the hashtag #MicDropWentGold to celebrate the group’s new win.

Even the U.S. Embassy in Seoul got in on the excitement.

#MICDropWentGold

It’s not a coincidence how Micdrop went gold right on Yoongi Day. He dropped so many mics that the mic is turning gold on it own to prevent from being broken. Now It’s a fact that everything Suga touches turn gold.#BTSARMY #BestFanArmy@BTS_twt #iHeartAwards — ‼️[VOTE] BTS ARMY‼️#SuperStarBTS Game Is OUT now🌎 (@BTSARMYNA) February 4, 2018

According to the RIAA, a song is eligible for gold certification after it surpasses 500,000 units in sales. While each permanent digital download counts as its own unit, 150 on-demand audio and/or video streams are regarded as a single unit by RIAA standards.Of all the Super Bowl commercials, only one was complete fire ... and ice.

In one of the top ads of the night on Sunday, Doritos and Mountain Dew brought us Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman in a rap battle. Dinklage did the lip-syncing gymnastics on Busta Rhymes’ verse from “Look At Me Now” in a room full of fire, because his Doritos chips were so hot, duh. Meanwhile, Freeman lip-synced Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On” in a room full of ice, thanks to his obviously very chilly Mountain Dew.

It was a battle that could rule the Seven Kingdoms, and even inspired “Game of Thrones” fans to tweet that the ad might “confirm” a long-held fan theory that Dinklage’s character, Tyrion, is actually a Targaryen.

People really ran with it.

At long last, thanks to A Song of Ice and Doritos Blaze, we have proof that Tyrion is in fact a Targaryen 🔥 pic.twitter.com/TyXQ2QnJT0 — Mallory Rubin (@MalloryRubin) February 5, 2018

After all, Dinklage was blowing fire out of his mouth ― I’m sorry, Doritos Blaze chips. But no chip is that hot. That’s blood of the dragon right there.

On Monday, HuffPost asked Dinklage about his reaction to the fan response and his thoughts on Tyrion possibly being a Targaryen.

“I love every single theory the fans of our show have, because they’re so much fun,” Dinklage said. “They get to show the dedication and love they have for the show, but you have to understand that it is a Doritos commercial.”

“It’s not ‘Game of Thrones,’” he added. “So [fans] are sort of stretching the limit with that theory when you’re branching out to Frito-Lay commercials. But I say that with all love and respect. Please, I love them. I love the fan theories that they have until the show is finally over.”

Doritos

So Dinklage loves your Tyrion theories, but according to the actor, the ad doesn’t confirm any of them. That’s fair. Doritos ads are nacho problem, HBO.

Also, for anyone wondering, Morgan Freeman probably isn’t a Stark either, despite his affinity for ice. (It would’ve been nice to look forward to some “March of the Penguins”-style narration over the White Walkers’ migration to Winterfell. But, alas, it wasn’t meant to be.)

Even without the ad, there’s plenty of evidence Tyrion actually has Targaryen heritage and isn’t Tywin’s son.

For example, in George R.R. Martin’s books, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen (Daenerys Targaryen’s dad) was known to take “unwonted liberties” with Tywin Lannister’s wife, Joanna. And the mothers of Tyrion, Dany and Jon Snow all died in childbirth, signaling another mysterious connection. Plus, Tyrion is obsessed with dragons, much like a Targaryen should be.

There’s also a supposed prophecy in the books that “the dragon has three heads.” Some fans believe this means there are three Targaryens who will lead the fight to save humanity.

So, yeah, maybe the chip commercial didn’t confirm it, but you can understand why fans freaked out when Tyrion started blowing fire. Doritos used the hashtag #SpitFire, but it might as well have been #TargaryenConfirmed.

Dinklage continued chatting with us about his rap skills, whether he actually beat Morgan Freeman in the battle, and what he thinks about some fans calling for a Peter Dinklage/Morgan Freeman presidential run in 2020.

How much of your performance was inspired by your “SNL” song “Space Pants”?

“Space Pants” I hold dear to my heart. I don’t think they’re very much alike, but sure. If anybody wants to draw a comparison, I’m more than happy to. Thanks for your love of “Space Pants.”

Only love for “Space Pants.” Also, just to be clear, you definitely know the Busta Rhymes rap, right? You didn’t use CGI or camera tricks?

No, we did a variety of different ways, but I will be the first to tell you that deep in my soul I was terrified of getting anything wrong, so I learned it frontwards and backwards.

So do you think you beat Morgan Freeman?

Oh, I think I did, all due respect … but I believe I did. I had the harder job. Busta Rhymes is the fastest rapper in the known universe. No disrespect to Missy Elliott, but I believe Morgan had the easier job. So I think I won, all due respect.

A lot of people look at Morgan Freeman as the voice of God, so what was it like lip-sync-rap-battling him?

What was it like rapping against God?

[Laugh] Yeah!

I wasn’t going to go easy on him just because I have love and respect for the man. You can’t.

You actually like Doritos, right? Or how did you get involved?

[Laugh] They just saw me on the street one day eating a bag of Doritos [and said], “Maybe we can get a Doritos ad.” No, of course, Doritos are incredible … Doritos are the ultimate non-organic food. It’s incredible stuff.

Have you tried Doritos Locos Tacos?

I have not. Do you recommend them?

Uh, yes, but I imagine you don’t eat at Taco Bell much.

No, not so much. But I got to say, usually when you do any sort of acting, like you’re sitting by the dinner table and you have to eat a lot of food or whatnot, usually you spit the food out or you’re eating all day. But in this Doritos commercial, I ate every single Dorito. I hadn’t had one in a while, and they were incredible. I missed them.

So how many takes did you do?

Oh, sometimes I screwed up a take so I could eat another one.

Is that true?

I’m sure. I was pretty hungry.

In addition to “Game of Thrones,” there were a lot of comparisons to Heat Miser and Snow Miser from the animation “The Year Without a Santa Claus.”

I love the old Rankin and Bass productions. That’s a brilliant comparison. That’s the stuff of my childhood. I welcome that comparison.

People were also calling for a Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman presidential run in 2020 after seeing your lip-sync-rap battle.

Wow, we’re in desperate times right now, aren’t we? [Laughs] Yeah, if that’s the case, it says something about our current presidency.

Dinklage/freeman 2020! I see that as a winning ticket! #SuperBowl — Chris McCoy (@chrisdivide) February 5, 2018A former leader in the American Nazi Party is about to be the only Republican on the ticket for a congressional race in Illinois.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier who has repeatedly tried ― and failed ― to attain office, is the only candidate seeking the GOP nod for the seat in the heavily Democratic 3rd Congressional District.

Arthur Jones is seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. congressional seat in Illinois. He's running unopposed. Arthur Jones

Images on Jones’ campaign website showed him speaking at KKK and neo-Nazi events, giving the Nazi salute and shredding the flag of Israel. He called the Confederate flag the symbol of “white pride,” “white resistance” and “white counterrevolution.” Jones also told the Sun-Times that the Holocaust was “an international extortion racket.”

Party leaders have disowned Jones.

“The Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones,” Tim Schneider, chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, told the Sun-Times. “We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District.”

Jones mocked the party’s attempts to stop him.

“Well, it’s absolutely the best opportunity in my entire political career,” he told the Chicago Tribune. “Every time I’ve run it’s been against a Republican who follows this politically correct nonsense. This time they screwed up.”

The primary is March 20.

Jones is the second candidate that the state GOP has tried to distance itself from in recent days. State Rep. Jeanne Ives, who is running in the primary for governor, was blasted by the party for a campaign ad that mocked transgender people and feminists, among others.

Schneider called on her to “pull down the ad and immediately apologize.”President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump greeted cheerleaders as the couple hosted a Super Bowl watch party at Trump International Golf Club near West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday.

According to The Sun-Sentinel, the Florida Atlantic University marching band serenaded the president and first lady with tunes including “Hail to the Chief” and “Shut Up and Dance.” The president then shook hands with the cheerleaders after they performed.

Earlier in the day, Trump sent out an official Super Bowl statement, in which he said “we proudly stand for the National Anthem” as we thank our servicemen and women, voicing his continued objection to NFL players who kneel during the Star-Spangled Banner to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The president previously encouraged fans to boycott the league over the protests, and said he’d “love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired.’”

NBC, the network broadcasting the Super Bowl, said ahead of time it would be sure to show players who choose to kneel during the national anthem, though none of the Philadelphia Eagles or New England Patriots players ended up doing so.

Trump hosted a Super Bowl watch party from the same golf club last year, but left early when the Patriots were down 28-3 in the third quarter, missing the team’s history-making comeback.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress may soon embark on a racially-fraught policy battle over “welfare.”

“We can lift our citizens from welfare, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity,” Trump said in his State of the Union address last week, the latest signal that Republicans want “welfare reform” this year.

Trump has often pandered to racists among his supporters. He said Mexico sends “rapists” to the United States and that there were some “fine people” among the neo-Nazis who staged a deadly protest last year in Charlottesville, Virginia. When the president said Mexican heritage made it impossible for a judge to be fair, House Speaker Paul Ryan called it the “textbook definition” of racist.

The word “welfare” is different. It’s a standard political term that Democrats, Republicans and journalists alike use ― though Republicans use it the most often. There’s nothing overtly racialized about welfare. You can even find it in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution.

And yet, the word is often loaded with racial meaning. As a new HuffPost/YouGov survey shows, much of the public has a distorted view of which groups receive the bulk of assistance from government programs. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say either that most welfare recipients are black, or that welfare recipiency is about the same among black and white people.

HuffPost

The numbers reflect a significant overestimation of the number of black Americans benefiting from the largest programs. Medicaid had more than 70 million beneficiaries in 2016, of whom 43 percent were white, 18 percent black, and 30 percent Hispanic. Of 43 million food stamp recipients that year, 36.2 percent were white, 25.6 percent black, 17.2 percent Hispanic and 15.5 percent unknown. (Food stamps are formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.)

In one sense, HuffPost’s survey asked an abstract question: The federal government doesn’t run a program that is actually called “welfare.” The word can describe any instance of the government helping people or businesses, though it’s most commonly used to describe programs that benefit the poor.

These days, to Republican lawmakers, welfare means Medicaid, food stamps and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Paul Ryan and hardline conservatives in the House of Representatives have said they want to make changes to those three programs this year under the banner of welfare reform.

Historically, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is probably the program that has most frequently been called welfare, as it was created in the famous “welfare reform” of 1996. As a result of that reform, the program today is much smaller than its predecessor, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and it only served 2.7 million people in 2016. Of those, 36.9 percent were Hispanic, 27.6 percent white, and 29.1 percent black ― meaning that if they had this particular program in mind, HuffPost’s survey respondents who said the number of white and black beneficiaries are “about the same” were basically right.

Survey respondents’ estimation of who receives welfare tracked closely to their estimation of who gets food stamps. Nearly two-thirds of poll respondents said the program’s recipients are mostly black or that there are as many black Americans as white Americans receiving benefits. Only 21 percent correctly said there are more white than black food stamp recipients.

“Across the programs people overestimate the share of recipients who are black,” said Elizabeth Lower-Basch, a senior analyst with the Center for Law and Social Policy. “It’s not surprising because we all know people’s images of public benefits is driven by stereotype.”

Trump himself harbors mistaken views of who receives welfare benefits, according to reporting by NBC News. During a meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus last March, one member of Congress told Trump that welfare cuts, which the president had proposed in his budget, would harm her constituents, specifying that not all of them were black.

According to NBC News, Trump said, “Really? Then what are they?”

Trump supporters are also more likely than Clinton voters to overestimate the share of welfare and public housing benefits that go to black recipients.

HuffPost

The perceptions of who benefits from programs may affect the favorability of the programs themselves. White Americans are more likely to support “assistance to the poor” than “welfare,” one 2014 study found. And other polling has shown that whites are 30 points likelier to agree that “average Americans have gotten less than they deserve” than they are to say the same about black Americans.

Last year, House Republicans and Trump signaled they wanted reforms to food stamps, specifically increased “work requirements” that would deny benefits to the sliver of SNAP and Medicaid recipients who are able bodied but don’t have jobs. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested he didn’t have much interest in pursuing major changes to safety net programs.

Even without McConnell’s support for a full-fledged reform of food stamps, Congress will definitely have to consider the $70 billion program later this year because it needs to be reauthorized.

Last week, Trump and Ryan talked about “workforce development,” in what might be a new euphemism for Ryan’s longstanding goal of shrinking the federal safety net. Ryan reportedly told fellow Republicans at a GOP retreat in West Virginia last week that workforce development means “getting people the skills and opportunity to get into the workforce.”

It’s even harder to believe that the person who occupied the next seat happened to work for CNN.

But that was the unlikely background for an article the news outlet published on Monday. The documents included a December 2017 report, marked “For Official Use Only” and “important for national security,” evaluating how prepared various officials were in the event of a biological attack at the 2018 Super Bowl. According to the documents, there were various areas that could have been improved, mainly among local officials.

The boarding pass and travel itinerary that CNN also found belonged to Michael V. Walter, the government scientist who runs BioWatch, a DHS program that ran anthrax drills before Sunday’s game, according to CNN.

Aware that CNN had obtained the documents, the agency requested that the news outlet not publish anything related to the report before the Super Bowl, CNN said, and asked that it withhold some of the material out of national security concerns. The network complied.

“This exercise was a resounding success and was not conducted in response to any specific, credible threat of a bioterrorism attack,” DHS acting press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton said in a statement, noting that preparation for the game took two years. “It is important that operators regularly exercise their capabilities against a wide range of scenarios in order to effectively counter the changing threat environment.”What started in October as a rallying cry to purge Hollywood of sexual predators has evolved into a global reckoning ― ousting alleged abusers from the U.S. Senate, Westminster in Great Britain and beyond. The #MeToo movement, sparked by women demanding accountability for sexual misconduct, is now exposing an ugly side of Canadian politics.

On Friday, HuffPost Canada reported that a senior member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party team stepped down after multiple women accused him of behaving inappropriately in the workplace. The departure of Claude-Éric Gagné, who allegedly harassed female staffers while serving as Trudeau’s deputy director of operations, is the latest in a shocking wave of misconduct-related resignations shaking up the capital.

Political upheaval

Late last month, two provincial Conservative Party leaders stepped down within 24 hours. The Nova Scotia Tories’ Jamie Baillie was the first to go on Jan. 24, after an independent investigation found that he breached workplace harassment rules. The next morning, Ontario Conservative leader Patrick Brown resigned, leaving his party in disarray months before provincial elections. Two women have accused him of committing graphic sexual offenses several years ago.

The Ontario Conservative Party president, Rick Dykstra, who allegedly sexually assaulted a young employee in 2014, stepped down days later.

On Thursday, the New Democratic Party announced the suspension of Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir, pending an investigation into harassment allegations. Months earlier, a teenage student claimed that a former candidate of the Saskatchewan NDP had raped her.

Trudeau’s Liberals, haunted by sexual misconduct scandals preceding the 2015 election, lost federal cabinet minister Kent Hehr on Jan. 25. Hehr quit his post as sport and disabilities minister after his former colleague, Kristin Raworth, accused him of making inappropriate sexual remarks years earlier. Raworth said she decided to eventually speak out because “it’s incredibly important in the current climate we are in that we have these conversations about abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace.”

The government’s response

The prime minister also accepted the resignations of Nunavut MP Hunter TooToo in 2016 and Calgary MP Darshan Kang in 2017 as similar allegations emerged. But the flood of recent revelations has forced him to explicitly address the #MeToo problem brewing in Canada’s Parliament.

“Sexual harassment ... in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable,” he told world leaders in Davos, Switzerland, last month. “We must each have a well-understood, established process in place to file allegations of workplace harassment, and when we receive those complaints, we must take them seriously.”

When pressed about how he’s handled allegations within his own party, Trudeau said he considers each situation inidividually.

“I don’t have a rule book that’s been handed down to me from [former Prime Minister] Wilfrid Laurier, as leader of the Liberal Party, on how to handle these situations,” he said during an Ottawa news conference. “This is new for organizations to have to deal with in this way and we are doing the best that we can on a case-by-case basis.”

Last week MPs agreed to fast-track legislation introduced last fall to address workplace harassment in federally regulated industries. Once passed, Bill C-65 would enforce strict privacy rules to protect victims who speak out, and would bring parliamentary staff under the protection of the Canada Labour Code for the first time. It will not apply to people working in the private sector.

Beyond Ottawa

The country’s foray into the #MeToo spotlight has uncovered a culture of sexual harassment and abuse that far transcends the political landscape. Two prominent Canadian gymnastics coaches were recently charged with sexual offenses, and a third was suspended amid allegations that he sexually abused minors decades ago. Albert Schultz, the co-founder of one of Canada’s leading theater companies, was forced to step down last month after four actresses accused him of sexual harassment.

More than 2,400 women have initiated sexual harassment or discrimination claims against the RCMP, Canada’s national police force, and lawyers expect that number could soon rise to 4,000. The organization has a long history of mistreating its female recruits. Currently, two former RCMP doctors are facing a total of no less than 80 complaints of sexual misconduct.

In Quebec, the head of “Just for Laughs” comedy festival, Gilbert Rozon, stepped down in October in the wake of bombshell allegations of rape and other forms of sexual assault spanning decades from well-known actresses and media personalities. On the day of Rozon’s resignation, French media broke a story detailing a series of sexual misconduct accusations against Quebec radio host Eric Salvail.

And on Saturday, a HuffPost Canada investigation leveled allegations of sexual harassment and abuse of power against a high school principal in London, Ontario. Two teachers and a former student accuse Michael Deeb of sexual misconduct, including complaining about his married sex life, talking about his sexual desires and making unwanted advances.

Moving forward

The deluge of allegations confronts Canada with some of its most high-profile sexual misconduct scandals since the Jian Ghomeshi case. In 2016, the former CBC radio host was acquitted of numerous counts of sexual assault, despite damning testimony from multiple women. Ghomeshi’s accusers and their supporters used the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported to share their experiences and to demand accountability. His stunning not-guilty verdict later spawned the #IBelieveSurvivors movement.

HuffPost Canada editor-in-chief Andree Lau has noticed clear parallels between the Canadian and American movements that have shone a light on so many previously unheard accounts of alleged abuse.

“It’s no surprise that women in Canada have been galvanized by what’s happening with #MeToo in the U.S. since media coverage flows so easily across the border,” she said.

Lau said she believes the media has a responsibility to listen to and amplify survivors’ stories.

“This time is yet another reminder for us in media to work harder to reach people whose experiences have not been shared and their voices not heard,” she said, “and at the same time to strive for fairness, accuracy and due diligence.”Singer Lana Del Rey performing in 2012. Reuters

Police in Orlando, Florida, say they foiled a 43-year-old man’s alleged plan to kidnap pop singer Lana Del Rey.

Michael Hunt of Riverview was arrested on Friday evening just a block away from Orlando’s Amway Center, where Del Rey — whose real name is Elizabeth Grant — was scheduled to perform to a crowd of about 8,000.

Hunt, who faces charges of attempted kidnapping and aggravated stalking, was found in possession of a knife and a ticket to the concert, police said.

They added that Hunt had neither made it inside the venue nor made contact with the singer.

Police told the Orlando Sentinel they’d received a tip from a caller who said Hunt had posted “cryptic and threatening” posts on social media about Del Rey.

A Facebook account believed to be Hunt’s show multiple posts published recently about the singer, who he referred to as his “queen.”

“I love you so much Lana I can’t wait to be back in your arms in a few days baby I hear you singing I miss you baby I miss you so much Lana,” Hunt wrote in a Jan. 29 post.

The next day, he wrote that he wanted to “see my queen on Friday,” the date of Del Rey’s Orlando concert.

“[F]rom that day forward our decisions will be as one,” Hunt wrote.

He also suggested in other posts that he was “leaving town” for good. In a video posted on Wednesday, Hunt spoke of “tak[ing] off with Lana.”

Orlando police said they’d determined Hunt’s threats against Del Rey were “credible” and officers “worked swiftly to ensure the safety of everyone involved and of everyone who attended the show.”

According to the Sentinel, Hunt has served five prison terms for a range of crimes, including burglary and grand theft of a motor vehicle.

He is currently being held at the Orange County jail without bond.

Del Rey’s concert at the Amway Center went on as planned on Friday night. After the show, the singer posted a note on Twitter thanking her Florida fans for their support and tweeted Sunday that she was “doing fine.”

Grateful. pic.twitter.com/qGVBUSEXGO — Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) February 3, 2018LOS ANGELES ― Jim Mangia, CEO of the St. John’s Well Child and Family Center, spent much of the last year wondering how many of his facilities he would have to shutter. St. John’s is a network of health clinics serving roughly 100,000 of the poorest people in Los Angeles. If Republicans had succeeded in repealing the Affordable Care Act, St. John’s revenue would have dropped as more of its patients became uninsured, making layoffs and closings all but inevitable.

The threat of repeal seems to have subsided, at least for the moment. But these days Mangia has a new worry. A federal program called the Community Health Center Fund, which subsidizes federal clinics through direct grants, officially expired in the fall. Congress has since made a pair of short-term appropriations, in order to keep the grant money flowing, and leaders in both parties talked about coming together on a deal that would finance the clinics for a longer period of time.

But multiple opportunities to do that have now come and gone, the most recent being the legislation Congress passed last month to keep the government funded through early February.

“We’re really very worried,” Mangia said on Wednesday, during an interview at the organization’s main facility about 4 miles south of downtown. “We can’t keep going like this.”

Jim Mangia, CEO of the St. John's Well Child and Family Center, says his organization will have to close six of its 15 facilities if Congress doesn't replenish a federal grant program that officially ran out of money last year. Jonathan Cohn/HuffPost

The stakes here are substantial. If the funding were to stop completely, as many as 9 million low-income people would lose their source of care, according to federal estimates. They’d have a hard time finding alternatives, even if they managed to hold onto their insurance, because they live in places that don’t have a lot of doctors and facilities with capacity ― or a willingness ― to see them.

That’s certainly true in Los Angeles, where, Mangia says, St. John’s is the largest primary care provider in what is the nation’s largest contiguous area of poverty. Without the federal grants, he says he’d have to close six facilities and lay off 150 staff members, leaving something like 10,000 to 15,000 of his patients with no source of care. The effects would ripple throughout the community, adding yet more strain to local emergency rooms, among other effects.

In theory, nobody in Congress wants this kind of thing to happen ― in Los Angeles or anywhere else. The clinics have a long history of bipartisan support, and serious negotiations over how to extend funding are underway. On Friday, a key House Republican told The Hill that clinic funding could be part of the bill Congress is now crafting to keep the government open through the end of February.

But the Republican leaders who control Congress insist the new spending must have offsetting cuts ― a condition, notably, they didn’t place on their $1.5 trillion tax cut. Democrats seem willing to go along with that, but the parties haven’t yet reached agreement on what those cuts should be. And the temporary funding Congress supplied is about to run out again.

It’s entirely possible that, in order to get a deal done, Republicans will insist Democrats give up some other item on their agenda, which is precisely what happened with reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program last month. It’s also possible that funding will last for only a year or two, which means the clinics woul be right back in the same situation come early 2020.

The Clinics Provide A Lot More Than Medical Care

There are roughly 10,000 federally qualified health centers around the country. They must abide by certain rules, like operating on a nonprofit basis and setting up boards with community representatives to oversee their operations. The clinics also must take all patients, whether they have private insurance, Medicaid or no insurance at all. These requirements, which entitle the clinics to grants from the Community Health Care Fund, are what distinguish them from other clinics serving low-income populations.

The clinics trace their history to President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty and, unlike some other programs of that era, they have generally enjoyed enthusiastic support from both parties. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each made the clinics a priority, pouring billions upon billions of dollars into them. That money has allowed clinics to build new facilities and hire new staff, making it possible not just to see more people (patient volume nearly tripled between 2001 and 2017) but also to offer more services.

The growth at St. John’s is as good an illustration as any of how important the money has been. When Mangia took over in 1995, it had just one facility. Today it has 15, including two school-based clinics ― that is, clinics on or adjacent to school grounds that can handle both kids and their families.

St. John’s has also upgraded its onsite medication dispensary, which relied heavily on inconsistent donations, to a full-fledged pharmacy. It has introduced dental and behavioral health services. And it has brought on full-time nutritionists who, among other things, offer classes on how to cook ethnic food with healthier, but still cheap, ingredients.

At one of the smaller sites, with no kitchen or conference space, the clinic holds the cooking classes outside ― “under the trees,” as Anitha Mullangi, the clinic’s medical director, likes to put it. She worried the setting might discourage patients but, to her surprise, it’s among the most popular classes she’s seen, because it’s drawing family and friends from the community.

More traditional prevention efforts are also a major focus at St. John’s and Mangia has a pile of statistics, which the federal government requires clinics to collect, to show the progress in just the last few years. Since 2014, when the Affordable Care Act’s insurance expansion took place, the childhood immunization rate in the clinic’s patient population has increased from 76 to 89 percent, to take one example. The cervical cancer screening rate has more than doubled, from 40 to 88 percent.

But some of the most interesting work at St. John’s takes place outside the clinic, through outreach programs designed to address underlying problems that contribute to bad health. “Obviously we can’t solve poverty in and of itself,” Mangia said, “but we can impact on some of the conditions of poverty ― and empower and educate our patients, so they can take control of their health.”

One such effort is an initiative called “Healthy Homes, Healthy Kids” that focuses on a pair of childhood scourges, asthma and lead poisoning. A big factor in both problems is poor housing conditions ― everything from roach and rat infestations, which create hazardous dust that children inhale, to lead paint, which crumbles into chips that children eat. Through the Healthy Homes initiative, St. John’s workers teach families about low-cost ways of reducing these hazards ― like using boric acid, cheap and widely available at stores, to kill roaches. The outreach workers also work with tenants on petitioning landlords to make structural repairs.

“When you are living in an area where 70 percent of the housing is slum housing, and most of it was built before 1978 when they banned lead in paint, you’re dealing with a lot of [hazardous] conditions,” Mangia said. “We had to develop a creative program that got to the source and didn’t only treat the symptom and send kids back to the very conditions that were making them sick in the first place.”

The Clinics Are Popular, But They’re Still Waiting For Money



St. John’s is among the larger, better known clinics in America. But its work is entirely emblematic of what’s been happening across the country over the last few years.

Since 2010, a period during which total clinic visits have increased by roughly 26 percent, dental visits have increased by 43 percent and behavioral health visits have increased by 57 percent, as a recent brief from The Commonwealth Fund noted. In places like Cleveland and New Orleans, Michigan and Montana, it’s the same story over and over again ― clinics are serving way more people, in ways they never could before.

That helps explain why they are so popular and, even now, draw support from across the ideological spectrum. In the Senate, several members of the Democratic caucus, including Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Patty Murray (Wash.) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) have been among those agitating to renew center funding. But they are hardly alone. One of Stabenow’s allies is Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who has co-sponsored a bill that would give the clinics new money.

The holdup, for now, is agreeing on the money’s source. To keep the fund at current levels, Congress would have to appropriate roughly $3.5 billion a year. But advocates for the clinics argue, plausibly, that they ultimately save the government and the country more money than they cost, because they reduce expensive emergency rooms visits and make it possible for more people to work.Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright delivered a scathing hit-and-run Twitter attack on Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) for the House Intelligence Committee memo he orchestrated slamming the FBI investigation of a one-time member of President Donald Trump’s campaign.

The memo, released Friday, claimed that the FBI obtained a warrant to monitor Carter Page without informing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the bureau’s request was based on Trump opposition research gathered for the Democrats. House Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and other sources said the court was aware of the context of the information and the memo has been criticized as inaccurate and misleading.

Albright, who became the nation’s first-ever female secretary of state in the Clinton administration, is currently a professor at Georgetown University. Based on her teaching principles to those aiming for jobs in the government, Albright said she’d “have to give” Nunes an “F” for his failure to be “compelling, accurate and unbiased.” She quipped that she hoped voters will “do the same in November.”

It’s a good thing Devin Nunes is not taking my course on national security decision making. I expect my students’ written work to be compelling, accurate, and unbiased. By those standards, I would have to give him an F. Let’s hope his constituents do the same in November. — Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) February 3, 2018

Nunes has become the man of the hour on Twitter, most notably for being the brunt of an overwhelming number of #YoMemo and #YoMemo Jokes that take jabs at the “weak” and “so dumb” dud memo.

A brand new Twitter site falsely purports to be from “Devin Nunes’ Mom,” whose profile says: “I’m so, so sorry.” One tweet boasts about the beautiful petunias on her lawn, which features a campaign sign for a Democrat vying to unseat him in November, Andrew Janz.

Thank you so much for your help! If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.Kathleen Hartnett-White testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in November. Senate EPW

The White House plans to withdraw its controversial nomination of Kathleen Hartnett-White to lead the Council on Environmental Quality, HuffPost has confirmed.

Hartnett-White, a former Texas regulator, eked through the confirmation process last year with only Republican votes despite radical views on issues like climate change and a humiliating public hearing at which she struggled with basic science questions. Democrats sent her nomination back to the White House in December as part of a deal with the Republican majority to close out the legislative session. But President Donald Trump re-nominated her early last month.

But on Saturday, The Washington Post reported the administration’s plan to pull the nomination after it ”failed to gather momentum even as some of the administration’s other senior environmental policy picks had won approval, with some Senate Republicans raising questions about her expertise.”

The White House confirmed the plans to HuffPost.

Democrats and environmentalists, who vehemently opposed her nomination, hailed victory late Saturday.

“In this case, it was abundantly clear very early on that heading up the Council on Environmental Quality wasn’t the right job for Ms. White,” Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement late Saturday.

“I often say that when you think you’re right, when you know you’re right, you should never give up,” he added. “When it comes to insulating our towns and cities from climate change, or protecting our children from toxic pollutants and chemicals, there should be no compromise.”

No Republican publicly opposed Hartnett-White. But it’s not surprising that her history of taking extreme stances to defend polluters gave lawmakers some pause.

She previously railed against her own party for failing to campaign on the idea that the United States has “almost no real environmental problems.”

“What you never hear and regrettably not even from our side is there is no environmental crisis,” she said in 2011 at an Americans for Prosperity conference titled, “The EPA’s Job Crushing Regulatory Assault.”

“Fossil fuels dissolved the economic justification for slavery.” - Kathleen Hartnett-White

She has made the claim that “people do not die from particulate matter levels,” despite World Health Organization estimates that some 3 million people worldwide die per year from particles in the air.

Harnett-White also credited coal with abolishing slavery, claiming “fossil fuels dissolved the economic justification for slavery,” and attacked the EPA’s rules to limit mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants.

For GOP lawmakers like Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who have fought to clean up mercury contamination, that could raise concerns.

“Kathleen Hartnett-White is a conspiracy theorist and anti-science extremist who would threaten public health as the White House’s top environmental advisor,” Sara Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. “This is a victory for science, and Trump would do well to listen to our voices and nominate someone who will put communities, not polluters, first.”It is a virtual certainty that when players from the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots line up on opposite sides of the field ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, Minnesota, none of them will kneel, raise a fist or protest in any other fashion.

This is, in part, a product of circumstance: No Patriots player protested all season, and none of the teams that still had protesting players at the end of the NFL’s regular season managed to make the playoffs. It is, in another version of events, a sign of a victory won by the players on behalf of the issues of racial justice and oppression their protests had sought to highlight: The Eagles’ Malcolm Jenkins, who for much of the 2017 season raised his fist during the playing of the national anthem, agreed to halt his protests after striking a controversial deal with the NFL whereby the league will pour millions of dollars into various social and racial justice-oriented campaigns.

And yet, the protests that started with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 will be notably missing from football’s main event, another entry in the history of black athletes’ protest and the freighted absences it creates.

This was, as HuffPost columnist Jamil Smith wrote this week, the “blackest year in NFL history” ― a season defined by Kaepernick’s lack of a contract and claims that he had been blackballed. A season defined by the continuation of the protests he began and by President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on the “son of a bitch” players who spoke out against America’s racism and his own. A season defined by the NFL’s doddering responses that, at every turn, were geared more toward stopping the protests by any means necessary to appease the anxious white members of its audience than understanding the protests’ purpose or their significance.

This was the season the underlying dynamic of the sport, and of professional sports in general, was laid bare: Black men make up some three-quarters of the participants in a league that exploits their labor for the entertainment of largely white fans and the enrichment of mostly white owners. Which is why, when a black athlete removes himself from the normal proceedings of American sports, or when he is removed by force or by silent decree, a charged space forms. Kaepernick, Craig Hodges, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the Wyoming Black 14 — the story of black agitation in sports is the story of profound absences.

And so, at Super Bowl LII, notwithstanding Monday night’s Black Lives Matter protest in St. Paul, the NFL’s blackest year will end with the absence of agitation itself.

The last time Minneapolis hosted a Super Bowl, in 1992, a series of protests against the Washington Redskins, who won that game, touched off the modern version of the movement against the team’s racist name. A lawsuit against the team’s trademark protections followed later that year; only this past fall did a second version of that suit fall at the hands of the Supreme Court.

The NFL and Washington’s owner have remained intransigent in the face of continued opposition to that name. The league has argued for more than two decades now that “Redskins” is not a “dictionary-defined racial slur,” as Native American groups say, but a symbol of “honor” and “respect” — waving away any suggestion that the stereotyping of Native Americans might exacerbate the inequalities and disparities they face in a country that for centuries has tried to eradicate them.

Perhaps, as Jenkins argued after his splintered Players Coalition reached its deal with the NFL, the league will be more forthcoming and less cynical in its efforts to help its black players address the problems they and their communities still face.

But there are reasons to share in the skepticism felt by players like 49ers safety Eric Reid, one of the first to join Kaepernick’s protest. Reid split with Jenkins and the Players Coalition over what he saw as a deal meant only to put a stop to the protests.

The NFL’s brass has long seen its league as separate from America’s problems, a bastion of unity that stands above the political and social issues that divide and define us.

Last year, ahead of Super Bowl LI in Houston ― home to millions of Latino immigrants and more refugees than any other city in our country ― reporters peppered NFL commissioner Roger Goodell with questions about Trump’s attempts to ban refugees from certain majority-Muslim countries. They asked about his plans to build a wall along the Mexican border. Goodell demurred, pointing back to the ideals of unity, pretending that the NFL is an inherently apolitical institution.

This is a lie, of course. The NFL owes its existence as a multibillion-dollar corporation to politics and political activism, and it is plenty willing to engage in the sort of politics that boost its bottom line: It stymies concussion research; it zealously pursues taxpayer funding for stadium construction; it lobbies for beneficial tax and antitrust treatment in Congress. And it continuously wraps itself in Americana, patriotism and militarism to pander to the white folks it sees as its primary fan base.

But these are the politics of self-preservation and self-enrichment, and they work best when paired with a furious backlash against any effort to change the status quo. The messages of the protesting players are distorted as somehow offensive to the military, or as a form of “reverse racism.” Athletes and sports commentators are ordered to “stick to sports.” Trump has harnessed the white backlash to the protests. Now others are, too: This week, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) issued a proclamation calling on the state’s residents to stand during the anthem before the Super Bowl.

I ask that all South Carolinians show the world our state’s resolute commitment to supporting our troops by standing for the national anthem wherever you watch the Super Bowl with your loved ones this Sunday. #IStand pic.twitter.com/x5pK3zPNTO — Henry McMaster (@henrymcmaster) January 30, 2018

NFL owners ― many of whom financially supported Trump ― were eager adopters of the argument that the protests from Kaepernick, Jenkins and dozens of other players had turned off white fans. And so under the guise of Goodell’s oft-stated mantra of protecting “the shield” — a metonym alluding to the league’s heraldic symbol — they sought to end the protests in an effort to keep the show going and the dollars flowing.Nothing can come between Pink and her Super Bowl performance ― apparently not even the flu.

The “So What” singer revealed that she is battling the flu but remains determined to power through Sunday’s performance of the National Anthem before the Philadelphia Eagles take on the New England Patriots in Minneapolis.

“I’ve been waiting to sing this song since 1991 when I saw my idol, Whitney Houston, own this song. And now, my chance has finally come,” she posted on Instagram on Saturday, insisting she will not be denied.

A post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Feb 3, 2018 at 12:37am PST

“I’ve arrived at another one of my dreams which is slowly becoming a sort of nightmare. I will tell you, this is one of the biggest honors of my life, singing this song in front of my family, my military family, my dad and brother and step mama and family and the world. And the EAGLES!?!?! I promise I will do my best, as I always do,” she shared.

Should anyone have any doubt about her ability to pull off the honor, the 38-year-old mother of two, who grew up outside of Philadelphia, carried out an energetic pre-Super Bowl concert on Friday at the Armory in Minneapolis.

During that performance, she belted out several of her hits while flying in the air and dancing on stage.

She at times did request help from her backup singers to fill in for her. She also cut short her song “Beautiful Trauma,” telling the crowd: “I can’t do it.”

“I hate this,” she said, according to The Associated Press. “I can’t do that song. I’m sorry.”American colonialists tied one on to gloat about a New England Patriots’ victory over the British army at Bunker Hill in a revolutionary Super Bowl spoof featuring “Saturday Night Live” alums Tina Fey and Rachel Dratch.

“We are the Patriots of New England and we are unstoppable!” shouts Dratch.

“Do we even know how to lose? No!” boasts colonialist Alex Moffat, who talks about “Captain Thomas Brady” having the “best cannon.”

“‘Dynasty.’ That’s the woid you’re looking for: ‘dynasty,’” pipes up Natalie Portman in a New England accent.

“We eat the most lobsters ... we got the most rocks in the soil, so how do ya like us now?” asks one of the Patriots.

Not so fast. Up pops the delegation from Philadelphia.

“How ya doin’?” asks Tina Fey with a couple of compatriots. “Philly’s mad strong from the little babies to all our mom-moms and pop-pops, we’s ready to fight ... so grease up them poles because Philly is going to win and one of these guys is going to punch a police horse.”

She adds, “Call us the Eagles, cuz we ready to fly. ... Like eagles, we Philadelphians are swift, we are deadly and our eyes are all a little too close together.”

She dismisses Boston as “a college town with a fishing pier.”

Colonial leader Beck Bennett congratulates the “patriots of New England” on their “remarkable success.” He adds, “I believe I speak for this entire chamber when I say, just shut up.”

To the Philly folks he notes: “You are overdue for victory, and I wish you all the best in your upcoming battle. But if you do win, please, be cool. Just because the British did not burn down your city, doesn’t mean you have to.”

Dratch has one parting shot to the rivals: “One if by land, two by your mother.”Prince fans are up in arms over rumors that Minnesota’s beloved music icon could make a posthumous appearance as a hologram during the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday.

TMZ reported Saturday that Justin Timberlake planned to use the high-tech effect to pay tribute to The Purple One during his halftime set at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. A Friday night rehearsal of the show included the hologram, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Fans and members of Prince’s inner circle, including his sister Sharon L. Nelson, immediately condemned the potential plans to use the guitar legend’s likeness in holographic form.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES did we approve of this! Prince's music moved, NOW THIS! #Istand2protectthislegacy #prnfamily — Sharon L. Nelson (@Sharon_L_Nelson) February 3, 2018

But Sheila E., who collaborated and maintained a close friendship with Prince for decades, tweeted Saturday night that she had spoken with Timberlake and confirmed there would be no hologram.

Family, I spoke w/Justin 2nite and he shared heartfelt words of respect for Prince & the Purple fans. I look 4wrd 2 seeing what I’m sure is going 2 be a spectacular halftime show. There is no hologram. 🙏🏽💋 pic.twitter.com/mhVXBfBa1B — SheilaEdrummer (@SheilaEdrummer) February 4, 2018

While holograms of late musical legends, including Michael Jackson and Tupac, have been featured at award shows and festivals, Prince was outspoken in his desire to maintain artistic control and integrity throughout his life and even in death.

In a 1998 interview with Guitar World magazine, Prince said he had no interest in using high-tech effects that would allow him to perform with a deceased artist.

“That’s the most demonic thing imaginable,” Prince said. “Everything is as it is, and it should be. If I was meant to jam with Duke Ellington, we would have lived in the same age.”

“That whole virtual reality thing ... it really is demonic,” he continued. “And I am not a demon ... To prevent that kind of thing from happening is another reason why I want artistic control.”

It’s unclear whether Timberlake ever planned to include a Prince hologram in his set or if he scrapped it in response to the backlash. Representatives for both the NFL and Timberlake did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Despite Sheila E.’s attempt to squash hologram speculation, Prince fans continued to express concern over the rumors on Sunday.

Buckle up. — brandon / jinx (@Jersey_Jinx) February 4, 2018The Republican primary challenger in Illinois’ gubernatorial race is in hot water for a campaign ad that mocks the transgender community, Women’s March activists and immigration activists.

State Rep. Jeanne Ives, who is running against Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in the Republican primary, released the ad Saturday in an attempt to challenge her opponent’s conservative values.

Her 30-second spot features actors outfitted to portray a transgender woman, an anti-fascist protestor wearing a hood and a bandana over his face, a member of the Chicago Teachers Union and a Women’s March activist.

Each character mockingly thanks Rauner for enacting policies that support their supposed demographic. The ad, as the Chicago Tribune pointed out, misrepresents the effects of Rauner’s policies.

“Thank you for signing legislation that lets me use the girls’ bathroom,” says a transgender woman in a red dress. The bill the ad is referencing, House Bill 1785, does not mention transgender bathroom rights. Instead, the legislation allows transgender individuals to change their gender printed on birth certificates with a doctor’s approval.

The actor portraying the hooded activist thanked Rauner “for opposing law enforcement and making Illinois a sanctuary state for illegal immigrant criminals.” It was a nod to the Illinois Trust Act, a bill signed into law by Rauner in August barring local law enforcement from detaining someone based solely on their immigration status and limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Another actor, a woman in a pink “pussy hat,” thanks Rauner for “making all Illinois families pay for my abortions,” referencing House Bill 40. Rauner signed HB 40 into law in September, expanding state-funded abortion coverage for women on Medicaid.

After Ives’ ad made its rounds on the internet, advocacy groups, Republicans and Democrats lashed out against Ives, calling her video bigoted and offensive.

Equality Illinois criticized Ives for using a transgender person in the divisive ad, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

“We need a governor who will stand up for all Illinoisans, not someone who will target transgender Illinoisans for their personal political benefit,” the group’s spokesman Brian Johnson told the newspaper.

Ives’ campaign did not return HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Tim Schneider, the chairman of the state’s GOP and a Rauner ally, called for Ives to pull the divisive ad and apologize to the communities it targeted.

Ives’ “campaign ad does not reflect who we are as the Party of Lincoln and as proud residents of our great and diverse state,” Schneider said in a statement. “She should pull down the ad and immediately apologize to the Illinoisans who were negatively portrayed in a cowardly attempt to stoke political division.”

Ives’ campaign later dismissed Schneider’s reaction and claimed that the state’s Republican party is an extension of Rauner’s campaign because it is entirely funded by the governor, the Associated Press reported.

“Rauner betrayed Illinois conservatives. He and his paid-for mouthpieces don’t like his betrayals being illustrated and his radical left-wing social agenda being exposed,” Ives’ spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy told AP. “Rauner is the one who owes Illinois families in general and conservatives, in particular, an apology.”

Pat Brady, the former Illinois Republican chairman, also denounced Ives, calling her “racist, bigoted and homophobic” in a tweet.

A spokeswoman for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Kennedy told the Chicago Sun-Times that Ives’ ad was “appalling and disrespectful to everyone who makes Illinois what it is today.”

“We already have enough hate and bigotry in the White House,” Rebecca Evans said on behalf of Kennedy. “We don’t need a governor who stands silent against Donald Trump, and we certainly don’t need a governor who echoes Donald Trump.”

Ives, who has been a state Representative since 2013, announced her bid for governor in September, in response to Rauner’s decision to sign HB 40 into law and expand state-funded abortion coverage.

In a statement released with the ad, Ives’ campaign appeared unapologetic and said that the video “represents Gov. Rauner’s chosen constituents based on the policy choices he made.”

“Those Republican primary voters who don’t know of Rauner’s betrayals of conservatives need to know. Now they will,” the statement read, according to ABC 7 Chicago.
