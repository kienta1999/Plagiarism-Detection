WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser, will meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday as part of a weekend trip to lead the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics.

A senior administration official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Ivanka Trump will dine with Moon at the Blue House in Seoul on Friday night. She has no plans to meet with North Korean officials, the official said.

Trump will fly commercially to South Korea, eschewing a government jet. Traveling with her as part of the U.S. delegation will be White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

There are no plans for Ms. Trump to get into substantive discussions about the dispute over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests, the official said.

A “winter sports enthusiast,” Ms. Trump will watch some of the Olympic competition on Saturday and Sunday in Pyeongchang, the official said.

“The purpose of the trip is to cheer on American athletes, reaffirm the U.S.-South Korea alliance and celebrate the successful Games,” the official said.

Vice President Mike Pence attended the opening of the Olympics. U.S. officials said he had been scheduled to meet with North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, while in South Korea for the Winter Olympics this month but the North Koreans canceled at the last minute.PODGORICA (Reuters) - An unknown person threw an explosive device, probably a hand grenade, at the United States embassy building in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, before blowing himself up, the government said on Thursday.

Messaging in English on its official Twitter account, the government said that half an hour after midnight (1130 GMT), “An unknown person committed suicide with an explosive device.”

It added, “Immediately before, that person threw an explosive device from the intersection near the Sport Center into the U.S. embassy compound.”

It said, “Most probably, the device was a hand grenade,” adding that police investigation and identification were underway.

A Reuters photographer in Podgorica said a police vehicle blocked the street where the embassy is located, adding that no damage was visible.

The embassy warned U.S. citizens to stay away until further notice.

“The U.S. embassy in Podgorica advises U.S. citizens there is an active security situation at the U.S. embassy in Podgorica,” it said on its website. “Avoid the embassy until further notice.”

Earlier, media in Montenegro had said the attack occurred minutes before midnight.Offering a positive alternative to both the Republican and centrist Democratic policy agendas, more than 70 progressive leaders pledged their support on Wednesday for an 11-point economic plan that includes single-payer health care and free education from pre-K to college.

The pledge reflects a belief by many on the political left that President Donald Trump’s rise is partly due to Democrats’ failure to consistently stand up for the interests of working people of all races and backgrounds. To take back power and build a more just country, they argue that Democrats and liberals must go beyond merely focusing on Trump and the prejudices he espouses.

“We will resist Trump. But resistance is not enough,” the introduction to the pledge reads.

“We therefore pledge that: We will fight for good jobs, sustainable prosperity and economic justice. We will work to build a movement that can make that agenda a reality.”

In addition to endorsing “Medicare for all” and free college, staples of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, the pledge calls for a comprehensive infrastructure investment program, a green energy economy, a reversal of the Trump tax cuts and appropriate taxation of the wealthy, the empowerment of labor unions, and tougher regulation of Wall Street. It also calls for reduced economic inequality for women and communities of color, and reforms like public campaign financing aimed at “rescuing democracy from the special interests.”

Few, if any, of the policies in the pledge are brand new ― a fact that its organizers freely admit.

What makes the pledge notable, however, is the diverse array of figures who have signed it and the debate it represents over the future of the progressive movement and the Democratic Party. Signers range from Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, and United Steelworkers president Leo Gerard to Ai-Jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and Eddie Glaude Jr., chair of Princeton University’s center for African-American studies.

Progressives, particularly those who backed Sanders’ presidential bid, have argued since the election that growing income disparities and the dominant role of money in politics left a populist void that Trump manipulated to his advantage.

The theory holds that as a candidate, Trump’s outsider status, hawkishness on trade and grandiose claims about “draining the swamp,” won over some working-class voters ― particularly white families in the Rust Belt ― who typically voted for Democrats, including former President Barack Obama. At the same time, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s deep ties to financial elites and her history of changing positions meant she failed to turn out more liberal members of the Democratic base, including millennials and people of color.

Soon after the 2016 election, there were signs that Democratic Party leaders were willing to heed these progressives’ advice and strike a more populist tone. In a platform unveiled over the summer, the party’s leaders in Congress embraced proposals to make it easier to unionize, crack down on corporate consolidation and reduce prescription drug prices.

“If the Democrats don’t start talking about a fundamental restructuring of the economy, either they will lose, or when they win, they will fail.” - Roger Hickey, Campaign for America's Future

But with headlines about Russia-related indictments dominating the 24-hour news cycle and the anti-Trump “Resistance” movement often embracing the president’s neoconservative critics, progressive leaders are worried that Democrats will once again drop the ball.

“There’s a large number of people who think all we need to do is oppose Trump, who think all we need to do is find an attractive candidate who runs on the platform of ‘I’m not Trump,’” said Roger Hickey, a co-director of the progressive Campaign for America’s Future and an architect of the pledge.

“We can’t just emerge from this battle saying, ‘We are not crazy, we are not Trump.’ That’s what we did after [Richard] Nixon, and it got us one term of Jimmy Carter,” Hickey added.

Acknowledging the unique factors at play in every election, Hickey emphasized that the pledge is not intended to be a “litmus test” for Democratic candidates as much as a framework for moving forward.

“If the Democrats don’t start talking about a fundamental restructuring of the economy, either they will lose, or when they win, they will fail,” he said.

The most common critique of the political theory behind the pledge is that progressives who claim that Trump’s victory was motivated by anything but blind racism are offensively naive. These critics argue that any attempt to win back the votes of white working-class people who switched from Obama to Trump would entail unnecessary concessions to those voters’ insensitivities to racial injustice and other issues.

But Hickey, a native of Kentucky who began his career as a civil rights movement organizer in Southside Virginia, insisted that fighting for economic equality and racial justice is a “both/and,” rather than zero-sum, proposition.

Support for the pledge from prominent African-Americans like Glaude, Heather McGhee, president of the think tank Demos, and Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, the legacy organization of Sanders’ campaign, could dampen this criticism.Mark Hamill is finally getting his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

The “Star Wars” actor confirmed the news on Twitter Thursday, and also took what appeared to be a shot at President Donald Trump:

Can't say this is a dream come true because I was never foolish enough to think something like this could ever happen. When part of me doubts I deserve such an honor, I remind myself that someone got a "Star" for just one crappy reality show. #BeyondGr8ful 🙏 https://t.co/CEzO0jdD3k — Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) February 22, 2018

“Can’t say this is a dream come true because I was never foolish enough to think something like this could ever happen,” wrote Hamill.

“When part of me doubts I deserve such an honor, I remind myself that someone got a ‘Star’ for just one crappy reality show,” he added.

Hamill did not mention Trump by name, but many of the actor’s followers read between the lines:

he's talking about you fkr @realDonaldTrump — Webberino (@WebbH62) February 22, 2018

What? You don't have one but Trump does? — MyrnaF (@MyrnaFM13) February 22, 2018

Trump was awarded a Walk of Fame star in 2007 for his role in reality series “The Apprentice.”

The official ceremony for Hamill’s star will take place on Mar. 8, according to Variety magazine. “Star Wars” creator George Lucas and Hamill’s costar, Harrison Ford, will assist in hosting the event.

Hamill’s fans were overjoyed at his accolade:

I’m so beyond proud of everything you do — Jarah Spence (@jmalec3693) February 22, 2018WASHINGTON ― A 27-year-old American man detained in Egypt for nearly five years has been freed, according to his lawyer.

“Today, after spending 1,733 days in jail for allegedly committing crimes at a protest he never attended, American Ahmed Etiwy and his cousin were released from an Egyptian prison,” Praveen Madhiraju of the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International wrote in a Wednesday afternoon statement. “The two were released at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, an occasion that has been traditionally marked by such pardons.”

Etiwy was swept up in mass arrests during political protests in August 2013.

Then a 23-year-old student, he was held in a military facility and in prison for over three years before his mass trial with hundreds of others also accused of violence even began. The initial cell he was held in was so small and filled with detainees that they had to take turns sleeping on the floor because they could not all lie down at the same time, a witness told HuffPost last year.

An Egyptian judge sentenced Etiwy to five years in prison in September.

President Donald Trump has made helping U.S. citizens imprisoned abroad a flashy part of his “America First” foreign policy. Trump aides staged a major welcome ceremony last week for three Americans released as part of the president’s diplomacy with North Korea. Trump held a celebration last year after he personally spoke with Egyptian President Abdel-Fatteh el-Sissi on behalf of jailed aid worker Aya Hijazi, winning her release by building on a yearslong campaign by U.S. officials and advocacy groups.

But advocates for Etiwy and at least 10 other Americans held by Sissi have been disappointed by the Trump administration’s approach. They have repeatedly told HuffPost they have had no luck in winning sustained attention from the White House.

A watershed moment came this January when Vice President Mike Pence, during a visit to Cairo, became the highest-ranking U.S. official to mention Etiwy and Mustafa Kassem, the only other detainee in Egypt whose family has publicly spoken about their case.AMMAN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Warplanes pounded the last rebel enclave near the Syrian capital for a fifth straight day on Thursday, as the United Nations pleaded for a truce to halt one of the fiercest air assaults of the seven-year civil and prevent a “massacre.”

More than 300 people have been killed in the rural eastern Ghouta district on the outskirts of Damascus since Sunday night, and many hundreds have been wounded, according to human rights monitors and aid agencies who say Russian and Syrian planes have struck hospitals and other civilian targets.

In the north, where Turkey launched an offensive in the past month against a Kurdish militia, the Kurds said pro-government fighters were now deploying to the front lines to help repel the Turkish advance. Government forces also entered a part of Aleppo controlled by the Kurdish YPG militia, a witness and a monitor group said, although the YPG denied this.

The Kurdish YPG ― allies with the United States in other parts of Syria ― have sought assistance in recent days from the Russian-backed government to resist the Turkish offensive, an example of the unexpected alliances wrought during a multi-sided conflict that has drawn in neighbors and world powers.

International attention is now focused on the humanitarian plight in the eastern Ghouta, where 400,000 people have been under siege for years and where government bombardment escalated sharply on Sunday, causing mass civilian casualties.

“There is a need for avoiding the massacre because we will be judged by history,” U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said.

Residents of Douma, the biggest town in the district, described plumes of black smoke billowing from residential areas after planes dropped bombs from high altitude. Searches were underway for bodies amid the rubble in the town of Saqba and elsewhere, said rescuers.

De Mistura said he hoped the Security Council would agree to a resolution calling for a ceasefire in eastern Ghouta, but acknowledged it would be difficult: “I hope it will. But it’s uphill. But I hope it will. It is very urgent,” he told Reuters as he arrived at the United Nations in Geneva.

President Bashar al-Assad’s veto-wielding ally Russia says a ceasefire would be hard to achieve. Moscow and Damascus say their assault on eastern Ghouta is necessary to defeat fighters who have been firing mortars on the government-held capital.

“Those who support the terrorists are responsible” for the situation in eastern Ghouta, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters. “Neither Russia, nor Syria, nor Iran are in that category of states, as they are waging an absolute war against terrorists in Syria.”

Aid workers and residents say Syrian army helicopters have been dropping “barrel bombs” - oil drums packed with explosives and shrapnel - on marketplaces and medical centers.

Residents and insurgents in eastern Ghouta say high-altitude jets of the kind involved in bombing on Thursday morning are Russian, as Moscow’s warplanes typically fly higher than those of the Syrian air force.

Damascus and Moscow deny targeting civilian areas and accuse rebels of holding civilians as human shields. Western powers have also accused Russia of aiding the bombardment.

SCORCHED EARTH

The opposition-held eastern Ghouta region, home to 400,000 people, has been under siege by government forces since 2013. After government gains in recent years it is the final rebel bastion near the capital.

Along with Idlib province and part of Aleppo province in the north and a strip in the southwest, it is one of just a handful of areas left where large numbers of people remain in territory controlled by fighters seeking to overthrow Assad. The president has vowed to regain control of every inch of Syria.

Residents and opposition figures say the Syrian government and its allies are deliberately harming civilians in a “scorched earth policy” to force rebels to surrender.

“They want to break our will and turn Ghouta into another Aleppo but this is their dream,” said Yusef Dughmi, a resident in the devastated eastern Ghouta town of Arbin overnight.

“Why is the regime targeting us we are civilians and the regime and Russia are only targeting civilians?” Khaled Shadid, a resident of Douma told Reuters by telephone as sounds of explosions could be heard.

Basema Abdullah, a widow who was huddled in a basement with her four children in Douma said: “We are in desperate need for your prayers,” before the connection was cut off.

One of the main rebel groups in eastern Ghouta said Moscow, which had agreed to a “de-escalation zone” in the enclave, would accept only accepting a rebel capitulation. “The Russian concept is complete surrender to the Assad regime’s authoritarian and security grip and they need no excuse to storm the Ghouta,” said Wael Alwan, spokesman for the Failaq al Rahman group.At a “listening session” with victims of gun violence on Wednesday, President Donald Trump needed a reminder to listen.

We know this because Trump ― or one of his advisers ― helpfully wrote it down on a cheat sheet he carried into the meeting.

Cameras captured the list of five pointers while Trump held it in his hands during the session. Point No. 5 on the list reads, simply, “I hear you.”

In the president’s defense, it’s not unusual to bring notes to a meeting. But to need a reminder to let gun violence survivors know you’re listening to them, while at a “listening session” organized for that explicit purpose is ... well, very on-brand for Trump.

The guest list for Wednesday’s session included students and families affected by last week’s shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. It was an emotional affair, as survivors of gun violence recalled lost siblings, frequently struggling to hold back tears.

Hopefully President Trump’s reminder to show empathy proved fruitful, and he was able to bring them at least a small amount of comfort.President Donald Trump elaborated on his proposal to arm 20 percent of teaching staff at schools in a series of tweets Thursday.

Trump first made the proposal during a listening session with students and parents affected by mass shootings, including some from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed last week.

Trump denied he ever suggested giving teachers guns, before arguing “only the best” teachers ― like ones with military experience ― should be given guns.

I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Since Trump first mentioned the idea Wednesday, some teachers have taken to Twitter to push back, arguing they don’t want the responsibility of keeping a gun in their classrooms. But Trump continued to push the idea Thursday morning.

....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Trump argued a “sicko shooter” wouldn’t try to stage an attack on a school known for having armed teachers.

....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Trump again said he’d push for improvements to the federal background check system. Earlier this week, the White House signaled support for the Fix NICS Act, a bill that seeks to address flaws in the national criminal background check database. The bill has the support of both gun control advocates and the National Rifle Association, but has yet to receive a vote in the Senate.

AdvertisementOprah Winfrey surprised actress Tiffany Haddish on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Thursday, and it was quite a moment.

Before we continue, let us explain how much Haddish loves Oprah.

Earlier in Thursday’s segment, Haddish told Ellen Degeneres she not only wants to garden with the media icon but she also wants to open up a booth at a farmers’ market with her called “Tiff and O’s Vegetables.”

She also told DeGeneres in the past that she longed to be close enough with Oprah to call her “Auntie O.”

These dreams almost came to fruition before Haddish was famous and caught Oprah’s attention on the set of the 2005 movie “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Haddish was working as an extra, and her extra personality caught Oprah’s attention. Haddish said that Oprah found her funny and asked Haddish to write to her to keep her informed on her career.

The 38-year-old said she wrote Oprah but never heard back. This promoted DeGeneres to say, “Why don’t we just ask Oprah why she never wrote back? Oprah, why didn’t you write back?”

That’s when Oprah walked on stage and Haddish completely lost it. She just couldn’t bottle up her emotions.

“When I woke up today, I just knew it was going to be magical,” Haddish said to Oprah through tears. “When I looked at myself in the mirror today, I said, ’Girl, today is going to be a magical day.”

Haddish was so thrilled about their meeting that she also posted a photo of her and “Auntie O” to Instragram … three times.

A post shared by Tiffany Haddish (@tiffanyhaddish) on Feb 21, 2018 at 4:55pm PSTPassion is found on the road, on the dance floor and even at a local diner in Nashville-based alt-rock band MONA’s music video for “Kiss Like a Woman.”

The video, which debuted Feb. 13, generated instant buzz for the band, and not just because its romantic theme was fitting for Valentine’s Day. Two of the clip’s steamy smooches take place between same-sex couples.

Lead singer Nick Brown told HuffPost he and bandmates Justin Wilson and Jordan Young wanted to remind fans that “there is joy in being yourself” with the video.

“It is very important to us ― not only as musicians, but just as humans ― to let the people in our lives, especially the listeners, know simply that no matter what walk of life you take that you are loved and accepted and have our support,” Brown said.

As for showcasing same-sex couples against a backdrop of Norman Rockwell-esque Americana, he quipped, “We love tying in classic, timeless vibes. Who doesn’t love a good scene with a motorcycle?!”

Music critics have applauded the gesture. Billboard called the video “a queer make-out celebration,” while Atwood Magazine praised Brown, Wilson and Young for sending a “true American message of love, freedom and acceptance.”

“Kiss Like a Woman” is the first single from MONA’s forthcoming, and as-yet-untitled, new album. It will be the band’s first full-length release since 2013′s “Torches & Pitchforks.”

Meanwhile, MONA ― which has opened for the likes of Arcade Fire, Kings of Leon and Robert Plant ― will kick off its latest era with performances in New York and Los Angeles next month.Fred Guttenberg, the father of a student killed last week in the massacre at a Florida high school, slammed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) during a town hall event hosted by CNN on Wednesday night.

“Your comments this week and those of our president have been pathetically weak,” Guttenberg told Rubio. His daughter, Jamie, was among the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “You and I are now eye to eye. Because I want to like you, look at me and tell me that guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids in this school this week. And look at me and tell me you accept it and you will work with us to do something about guns.”

Father of Florida school shooting victim confronts Sen. Marco Rubio: "Your comments this week and those of our President have been pathetically weak" https://t.co/puYEwpdgTl #StudentsStandUp https://t.co/AC5Zh1NuJa — CNN (@CNN) February 22, 2018

After Guttenberg’s question, Rubio didn’t immediately answer and instead sought to clarify his statements over the past week in which he’s reaffirmed his support for gun rights while remaining open to incremental measures that would prevent some people from obtaining weapons. “Here’s what I said: The problems that we’re facing here today cannot be solved by gun laws alone.”

Guttenberg interjected, demanding the senator say if guns were responsible for his daughters death.

“Absolutely, of course they were,” Rubio replied. “I absolutely believe that in this country if you are 18 years of age you should not be able to buy a rifle. I will support the banning of bump stocks. I will support changing our background system.”

Rubio was repeatedly booed during his response, and the jeers continued throughout the night. The arena, packed with more than 7,000 people, erupted in frustration when the senator effectively said he’d continue to accept campaign donations from the National Rifle Association. Rubio has received more than $3.3 million from the NRA over the course of his political career.

As Guttenberg continued to question Rubio, the Republican once again voiced his opposition to legislation that would ban the class of assault-style weapons, including the AR-15, used in last week’s massacre, saying such a ban wouldn’t prevent such shootings from happening. The stance echoed a speech he gave in Congress last Thursday, when he declared that “if someone has decided ‘I’m going to commit this crime,’ they will find a way to get the gun to do it.”

“Sen. Rubio, my daughter, running down the hallway at Marjory Douglas, was shot with an assault weapon, the weapon of choice,” Guttenberg said after Rubio voiced his opposition to such legislation. “It is too easy to get. It is a weapon of war. The fact that you can stand here and can’t say that, I’m sorry.”CNN is denying reports that it asked a Florida school shooting survivor to read a “scripted” question during a town hall debate on gun violence that aired on the network Wednesday night.

Colton Haab, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were gunned down last week, told local media Wednesday that he declined an invitation to appear on CNN’s program. He said he’d wanted to speak about the possibility of putting more armed guards in schools to protect students ― but, he said, CNN squelched his proposed remarks.

“CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions, and it ended up being all scripted,” Haab told local ABC affiliate WPLG. “I don’t think that it’s going to get anything accomplished. It’s not gonna ask the true questions that all the parents and teachers and students have.”

The network on Thursday vehemently denied Haab’s accusation.

“There is absolutely no truth to this,” CNN said in a statement. “CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night’s town hall, nor have we ever.”

“After seeing an interview with Colton Haab, we invited him to participate in our town hall along with other students and administrators from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School,” the statement says. “Colton’s father withdrew his name from participation before the forum began, which we regretted but respected.”

CNN invited Haab to appear on the network Thursday “to discuss his views on school safety,” according to the network’s statement. Colton Haab did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

A CNN source told HuffPost that the town hall was intended to give participants a chance to ask a question, but Haab wanted to read an “extensive” speech. Colton’s father, Glenn Haab, declined to have his son participate after the network refused to let his son read the full speech, according to the source.

Glenn Haab told HuffPost that a CNN producer told him Colton’s speech ― which consisted of an opening statement, three questions and closing remarks ― was “too long,” and that Colton would have to stick to asking one question.

The elder Haab said he told the producer that Colton wouldn’t read “one short question” without the option of first presenting the audience with “extremely relevant” background information.

Colton, a member of the high school’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, helped usher dozens of students to safety during last week’s shooting. He told Fox News on Saturday that he believed the high school’s assistant football coach, Aaron Feis, who was killed in the massacre, could have stopped the shooter if he’d been armed.

“Unfortunately, gun control, it’s definitely needed a little bit more,” Haab told Fox News on Saturday. “I believe that if we did bring firearms on campus to teachers that are willing to carry their firearm... if they got their correct training for it, I think that would be a big beneficial factor into school safety.”“We take incidents like these incredibly seriously and will continue working to ensure the security of the mayor and everyone who visits City Hall,” Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante said in the city’s statement.

The nature of the death threats against Bhalla is unclear.

In an email, Bhalla told HuffPost that he cannot release further information about the death threats “because there are several active investigations into these matters by law enforcement agencies.”

As a Sikh American, Bhalla said in November, he had been a victim of religious discrimination in the past, including being bullied while growing up in New Jersey as a teen who wore a turban as a sign of devotion to his faith. In the days leading up to Bhalla’s election, he was also targeted by racist flyers in Hoboken that falsely linked him to terrorism.President Donald Trump doubled down on his suggestion that arming teachers could help prevent school shootings on Thursday, adding that those trained to use firearms could receive extra pay.

During a White House meeting with law enforcement officials, Trump proposed for the second time in the last two days that some teachers, “certain highly adept people, people who understand weaponry, guns,” should carry firearms on campus. He added Thursday that they may be paid “a little bit of a bonus” to do so.

Trump first touched on this idea during a Wednesday listening session with students, families and others affected by gun violence in schools, including many from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and staff members were killed last week.

He suggested then that arming 20 percent of teaching staff at schools may be effective at quickly ending attacks. It’s unclear how much funding would be needed to train and arm 20 percent of the country’s teaching staff, or where that funding would come from.

On Thursday, he suggested bringing in more security guards in addition to arming teachers.

“You can’t hire enough security guards. ... You need 100, 150 security guards,” he said.

AdvertisementThe Democratic political action committee End Citizens United is buying about $250,000 worth of advertisements in support of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate in the special election for Pennsylvania’s vacant 18th District.

The ad buy will include digital video ads and a 30-second television spot attacking Republican Rick Saccone for reportedly questionable use of his expense account as a state representative.

“Rick Saccone, promised no legislative perks in Harrisburg ― called them lavish, then gobbled them up, spending $435,000 taxpayer dollars on himself,” a narrator in the TV ad, “Clean House,” intones as black ink splashes a white canvas.

The ad is drawn from a report in The Intercept detailing Saccone’s liberal use of his taxpayer-funded expense account since his 2010 election to the state House. Saccone, who won during the Tea Party wave, still touts his fiscally conservative bona fides.

The ad notes that Lamb, by contrast, has refused to take campaign donations from corporate PACs.

“We’re committed to making sure voters know Lamb’s record of integrity and Saccone’s history of exploiting taxpayers,” said End Citizens United President Tiffany Muller in a statement about the ad.

The TV ad is due to appear on Monday and continue through March 4. The digital ads, which address similar themes, begin Friday and will continue through March 13, the day of the special election.

The ad buy makes End Citizens United the only outside group currently taking to the airwaves on Lamb’s behalf. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $224,000 on a television ad supporting Lamb in late January but has since been off the air.

End Citizens United, named for its opposition to a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that got rid of limits on corporate electoral spending, has also leveraged its sizable email list to raise $175,000 for Lamb’s bid. The group said it has 3,700 members in the southwest Pennsylvania district where Lamb is running.

Lamb, 33, needs all the help from outside groups that he can get. Although he has outraised Saccone, a 60-year-old former military intelligence officer and diplomat, GOP-aligned outside groups have poured millions into the race on Saccone’s behalf. As of earlier this month, four conservative groups, including the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), had outspent Democratic outside groups by a 17-to-one margin. They have tried to paint Lamb as a stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whom conservative voters loathe. Lamb has already said he opposes Pelosi as the party’s House leader.

However, the level of national Republican attention and resources flowing into the district reflect GOP leaders’ anxieties that a solid red district is so competitive.

President Donald Trump, who won the 18th District by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016, is due to campaign for Saccone between now and the election day. The president already plugged Saccone’s candidacy at a January visit to the district ostensibly aimed at promoting GOP tax cut legislation.

In a bid to win over swing voters in the blue-collar district, Lamb has mixed a kitchen table-pitch to protect Social Security and labor unions with more conservative stances on issues like gun control and coal energy. Thus far, Lamb has welcomed House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) to the district to campaign for him.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is also slated to hold a rally for Lamb in the district before the election.Fox News settled lawsuits with several plaintiffs suing the network for racial and gender discrimination in a deal worth about $10 million, the New York Times reported Tuesday.

The settlement is far lower than the $60 million figure the network was approached with last summer, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Among the cases reportedly settled was the class action lawsuit joined by veteran anchor Kelly Wright, who was the only black man at the network to hold such a position. The Times reported Wright’s settlement included a contractual buyout.

Last year, an emotional Wright held a press conference in which he said he was demeaned and prevented from advancing in his career due to racial bias at the network. He accused former host Bill O’Reilly, whom the network severed ties with in August amid mounting sexual harassment allegations, of refusing to air stories Wright did on the African-American community because they were “too positive.”

A Fox News representative confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that the network “resolved various cases involving Fox News employees.”

The Wall Street Journal reported the settlement was reached with 18 former Fox News employees. The onslaught of discrimination litigation grew out of multiple sexual harassment lawsuits filed against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who left the network amid scandal in July 2016 and died last May.As “Black Panther” mania sweeps the nation this week, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport has joined in the fun, tweeting a picture of a mystery flight to Wakanda that’s put Wakandan Twitter in a frenzy.

On Monday, the airport’s Twitter account shared a picture of a departure gate for flight ATL 1234 to Wakanda, the Black Panther’s homeland, with the simple caption, “The bags are packed.”

In “Black Panther,” Wakanda is the most advanced nation in the world. Considering it’s never been colonized, it represents an Afrofuturist, unapologetic blackness rarely seen on screen.

From the looks of their fevered tweets, social media users were beginning to pack their bags for the fictional nation, too.

Flooded with requests for more details, the airport played along. One person asked what the menu on the flight looked like, and the airport responded, “Sorghum, millet, rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, beans, yams and okra.”

What's the food we're serving on that flight? 😂 #WakandaForever — Call Me Shuri ❤️✊🏾 (@tyizar) February 20, 2018

Another person inquired about connecting flights to Zamunda ― the fictional African nation from the 1988 classic “Coming to America” ― and of course, ATL had them.

Getting my ticket soon, but checking to see if you also have flights to Zamunda. Planning a long vacation . . . — Gwendolyn Brown (@gwencontralto) February 21, 2018

They have direct flights from Wakanda to Zamunda, just checked on-line :) — Atlanta Airport (@ATLairport) February 21, 2018

Even “Black Panther” star Lupita Nyong’o joined in, asking if the in-flight movies would include titles such as “T’Challa’s Angels” and “Killmonger Bill.”

Apart from La Femme Nakia, what else is on the in-flight entertainment? T’Challa’s Angels, M’Baku To The Future, Shuri’s Gotta Have It, Killmonger Bill, W’Kabi In The Woods...? — Lupita Nyong'o (@Lupita_Nyongo) February 20, 2018

The reactions highlight how African culture is celebrated throughout “Black Panther.” Since the movie’s release, Wakanda has come to represent the possibilities of a fully decolonized continent.

Director Ryan Coogler, production director Hannah Beachler and costume designer Ruth E. Carter teamed up in envisioning Wakanda, making sure to represent a specific aspect of the continent’s culture in every step.

To do so, Beachler created the Wakandan Bible, which ensured the movie stayed true to African traditions. Wakandans speak the Bantu language Xhosa, while each of their five tribes represents a real African people. For example, Carter fashioned the Jabari tribe in the movie after the Dogon people of West Africa.

This dedication to accuracy and Afrocentrism has left audiences ― and especially black audiences ― no choice but to dive headfirst into the fantasy.

And while ATL’s flight isn’t real, that doesn’t mean future Wakandans aren’t still hoping to book one-way flights back to their fictional home country.Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens with his wife, Sheena, and their children in St. Louis last November. Cristina M. Fletes/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via Getty Images

Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on charges of felony invasion of privacy.

Greitens, a Republican, was embroiled in a scandal last month after a local news report alleged he had an affair with a woman and then took compromising photographs of her to use as blackmail. The details of the report were provided to a St. Louis CBS affiliate by the woman’s ex-husband, who told the station that there was “no worse person” than Greitens.

The governor later admitted he had an affair in 2015 before he was elected to office, but he denied there was any blackmail and he didn’t identify the woman.

A call to the governor’s office Thursday was not immediately returned.

Thursday’s indictment involved a March 21, 2015, incident that was not specified. Missouri law states that invasion of privacy laws include the taking of photos of a person without their consent while they’re in a state of full or partial nudity. Individuals can be charged with a misdemeanor if such images aren’t disseminated, but the charge is classified as a felony if the photos are distributed by any means.

Greiten’s indictment lists his charge as a Class D felony, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. It has a three-year statute of limitations.

“The defendant knowingly photographed [the victim] in a state of full or partial nudity without the knowledge and consent of [the victim] and in a place where a person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy,” the charge reads. “The defendant subsequently transmitted the image contained in the photograph in a manner that allowed access to that image via a computer.”

“As I have stated before, it is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in our leaders,” St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardener said in a statement announcing the charges. “They must know that the Office of the Circuit Attorney will hold public officials accountable in the same manner as any other resident of our city.”

Greitens has so far rebuffed calls that he resign, even though several members of his party have told him to step aside after the blackmail allegations first surfaced. Republican lawmakers quickly echoed such sentiment after the indictment, including Republican state Sen. Rob Schaaf, who told The New York Times the Missouri House would act to remove the governor if he didn’t step down.

A reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said he saw Greitens being led away in custody at the Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis on Thursday. The newspaper confirmed that the governor was booked at the St. Louis Justice Center but was expected to be released on bond.Alfonso Calderon (right) speaks with CNN's Don Lemon about the president's ideas to prevent school shootings. CNN

Alfonso Calderon is not here for President Donald Trump’s idea to arm teachers with guns.

The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School junior and survivor of the recent mass shooting told CNN’s Don Lemon on Wednesday evening that Trump’s plan is simply “a terrible idea.”

“I don’t know if Donald Trump has ever been to a public high school but, as far as I’m aware, teachers are meant to be educators. They are meant to teach young minds how to work in the world,” Calderon said defiantly. “They are not meant to know how to carry AR-15s, they are not meant to know how to put on Kevlar vests for the other students or for themselves.”

Seventeen people were killed when a gunman opened fire with an assault-style rifle at the South Florida high school on Feb. 14. The attack is the 17th school shooting in 2018 alone. Since then, student activists including Calderon have organized and called on Trump and legislators to enact stricter gun laws.

During a listening session at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, Trump suggested arming 20 percent of teachers with guns in order to end future school shootings more quickly.

Calderon said he’s “sick” of having to discuss arming teachers.

“This is not what we stand for,” he continued. “We stand for small policy changes and maybe possibly big ones in the future. Because right now I’m pretty sick of having to talk about teachers being armed. Because that is not even a possibility in my mind.”

Trump elaborated on his idea in a series of tweets Thursday morning, writing that he “never said ‘give teachers guns.’”

He went on to write that “only the best” teachers, as in ones “with military or special training experience,” should be given guns.

“Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this,” Trump tweeted. “Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A ‘gun free’ school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!”

I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Many teachers and educators have pushed back on Trump’s idea, writing on social media that they don’t want to carry guns.Rachel McAdams attends the "Disobedience" premiere during the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. Tara Ziemba via Getty Images

Guaranteed, Rachel McAdams won’t just be a regular mom. She’ll be a cool mom.

The “Mean Girls” star is expecting her first child, according to E! News, which cited multiple unnamed sources.

Details about her pregnancy, including the identity of the father, have yet to be revealed. A representative for the famously private actress did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

McAdams, 39, has been dating screenwriter Jamie Linden, 37, since 2016, when they were first spotted together on a stroll in Los Angeles. The couple has yet to make their red carpet debut, but were photographed together at a wedding.

A post shared by @vatobknyc on Jun 11, 2016 at 10:32pm PDT

On Wednesday night, McAdams noticeably skipped the premiere of her new comedy film “Game Night,” for which she is receiving rave reviews, while other cast members, including Jason Bateman, walked the red carpet.

The actress has previously dated actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Sheen, whom she separated from around 2013. Linden, who’s penned scripts for romantic dramas like “Dear John,” meanwhile, was in a relationship with “New Girl” star Zooey Deschanel from 2012 to 2014.

McAdams on multiple occasions has expressed an interest in having children, telling Marie Claire in 2015 that “at some point” she’d like to start a family.NEW YORK― President Donald Trump’s State Department has been ordered to strip language about women’s reproductive rights from its annual global human rights report, Politico reported on Thursday.

The report, compiled each year with information from U.S. embassies around the world, typically details the lack of contraception and abortion access in various countries and sheds light on racial and sexual discrimination.

This year, a senior aide to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly directed the department to remove much of that information from the document. The new report will focus instead on forced sterilization and abortions, and the “Reproductive Rights” subsection in the report will be renamed “Coercion in Population Control.”

The section on racial and sexual discrimination will be pared down, according to the Politico story.

The move follows a string of attempts by the Trump administration to de-prioritize women’s rights and roll back women’s access to contraception and abortion around the world.

“This development is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to not only deprioritize reproductive rights, but effectively erase them from the broader conversation on human rights,” said Tarah Demant, director of gender, sexuality, and identity at Amnesty International USA.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the department is “better focusing some sections of the report for clarity,” and sharpening it to spotlight “the most egregious issues.”

The administration’s proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year, released earlier this month, would cut nearly $2.5 billion from the Global Health Programs Account, slashing global family planning funding by half.

Trump also reinstated and massively expanded the Global Gag Rule, restricting $8.8 billion in U.S. foreign aid funding for international health programs that provide or even mention abortion services. And he defunded the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a global maternal health organization that provides contraception and pregnancy care to low-income women in 150 countries.

“Girls aren’t able to get contraception, and they’re starting to come back pregnant, suicidal, bereft” - Lisa Shannon, a global women’s rights advocate who works with reproductive health clinics in East Africa.

Women’s health workers around the world are already seeing the effects of Trump’s policies on women and girls, who are seeking dangerous and sometimes deadly back-alley abortions as family planning clinics are forced to shut down. Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal mortality globally.Just weeks after giving the type of interview that readers love and publicists hate, Quincy Jones is now apologizing for what he said.

In the last month, the music legend has given two wide-ranging ― and very opinionated ― interviews with GQ and Vulture that had strong repercussions over the world of showbiz and politics.

For instance, Jones told Vulture he once dated Ivanka Trump and called Paul McCartney “the worst bass player I ever heard.” He also trashed Taylor Swift’s songwriting abilities.

Among those offended were Michael Jackson’s father, Joe Jackson, who was angered when Jones called the King of Pop a song thief.

Perhaps what was most controversial though were his comments on how actor Marlon Brando had sex with Richard Pryor, a claim the late comedian’s widow supported.

Richard Pryor’s daughter, Rain, was also angered by the interview, and posted on Facebook that Jones “is losing his mind.”

Jones tried to rectify that situation on Thursday with a public apology that seemed as sincere as his previous comments were incendiary.

The full statement appears below, but it may be best summed up with this sentence.Brendan Fraser, who has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent years, said in a GQ interview published Thursday that a high-profile man in Hollywood once groped him.

After headlining a series of popular films throughout the ’90s, including “George of the Jungle” and “The Mummy,” Fraser’s star power waned in the next decade following a string of personal and professional challenges.

The actor believes one of the reasons his career hit a standstill was because of an alleged incident with Philip Berk, a former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which hosts the Golden Globes. Fraser told GQ that Berk groped him at a luncheon in 2003.

“His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around,” Fraser said. “I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.”

He added: “I became depressed ... I was blaming myself and I was miserable—because I was saying, ‘This is nothing; this guy reached around and he copped a feel.’”

Fraser later demanded and received a written apology from the organization, but he wasn’t satisfied with it. Berk maintains the interaction was in jest, calling the actor’s version of events a “total fabrication.”

“My apology admitted no wrongdoing, the usual ‘If I’ve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologize,’” Berk told GQ.

As in many accounts similar to Fraser’s that have come to light as Hollywood reckons with sexual harassment and assault, Fraser said that at the time of the incident he didn’t possess “the courage to speak up for risk of humiliation, or damage to my career.”

“I know Rose [McGowan], I know Ashley [Judd], I know Mira [Sorvino]—I’ve worked with them. I call them friends in my mind. I haven’t spoken to them in years, but they’re my friends,” he said. “I watched this wonderful movement, these people with the courage to say what I didn’t have the courage to say.”

While Fraser said there were a host of reasons why his work suffered ― he went through a contentious divorce, underwent multiple surgeries after injuries on film sets, his mother lost a battle to cancer ― he says job opportunities “withered on the vine for me” and he was rarely invited back to the Globes after the incident.

As for his career, it’s seemingly gotten back on track in recent years with roles in the third season of “The Affair” and a role on Danny Boyle’s upcoming FX series “Trust,” but the experience with Berk still looms large.

“Am I still frightened?” he said “Absolutely. Do I feel like I need to say something? Absolutely. Have I wanted to many, many times? Absolutely. Have I stopped myself? Absolutely.”At this point in “The Walking Dead” timeline, longtime zombie hunter Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) could probably fire a weapon with his eyes closed, so the question is, uh, did he?

A certain optical mystery involving Carl has been plaguing fans since Season 7. It seems there was a pretty big mistake on the episode “Something They Need,” but we haven’t been able to confirm the truth.

Until now.WASHINGTON ― A week after President Donald Trump proposed replacing food stamp benefits with boxes of canned goods, the Trump administration is now crowdsourcing ideas on how to shrink enrollment in the program.

Roughly 43 million Americans received monthly benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in 2016, of whom 3.8 million were able-bodied adults without children. The administration thinks those people should get less help unless they find part-time jobs.

In a rare callout for ideas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is seeking suggestions from the public on how to reduce the able-bodied caseload. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Thursday that the agency’s goal is “to move individuals and families from SNAP back to the workforce as the best long-term solution to poverty.”

The request for input is the latest signal the Trump administration wants more stringent food stamp rules as part of a “welfare reform” initiative for 2018. Trump-allied conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives are also itching for a food stamp fight, though it’s not clear if party leaders want to play up the issue in an election year.

Federal law imposes a three-month limit on food stamp benefits for able-bodied adults who don’t have children and don’t work at least 20 hours per week, but states with high unemployment have been allowed to waive the limit, which is billed as a “work requirement.”

“It’s more thorough in asking how the procedures work but does not seem to pay as much attention to what are the harmful impacts.” - Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research and Action Center

In the wake of the Great Recession, the USDA waived the limit for every state. As the national unemployment rate has fallen, the waivers have begun to expire; though 28 states can still disregard the time limit in selected areas, and five can waive it statewide.

“Too many states have asked to waive work requirements, abdicating their responsibility to move participants to self-sufficiency,” Perdue said.

As part of a symbolic budget proposal, last week the Trump administration suggested cutting costs 25 percent by replacing benefits with boxes of shelf-stable foods and also by making it more difficult for states to waive work requirements. The budget would also apply the time limit to people as old as 62; currently it applies to SNAP recipients younger than 50.

The USDA said Thursday that its request for ideas would help fulfill the goals in the budget proposal. Among other questions, the call for ideas asks how states should go about applying for waivers from the time limit and how they should determine whether someone is fit to work. The public comment period will be open for 45 days.

“It’s more thorough in asking how the procedures work but does not seem to pay as much attention to what are the harmful impacts,” Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research and Action Center said in an interview, commenting on the announcement.

Vollinger said that people who lose benefits because of the time limit can wind up hungry, since federal law doesn’t require states to make allowances for people who can’t find suitable work. Someone unable to get to a job due to lack of transportation, for example, would see their food budget disappear.

Food stamps are supposed to be reauthorized this year as part of what’s known as a farm bill, legislation that pairs nutrition assistance with things like crop subsidies. House Agriculture Committee chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) has said he’s open to tougher time limits.

As states have reimposed work requirements and the economy has improved, the number of SNAP recipients has declined since hitting a peak of 47 million in 2013. The percentage of SNAP recipients who are nondisabled adults without children has declined from 10.5 percent that year to 8.8 percent in 2016, according to the most recent data.The White House Correspondents’ Association announced Thursday that comedian Michelle Wolf will headline the group’s annual dinner on April 28.

Wolf has worked on both “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” and “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” In 2017, she debuted her first HBO standup special, “Nice Lady.” She’s expected to launch a weekly Netflix show later this year.

It’s still unclear whether President Donald Trump will attend this year’s dinner after breaking tradition and skipping the event last year. He has said he will be attending the Gridiron Club dinner, another annual gathering of the D.C. press corps that he skipped in 2017.

Historically, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner has been a bit of a roast of the current commander in chief, and few would characterize Trump as having a thick skin.The Republican National Committee is once again asking for donations in exchange for the chance to win dinner and a photo with Donald Trump.
