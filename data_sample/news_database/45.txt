Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), the first American woman to fly in combat, has gone public with a charge that she was sexually abused by an adult while in high school.

In a Wall Street Journal interview, McSally alleges that her high-school track coach pressured her into having sex with him when she was 17 years old. The congresswoman said she wasn’t physically forced to comply, but accused the coach of using “emotional manipulation” and employing psychological tactics to keep her silent.

McSally, 52, said the alleged abuse occurred during her senior year an all-girls Catholic school in Riverside, Rhode Island. She said she told two adults of the situation at the time, but didn’t mention the abuse to friends or family until about a decade later.

“It took a while for me to come to a place where I understood what the hell I had been through,” the two-term House member told the Journal. “At the time, I was so afraid. I now understand — like many girls and boys who are abused by people in authority over them — there’s a lot of fear and manipulation and shame.”

The school, St. Mary Academy-Bay View, told HuffPost in a statement that it is committed to the “empowerment, safety, and well-being of our students,” past and present.

“We are saddened by these allegations, and we are committed to confronting issues of misconduct and abuse, irrespective of when the incident occurred,” the school said. “Nothing is more important than the safety of our students.”

One of the women McSally confided in told the Journal that she informed the school principal of the matter and that the coach, Jack Dwyer, was fired.

Dwyer denied the abuse allegations and told the Journal that he resigned to pursue another job.

“I believe she’s nuts,” Dwyer said. “That girl is the most scheming woman I ever met.”

McSally announced in January that she would be running to replace Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is not seeking re-election this year.

The Air Force veteran has previously spoken out against sexual harassment in the military, something she said she experienced firsthand. McSally also co-sponsored a House resolution last year aimed at cracking down on sexual harassment in the chamber.

“Sexual harassment is intolerable in our military, it is intolerable in our schools, it is intolerable in private sector workplaces, and it should be intolerable in Congress,” McSally said in a press release at the time. “Members of Congress should never be above the law.”

The resolution passed.

However, McSally has been criticized in the past for refusing to comment on alleged sexual abuse by GOP politicians, including Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore whose bid for office floundered amid accusations that decades ago he sexually harassed minors.

McSally also chose not to participate when a number of Democratic lawmakers decided to wear black to Trump’s State of the Union address this year in solidarity with the #MeToo movement. She instead wore red, white and blue with other GOP congresswomen to show support for the military.The wizarding world is about to get some black girl magic.

Comedian Jessica Williams and author J.K. Rowling decided to spill quite a bit of tea during the intermission of the Broadway premiere of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” Sunday night.

The two women, who are also friends, announced on Twitter and in an Instagram video that the host of podcast and HBO comedy special “2 Dope Queens” would be playing a character named Professor Eulalie “Lally” Hicks in “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” which hits theaters Nov. 16, 2018.

Lally, as Rowling clarified on Twitter, is a teacher at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or the American version of Hogwarts.

It’s going to be a while until fans get to know the real Lally, however.

In response to an excited fan who needed wanted more information, Rowling explained that Williams’ character has a small part in the second installment of “Fantastic Beasts.”

“You only see a HINT of Lally in Fantastic Beasts 2,” Rowling tweeted at a fan. “Her true glory is revealed in FB3.”

In October, Pottermore announced that the former “Daily Show” correspondent was set to join the cast of the upcoming sequel to the “Harry Potter” spinoff “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”

Williams, who is an ardent lifelong “Harry Potter” fan, also excitedly announced the news on social media as well — pretty much in all caps.

A post shared by Jessica Williams (@msjwilly) on Oct 6, 2017 at 8:49am PDT

Rowling and Williams have a pretty well-documented friendship, sparked by the author’s realization that she and Williams (and Harry Potter himself) had the same birthday, July 31.

After privately messaging each other over Twitter, the two women finally met up IRL and even celebrated their most recent birthday together.

.@msjwilly and I celebrating our birthday yesterday (my tiara really pinched). pic.twitter.com/jf2vdILopS — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) August 1, 2017LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - “A Quiet Place” had another noisy weekend at the domestic box office, reclaiming the No. 1 slot in its third frame.

John Krasinski’s thriller co-starring Emily Blunt continued on its stellar run, earning $22 million from 3,808 locations. “A Quiet Place” had another impressive holdover, declining only 34 percent to bring its domestic tally to $132 million. That was enough to top Dwayne Johnson’s “Rampage” and Amy Schumer’s “I Feel Pretty.”

Bumped down to No. 2, Dwayne Johnson’s “Rampage” collected $21 million in 4,115 theaters in its second weekend. The film has made $66.6 million at the North American box office. Luckily, “Rampage” has been able to justify its expensive price tag with a strong international showing. It has crossed the $200 million mark internationally, claiming $57 million this weekend. That brings its global tally to $283 million.

STX’s “I Feel Pretty” bowed in third with $16.2 million from 3,440 theaters. The Schumer-led comedy also features Michelle Williams, Rory Scovel, Emily Ratajkowski, Busy Phillips and Aidy Bryant. “I Feel Pretty” is currently averaging a tepid 34 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a B+ CinemaScore.

Another newcomer, Fox Searchlight’s “Super Troopers 2,” opened in fourth, burning by projections to make $14.7 million from 2,038 locations. The sequel reunites the 2002 cult classic’s leads ― Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske ― collectively known as Broken Lizards. The stoner comedy has a 35 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the same score as the first film. The audience score of the sequel, however, is down significantly from the original’s, at 68 percent compared to the first movie’s 90 percent. The first film launched with $6 million.

The film did more than double the numbers that estimates suggested. Frank Rodriguez, head of distribution at Fox Searchlight, says the movie’s key demographic of males between the ages of 25 and 49 is to thank. Aside from action hero movies, Rodriguez says it’s a generally underserved group.

“People just want to find something they can have a good time with,” he said. “This audience knew they’d laugh and have a communal experience that makes them feel good. The final weekend opener is Lionsgate’s Codeblack Films’ “Traffik,” which took in $3.9 million in 1,024 theaters.

Rounding out the top five is Universal and Blumhouse’s “Truth or Dare.” Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey lead the thriller, which scored $7.9 million in 3,068 locations. In total, the horror film has made $30.4 million in two weeks. “Truth or Dare” has pulled in $7.9 million internationally, combining for a global total of $38.3 million.

The domestic box office is up 12.6 percent compared to the same weekend last year, though the year to date box office is down 2.4 percent. That could change next weekend as “Avengers: Infinity War” eyes a monstrous opening weekend.

“The industry is bracing for the record-setting debut of the highly anticipated ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ that is expected to break through the $200 million opening weekend sound barrier as the summer movie season of 2018 gets off to an early and auspicious start,” said comScore box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian."Black Panther" director Ryan Coogler (left) sits with Marvel Studio president Kevin Feige to discuss the blockbuster film in January in Beverly Hills, California.

“Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler will helm a sequel to one of Marvel’s most successful films when he’s good and ready, studio President Kevin Feige told Collider recently.

“We definitely want Ryan to come back and that’s actively being worked out right now,” Feige said. “When will it be? A lot of it will be when Ryan wants to and not rushing anything, but I think we have an idea of when it will be.”

Feige also said Marvel won’t be announcing any post-“Avengers 4” films anytime soon. That’s likely because “Avengers: Infinity War,” which opens this week, and the yet-untitled “Avengers 4,” set to hit theaters in May 2019, are predicted to dramatically alter the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The title of “Avengers 4,” Feige has said, is itself a spoiler for the events in “Infinity War.”

As for that “Black Panther” sequel, we always knew it was coming, it’s just a matter of when. And Marvel certainly doesn’t want to mess with the recipe of talent that made it so profitable.TENNESSEE SUSPECT’S WHITE HOUSE ARREST Police have revealed the nude suspect who fled the Tennessee Waffle House shooting that left four dead Sunday was arrested in Washington last year trying to climb a White House barrier, with police seizing an AR-15 rifle.

Last week, between her back-to-back blowout performances at Coachella, Beyoncé announced that her BeyGOOD initiative would be giving $25,000 each to four historically black colleges and universities for the 2018-2019 academic year. Her historic headlining performance on April 14 was the “impetus to mark” the new scholarship program, according to the announcement.

Google then stepped in to match Beyoncé’s $100,000 grant and enable students at four additional HBCUs to receive $25,000 scholarships.

BeyGOOD’s scholarship funds are going to Xavier University of Louisiana, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University and Bethune-Cookman University. The Google-enabled scholarships will help Texas Southern University, Fisk University, Grambling State University and Morehouse College.

In January, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke traveled to Las Vegas to mingle at the SHOT Show, an annual gathering of the shooting, hunting and outdoor trade industries. The people there were “all great conservationists, really good people, dedicated to the outdoors,” he said in an interview with NRA-TV.

An avid hunter and angler himself, Zinke has often said that the best stewards of wildlife are America’s sportsmen and -women. But after taking over the Department of the Interior in March 2017, he made quick work of angering some of those would-be supporters.

Zinke and his team focused on boosting fossil fuel production and rolling back national monument protections. And he repeatedly voiced support for budget requests that would gut federal funding for land acquisition and conservation programs.

Several hunting and fishing groups that initially found a lot to like about the self-proclaimed “Teddy Roosevelt conservationist” have become outspoken critics.

Now, after a tumultuous first year at the Interior helm, Zinke appears to be signaling a new direction.

Earlier this month, he hosted a roundtable of more than two dozen outdoor sporting and conservation organizations to get their input on his planned reorganization of the department. He promised them a “grand pivot” away from energy development and toward species and habitat conservation, according to E&E News.

Today I hosted a dozen+ #conservation organizations ranging from @audubonsociety and @DefendersNews to @BC_Club1887, @TheTRCP, and Simon Roosevelt. I'm looking for their input on how to reorganize @Interior for the benefit of people, wildlife & habitat pic.twitter.com/NPcQ0Y3Jji — Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) May 16, 2018

At the end of December, Zinke vowed to “create a conservation stewardship legacy second only to Teddy Roosevelt.” As the chief steward of America’s natural resources, he is responsible for managing some 500 million acres of land, or one-fifth of the United States, as well as protecting endangered species and managing migratory birds.

Many conservation organizations and leaders, including the late president’s great-grandson Theodore Roosevelt IV, complained that he was falling far short of the lofty mark.

Besides the conservation roundtable, Zinke has taken a number of steps in recent months that might reel back those groups.

The Interior Department made several pro-hunting announcements in the week after the conservation roundtable. It moved to scrap a 2015 rule that bans aggressive hunting tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens and swimming caribou from motorboats. It proposed expanding hunting and fishing opportunities on numerous wildlife refuges. And it named 17 members to a new panel, the Hunting and Shooting Sports Conservation Council, which will advise Zinke on wildlife and habitat conservation.

“We’re going to take him at his word. He seemed sincere about it.” - Whit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership

Some of those who attended this month’s roundtable are now sounding a more optimistic note about Zinke.

Whit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, told HuffPost last July that it was “troubling” to watch Zinke work solely on the development of natural resources “without even lip service to conservation.” Fosburgh’s nonprofit advocates for access to public lands for hunting and fishing.

At the roundtable, he said, the secretary acknowledged that energy was the major push in 2017 and declared that the next few years would be about conservation, departmental reorganization and tackling the maintenance backlog at national parks.

“We’re going to take him at his word,” Fosburgh told HuffPost this week. “He seemed sincere about it.”

Fosburgh noted he is particularly pleased with a February order from Zinke that aims to improve habitat and migration corridors for big game species, including elk, antelope and mule deer.

Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, also voiced newfound optimism after the meeting, telling E&E that his group is “committed to working with Secretary Zinke more closely on priorities like increasing America’s wildlife populations, conserving wildlife corridors and expanding outdoor recreation opportunity.” And Steve Moyer, vice president for government affairs at Trout Unlimited, told the publication he was “glad to hear of a change of direction from Mr. Zinke.”

Other conservation-focused organizations sound more skeptical about the secretary’s proclaimed shift.

Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, told HuffPost that non-game and endangered species are still missing from the conservation conversation. Zinke’s pivot, she added, seems largely geared toward rebuilding crumbling park infrastructure and reorganizing the agency.

“I didn’t come out of [the meeting] believing that our nation’s natural resources chief steward was either enlightened or energized to conserve biodiversity,” Clark said. “Not at all.”

Zinke is mistaken, she said, if he thinks shuffling employees around will lead to more sustainable fish, wildlife and plant habitat and resources.

In a statement after the roundtable, David O’Neill, chief conservation officer of the National Audubon Society, said that while he appreciated the opportunity to join the discussion, the group continues to “fundamentally disagree with the Department of the Interior’s interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.”

A little more than a week later, the National Audubon Society joined Defenders of Wildlife and other conservation groups in suing the Interior Department over its recent decision to slash protections for migratory bird species.The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Ohio to strike down the state’s congressional map, saying it was intentionally drawn to so egregiously benefit Republicans that it violates the Constitution.

Since 2012, Republicans have consistently won the same 12 of Ohio’s 16 congressional seats, while winning between 51 and 59 percent of the state’s popular vote. The suit alleges that Republicans maintain this remarkable advantage because they controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and worked in secret to draw a map to guarantee just that outcome each year.

The suit was filed Wednesday in federal court on behalf of 16 voters in each of the state’s congressional districts, the Ohio chapter of the League of Women Voters and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a labor and civil rights group.

The lawsuit underscores a growing confidence among voting rights groups over the last few years in bringing challenges to congressional plans that Republicans have benefited from since 2012. The Supreme Court has never said whether an electoral map can be so partisan that it violates the Constitution, but it is expected to rule in two cases that make that argument in June. A ruling setting constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering could profoundly affect American politics by requiring lawmakers to draw districts that are more competitive.

The ACLU says Ohio's congressional map violates the Constitution because it deprives Democrats of the ability to elect a candidate of their choice and treats them differently from Republicans. Ohio secretary of state

Two more congressional elections are due to take place under Ohio’s current map before the next round of redistricting in 2021. Even though litigation can move very slowly, the ACLU hopes to have a new map in place for the 2020 congressional elections.

Alora Thomas, an attorney with the ACLU, said her organization felt encouraged to bring the suit after multiple rulings in lower courts blocking electoral maps in Wisconsin and North Carolina on partisan grounds. (Those rulings are currently paused while the Supreme Court considers appeals.) In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s congressional maps as too partisan for the state Constitution. A challenge to Michigan’s congressional map on partisan grounds is also before a federal court.

“Because courts are really now open to taking a look at this issue, and it looks like they’re going the right way and finding partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional, the question becomes, ‘Well, where else is there a problem and is it something that needs to be addressed now?’” Thomas told HuffPost. “Ohio is one of the most gerrymandered states in the country.”

An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found that Ohio’s congressional map has some of the most severe partisan bias in the country and accounts for between two and three additional GOP seats in the current Congress.

Thomas said the ACLU didn’t want to wait until Ohio got a new congressional map in 2022, because Ohio residents have already spent nearly a decade voting under a map the group believes is unconstitutional. A fairer map in place before the next round of redistricting, Thomas said, could ensure that the map for the subsequent decade is also fairer. Ohio voters also recently approved a ballot initiative to change the way redistricting is done in the state, a move that advocates hope will rein in excessive partisan gerrymandering.

The suit argues that the Ohio map violates the First and 14th Amendments, as well as Article I of the Constitution. The map violates the First Amendment, the suit says, because it amounts to an effort to “skew electoral outcomes to freeze their advantage and insulate their majority from changes in voter preferences.” It violates the 14th Amendment, the ACLU says, because lawmakers drew the map intentionally to disfavor Democratic voters in the state without a legitimate reason to do so. The ACLU also argues that in drawing such a severely gerrymandered map, Ohio lawmakers exceeded the power the Constitution gives them to regulate elections.

The case will hinge significantly on what the Supreme Court decides by the end of June. During oral argument in two partisan gerrymandering cases this year, the court seemed willing to allow some amount of politics in redistricting, but appeared closely divided on whether it was possible to determine if partisan gerrymandering could go so far that it violates the Constitution. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote in a 2004 case that such a standard might exist, is seen as the critical swing vote in the case, and advocates have offered a number of standards with the hope that he might find one he likes.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who signed the state’s congressional map into law in 2011, is named as a defendant in the suit. But Kasich has recently been an outspoken opponent of partisan gerrymandering, and was one of a number of Republican elected officials who urged the Supreme Court in October to step in and do something about gerrymandering.

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Kasich and other Republican officials took a position similar to what the ACLU is arguing in the Ohio case, saying that partisan gerrymanders are “repugnant to the Constitution” and violate the First and 14th Amendments.

UPDATE: 2:50 p.m. ― Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R), one of the state officials named as a defendant in the suit, criticized the challenge.Detroit Pistons’ Reggie Bullock proposed a colorful idea on Twitter on Sunday: Playing basketball in a rainbow-colored jersey to “incorporate #LGBTQ into sports.”

The small forward implored the National Basketball Association to “make it happen” in his lifetime:

Bullock has long been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights. It’s a cause particularly close to him because his transgender sister, Mia Henderson, was found murdered in Baltimore in July 2014.

He has hosted an LGBTQ Pride Night, and even gotten the words “LGBTQ” tattooed on his calf next to Mia’s name.

As for the NBA, its slowly been making strides at being a more inclusive organization.

In early 2014, Jason Collins became the first openly gay athlete to play in any of North America’s major professional sports leagues when he signed with the New Jersey Nets.

In August 2017, the NBA partnered with the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), a Washington-based advocacy group, to expand opportunities for LGBTQ businesses to work with the league. This January, the Toronto Raptors became the league’s first team to host a “You Can Play” night in support of their LGBTQ fans.

In a vein similar to what Bullock proposes, the NBA previously partnered with GLSEN, which works to end anti-LGBTQ bullying in schools, and retailer Fanatics to celebrate Pride Month by offering T-shirts with rainbow-colored NBA logos.

The shirts launched in 2016, and are still available for purchase.In this premiere episode, Appelman asks motorists at the Long Island Welcome Center off Highway 495 why they’re visiting and what they look for in good rest stop.

He also communicated with the EPA early this year, according to documents from his own company.

Pruitt is being investigated over a sweetheart deal that allowed him to spend just $50 a night for him and sometimes his daughter to stay in a Capitol Hill condo. His landlord was Vicki Hart, wife of prominent energy and food company lobbyist J. Steven Hart. A copy of Pruitt’s lease first included Steven Hart’s name as the landlord, which was scratched out and replaced by his wife’s name.

Scott Pruitts lease

When the eyebrow-raising deal was initially uncovered, Hart said he hadn’t spoken to Pruitt for “many months,” and had no lobbying contact with the EPA in 2017 or 2018.

But Hart, who was chairman and CEO of powerhouse lobbying firm Williams & Jenson at the time, met last summer in Pruitt’s office to discuss EPA protections for the Chesapeake Bay. He was also a registered lobbyist for Smithfield Foods in the first quarter of 2018 and lobbied the EPA on the company’s behalf early this year, according to new disclosure documents filed by Williams & Jenson on Friday. The documents were submitted just hours after Hart announced he was taking early retirement.

Hart insisted, however, that his company’s filings were “inaccurate.” A spokesman confirmed Hart did meet with Pruitt in 2017 and emailed the EPA this year. But he said in a statement Saturday to The Hill that he did so to assist a “friend” on the Chesapeake Bay Commission. “I was not paid for this assistance, and any suggestion that I lobbied for Smithfield Foods is inaccurate,” he added, an assertion that appeared to be backed up by Smithfield Foods.

Hart’s “friend” was Dennis Treacy, a former Smithfield Foods executive now on the board of the Smithfield Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay Commission, The Washington Post reported. Hog and pork producer Smithfield Foods has been supporting Chesapeake Bay environmental protections since it was fined $12.6 million in 1997 for dumping pig waste from its industrial farm into a waterway leading to the bay.

Regardless of who Hart was representing or what was discussed, the fact remains that Hart did meet with Pruitt and reach out to the EPA while the EPA chief was renting from his wife, contradicting Hart’s initial assertions.

Reuters/Jonathan Ernst

At the time Pruitt was renting from his wife, Hart’s company was also representing Cheniere Energy Inc., which is the only exporter of liquified natural gas from the continental U.S. Pruitt touted that very fuel on his controversial trip last year to Morocco. Pruitt and seven aides (at a cost of $40,000) spent four days in Morocco in December touting the benefits of liquified natural gas, according to an EPA press release. The trip was slammed by environmental groups and Democrats as having absolutely nothing to do with EPA’s mission to protect the environment.Netflix is adding quite a few quality movies over the next few days.

AdvertisementKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) publicly defended himself on Saturday after a federal judge found him in contempt of court, arguing that he shouldn’t be held responsible for what didn’t happen and shifting the blame to others.

U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson held Kobach in contempt of court last week, ruling that he had failed to fully follow her 2016 order temporarily blocking a Kansas law that required people to prove their citizenship when they registered to vote at the motor vehicle department. There were about 18,000 people who had failed to show proof of citizenship and as a result had their voter registrations placed “in suspense.” As part of her ruling, Robinson wanted those people to be made registered voters like any others.

Specifically, Robinson expected Kobach to send out two notices to those 18,000 people: a letter telling them that they were fully registered to vote in 2016 and a postcard informing them of their polling place. Kobach suggested he would do both, but in fact, he did not ensure that the postcards were sent out. He also failed to update the online state election manual to indicate that people didn’t need to prove their citizenship at the motor vehicle department.

As part of her contempt ruling, Robinson ordered Kobach to pay attorney fees to the American Civil Liberties Union, which had filed the motion seeking to hold the Kansas official in contempt. The judge reserved a decision on any further remedies for when she rules on the merits of the underlying case against the Kansas law later this year.

Many Kansans see the postcards as a formal confirmation that they are eligible to vote, Marge Ahrens, the former co-president of the Kansas League of Women Voters, testified during the trial, which was held in Kansas City last month.

Over the weekend, Kobach told Breitbart News that the contempt finding was “ridiculous” and blamed local county election officials for failing to send out the postcards.

“She also wanted to make sure that all those voters got a notice telling them where their polling place is, the standard postcard that’s sent out in Kansas. And we instructed the counties to do so, but some of the counties didn’t get it done in time in the short period before the election,” Kobach said. “So the judge is holding my office in contempt for the failure of counties to follow the instructions that we gave them. It’s just ridiculous.”

“When really all it is, is some counties that didn’t send out both postcards, they only sent out one postcard,” he continued.

Kobach’s comments mischaracterize what he and his office actually did and said. A month before the 2016 election, Robinson specifically asked Kobach if the voters affected by her ruling would receive the postcards that Kansans are used to getting in the mail before an election.

“They will get the same notice that others ― that other voters get, that it notifies you of your polling place,” Kobach told the judge on Oct. 5, 2016.

But at a contempt hearing in March of this year, Bryan Caskey, the director of elections in Kansas and a Kobach staffer, said he had been confused as to whether local election officials needed to send out the postcards in addition to the court-ordered letter informing people they were eligible to vote. While Kobach and his lawyers had claimed Caskey verbally told local officials to send the postcards, Caskey testified that he could not verify that election officials in all 105 counties had sent them.

He later testified that he’d informally surveyed four local election officials as to whether they had sent the postcards after being told to do so in October 2016 and could confirm that just one had done so.

After the contempt hearing but before the judge ruled against Kobach, Caskey sent a letter to all election officials in Kansas instructing them that they should send out the postcards. As of April 3, he had received confirmation from 49 counties that the postcards had gone out.

Chris Biggs, a Democrat who served as Kansas secretary of state before Kobach (and whom Kobach defeated in the 2010 election), told HuffPost that while he hadn’t seen the specific communications at issue in the case, it was common for local election officials to seek guidance from the secretary of state’s office on how to enforce election law. Biggs said that he would have wanted to create a clear record of what he’d ordered local election officials to do.

“If I had a court order to do something, I would want to serve and have proof that I communicated in writing with every election official in the state,” he said.

During the contempt hearing, Robinson dismissed Kobach’s claim that he wasn’t responsible for the postcards failing to go out because he couldn’t force election officials in 105 counties to send out the postcards.

“The Court is troubled by Defendant’s failure to take responsibility for violating this Court’s orders, and for failing to ensure compliance over an issue that he explicitly represented to the Court had been accomplished,” Robinson wrote in her contempt order. “Defendant deflected blame for his failure to comply onto county officials, and onto his own staff, some of whom are not licensed attorneys.” (Kobach is a lawyer.)

“The letters from Plaintiffs seeking compliance with these issues were directed to Defendant. The motion for contempt was directed to Defendant. It was Defendant’s duty to ensure that the counties complied with the Court’s Orders, a duty this Court made crystal clear to him back on October 5, 2016,” she continued.

Biggs also questioned Kobach’s contention that he couldn’t make sure that county election officials sent out those postcards.

“He’s the chief election officer, so he would have the ability to advise them how they’re supposed to behave. And if they didn’t, he could seek appropriate action through the attorney general’s office and the local county attorneys, if necessary, to force them to perform their lawfully required duty,” Biggs said.

WASHINGTON ― Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced Monday that he would support Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state, a change in position that allowed the CIA chief to be recommended favorably out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after all.

Paul, a libertarian-leaning critic of U.S. military intervention abroad, has spoken out against Pompeo for weeks, citing concerns with his support for the Iraq War. Last month, in a news conference announcing his position, Paul said he was “perplexed” by Pompeo’s nomination and even called him “the wrong fit for America.”

“It goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on, that the unintended consequences of regime change in Iraq led to instability in the Middle East,” Paul said then.

But on Monday, shortly before the committee was expected to vote, Paul tweeted that he’d received assurances from President Donald Trump that Pompeo agrees with him that “Iraq was a mistake, that regime change has destabilized the region, and that we must end our involvement with Afghanistan.”

Explaining his changed position in remarks before the committee, Paul said Pompeo had sufficiently “incorporated” the idea that the Iraq War was a mistake into his worldview. But the senator added that he wished the CIA director would say so publicly.

“Time will tell if those assurances are true or not,” Paul said before the vote on Monday, “but I do take him at his word.”

Paul also pointed to recent talks he’s had with Trump about surveillance policy as another factor in his decision to support Pompeo’s appointment.

“I’ve been very concerned that the FBI’s allowed to look at Americans’ information without a warrant,” Paul said Tuesday during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“I’ve had some discussions with [Trump] over whether or not we could actually have an executive order from the president that simply says from now on we’re going to obey the Fourth Amendment and that FBI agents will have to get a warrant to look at these foreign surveillance databases,” he continued. “That’s a big step forward for me, too.”

During a White House event Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump thanked Paul for coming around to his nominee. Trump said the senator “never let us down” and called him “a good man.”

In a tweet earlier Monday when Pompeo’s prospects didn’t look as good, Trump had blasted Democrats for being “obstructionists.”

Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. Need more Republicans! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2018

Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, is well-known for his militaristic foreign policy stances. He has pushed for regime change in Iran and openly mused about the U.S. overthrowing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he recently met during a secret trip. He also supported ending the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries. But he reversed or walked back many of those positions during his confirmation hearing earlier this month.

Democrats, meanwhile, grilled Pompeo about his ties to an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist during his confirmation hearing and questioned him about his past homophobic remarks. Pompeo said he would treat “every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation,” with respect despite his personal belief that same-sex couples should not have the right to marry.

Although 15 members of the Democratic caucus voted to confirm Pompeo to run the CIA last year, many of those same senators have opposed his nomination to be secretary of state this year, expressing concern that he is ill-suited to be the nation’s top diplomat.

Earlier Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) joined Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), another vulnerable Democrat up for re-election this year, in announcing his support for Pompeo, whom Manchin praised for his “exemplary career in public service.”

“Going forward, I think we should all bear in mind, and we need to strive to make this a better and more even playing field for everyone involved,” he said Sunday at the Tribeca Film Festival, according to Vanity Fair. “But not just in our industry ― in all industries.”

Producers of the Netflix series admitted more than a month ago that Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth II in the show, was paid less than Smith, who plays her on-screen husband, Prince Phillip. Foy reportedly received around $40,000 per episode for the first two seasons; Smith’s salary is still unreported.

Foy won a Golden Globe last year for her role on the show. Smith has not received any awards for “The Crown.”

“Claire is one of my best friends,” Smith said Sunday. “I support her completely.”Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, left, greets incoming national security adviser John Bolton outside the Pentagon on March 29.

WASHINGTON ― A little-noticed appointment to the National Security Council staff on Friday could be the first skirmish between President Donald Trump’s new security adviser and the defense secretary.

John Bolton has named as his deputy Mira Ricardel, a longtime official in GOP presidential administrations past. A year ago, she was reportedly the reason Pentagon chief Jim Mattis threatened to resign after she repeatedly blocked his choices for top Defense Department positions in her Office of Presidential Personnel role.

One Republican adviser close to the White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called Bolton’s move a “shot across the bow” directed at Mattis and a clear statement of his new authority within the Trump White House.

Mattis could not be reached for comment. Neither the Department of Defense nor the White House responded to HuffPost queries on the matter.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Mattis had become known as the “Axis of Adults” ― a trio of top aides whose calmer temperaments would mitigate Trump’s most impulsive and potentially dangerous foreign policy instincts.

Trump loyalists, though, saw all three not as calming influences but as obstructionists blocking the president’s efforts to replace a “globalist” foreign policy with an “America first” one that favors withdrawing from existing military and trade alliances.

In the past two months, Trump has fired both Tillerson and McMaster ― Tillerson via a morning tweet that appointed his successor.

Opponents of the traditional foreign policy establishment see Bolton’s rise as diminishing Mattis’ influence, possibly even leading to his departure, the Republican adviser said.

Mattis’ disagreements with Ricardel last year were a relatively open secret. After Trump won the presidency in November 2016, Ricardel was named to Trump’s transition team charged with finding and screening thousands of names for high-level political appointments in the executive agencies.

She had previously served in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as the office of former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP presidential nominee in 1996.

She had wanted to be named undersecretary for policy at the Pentagon last year, according to several former Pentagon and State Department officials, but couldn’t get the post because Mattis wanted someone else. Ricardel, in turn, worked with other White House officials to block Mattis’ choice for that job as well as a number of others because they had not been considered loyal to Trump prior to his election.

At one point, the situation became so bad that Mattis reportedly gave the White House an ultimatum: Either Ricardel had to leave or he would.

Eventually, Ricardel received a high-level position at the Department of Commerce, where she remained until Bolton named her to her new position in a Friday evening news release.

“I look forward to her joining our team and working together to ensure President Trump’s foreign policy agenda is executed,” Bolton wrote.Cage-free eggs from a farm in Iowa.

By Rebecca Beitsch

Dennis Bowden has raised chickens in the town of Waldoboro, Maine, nearly his whole life. For more than 40 years, he raised his chickens in cages. Then four years ago, when he turned 65, he cut down his flock and went cage-free.

The decision to switch was Bowden’s alone, but around the country many politicians have firmly taken sides on the issue of penning hens, hoping either to require egg producers to go cage-free or to protect conventional producers by mandating that stores stock their eggs.

Eggs are a staple of the American diet, with 88 billion table eggs produced in 2016. Egg consumption is growing, and the quality of life of the hens that lay the eggs has become an issue not just for animal welfare groups but also for many consumers. Although cage-free hens represent 16 percent of U.S. chickens, their share of the flock grew by a third from 2016 to 2017, and the egg industry and its supporters are paying close attention.

When California and Massachusetts enacted laws requiring that eggs produced and sold there be raised cage-free, 13 states including some of the nation’s largest egg producers sued, saying the laws violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Iowa, the top egg-producing state in the country, went further and enacted a law to protect its conventional, caged-chicken industry. The state now requires any grocer participating in the federal food program for low-income mothers, infants and children, known as WIC, to sell conventional eggs alongside cage-free options.

And last week, U.S. Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would block states from regulating agricultural products that are also produced in other states — a clear shot at cage-free-egg laws.

The tension comes as many restaurants and retailers say they are going cage-free — McDonald’s and Kellogg’s plan to do so by 2025, as does the grocery chain Kroger. And Ohio, Oregon and Washington have banned traditional cages, while this year, bills in Rhode Island and Michigan would require cage-free production and sales.

Conventional egg producers outside those states fear that as more egg-importing states enact such laws, they too will be required to go cage-free, costing them about $40 a bird to convert their facilities.

The Humane Society of the United States, which was behind the ballot measures approved in Massachusetts and California as well as the bill in Rhode Island, said that’s the goal.

“Some states are net importers; some are net exporters,” said Josh Balk, vice president of farm animal protection with the organization. “What we hope to achieve is that there is no place for caged hens to be sold anywhere.”

The Consumer Conundrum

Cage-free doesn’t mean chickens frolicking through pastures. The most common scenario is a big barn with thousands of chickens able to fly and move about freely, even if they are packed in. They may stay inside their entire lives. It’s not chicken utopia, Balk said, but it does give them space to do things chickens like to do — spread their wings, flutter around in the dirt, or just perch.

But having that many chickens cooped up in one space can be dangerous too. Pecking order is not just an expression — the birds seek to create a hierarchy among those they share a space with by pecking those beneath them. Bowden said he trims the beaks of his birds, something he likens to clipping one’s fingernails, so that the birds don’t hurt each other.

Producers who use cages say birds each have about the space of an 8-by-10-inch piece of paper but can move around alongside six or seven other chicken cage-mates, according to a spokesman for the National Association of Egg Farmers, Ken Klippen. That keeps them from pecking each other as much and from pecking at their own feces.

Iowa’s move to protect conventional egg producers was supported by the industry — Klippen said farmers in other states may consider pushing similar legislation. But the bill was narrowed considerably after grocers expressed concern, and lawmakers eventually limited the restrictions to grocers that serve the more than 60,000 WIC participants.

“We want the market to dictate and the consumers’ choice to dictate what you put on the shelf,” said Michelle Hurd, president of the Iowa Grocery Industry Association. “We were concerned it sets a precedent for industry to use the law to force stores to carry their type of product.”

Consumers, however, can present a conundrum.

Cage-free-egg laws appear to be popular with consumers — at least the ones who voted for them. Ballot measures were approved by wide margins in California, with 64 percent of the vote, and in Massachusetts, with 78 percent. This happened despite consumers in both states overwhelmingly buying conventional eggs.

“I call it a vote by paradox,” said Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University in Indiana who has studied the effects of the California law.

“These cage-free eggs were available in the grocery store, and, at the time, less than 10 percent of market share was cage-free. Why people banned something they were routinely buying in a grocery store, I don’t know,” he said. “It does act something like an unfunded mandate. We have asked farmers to provide something that we as consumers have not funded by buying that product.”

Only California’s law has been fully phased in — the laws typically give farmers a few years to convert from cages — so the impacts of its law have been the most widely studied.

Lusk estimated that the number of eggs produced in the state since the law was enacted was a third lower than it otherwise would have been. In response, stores in the state initially imported more eggs from other states. Shortly after the new law took effect, the price of eggs increased by more than a third, though by fall 2016, Lusk estimated that prices were 9 percent higher than they would have been without the law.

But some economists doubt the egg industry can produce enough cage-free eggs to meet future demand spurred by state mandates and retailer pledges. To do so, three-quarters of the nation’s 320 million birds would have to go cage-free.

At the same time, some egg producers have paused plans to expand cage-free production because their products weren’t being grabbed off store shelves.

Happier Hens, Harder-Working Farmers

Cage-free eggs aren’t just more expensive because farmers must convert their facilities. They require more work from farmers too.

When Bowden in Maine went cage-free, he went from a flock of more than 33,000 hens down to 3,000. But he had to increase his employees from five to eight just to help with the extra work taking care of the chickens.

“The majority of them like the nest box ’cause it’s darker and more private,” Bowden said. “They get in and like setting on their eggs. But some like making nests on the floor and others don’t give a damn and just lay eggs wherever they may be — on the window sill, all kinds of places like that.”

So now they have to collect eggs thrice a day instead of just once, and the shells get dirtier, so it takes more work to clean them.

Bowden didn’t go cage-free for the chickens’ sake. The family farm was cage-free and even sometimes had chickens in the pasture before they bought cages in 1969. When those were at the end of their useful life and Bowden was ready to slow operations down a bit, he converted the old barns by adding nest boxes he built himself.

But he does think his chickens are happier.

“It’s pretty hard to gauge,” he said. “We can’t really get them to vote.” But they are certainly making use of the space. They can move around, spread their wings — they have “free choice,” he said. And egg production per hen, which farmers say is perhaps the best indicator of chicken satisfaction, is the same.

Despite being happy with the switch, Bowden doesn’t think cage-free should be mandatory.

“I think it should be an issue of the person votes when they buy the eggs,” he said. “Does he want to pay $5 a dozen for eggs or $2 a dozen? Poor people can’t afford to buy eggs if they’re all cage-free.”

That’s what legislators in Iowa argued too.

“It’s not just about farmers versus animal rights,” said Iowa state Rep. Lee Hein, a Republican who chairs the Agriculture Committee. “It’s about people having access to affordable protein.”

Balk, with the Humane Society, said it’s insulting to imply that low-income people care less about animal welfare than the wealthy. He compared the group’s work to banning child labor, saying he was confident California’s and Massachusetts’ laws would withstand their court battles.

“No producer is mandated to sell in any state,” he said. “We’re just saying if you want to sell your products in Massachusetts, for example, you need to follow these minimum standards.”Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) won't be listed on the ballot for the Republican primary this year. Hyoung Chang/Getty Images

UPDATE: May 1 ― A federal judge ruled that Lamborn can be on the primary ballot, rejecting the residency requirement for petition circulators.

PREVIOUSLY:

Colorado GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn won’t be on the ballot as a Republican in 2018 after the state’s Supreme Court ruled on Monday, April 23, that one of his petition gatherers wasn’t a Colorado resident.

Five Republicans living in Lamborn’s district had challenged his candidacy earlier this month, arguing he hadn’t properly collected the 1,000 signatures necessary to make the ballot. A lower court had knocked off just 58 signatures, leaving Lamborn with enough to qualify for the ballot. But the state Supreme Court said more than 200 additional signatures were collected by an ineligible petition gatherer and booted Lamborn from the ballot for the June 26 primary.

“We recognize the gravity of this conclusion, but Colorado law does not permit us to conclude otherwise,” the court wrote in a 26-page opinion.

The ruling bars Lamborn for running on the ballot as a Republican. He could challenge the ruling, or potentially mount a re-election bid as an independent.

“We are disappointed by the outcome and we believe it was wrongly decided,” a representative from Lamborn’s campaign told Gray Television News’ D.C. bureau. The campaign will reportedly turn to federal court, seeking to overturn “the part of Colorado law that deprives voters who have petitioned to have Congressman Lamborn on the ballot of their Constitutional rights.”

The decision potentially opens up a lane for Darryl Glenn, an El Paso County Commissioner and Air Force veteran who was the GOP nominee against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in 2016. Glenn had announced a primary challenge to Lamborn late last year. State Sen. Owen Hill, another Air Force veteran, is also challenging the incumbent.

Lamborn’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In an earlier statement on the case, the campaign blamed the legal issues on “political tricks” by political allies of Hill.

Lamborn’s district, which is based around heavily conservative Colorado Springs, isn’t considered a Democratic pickup opportunity and isn’t a DCCC target. President Donald Trump won the district in 2016 with 57 percent of the vote to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s 33 percent.

While Lamborn had typically cruised to general election victories, he had faced prior scares in GOP primaries. He originally won the seat with a plurality in a three-way contest and earned just 52 percent of the vote in 2014.

Many states require petition gatherers to be registered voters in the state. Colorado requires they be “a resident of the state,” but a lower court had suggested a petition gatherer’s intent to live in Colorado in the long term was sufficient. The Supreme Court disagreed, noting the petition gatherer didn’t have a place to live in the state.



The firm Lamborn hired to gather signatures, Kennedy Enterprises, is also at the center of a controversy in the governor’s race. State Treasurer Walker Stapleton, the GOP frontrunner and a cousin of former President George W. Bush, qualified for the ballot through a convention after determining Kennedy Enterprises had committed fraud while gathering signatures for him.

The Colorado Secretary of State’s office told the Denver Post they feared Lamborn could challenge the legality of the residency requirement in federal court.

“The Colorado Supreme Court just provided an avenue to have a federal court strike down residency requirements for candidate circulators,” Deputy Colorado Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert told the paper.Jonathan Bachman / Reuters

Last week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed 10 students and teachers isn’t significantly reviving the momentum for gun control that followed the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, new HuffPost/YouGov polling suggests.

Slightly more than half of the public now calls gun violence a very serious problem, down from 60 percent in February. A 56-percent majority say it’s possible to pass new gun laws without violating the Second Amendment, down from a high of 65 percent. And, regardless of how they personally feel about the subject, just 40 percent now think passing new gun laws is politically possible, down from 50 percent.

HuffPost

Concern about gun violence and a desire for Congress to take action are now several percentage points higher than they were in April, when most of the post-Parkland wave had already abated, but it’s difficult to say how much of that represents a genuine uptick, rather than the variability inherent in tracking polls. Either way, it’s clear that the energy around crafting new gun policies isn’t near the heights reached earlier this year.

HuffPost

Similarly, tracking data from the progressive pollster Civiqs showed voters’ support for gun control spiking after Parkland, but then slowly declining. Santa Fe, it found, at most seemed to modestly stanch that decline.

Google Trends, which tracks how often people query the search engine on varying topics, shows that comparatively little attention has been paid to gun issues following the lastest school shooting.

The difference in public opinion following the two school shootings isn’t entirely surprising: It mirrors the difference in how each community responded. Although Americans were shocked by the Parkland massacre, the shift in public opinion it produced didn’t gain steam until the weeks that followed, when the surviving students spearheaded a gun control push. Their advocacy kept the debate over gun laws in the news, even after the immediate details of the shooting had faded.

Although student activists nationwide led walkouts earlier this year in protest of gun violence, polling of teens finds that such attitudes aren’t universal among their generation. In largely rural Santa Fe, last week’s shooting didn’t spark the same kind of push for gun control. There were no local protests, and little talk of guns,the Los Angeles Times reported.

“I don’t think guns are the problem — I think people are the problem,” a 16-year-old Santa Fe high school student told NBC. “Even if we did more gun laws, people who are sick enough to do something like this are still going to figure out a way to do it. So it doesn’t matter.”

Gun restrictions proposed in the wake of the Parkland shooting, meanwhile, remain broadly popular, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Americans, 78 percent to 11 percent, say that they favor strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns. They also say, 64 percent to 22 percent, that they favor raising the age for gun purchases to 21.

A plurality, 43 percent, say President Donald Trump is not doing enough to pass gun laws, while just 6 percent believe he’s done too much.
