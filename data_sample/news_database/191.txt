WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will ramp up its fight against so-called “sanctuary” policies by filing a lawsuit on Tuesday against the state of California over its laws meant to protect undocumented immigrants.

The lawsuit, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions will formally announce on Wednesday, is the latest in a string of moves by the White House, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to combat local efforts to limit police cooperation with deportation. Thus far, this has largely involved condemnations and threats, including the withholding of federal funds and prosecuting public officials.

Now, the administration is seeking to block three California laws by arguing that they violate the Constitution and federal law.

“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,” Sessions is expected to tell law enforcement officers during a speech on Wednesday, according to prepared remarks. “We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America. And I believe that we are going to win.”

To make its case, the DOJ is in part pointing to a ruling on a very different state-level immigration law: Arizona’s SB 1070, which was meant to expand local police efforts to find and arrest undocumented immigrants. The Supreme Court sided with the Obama administration by striking down major provisions of that law in 2012.

The Trump administration plans to argue that California is similarly overstepping its authority, senior DOJ officials said Tuesday. The lawsuit will challenge three laws that DOJ officials say hurt the government’s ability to carry out immigration enforcement.

Supporters of the California laws and “sanctuary” policies in general argue that they make communities safer by allowing local police to work better with immigrant communities and focus time and resources on duties other than immigration matters. (“Sanctuary” policies differ widely from place to place and there is no set definition for the term.)

California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) responded to Sessions’ suit Tuesday evening, calling it a “political stunt.”

“At a time of unprecedented political turmoil, Jeff Sessions has come to California to further divide and polarize America,” he said in a statement. “Jeff, these political stunts may be the norm in Washington, but they don’t work here. SAD!!!”

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) also defended his state’s policies.

“In California, our state laws work in concert with federal law,” Becerra said in a call with reporters Tuesday evening. “Our state officials work in concert with federal officials every day. We have no intention changing that here in California. But what we won’t do is stop being focused on public safety. We’re in the business of public safety, not deportation.”

The most prominent of the three California laws is SB 54, which Brown signed in October and went into effect Jan. 1 in spite of criticism from Sessions and other Trump officials. The Trump administration is seeking to block provisions of the law that stop local law enforcement from telling Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they will release certain individuals and from facilitating their transfer unless they’ve committed certain crimes.

The DOJ suit will argue that state policy violates a statute known as Section 1373, which broadly states that jurisdictions cannot bar local law enforcement from sharing information with federal officials about individuals’ immigration status. Proponents of laws like the one in California argue that by sharing arrest information with the federal government, they’re in compliance; but the DOJ plans to argue that Section 1373 also requires them to share things like when an individual is set to be released. The DOJ does not plan to argue that Section 1373 requires local law enforcement to hold people solely based on ICE requests ― known as “detainers” ― which many jurisdictions have rejected based on cost and constitutionality concerns.

The DOJ suit will also target a law called AB 450 that went into effect Jan. 1 and restricts private employers’ ability to cooperate with federal immigration officials, including by requiring a subpoena or warrant to enter workplaces and by notifying workers about reviews of employment documentation. The third law the DOJ is targeting is AB 103, a provision of a budget bill approved last year that allows the state to review federal immigrant detention of immigrants inside the state. The DOJ will argue that those laws violate the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause by attempting to preempt federal authority.

The pending DOJ lawsuit is a separate legal matter from challenges against the Trump administration’s threats to withhold federal grants from jurisdictions over “sanctuary” policies, which are playing out in courts in California and Illinois.There’s perhaps never a bad time to stretch or rethink one’s vocabulary.

The term “globalist” has been used at the White House at least three times this week in reference to an outgoing Jewish Trump administration official, raising some eyebrows because the word is increasingly used in xenophobic and anti-Semitic contexts.

The word came up on Wednesday when a reporter asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders whether a similar candidate will take the place of Gary Cohn, the outgoing director of President Donald Trump’s National Economic Council.

“He was a noted free trader, a globalist. Will the president seek another globalist, another free trader?” Fox News reporter John Roberts asked.

This followed Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, using the word “globalist,” in quotation marks, to describe Cohn in a statement that was tweeted by his department on Tuesday.

Mulvaney’s statement also noted that he was surprised to get along with Cohn, who he said ended up being “one of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with.”

Twitter users didn’t hold back in expressing concern over the choice of language.

just want to point out that using the word "globalist" in quotes like that might make this seem "anti-semitic"......actually...it definitely does. — m i t h (@ManInTheHoody) March 7, 2018

Damn. Not even trying to hide it anymore. — Fakebot3000 (@BobDobaleeny) March 7, 2018

The third instance came during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, when Trump lauded Cohn as “a globalist,” while adding, “but I still like him.”

“He’s been terrific,” Trump said. “He may be a globalist, but I still like him. He’s seriously globalist, there’s no question, but you know what, in his own way he’s also a nationalist because he loves our country.”

The term can be used to describe someone who has universal or open-world beliefs, particularly in regard to trade or public policies, but it can carry a more sinister meaning for members of the far right.

For the anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi members of the so-called “alt-right” white supremacist movement, “globalist” is a euphemism for “Jew.” It refers to the longstanding conspiracy theory about an international Jewish cabal working to undermine the traditional white family and Western culture by pushing for immigration and diversity.

A glossary of extremist language published by The New York Times places “globalism” among terms like “alt-right,” “antifa” and “cuck.”

“For the far right, globalism has long had distinct xenophobic, anti-immigrant, and anti-Semitic overtones,” the article states. “It refers to a conspiratorial worldview: a cabal that likes open borders, diversity and weak nation states, and that dislikes white people, Christianity and the traditional culture of their own country.”

Figures such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump have used the term as a dog whistle for their followers. Just before the 2016 election, Trump delivered a campaign speech in which he described Hillary Clinton as working with globalists to “plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty.”

Its use on Wednesday, again on the national stage, led to renewed concern on social media ― in particular, that the word is being normalized or “mainstreamed.”

It's jarring to hear a White House reporter nonchalantly ask a question using "globalist" — Eric Morrow 🧐 (@morroweric) March 7, 2018Adam Purinton, 52, is accused of killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and wounding Alok Madasani, 32, as well as a person who tried to intervene. He pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on Tuesday. POOL New/Reuters

A Kansas man who fatally shot an Indian immigrant in a bar last year pleaded guilty to murder on Tuesday.

Adam Purinton, a 52-year-old white man, allegedly yelled racial slurs and “Get out of my country” before he fatally shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounded his friend, Alok Madasani, during the Feb. 22, 2017, attack at Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas.

Witnesses said Purinton believed the two men were Middle Eastern and asked if their “status was legal.” Both victims had come from India to the U.S. and worked as engineers.

Another victim, 24-year-old Ian Grillot, was shot in the hand and chest while trying to stop the gunman. He was hailed as a hero and was awarded $100,000 by a Houston Indian community center.

After the shooting, Purinton went to an Applebee’s in Missouri where he allegedly told a bartender that he’d “just killed two Middle Eastern men.” He was arrested at the location.

The widow of Kuchibohotla, Sunyana Dumala, said in a statement that she hoped Purinton’s guilty plea for first-degree murder would “send a strong message that hate is never acceptable.”

Purinton faces life in prison when he is sentenced May 4, according to The Guardian.

He still faces federal charges of a hate crime. Prosecutors argued that Kuchibhotla and Madasani were targeted because of their “actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin.”

The Justice Department stepped in to file the hate crime charges since Kansas lacks state hate crime laws. The number of hate crimes across the country hit a five-year peak in 2016, with an even larger uptick following Donald Trump’s presidential victory.Downplaying reports of chaos and disarray in his administration, Trump told reporters that his staff had “tremendous energy” and “tremendous spirit.”

“Many, many people want every single job,” he said at a joint press conference with Sweden’s prime minister. “You know, I read where, ‘Oh, gee, maybe people don’t want to work for Trump.’ And believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office. They want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé, it’s just a great place to work.”

“So many people want to come in,” Trump added. “I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House, and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position.”

After the White House confirmed Cohn’s resignation Tuesday evening, the president bragged ― without providing evidence ― that there were “many people wanting the job.”

Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2018

Cohn’s departure, which had been rumored for months, capped off several days of White House aides announcing resignations and added to the already dizzying list of departures and firings during Trump’s presidency.

Just last week, two communications officials said they planned to leave: Josh Raffel, a spokesman for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, and longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, the president’s third permanent communications director in less than 14 months in office. (In addition, Sean Spicer simultaneously served as acting communications director and press secretary for several months last year.)

This turnover rate among top staffers is higher than it has been for any of the last five presidents, according to analysis of Trump’s first year from Brookings Institution fellow Kathryn Dunn Tenpas. It was at 34 percent as of Jan. 19 ―more than triple that of Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. That rate has since gone up to 43 percent, the think tank announced Wednesday.

Tenpas attributed this to Trump prioritizing “loyalty over qualifications,” as well as “a White House that has functioned in a chaotic manner.”

There are positions that have been left unfilled for months, leaving some staffers to perform multiple roles at once.

And the vacancies in top positions go beyond the White House ― at the State Department, for example, there aren’t people in roles that have important ramifications for international relations.

Trump’s vacancy rate for ambassadors is 22 percent, according to USA Today. It was 11 percent at the same point in Obama’s presidency.

Dozens of vacancies at the State Department have led to tensions between Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has accused the White House of stalling the hiring process.

Tillerson’s own job security has perpetually seemed precarious, yet he has somehow outlasted many other Trump officials ― for now.The rumors are "maybe" true. Getty

Adam Rippon just “maybe” confirmed there’s some icy tension between himself and former figure skater and NBC commentator Johnny Weir.

During an appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” on Tuesday, a caller asked Rippon if Page Six’s reported rumors of drama between the two were true. The outlet reported that Weir felt “upstaged and threw a fit about Adam” at the Olympics.

“Um, maybe,” Rippon said with a slight smile and a head nod. “I think maybe. But you know what? I’m not coming for his job. I’m not coming for his gig.”

Rippon also told the Bravo show’s host Andy Cohen that the two skaters “didn’t really have any interactions” at the Olympics.

“We’ve always reached out to each other, and I’ve always, liked, thanked him because I kind of feel like, he kind of, like, helped make my way a little bit easier,” Rippon, the first openly gay American male figure skater to compete at the Olympics, told Cohen. Weir came out as gay in 2011, shortly after competing in his second Winter Olympics.

A representative for Weir told HuffPost Wednesday: “The Page Six story was completely false. Johnny is proud of and stands behind all the athletes and their accomplishments.” The rep didn’t have any comment on Rippon’s talk show remarks.

Rippon said he doesn’t want Weir’s gig as commentator for network TV coverage of the Olympics. When Cohen asked the skater if he had aspirations to be an announcer, he answered, “Not really.”

The bronze medalist turned down the chance to be an NBC commentator at this year’s Olympics when he was done competing. Rippon said at the time he didn’t want to leave Team USA and the Olympic Village for the role.

He did seem to enjoy his time at Bravo, though.

“I really love being here and like, drinking,” Rippon said on Cohen’s show.

An Australian woman happened upon what experts believe is the oldest message in a bottle ever found, dating back to 1886.

Tonya Illman of Perth said she walking along the beach on Wedge Island in January when she spied the old glass bottle and picked it up. She thought the bottle ― which apparently once contained gin ― “might look nice on display” in her home, NPR reported, quoting from a website owned by her husband, Kym Illman.

Illman said when she got back to her car, she handed the bottle to her son’s girlfriend, Bree Del Borrello. She noticed the bottle had no lid or cap, but there was something that looked like a cigarette inside.

It turned out to be a neatly rolled, damp note wrapped in string. After the paper dried, they discovered the note was written in German, according to the account on the website.

Using basic German language skills and Google Translate, Kym Illman figured out the person who dispatched the bottle wanted to know where and when it was found.

“I could easily make out the day and month, June 12, but the year was harder to decipher,” he said on the website. “We had to wait a week before we had confirmation it was 1886.”

Western Australia Museum

The Western Australian Museum in Perth helped the Illmans determine the bottle had been thrown overboard from the German sailing ship Paula as it crossed the Indian Ocean, nearly 600 miles from the Australian coast, according to The Guardian.

Ross Anderson, the museum’s assistant curator of maritime archaeology, also determined the bottle was part of an experiment by German ships ― conducted from 1864 to 1933 ― that attempted to track ocean currents by tossing thousands of bottles into the sea. Each one contained a note giving the name of the ship, its coordinates when a bottle was tossed into the sea and the date.

The notes asked that those who found them contact either the German Naval Observatory in Hamburg or the nearest German Consulate with information on where the bottles washed ashore.

The handwriting on the note found by Tonya Illman matched that in the captain’s log for the Paula. And an entry in the log for June 12, 1886, mentioned a bottle having been thrown overboard.

The previous record for oldest-known message in a bottle was for one discovered in April 2015 at Amrum Island, Germany, 108 years and 133 days after it was tossed into the North Sea by the British Marine Biological Society.

Despite the scientific evidence that the bottle and note found in Australia are legitimate, The Brisbane Times interviewed a few people who suspect the whole matter is just an elaborate publicity stunt by Kym Illman. Owner of Messages On Hold, an audio advertising company, he’s known for aggressively marketing his projects.

Illman denied making up the story, though he acknowledged to a radio host the coincidence of his wife’s discovery and his company’s name was remarkable but fortuitous, according to the newspaper.(Reuters) - A Florida grand jury formally indicted Nikolas Cruz on Wednesday on 17 counts of premeditated murder in the first degree and 17 counts of attempted murder in the first degree for last month’s shooting spree at a high school in Parkland, prosecutors said.

No date was set for an arraignment, at which Cruz will be allowed to enter a plea, said Constance Simmons, a spokeswoman for the Broward County state attorney’s office.

The 19-year-old former student is accused of using a semiautomatic assault rifle to kill 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14.

He faces a maximum sentence of either execution or life in prison without parole if convicted. The public defender’s office in Broward County has said Cruz was willing to plead guilty if county prosecutors choose not to pursue the death penalty.

The prosecutors’ office has said a decision on this has not yet been made, according to Simmons.

The attack, one of the deadliest at a school in a country where school shootings happen multiple times a year, has reignited a national debate about overhauling gun laws in Florida and beyond.

(Editing by Bernadette Baum)Jennifer Lawrence had some unkind words for a reality TV star recently, and the object of her ridicule is striking back.

The Oscar-winner and noted fan of all things Bravo dragged Lala Kent of “Vanderpump Rules” on an episode of “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.” Lawrence called out Kent for changing her personality on a dime.

“I’m sorry, but in the season before, we see Lala trying so hard to be nice,” Lawrence told Cohen. “And then she’s like crying to her mom, and then she’s like a total bitch. And then she’s trying like really, really hard to be nice, and then she comes back this season and she’s like, ‘Hi, honey. Hi, sweetie.’”

“I’m like, bitch, you’s a c**t,’” Lawrence added.

Kent understandably didn’t appreciate one of the most famous women in the world knocking her for doing what you’re supposed to do on reality TV ― cause turmoil. After Lawrence’s comments, the 27-year-old fired off some now-deleted tweets slamming the actress for not being pro-women.

“Did Jennifer Lawrence really call me a ‘c**t’ on @bravowwhl? Annnnnd talk about my mama? Bitch, you better pray I don’t see you in the streets,” she wrote. “You’re one of the highest paid actresses on the planet ... you claim you are pro-women and you call another woman a c**t? You’re gross.”

Kent later appeared on the SiriusXM show “Reality Checked” to further discuss the matter. She couldn’t help but get another dig in at Lawrence, who’s also 27.

“Congratulations on two bombed movies in a row,” she cracked.

Kent is likely referring to Lawrence’s films “Mother!” and “Red Sparrow,” which both failed to make much of an impression at the box office.

She went on to reveal that her manager instructed her to take down her Twitter clapback, telling her “delete the tweet, or you delete my info for the next 24 hours, because I’m not trying to deal.”

Though Kent is no stranger to drama on the spin-off of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” which follows a group of servers at Lisa Vanderpump’s restaurant, she admitted on the radio show that Lawrence hurt her feelings.Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, speaks to media along with lawyer Michael Avenatti in Manhattan, April 16, 2018. Brendan McDermid / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― When the pre-election payment from President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer to porn actress Stormy Daniels not to discuss the affair she says she had with him first came to light, the figure cited was $130,000.

Weeks later, as Trump’s latest lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, finally acknowledged that Trump was aware of Michael Cohen’s payment and had repaid him for it, Giuliani cited $35,000 monthly payments over the course of a year ― or $420,000.

And on Wednesday, when Trump for the first time acknowledged the payment on his financial disclosure form, it was characterized as a “reimbursement” of “expenses” that Cohen incurred in 2016, with a value between $100,000 and $250,000.

So what’s going on? Why did Trump pay Cohen $420,000 for a $130,000 expense?

That remains unclear.

Giuliani, in several interviews with HuffPost over the course of a week, explained that Trump also paid enough to cover all the taxes Cohen would have had to pay to have been left with $130,000 ― the original sum he paid out of his own pocket. Giuliani estimated that this added another $70,000, plus some profit for Cohen, plus some other expenses.

What other expenses?

“That’s privileged,” Giuliani said.

Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University, began laughing as she listened to a summary of Giuliani’s explanations.

“It seems nonsensical, because it is nonsensical,” she said.

Both Trump and his White House had claimed for months that Trump knew nothing about Cohen’s payment to Daniels. Those statements, though, were proven false when Giuliani began explaining last month that Trump had repaid Cohen. Giuliani was emphasizing that because Trump repaid Cohen, the $130,000 could not be construed as a campaign finance law violation, as candidates are permitted to spend as much as they want on their own races.

Because Trump had not disclosed his debt to Cohen on the financial disclosure form he filed last June, the Office of Government Ethics referred his failure to do so to the Justice Department on Wednesday, when Trump belatedly revealed that payment on this year’s form. “Knowingly and willfully” withholding that information on that form is punishable by as much as a year in jail, per federal statute.

Giuliani said Trump was under no obligation to report the payments to Cohen to repay Daniels ― “There’s no place on the form to disclose it” ― but said he advised Trump to do it anyway, as he anticipated that OGE officials would argue it should be disclosed.

He insisted that the payment to Daniels was entirely normal, something done all the time by famous people wanting nuisances to go away. “This is a perfectly legitimate thing. There’s nothing wrong with it,” he said.

Other lawyers, though, said that Cohen’s use of a newly created shell company to pay Daniels suggested otherwise.

“This whole thing is highly suspicious, highly unusual,” said a lawyer with two decades of experience in business law who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I’d be very reluctant to be involved in anything like this.”

Another lawyer familiar with nondisclosure agreements who spoke on condition of anonymity had a simple explanation for Giuliani’s contortions: “Paying hush money to porn stars is not a legitimate business expense.”

But technically, the nondisclosure agreement was a standard services contract ― except that in this case, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was being paid for the service of remaining silent.

That payment from Trump to Clifford via Cohen would clearly be a business expense for Cohen, and therefore not taxable income, said a Washington, D.C., tax lawyer, also on condition of anonymity.

“That’s not your money. That’s not income to you,” the lawyer said. “I disagree with Giuliani’s characterization of this. I don’t see why it would have to be out of after-tax earnings.”

In any event, Trump’s payment to Cohen of close to half a million dollars still makes no sense, Clark said, if it was to reimburse Cohen for a payment to Daniels that was less than one-third that amount.

“What Giuliani seems to be acknowledging is that this was not the only hush payment,” she said. “There’s no other way to make the math work.”

Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ new lawyer who is trying to invalidate the 2016 “hush agreement” in court, told NBC News on Thursday that he is researching the stories of two other women who have come to him claiming they have similar agreements with Trump negotiated by Cohen.

Giuliani himself allowed that possibility in an ABC News interview last month, saying that while he did not have knowledge of other women who might have been paid off, Cohen would have done that “if it was necessary.”

Late Wednesday, he would not say if he’d yet learned the nature of those other expenses ― “none of which are my concern or yours,” he said.

He reiterated that the Daniels payment was not a campaign expense that needed to be reported. He acknowledged that keeping Daniels out of the news in the days leading up to the election was helpful to Trump’s campaign, but he said it benefited the campaign in the same way, for example, that a new suit that Trump bought to wear during a debate might have.

“This payment would have been made in any event,” he said. “It’s not a campaign expense. It would have been made at any other time to protect his family and his reputation.”

Giuliani did say, however, that his earlier belief that Trump had sought to pay for Cohen’s taxes on the $130,000 was incorrect. He said the repayment was for $130,000 exactly, and no more.Singer Usher and his wife of two years, Grace Miguel, are separating.

The couple announced the change in relationship status in a statement released to Us Weekly on Tuesday:

“After much thought and consideration we have mutually decided to separate as a couple. We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives. The enormous amount of love and respect that we have for each other will only increase as we move forward.”

Although the couple was married only two years, the 39-year-old singer, whose full name is Usher Raymond IV, and 48-year-old Miguel started dating in 2009, after the singer split from his first wife, Tameka Foster, according to Page Six.

The couple eloped in 2015 and honeymooned in Cuba.

A post shared by Usher (@usher) on Feb 27, 2018 at 8:44pm PSTBilly McFarland, the brains behind the Fyre Festival fiasco, pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud that may send him to prison for up to 10 years, news outlets reported.

“I deeply regret my actions, and I apologize to my investors, team, family and supporters who I let down,” McFarland told a federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday. “I grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude.”

McFarland misled customers into paying up to $250,000 for tickets to a Bahamas music festival in 2016 that he advertised as lavish and “life-changing,” complete with models in bikinis, star musical talents and luxury accommodations. Ticket holders arrived to a barren island bereft of even the most basic survival elements.

The first count of McFarland’s wire fraud charges pertained to the festival’s financing. McFarland provided investors with fake documents overstating the earnings of his company, Fyre Media, as well as his personal finances. The second count alleged that he tricked a ticket vendor into buying $2 million in advance tickets to future festivals.

Sentencing is set for June 21.

The woman, who has not been publicly identified because she is a possible sexual assault victim, said Cuban sexually penetrated her with his finger at a Portland, Oregon, bar after she asked to take a photo with him in April 2011, according to the Portland-based Willamette Week, which recently obtained a copy of the incident report.

According to the report, which the paper obtained through a public records request, the woman immediately told a friend and her boyfriend about what happened but didn’t go to police until more than a week later.

Prosecutors ultimately declined to pursue the case, citing a lack of supporting evidence.

Cuban has denied that such an incident took place and declined further comment when reached by HuffPost by email on Wednesday.

“I’ll just repeat very strongly that it didn’t happen,” he stated, stressing prosecutors’ inability to find supporting evidence.

The woman who filed the report told Willamette Week that she stands by her claim.

“I filed the report because what he did was wrong,” she told the paper. “I stand behind that report 1,000 percent.”

The woman reportedly submitted photos to the police department, which have not been publicly released. They were described by an officer as showing Cuban, whose hands were not visible, appearing to “be stretching to reach his arm down” while standing beside the woman. The woman appeared to have a “look of surprise and strain” in some of the photos, the officer noted.

Cuban, while being investigated by police for the alleged assault, expressed panic at the idea of being accused and uncertainty of how to defend himself.

“If she told five friends right there and then, then that’s what they’re gonna tell the judge and I’m gonna be fucked. Oh my God, I don’t know what to do,” he said according to a transcript of his conversation with Portland Police Detective Brendan McGuire that was published by the Willamette Week.

News of the 2011 police report comes two weeks after a Sports Illustrated report detailed widespread sexual misconduct claims from within the Dallas Mavericks organization.

Cuban has denied knowledge of the alleged misbehavior, telling the magazine,“This is all new to me ... the only awareness I have is because I heard you guys were looking into something.”At 36, Gina Ortiz Jones has served in the Air Force, deployed to Iraq, worked as an intelligence officer and is now running for Congress. A real underachiever. Ana Martinez Chamorro

WASHINGTON ― Texas Democratic congressional candidate Gina Ortiz Jones got the most votes in Tuesday’s night’s primary. But she fell short of 51 percent, so she’ll face fellow Democrat Rick Trevino in a May runoff.

Ortiz Jones won 41 percent of the vote, well above any of her four opponents. Trevino came in second at 17 percent. Whoever wins the May runoff will go up against Rep. Will Hurd (R) in November.

A former Air Force intelligence officer, Ortiz Jones served in Iraq under President George W. Bush and as a high-level director within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under President Barack Obama. Her bid for Congress marks her first time running for office, and if she wins, Ortiz Jones would make history as the first lesbian, first Iraq War veteran and first Filipina-American to hold a U.S. House seat in Texas.

If she faces him in November, it won’t be easy for Ortiz Jones to unseat Hurd. The two-term congressman has a lot more money, and Texas’ 23rd Congressional District leans Republican.

But the district has flip-flopped between Democratic and GOP representation for years, with nobody holding it for more than two terms since 2007. Hurd won his first term in 2014 by 2,400 votes against Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego. In 2016, Hurd won by 3,000 votes. Those are pretty close races in a district where roughly 115,000 people voted in the midterm and 229,000 voted in the presidential election.

Democrats have also been sweeping in races around the country, with some high-level GOP operatives bracing for a possible bloodbath in 2018.

In Texas, momentum was on the side of Democrats on Tuesday night. More than 44,000 voters cast ballots in Ortiz’s primary, compared to about 31,000 voters in Hurd’s primary. That’s a difference of roughly 13,000 people.

Ortiz Jones argues that she is in a strong position to take on Hurd, a former CIA agent, in part because of her intelligence experience.A progressive Democrat attacked by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advanced in the primary vote for a Texas congressional seat on Tuesday.

Laura Moser, the activist and writer who withstood the broadside from the House Democrats’ campaign arm, emerged as one of the party’s two potential nominees for Texas’ 7th Congressional District. In a crowded Democratic field, none of the seven contenders in the Houston-area district received the 50-percent-plus-one needed to win outright.

Moser now heads to a May 22 runoff election against corporate lawyer Lizzie Fletcher, who led the primary field, to determine which Democrat faces Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term Republican, in November’s general election.

But even if Moser falls short in May, her strong performance on Tuesday demonstrates the strength of the Democratic Party’s energized progressive base and the limits of the DCCC’s power to steer the outcomes of contentious primaries.

“The bosses in the party tried to put their thumb on the scale and they misjudged it. It shows how far out of touch some in the leadership of the party are from their supporters,” said John Floyd, a criminal defense attorney and leader of the local Our Revolution chapter, which backed Moser’s bid.

Although Culberson has run unopposed on at least one occasion, this year Democrats came out of the woodwork to challenge the deeply conservative congressman. Texas’ 7th is one of just three GOP-held districts in the state where voters narrowly opted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2016, making it a prime Democratic pickup opportunity in the midterm elections. The district went for Clinton 49 to 47 percent, a sharp swing from 2012 when it went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 21 percentage points.

The devastating effect of Hurricane Harvey last year has also made Culberson more vulnerable than normal. He promoted the expansion of an interstate highway that some of his constituents believe left their neighborhoods more vulnerable to flooding.

Moser ― who previously founded Daily Action, a text-message alert tool popular with the anti-Trump protest movement ― staked out the most left-wing stances in the Democratic field, including support for a single-payer health care system.

In addition to Fletcher, Moser’s competitors in the race included Jason Westin, a progressive physician and cancer researcher; and Alex Triantyphyllis, a nonprofit executive and former Goldman Sachs analyst. Triantyphillis did not make the runoff despite raising over $1 million, more than any other Democratic candidate.

Fletcher picked up the influential endorsement of EMILY’s List, a Democratic group that helps women candidates who support abortion rights. However, local labor unions deeply opposed her bid, since her law firm represented a janitorial services company that successfully blocked its largely immigrant workforce from unionizing and sued the local chapter of the Service Employees International Union that had been trying to organize the workers. The SEIU chapter subsequently declared bankruptcy.

The Working Families Party, a progressive group with some labor union funding, already spent $20,000 on targeted social media ads blasting Fletcher for her work with the law firm. The group plans to spend more informing the public about the issue during the runoff.

“Lizzie Fletcher’s law firm, and Lizzie herself as a partner, profited from the pain and loss of immigrant women janitors. That’s not right,” Working Families Party communications director Joe Dinkin said. “If Democrats are going to win in November, we need candidates who fight for working families, not fight against them.”

For her part, Moser’s bold positions and deep roots in the resistance drew the backing of local activists and national organizations like Democracy for America and Justice Democrats. Outspoken liberal actor Alyssa Milano also volunteered for her campaign.

But the DCCC grew concerned that nominating a progressive like Moser would dash Democrats’ general-election hopes in the affluent, Republican-leaning district. In an apparent bid to prevent her from advancing, the House Democrats group took the highly unusual step on Feb. 22 of posting an opposition research memo about Moser on its website.

The DCCC used misleading claims in the brief dossier to argue that Moser was a “Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress.” The memo cited a quote in which Moser expressed her strong reluctance to live in a rural outpost like Paris, Texas, but the DCCC selectively edited the quote to make it seem as if she hated the entire state. (Moser actually grew up in the 7th District and returned there with her family last year.)

The campaign committee also accused Moser of self-dealing by using campaign dollars to hire her husband’s political consulting firm. But the firm, Revolution Messaging, where Moser’s husband Arun Chaudhary is a partner, gained national renown for its role in the 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). As such, the firm would be a plausible choice for any ambitious candidate.

As The Intercept noted, the DCCC has its own sordid history of aggressively directing candidates and partner organizations to consultants with deep ties to its leaders.

“We have to fix our broken politics ― and that starts by rejecting the system where Washington party bosses tell us who to choose.” - Laura Moser

By all appearances, the salvo against Moser had the opposite of its intended effect. The party organization drew stinging criticism not only from left-leaning activists, but also from Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez and the former Obama White House aides who host the podcast “Pod Save America.”

In her closing campaign ad, “Our Turn,” Moser relished the opportunity to paint herself as a grassroots crusader up against the Democratic establishment.

“We have to fix our broken politics ― and that starts by rejecting the system where Washington party bosses tell us who to choose,” she said, speaking directly into the camera. “We tried that before and look where it got us.”

On the strength of this David-vs.-Goliath framing, Moser saw a spike in fundraising that netted her over $90,000 as of the end of last week. Our Revolution, the legacy organization formed out of Sanders’ presidential campaign, cited the DCCC’s attack in its last-minute endorsement of her on Thursday.

Blasting Moser “sparked a grassroots upsurge that actually benefited Moser’s campaign,” said Floyd, the local Our Revolution leader.

It remains to be seen how the internecine feud will affect Democrats’ competitiveness in general and in Texas’ 7th District in particular. Following the party’s clash with Moser, a series of revelations about the DCCC’s controversial endorsements in other primaries and its conservative advice to candidates about how to address gun control and health care policy further rankled progressive activists.

The Republican Party is already trying to exploit the divisions. The National Republican Congressional Committee released a web ad highlighting the anti-Moser memo in a bid to underscore the “Democratic civil war.”

Floyd predicted that with Moser’s advancement, the DCCC has “learned its lesson” about intervening in primaries.

But ahead of Tuesday’s election, the campaign committee had shown no signs of backtracking. The party’s next aggressive intervention in a primary might be in California, where the top two primary vote-getters regardless of party advance to the general election. Crowded Democratic fields in several southern California districts risk splitting the vote and leaving the party with no candidate on the ballot in November.

DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly told HuffPost last week that the committee is “keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there’s a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November.”WASHINGTON ― Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is changing the mission statement of his agency, removing promises of inclusive and discrimination-free communities.

In a March 5 memo addressed to HUD political staff, Amy Thompson, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, explained that the statement is being updated “in an effort to align HUD’s mission with the Secretary’s priorities and that of the Administration.”

The new mission statement reads:

HUD’s mission is to ensure Americans have access to fair, affordable housing and opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency, thereby strengthening our communities and nation.

“An organization’s mission is never static,” Thompson wrote in the memo, which was shared with HuffPost by a HUD employee. “A mission statement describes an organization’s purpose, what it intends to do, and whom it intends to serve. Most importantly, an organization’s activities must be embodied in its mission.”

She said the mission statement had been developed with input from both Carson and his deputy. It’s not clear whether the new language is final. Thompson asked the political staff to send along any “comments or suggestions.”

The Carson mission statement is quite different from the current one, which is still up on HUD’s website. That one promises “strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.” It also says these communities will be “free from discrimination”:

HUD’s mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. HUD is working to strengthen the housing market to bolster the economy and protect consumers; meet the need for quality affordable rental homes; utilize housing as a platform for improving quality of life; build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination, and transform the way HUD does business.

HUD spokesman Raffi Williams said officials were considering “modest changes” to the mission statement, as has been done in previous administrations, to “make it a more clear and concise expression of the historic work this agency performs on behalf of the American people.”

“You can be sure of one thing — any mission statement for this Department will embody the principle of fairness as a central element of everything that we do. HUD has been, is now, and will always be committed to ensuring inclusive housing, free from discrimination for all Americans,” Williams added.

HUD is not the only federal agency changing its mission under President Donald Trump. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director recently informed employees that it was removing the phrase “America’s promise as a nation of immigrants” from its mission statement.

Under President Barack Obama, HUD made advancing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer rights a priority. Shaun Donovan, who served as Obama’s first HUD secretary, was the first sitting Cabinet official in history to publicly support marriage equality.

The agency worked to prohibit discrimination by HUD-funded housing authorities, recognized state and local laws that are more LGBTQ-friendly than federal ones and raised awareness of resources available to the LGBTQ community.

Carson has a long history of making comments opposing equal rights for the LGBTQ community. New York Magazine recently reported that under Carson, HUD has pulled projects meant to help the LGBTQ community, which included online training materials for homeless shelters to ensure equal access for transgender people.

“Self-sufficiency” has been a major focus of Carson’s. Last year, he said he didn’t want low-income Americans receiving federal assistance to feel too “comfortable” in their housing because it might make them say, “I’ll just stay here. They will take care of me.”

In December, he announced a new initiative that would put “EnVision Centers” near federal housing developments to help train people in character and leadership, educational advancement, economic empowerment, and health and wellness.

Carson recently came under scrutiny for the revelation that his office was set to be redecorated with a $31,000 dining room set. The secretary has claimed he knew nothing about the order.There was an awkward moment on Tuesday evening during a CNN panel discussion about porn star Stormy Daniels’ lawsuit against President Donald Trump.

On “CNN Tonight,” Stephen Moore, who served as an advisor to Trump during the 2016 campaign and is now a CNN analyst, tried to derail a discussion about the payment and the lawsuit by cracking a joke.

“Are you saying that a porn star would actually try to call attention to herself?” Moore said. “Shocking, right?”

Moore then smiled at his own comments, but for a long and painful moment, none of the other three fellow panelists, nor the host Don Lemon, reacted.

“I mean, that’s what porn stars do!” Moore finally added, breaking the silence.

“That’s your only response, Stephen?” Lemon replied. “Is that a porn star is trying to call attention, a porn star with a very lengthy complaint from California? I mean, it’s, you know, hey, $130,000 payout from the president’s personal attorney. I mean, come on, brother.”Geek Squad employees have been working as FBI informants for more than a decade, newly released documents show, revealing a much closer relationship between the two organizations than formerly reported.

While we’d previously known some of the Best Buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers’ hard drives, the new documents show that the FBI met with the Geek Squad team at least as early as 2008 and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents last year and released them on Tuesday. The Bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies.

The documents indicate Geek Squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a client’s computer, so it’s hard to be too upset. Nevertheless, it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Seeking to calm fears, a Best Buy spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently. But in at least one instance, that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Per the EFF, an illicit image found on the hard drive of Mark Rettenmaier, a California doctor who dropped off his computer at a Best Buy in 2011, was stored on unallocated space on the disk that “typically requires forensic software to find.”

Rettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges, but the case was thrown out after U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled the FBI warrant that allowed the search of Rettenmaier’s home ― a warrant granted based on the image found by Geek Squad ― was obtained via “false and misleading statements.”

EFF documents show this wasn’t a one-off case, and that the FBI handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by Geek Squad technicians at the company’s repair facility in Kentucky. (The company’s Kentucky Geek Squad City facility handles more serious repairs, including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customer’s data.)

Records uncovered as a result of the Rettenmaier case show the Bureau had “eight FBI informants at Geek Squad City” from 2007-2012, and that some Geek Squad employees were paid between $500 and $1,000 for their help. At least one Geek Squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed.

In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Best Buy sought to temper concerns about possibly illegal searches, saying the company has both a moral and, in some cases, legal obligation to alert authorities when employees find child pornography ― as it does “nearly 100 times a year.”

Customers are also made aware of the policy in writing prior to Geek Squad beginning any repair.

“As a company, we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography,” the company said. “Our policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer’s problem. In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do — and not do — in these circumstances.”Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger in "Black Panther." Marvel / Walt Disney Studio

Michael B. Jordan has quite the forceful presence on screen.

So much so that his shirtless body in “Black Panther” reportedly caused 18-year-old Sophia Robb to clench her teeth hard enough that she broke her dental retainer.

It was a situation her orthodontist found so funny that he wrote about the emergency repair, without mentioning his patient’s name, on Tumblr.

“One of my patients came in for an emergency visit because she snapped the wire on her retainer watching the movie when MBJ took his shirt off she clenched her teeth so fucking hard she snapped it,” wrote the doctor, who uses the name Nitramaraho on his Tumblr account. He added that he found it funny for “this tiny 17-year-old girl thirsting so goddamn hard she busted steel.”

As humiliating as it was to tell her orthodontist the story of the broken retainer, Sophia said it got really crazy when she learned of his Tumblr post. She turned herself in with a tweet.

Wait. That girl is me. That is my orthodontist’s tumblr. This is a post about me? I’m going to kill myself https://t.co/ErDqESPrWj — Sophia (@pixyrue) March 5, 2018

Her post quickly went viral, but Sophia told Teen Vogue she never imagined the Jordan himself would see it.

Welp, he did.

And once he learned Erik Killmonger has the power to kill retainers, he took responsibility.

.@pixyrue since I feel partly responsible for breaking your retainers 🤷🏾‍♂️ let me know if I can replace them 😅 — Michael B. Jordan (@michaelb4jordan) March 6, 2018

Sophia told CNBC insurance covered most of the repair, so she didn’t take Jordan’s offer.Taylor Hickson, pictured with a visible scar on her left cheek in May 2017, says negligence led to her injury. FREDERIC J. BROWN via Getty Images

“Deadpool” actress Taylor Hickson is suing Incident Productions Inc. for career-altering facial injuries that she suffered on the set of “Ghostland.”

According to the suit, obtained by Deadline Tuesday, Hickson was told to pound on a glass door harder during an emotional scene of the indie horror film, which was shot in Winnipeg in December 2016.

Despite assurances from director Pascal Laugier and a producer that the scene was safe to perform, Hickson shattered the glass pane with her fist and fell through onto the shards, the suit says. She was rushed to the hospital and required 70 stitches on the left side of her face. The photo below shows the actual gash across Hickson’s cheek. However, her lawyer told HuffPost that “much of the bruising and swelling” on her face was actually makeup or prosthetics from the shoot.

Hickson, a 20-year-old described by her lawyers as a “busy, up and coming actor” before the accident, remains scarred, the suit contends. She lost income during her recovery and now “has struggled to find work as an actor and states that same is due to her injury. She states she has and will continue to suffer future financial losses in an amount to be proven at or before trial.”

Hickson, of Kelowna, British Columbia, told Deadline she also sustained wounds beyond the physical. “It’s been mass amounts of insecurity, conflicted, confused, hurt, angry, and sad that this was my last day on set and no precautions were taken,” she said.

Winnipeg-based Incident Productions “fell below the legal standard of care that is expected of a production company,” Jason Harvey, one of Hickson’s lawyers, said in an email to HuffPost. “We believe that this incident was easily preventable and, unfortunately, resulted in significant injuries to Taylor.”

One of the “Ghostland” producers would not comment on the allegations, The Canadian Press reported.

The movie is also titled “Incident in A Ghost Land” and coincidentally features a woman with a broken face on a poster.

Marius Makon, who is also known as Elton Prince, told the Spanish newspaper El Pais he was ordering coffee with friends when a couple approached him.

Makon said the woman, who police later described as a 32-year-old from El Salvador, told him, “I don’t want black people in this place or in front of me.”

Makon said he told the woman he’d be leaving in a moment and added, “I don’t have any interest in staying near you for long.”

The woman allegedly called Makon a “black piece of shit.” According to The Washington Post, she said: “I’m white. I can kill you and nothing will happen.”

The woman allegedly smashed a beer bottle against the actor’s head twice, causing cuts and other injuries that required medical attention.

After the attack, other customers helped Makon with his injuries while the restaurant owners called police.

After witnesses identified the suspect, Makon filed a report at the local police station. The woman was arrested, according to The Associated Press, but was released shortly after she provided a statement to police, according to El Pais.

Makon went into detail about the incident on his Facebook page, and said he does not feel any hatred toward his assailant:

Now I am in my house and I look through these images [of my injuries] I do not feel any hate towards the woman. I want to say that I am not angry with her and I don’t know why. I am sad that she feels such hate, that she lives with hate. It saddens me that she does not enjoy life, that she doesn’t leave a small space in her heart to love.

Spain’s Migration Network, a group of nongovernmental organizations and groups fighting discrimination, is asking prosecutors to investigate the incident as a hate crime. However, the Civil Liberties Union for Europe notes that Spain does not have “any comprehensive and united policy against racism.”The mystery surrounding former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who remain in critical condition at a hospital in the United Kingdom after being exposed to an unknown substance, escalated Tuesday as Britain’s government accused Russia of being responsible.

“There is much speculation about the disturbing incident in Salisbury, where a 66-year-old man, Sergei Skripal, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious,” said British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

Skripal and his daughter were found on a bench at a mall in Salisbury on Sunday, according to a statement from the police in England’s Wiltshire County. They were both being “treated for suspected exposure to an unknown substance.”

“He had his palms up to the sky as if he was shrugging and was staring at the building in front of him. I remember looking back at him thinking he would catch my eye but he was staring dead straight,” Georgia Pridham, a passerby, told The Telegraph. “He was conscious but it was like he was frozen and he was slightly rocking back and forward.”

The woman, Pridham added, was “slumped onto his shoulder.”

The substance has not yet been identified, nor have police confirmed if any criminal activity took place. The police declared the case a “major incident,” and multiple agencies, including the country’s counterterrorism police force, are investigating.

Authorities said they closed down a local restaurant called Zizzi on Monday in connection with the investigation, although there’s no known risk to public health. One member of the emergency service that dealt with Skripal and his daughter is also in the hospital, the Press Association reported.

A major incident has been declared & a multi-agency response co-ordinated. Alongside partner agencies, we're conducting extensive enquiries to determine exactly what led to these people falling unconscious & clarify whether or not any criminal activity has happened. #Salisbury — Wiltshire Police (@wiltshirepolice) March 5, 2018

Skripal, a former colonel in the Russian military intelligence, was accused of spying for Britain in 2006 and sentenced by Russia to 13 years in prison. He was pardoned in 2010 and released to the U.S. as part of a high-profile “spy swap” and later flown to Britain.

Russia has so far not been linked to the incident. The Kremlin denied having any knowledge about the cause of Skripal’s illness, and offered to cooperate in the investigation. Yet Johnson slammed Russia as a “malign and disruptive force,” warning that Britain plans to “respond appropriately and robustly” if President Vladimir Putin’s government is found to have been responsible. He implied he would think twice about sending U.K. representation to the 2018 World Cup, which will take place in Russia this summer.

The incident recalls the high-profile 2006 poisoning of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died weeks after drinking tea laced with a poisonous substance at a London hotel, accused Putin from his deathbed of ordering the poisoning. A 2016 inquiry by the British government found Russian agency FSB (which succeeded the KGB) had Litvinenko killed in an operation “probably approved” by Putin. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied involvement.
