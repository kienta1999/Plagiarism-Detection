Meehan told the Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday that he believed the two were “soul mates” but denied that an emotional letter he sent her last year was romantic. Meehan said he sent the letter after learning she was in a serious relationship and was considering quitting her position.

“You are and have been a complete partner to me and you have brought me much happiness,” he wrote in the May 2017 letter, which is signed “with all my heart.”

She didn’t reciprocate his feelings, leading him to grow hostile, the woman said in a complaint. She received a taxpayer-funded settlement in response and left her position.

Meehan denied that he retaliated against her and instead blamed any negative behavior on stress over the Republican effort to dismantle Affordable Care Act. On the day Meehan penned the letter to his aide, the House voted to partially repeal and replace the health care law.

The New York Times first reported news of the settlement on Saturday. Hours later, Meehan was removed from the House Ethics Committee, the body tasked with investigating claims of sexual misconduct among members. An investigation into his conduct was launched Monday.

“I looked at it the way somebody might look at the customary resolution of a matter in which we can allow the parties to move forward,” Meehan said when asked why the settlement remained confidential. He offered to repay the public funds in the event that the Ethics Committee investigation concludes that harassment did in fact occur.Trump judicial nominee Michael Brennan on racial bias in the justice system: What, can't hear you, phone ... breaking ... up .... Tom Williams via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― One of President Donald Trump’s nominees to a lifetime seat on a federal court, Michael Brennan, can’t say if there is racial bias in the American criminal justice system.

During his Wednesday confirmation hearing, Brennan, a white lawyer from Wisconsin who is nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, repeatedly dodged the question posed by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

“Do you think implicit racial bias exists in our criminal justice system?” asked Booker, one of three black members to ever serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“I would indicate only that I would do my very best as a judge to ensure that no biases came in,” said Brennan, who was a trial judge on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court for nine years.

“You’re aware that African-Americans are stopped more than whites for drug searches in this country?” Booker continued. “That there’s no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or dealing drugs, but [blacks] are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for it? You’re aware of the data, I imagine, that says African-Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimum sentences for the same crime. You’re probably aware of the data that African-Americans are more likely to serve more time for similar crimes.”

The senator asked again, “Do you think implicit racial bias exists in the criminal justice system as you know it?”

“One of the things I can say, senator, is that I want to put my pro bono efforts into …,” Brennan began.

“I’m not asking about you specifically, sir,” Booker interrupted. “I’m asking do you think racial bias exists in the criminal justice system.”

Federally collected data is clear on the racial divide in the justice system. Black drivers, for example, are more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. White drivers involved in traffic stops are searched at lower rates than black drivers. Black people spend more time behind bars than white people for the same crimes, and black people are three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people ― even though the two groups use cannabis at roughly the same rates.

Booker kept asking the question of Brennan, who then said he couldn’t take a position because of the “canons of ethics” for judges and tried to pivot to talking about his volunteer work. He suggested he might give an opinion if he could have a look at the data that Booker was referencing. The senator was incredulous.

“You haven’t? You’re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal justice system?” Booker asked. “I find this astonishing.”Aly Raisman

By Rebecca Beitsch

Fueled by accusations against titans of Hollywood, industry and politics, the #MeToo movement will prompt state lawmakers across the country this year to consider bills that could fundamentally change the culture of dating and sex.

States are expected to grapple with legislation to establish affirmative consent — known as “yes means yes” — and rewrite rape and sexual assault laws. Legislatures already are considering more than two dozen bills that would strengthen laws against rape, teach students that both participants must consent to sexual activity, and extend the time to prosecute or sue those accused of sexual assault. They also will weigh measures to clarify sexual assault survivors’ rights, improve rape kit testing, and change the rules for sexual harassment settlements.

State lawmakers have debated such bills in the past. But this year a slew of accusations of sexual assault, misconduct and harassment — along with accounts such as the anonymous accusation against comedian Aziz Ansari — have given legislators greater momentum in pursuing policies that do more to crack down on abusers and support survivors. The bills have been introduced primarily by Democrats, but many have Republican co-sponsors.

“I’m hoping we are just reaching a time where people realize this is not a fad,” said Maine state Sen. Mattie Daughtry, a Democrat who introduced a bill this year to teach consent as part of sex education. “There is a wave. This is women stepping up for change, and this cannot be put on the back burner.”

Legislators and victims’ rights advocates say many current laws put too much of the onus on victims, requiring them to prove they resisted sexual advances. And they say requiring victims to come forward quickly is unfair to those abused as children, who may take years to understand and grapple with what happened to them.

“The steady stream of people coming out and saying ‘me too’ led to this moment that I think is going to lead to a lot of change,” said Ilse Knecht, director of policy and advocacy with the Joyful Heart Foundation, a New York-based group that pushes states to improve rape kit testing.

Defining Consent

Many states are considering bills that would toughen their existing rape statutes by no longer requiring proof that the perpetrator used force against his victim, or that the victim actively resisted.

“When you look at the neurobiology of trauma, we hear about fight or flight, but there’s a third response: there’s freeze. … Some women undergoing trauma, their body may choose to freeze,” said Washington state Rep. Tina Orwall, a Democrat who has sponsored a bill that would remove the force requirement from current rape law. “We don’t want victim-blaming. It shouldn’t be the victim’s fault for not fighting back.”

More than half the states have laws that require a show of force by either the perpetrator or the victim, according to a 2015 analysis of state laws by Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law who studies sexual assault issues. Only four states — Montana, New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin — have what Tuerkheimer considers a strict affirmative consent standard that requires both parties freely consent to sexual activity, rather than relying on the victim to say no.

The topic of consent has been brought to the forefront especially by allegations against Ansari. The comedian recently made headlines after a murky sexual encounter with an unnamed woman that he says he thought was consensual.

Tuerkheimer said those opposed to affirmative consent bills often argue that communication during sex can be a gray area and that too many would be punished for failing to meet a gold standard. But when she reviewed cases in states with an affirmative consent law, she found the types of rape cases being prosecuted did not differ greatly from those in other states.

“They’ve had these laws, and the sky has not fallen, and the cases that have been brought are the exact kind of cases we want prosecutors to bring,” she said of the states with existing affirmative consent laws.

In Nebraska, state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, introduced a bill that would scrap the force requirements for both perpetrators and victims in the current law while imposing a new affirmative consent standard.

“The old law didn’t do enough,” she said. “I guess the theory was, How could a woman not want sex? She has to prove herself she didn’t want it. … If you require that there be force, then someone has to fight off someone to say no. That’s not a reasonable standard.”

One of the most popular videos for explaining affirmative consent is a British public service video comparing sex to offering someone a cup of tea. If someone isn’t sure if they want tea, changes their mind about wanting tea, or passes out, the person who brewed the tea shouldn’t force it down the other person’s throat.

Pansing Brooks said she plans to send the video to all the legislators in her state, adding that she has heard some confusion on talk radio there, with hosts arguing it’s not always clear whether someone wants to have sex.

“ ‘How are we supposed to know?’ Well, ask her,” Pansing Brooks said. “It’s yes or no if you want to have sex. … You better be darn sure, or you could be liable.”

Some lawmakers are pushing for an affirmative consent standard to be taught in schools. Bills in Pennsylvania and West Virginia would make affirmative consent part of the code of conduct for college students. Bills in Maine and Michigan would require teaching affirmative consent as part of sex education in K-12 schools.

“Before ‘Me Too,’ a lot of the conversation was about college campuses,” said Daughtry in Maine. “I think it’s critical to introduce it at an earlier age.”

State Rep. Abdullah Hammoud, a Democrat, sponsored the Michigan bill as a way to change the conversation around consent.

“I think what we’re trying to do is change a culture,” he said. “Personally I believe you change a culture with our youth. It’s important to provide that information and context at an early age.”

Statute of Limitations

At least eight states — California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont — also are considering bills that would extend the time for sexual assault victims to file a civil suit or for district attorneys to prosecute.

New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat seeking to extend the statute of limitations in the state, said current law protects abusers, particularly those who prey on children who may not address the issue before turning 23, as the law now requires.

“There’s this widespread revulsion among survivors that their abusers have remained unidentified and continue to prey on young people with abandon,” Hoylman said. “A constituent told me that he had been abused by his coach and shared that traumatic story with me but also added that wasn’t the worst thing to him. What was most outrageous was that his former coach was still at his school.”

Hoylman’s bill would extend both the criminal and civil statute of limitations going forward, and it also would create a one-year exception for people whose claims have expired to file a civil suit against their abuser.

Such windows have been used before in other states, despite claims from critics they would lead to a wealth of false accusations. Marci Hamilton, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, studied the short-term windows used in five other states. Of those states, Hamilton said there was anecdotal evidence of only five false claims reported in California, out of 1,150 filed.

Still, such bills often face resistance in state legislatures. A bill to extend the statute of limitations in New York was voted down last year after hard lobbying from the Catholic Church, saying a one-year civil suit window would be financially devastating. And some prosecutors have also expressed concern, arguing older cases can be harder to prosecute.

Survivors’ Rights

Other state legislators are pushing the rights of victims of sexual assault and harassment.

Some lawmakers want to outline the rights sexual assault survivors have — often dubbed a bill of rights for survivors — and push stricter guidelines for how rape kits should be tested. Bills in New Hampshire and New York would forbid charging victims for a rape kit. An Iowa bill would require victims to be notified as their rape kit proceeds through testing.

“I think in the past these things were a matter of courtesy, and that didn’t work very well,” said Iowa state Rep. Marti Anderson, a Democrat who sponsored the bill there. “So I think they need to be in a law.”

California’s Legislature is considering a bill that would bar sexual harassment agreements from including a nondisclosure agreement that prohibits victims from speaking publicly about the harassment.

State Sen. Connie Leyva, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, said it was a direct response to the outpouring of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

“What if that first woman he harassed and abused didn’t sign a secret settlement? Then maybe the 79 other women wouldn’t have been subjected to him and his ways,” Leyva said. “This takes the power away from the harasser and puts it in the woman’s hand.”

Leyva said the bill will primarily affect wealthy men who have long been able to keep their jobs and progress in their industry while the women they harass lose their job or struggle to advance in their career.The two students killed by a fellow high schooler Tuesday in Benton, Kentucky, weren’t the first victims of such violence this month. So far this week, three shootings have happened at or near schools. At least eight more took place in the first three weeks of 2018.

A student bringing a gun onto school property and firing at peers or teachers seems to occur most often, though that’s not always what happens. Two of the shootings this month were later identified as suicides. And in one instance, a 32-year-old man shot at a school bus with a pellet gun.

Here’s the complete list of shooting incidents schools have faced so far this year:

Jan. 23: Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky

A 15-year-old boy opened fire inside the school, killing two and injuring 16.

Jan. 22: NET Charter High School in New Orleans, Louisiana

Someone driving by the school fired on a group of students in the parking lot. Only one boy was injured.

Jan. 22: Italy High School in Italy, Texas

A 16-year-old boy shot a 15-year-old girl in the cafeteria. He was arrested and she was airlifted to a hospital, where she was “in good spirits” as of Tuesday.

Jan. 20: Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina

Following an argument, a 21-year-old Winston-Salem University student was shot and killed during a sorority event at Wake Forest University.

Jan. 15: Wiley College in Marshall, Texas

Two people in a car exchanged gunfire with a person in a dormitory parking lot. No one was injured, but a bullet was fired into a dorm room with three female students inside.

Jan. 10: Coronado Elementary School in Sierra Vista, Arizona

A 14-year-old died in a school bathroom from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Jan. 10: Grayson College in Denison, Texas

A student confused a training weapon with a real one and fired a bullet through a classroom wall. No students were injured.

Jan. 10: California State University in San Bernardino, California

At least one shot was fired, shattering one classroom window. No students were injured.

Jan. 6: School bus in Forest City, Iowa

A 32-year-old man fired a pellet gun at a school bus, shattering one of the windows. No students were injured.

Jan. 4: New Start High School in Seattle, Washington

Two shots were fired at the school from outside the building. No students were injured.

***

With a tally of almost 300 school shootings since 2013, the country is averaging one school shooting per week, according to a report from gun control advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety.

Everytown defines a school shooting as when a “firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.” Other groups may expand the characterization to include school-like settings, like the aforementioned school bus shooting.

In instances where minors shot a gun at school and authorities could determine where the child got the weapon, more than half obtained the gun at home, Everytown said. It’s also fairly common for a school shooting to result from a confrontation or verbal argument that escalates.

Experts have also begun to document the effects that fatal school shootings have on students.

“These incidents can affect students’ decision about whether to stay at their school, affect their cognitive skills, and influence their behavior at school,” according to a 2015 study titled “The Effect of High School Shootings on Schools and Student Performance.”

Authors Louis-Philippe Beland and Dongwoo Kim found that enrollment in ninth grade drops following a deadly shooting, as do standardized test scores in math and English for up to three years after a shooting.

A quarter of U.S. parents said they fear for their children’s safety while they are at school, according to an August 2017 Gallup survey. Parents’ concern about children’s safety reached a high after the 1999 Columbine shooting and has spiked sporadically in the wake of other major school shootings.

Yet some fear the need for gun safety isn’t resonating with a wider American audience.

“As we think about the lives affected today, we must not let news of school shootings become the new normal,” said Connie Courtney, a volunteer with the Kentucky chapter of Moms Demand Action, a gun safety advocacy organization.

The issue doesn’t seem to be a major concern for the Trump administration, either. President Donald Trump hasn’t directly addressed any of the 10 shootings this year. Last year, he even tweeted out condolences about the wrong mass shooting.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the president had been briefed on the Kentucky shooting and offered his “thoughts and prayers.”How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.

Any reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.A trio of older gay men offer their collective take on terms and expressions used by younger members of the queer community for a hilarious new video.

The clip ― released Tuesday by Grindr’s online lifestyle magazine, INTO ― finds the men sounding off on popular slang phrases like “werk,” “extra” and, of course, “yas kween.”

As the video progresses, the men offer off-the-cuff observations, as well as bits of sage advice, to their younger counterparts.

“You guys are watching too much RuPaul,” one quips in the clip, which had been viewed over 114,000 times as of Friday afternoon. Adds another, “This is the kind of thing the Kardashians would sit around and do all afternoon.”“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” has your back when it comes to buying gifts for Mother’s Day this Sunday.

The reality TV star and her husband Kanye West brought a baby girl named Chicago into the world via a surrogate on Jan. 15. The mom of three, who had tried to conceive naturally for years despite two high-risk pregnancies, opened up about how the connection to the new baby “came instantly.”

“Even before Chicago was born, Kim was talking about asking the surrogate to carry her next baby,” a source told People.

“She’s so happy with the whole process and thrilled with the surrogate,” the source added. “Kanye was even bonding with the surrogate’s husband in the delivery room.”

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jan 10, 2018 at 1:49pm PST

Kardashian and West are already parents to two other children, the impossibly cute North, 4, and Saint, 2, who reportedly are already bonding with their new sister.

“Kim definitely wants more kids. She is so happy being a family of five,” the source continued. “She wants the family to get even bigger!”

The beauty mogul has yet to share a photo of baby Chicago, but did post a T-shirt with her name featured on it ― which she’ll probably make available for purchase any day now ― hinting that our first peek could be coming soon.

And despite not inviting her to the baby shower, Kardashian seems to have developed quite the affection for her surrogate, who has remained out of the spotlight.Amazon has removed a series of products from its website that bore a slogan praising slavery.

The online retailer faced a backlash this week after a third-party seller named Styleart listed a number of items emblazoned with the phrase “Slavery Gets Shit Done” on Amazon’s Marketplace platform. The products included laptop cases, mugs, bags, children’s T-shirts and bibs, according to reports.

Human rights organization Anti-Slavery International described the items as “absolutely shocking” and urged Amazon to “do better to control what you sell.” Some customers also called for a boycott of the website.

Twenty-five years ago, as Hurricane Andrew bore down on northeast Mississippi, a teenage girl vanished without a trace in the town of Tupelo. She wasn’t a casualty of Mother Nature. She was, according to police, a victim of a cold and calculating individual who took advantage of the chaos caused by the storm.

The hurricane, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached Tupelo, left no permanent mark on the city, which is best known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. However, the disappearance of 13-year-old Leigh Marine Occhi did, and it still hangs like a thick cloud over the city.

For more than two decades, authorities have dissected and combed through the evidence. Theories and suspicions abound, but the teenager has yet to be found.

Still, there is hope for resolution. The case is now being analyzed in a new podcast, titled “13: The Search for Leigh Occhi,” which is being released episodically by local NBC affiliate WTVA News.

“There’s a lot of apparent coincidence in this tale,” WTVA’s Jason Lee Usry says in the preview episode of the podcast, which can be found on iTunes or SoundCloud. “A lot of coincidence, a great deal of mysterious behavior, and somewhere within one of the players in this story, a terrifying level of cruelty.”

The case, which this author first covered on the Criminal Report Daily blog nine years ago, began on Aug. 27, 1992. As torrential rains and gusting winds began to hit Tupelo, the alarm clock at the Yarbrough home went off at about 6:45 a.m.

According to Vickie Yarborough, she and her daughter, Leigh Occhi, had slept in the same bed the previous night because the girl was afraid of storms. The blond-haired, bright-eyed Leigh had recently celebrated her thirteenth birthday and was supposed to go to an open house at Tupelo Middle School with her grandmother that afternoon.

Yarborough had recently separated from Leigh’s stepfather, Barney, and she told detectives it was just her and her daughter on that rainy Thursday morning. According to the police report, Yarborough said her daughter had been alive and well when she left for work at about 7:40 a.m. that morning.

Yarborough later said she’d heard there were tornado watches in the area and decided to call from work and check on Leigh at about 8:30 a.m. Nobody answered. Concern turned to worry, prompting Yarborough to drive home, according to the report.

“The door was unlocked, and I opened the house and it was all dark, so I didn’t see Leigh anywhere,” Yarborough told detectives. “I said, ‘Leigh,’ like that, and nobody answered me, and then I went in.”

She added, “I saw blood right there splattered on the walls and then I screamed ... and dialed 911.”

At about 9:00 a.m., Yarborough made a frantic 911 call to the Tupelo Police Department. She requested immediate assistance at her home on a cul-de-sac on the city’s west side, telling the dispatcher that her daughter was missing and that she’d found traces of blood inside the house.

When police arrived on the scene, they observed blood stains in the hallway and bathroom, and a bloody stain containing strands of hair on a door frame facing the kitchen area. Authorities said there were indications that someone had attempted to clean up the blood in the bathroom. In Leigh’s room, a bloody blue nightgown and bra were discovered. The only items missing were the teen’s shoes, reading glasses and underclothes.

There was no sign of forced entry into the house, police said. Based on the evidence, authorities surmised Leigh had been killed inside.

The next day, the leading headline in The Daily Journal read, “Federal Troops Ordered to Fla.” A much smaller headline, within a subsection of the paper, read, “13-year-old Tupelo Girl Reported Missing.”

Police conducted multiple ground and aerial searches, but found no sign of Leigh. The case was coming to an abrupt standstill when, on Sept. 9, 1992, Yarborough contacted police and told them she’d received a package in the mail containing Leigh’s missing eyeglasses. They’d been delivered in an 8-inch envelope, addressed in block letters to “B Yarborough.” The return address was the same as the mailing address.

Authorities determined the package had been mailed from Booneville, a small city located roughly 30 miles north of Tupelo. The envelope was sent to the state crime lab in Jackson for handwriting analysis and DNA testing, but nothing of evidentiary value was found.

According to Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre, investigators became suspicious and asked Yarborough to take a lie detector test. She was polygraphed three different times ― once by a local polygraph examiner and twice by the FBI – and “failed it three times,” the chief said in a 2009 interview with this author.

Yarborough was named a person of interest at the time, but no charges were ever filed against her.

In 2009, the same year the police chief revealed the alleged results of the lie detector tests to this author, Yarborough said she was well aware they’d considered her a person of interest.

“That has never been a bother to me,” she told this author.

“It’s never been about me. It’s about finding Leigh, and I didn’t care and I [still] don’t care what anyone says about any of it ... I have never not cooperated with anybody [and] I am not fazed by what they say.”

Detectives investigated Leigh’s step-father, but ultimately cleared him, police said. Other suspicions ― directed at a man who was known to Leigh’s family and later incarcerated for similar crimes ― failed to pan out.

Despite the police department’s belief that Leigh was murdered, her mother was unwilling, in 2009, to give up the hope that her daughter was still alive.

“I am not going to accept anything for sure,” she said. “I am not going to do that ... I have to keep focused on factual things ... or I wouldn’t be able to cope very well.”

It’s unclear if she still holds that belief. Attempts by HuffPost to reach her were unsuccessful.

Leigh’s father, Donald Occhi, says he believes his daughter is dead. A master sergeant in the Army, he and Yarborough had met and married while serving together in the military. Leigh was their only child. When the marriage ended, Yarborough left the service and made her way to Mississippi, while Donald Occhi was transferred to another base.

“I want to live to see her body located, so that I can see that she is properly buried,” he said. “Then I will smile when the son of a bitch who did this dies in the Mississippi state death chamber.”

In the last two decades, there have been plenty of “maybes” and “what ifs,” but the complete portrait of the crime has remained blurred. Now, 25 years after the fact, WTVA News promises to “reveal new twists, turns and developments” in the long-dormant case, though it’s unclear whether there will be any answers.

AdvertisementElton John is letting the sun go down on his performing days after all.

The bespectacled icon announced a three-year farewell tour and his subsequent retirement during a press conference on Wednesday.

“I’m not going to be touring anymore,” he told moderator Anderson Cooper at New York’s Gotham Hall.

“I’m not going to be touring and traveling the world. My priorities have changed. I have young children... That doesn’t mean I won’t still be creative,” the iconic singer said. “But I won’t travel any more ... I don’t want to go out with a whimper. I want to go out with a bang ... It’ll be the most produced, fantastic show I’ve ever done.”

The 300-date tour, spanning over the course of a several years, is called the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour. John insists that this will be the one and only farewell tour he will do.

“I’m 71. I can’t physically do the traveling anymore,” he said. “I want to be at home. I really want to spend time with my children at home. I’ve had an incredible life, but life is all about change.”

Despite the desire to stop touring after this stretch, John expressed interest in making more albums.

“I definitely want to make a couple more albums, but that will be easy since I can do that at home. I want to see friends. I want to spend time at my house and with my photography collection. I’m really looking forward to this tour and I’m really looking forward to the 300th date,” he said.

He’ll be answering more questions about the tour on an upcoming Facebook Live stream, which is set to occur sometime on Wednesday.

John’s first massive hit, “Your Song,” was released in 1970 alongside his self-titled debut album, and he hasn’t really stopped since. He’ll finish his Las Vegas residency in May after six years and embark on the farewell tour in September. Tickets are available on his website.

The baby hippo who took the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden (and the world) by storm last year turned 1 year old on Wednesday.

Fiona was the first Nile hippo born at the Cincinnati Zoo in 75 years and arrived on Jan. 24, 2017, weighing just 29 pounds. The average newborn baby hippo weighs 55 to 120 pounds.

She was due in March, but came barreling into the light of day six weeks early. Because she was barely able to walk and nurse after birth, Fiona was taken care of by a round-the-clock care team, known as “Team Fiona.”

You may recognize Fiona from the zoo Facebook page’s frequent updates on her life. She’s become a hippo sensation, with a line of merchandise and even her own ice cream flavor. (We live in a weird time!)

At a year old, Fiona is happy, healthy and gaining more and more weight every day. She’s also the star of The Fiona Show on Facebook Watch. The Season 2 premiere aired Wednesday, featuring Fiona going to town on her birthday “cake,” a delicious-looking watermelon and pineapple display.

Broadly even mapped Fiona’s astrological chart for her on this momentous day, after finding out that she was born at 2:58 a.m. at the Cincinnati Zoo.

“She’s a rebel,” wrote Broadly staff astrologer Annabel Gat in the report. “She’s an Aquarius, which is one of the most free-thinking signs in the zodiac.”

Christina Gorsuch, the Cincinnati Zoo’s curator of mammals and one of the first people to see and hold Fiona when she was born, told Broadly that the assessment seemed accurate.

“She has been curious her whole life and her fearlessness is in part the source of her strength and ability to conquer all adversity,” said Gorsuch.A Chicago student’s journal entry has gone viral after he set his teacher straight in response to a whitewashed history lesson.

Eight-year-old King Johnson wrote the entry after speaking with his mother, Robin Johnson, about the meaning of Columbus Day, his mom told HuffPost.

In the entry, King confronts his teacher after learning Christopher Columbus discovered America.

“Today was not a good learning day. Blah, blah, blah,” he wrote. “I only wanted to hear you not talking. You said something wrong and I can’t listen when I hear lies.”

King reminds the teacher about Native Americans while quoting an apt Jay-Z lyric.

“My mom said that the only Christofer we acknowledge is Wallace. Because Columbus didn’t find our country, the Indians did. I like to have Columbus Day off, but I want you to not teach me lies. That is all.”

He ended with a question: “How can white people teach black history?”

King’s teacher responded to his journal, saying that she was “very disappointed” in what he had to say. His reply was simple and nonchalant: “OK.”

King’s mom said she was “proud of him but not so pleased with the ‘blah blah blah.’”

“I always use every moment as a teaching moment,” she said. “His first day off of school for Columbus Day, I decided to talk to him and his siblings about it because he asked why they didn’t have to attend school.”

King told HuffPost he wrote the journal because he doesn’t like the “dark side” that comes out of a person when they lie.

“It’s important to tell the truth because the world should be full of trust and love,” he said.

A Facebook post of the journal entry was shared more than 128,000 times as of Wednesday. Many people commended King for speaking out against the teacher’s lesson, with some wondering why the teacher didn’t use the journal entry as an opportunity for dialogue.

Johnson said she was surprised that her son’s journal went viral. King, who wants to be a police officer when he grows up so he can save lives, said he appreciates all the positive attention he’s been getting.Barney the Dinosaur famously sings “I love you, you love me” in the theme song of the PBS children’s show “Barney & Friends.”

But the actor who played the purple character from the early ’90s to the early 2000s isn’t loving the way he was portrayed in an article about his latest occupation: Tantric massage therapist.

David Joyner charges female clients (he calls them “goddesses”) $350 for three to four hours of ritual bath, chakra balancing and massage that can lead to “mind-blowing orgasms,” Vice wrote.

Apparently the article was an anti-climax for Joyner. “I truly wish more people would try to see the spiritual side of Tantra & not think it’s all about sex,” he complained on Facebook Tuesday. “Sometimes people here in the west can be so sad.”

The 54-year-old Joyner, who has had his practice since 2004, said he used his tantra training to maintain his energy in the 70-pound Barney costume during long days of shooting. (The character’s voice was supplied by another actor.)

“The energy I brought up [while] in the costume is based on the foundation of tantra, which is love,” he told Vice. “Everything stems, grows and evolves from love. Even when you have emotionally blocked energy, the best way to remove it is to remove it with love, and then replace it with God’s divine love. Love heals and allows you to continue to grow.”

AdvertisementJust over a month after Republicans pushed through a sweeping corporate tax cut from which Bank of America stands to gain billions of dollars, the bank is set to start charging its poorest customers $12 a month for the privilege of having a checking account.

The charge, implemented earlier this month, applies to customers with an “eBanking” account, which was free for anyone who didn’t receive paper statements or use bank tellers. Bank of America has phased out eBanking and transferred those customers to “core checking accounts” that require them to contribute a direct deposit of at least $250 a month (that’s $3,000 a year) or keep a minimum daily balance of at least $1,500 to avoid the $12 monthly fee.

Most national banks with a physical presence have similar requirements for free checking accounts, according to a comparison tool on Bankrate.com. Credit unions and online-only banks, however, often don’t have a monthly charge.

While $12 a month might seem manageable, that’s not the case if you can’t meet the new minimum qualifications for a free account in the first place, NPR’s Steve Inskeep notes:

$12 per month for a checking account?

Some math:

If you have $1,000 in the account, $12 is 1.2% of it—per month.

Multiply by 12 months: people without much money are charged an annual rate of 14.4% for the bank to hold their money and process checks. https://t.co/emxDj2Pw3w — Steve Inskeep (@NPRinskeep) January 23, 2018

The timing of the bank’s decision, right on the heels of a massive Republican-backed corporate tax cut, drew outrage across the internet. A Change.org petition protesting the bank’s decision had more than 86,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.

Among U.S. banks, Bank of America is one of the largest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut, according to an analysis the investment bank KBW shared with HuffPost.

Analysts at KBW predict Bank of America’s earnings will increase 17.8 percent in 2018 once the tax cut is factored in, compared to an expected 13 percent earnings increase for banks overall. Assuming KBW’s estimates hold, that means the bank could pocket an additional $3.8 billion or so in 2018. (Bank of America turned a $21 billion profit in 2017.)

Bank of America spokeswoman Betty Riess told HuffPost the termination of eBanking isn’t “new or recent,” despite what it seems. The bank stopped offering the account five years ago and has been slowly migrating customers into different accounts ever since, she said.

Riess couldn’t say how many eBanking customers were affected by the final account closures this month. For fee-conscious customers who don’t meet Bank of America’s minimums, Riess noted the bank offers a “SafeBalance” checking account with a $4.95 monthly fee, but it doesn’t allow for overdrafts.

“Poor people who are denied access to traditional bank services are left vulnerable to costly check-cashing outlets, pawnshops and other predatory services.” - Kristen Clarke, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law

Lack of access to traditional banking services forces marginalized people into the hands of even riskier financial institutions, like predatory lenders, which exacerbates poverty, says Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonprofit organization that fights inequality.

“Poor people who are denied access to traditional bank services are left vulnerable to costly check-cashing outlets, pawnshops and other predatory services,” said Kristen Clarke, the group’s president and executive director, in a statement. “By pushing poor people into the dark world of alternative financial services characterized by higher fees and exorbitant interest rates, low-income communities are at risk of being thrust into further economic distress.”

Clarke said the bank’s action would disproportionately affect African-American and Hispanic consumers, who have historically been excluded from banking services at higher rates.Mexico saw its highest murder rate in at least two decades last year as homicides skyrocketed nearly 25 percent compared to 2016, the country’s Interior Ministry announced last week.

The Mexican government said it tracked 25,339 murders throughout 2017 — an average of about 70 per day — marking the bloodiest year since Mexico began gathering such data in 1997. The statistics top the previous record set in 2011 by more than 3,000 deaths.

The trend has already continued into 2018, after journalist Carlos Domínguez was killed last weekend in the state of Tamaulipas. Authorities are investigating whether his death was related to his work.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto addressed the ongoing violence in a speech in November, saying the government was “still not satisfied” and that it had “lots more to achieve” after taking steps to address the dangers. Mexico’s Congress passed a new law in December strengthening the military and expanding its authority to fight drug crime, but the move was met with criticism.

Peña Nieto’s approval ratings have been plummeting ahead of Mexico’s presidential elections in July. He is not up for re-election due to term limits, but his party is facing strong opposition.

U.S. President Donald Trump slammed Mexico last week as “the number one most dangerous country in the world” in a series of Twitter messages meant to further his ongoing calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Mexican government rejected such a distinction.

“Even though Mexico has a significant problem with violence, it is plainly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world,” the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement obtained by Reuters.Refugees prepare to leave Manus Island for the U.S. Refugee Action Coalition

Up to 58 refugees being held at Australia’s offshore detention facility on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island will fly to the United States on Tuesday.

Refugee advocates in Australia told HuffPost that 40 refugees had already left Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby, on Tuesday morning local time, with another 18 thought to be departing later on a separate plane. The refugees were living at the Manus Island facilities, which house only men, and had been detained by Australia for several years after trying to reach the mainland by boat.

The refugees will be flown to Manila in the Philippines before the group is set to be split in two, with some people reportedly flying to Los Angeles and others to New York.

Ian Rintoul, of the Refugee Action Coalition, told HuffPost he believed the men ― among them Rohingyas, Afghans and Pakistanis ― would be settled in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and unspecified parts of North Carolina.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

This is the second contingent of refugees to be transferred to the U.S. under a resettlement agreement between the Obama administration and the Australian government in 2016. Last September, 50 people being held on Manus and Nauru islands were also moved.

Australia’s hard-line immigration policies include sending people seeking asylum by boat to offshore detention camps for processing, with successive governments pledging that nobody arriving by boat can ever be resettled in Australia. Refugees are permitted to resettle in either Papua New Guinea or Nauru, but have no prospect of being admitted to Australia. The U.S. resettlement deal was seen as a way to get refugees off the poor and under-resourced Pacific islands without allowing them into Australia.

“It was a bittersweet moment for the refugees who, on the one hand, are happy to be gaining the freedom that Australia denied them more than four years ago, but on the other, they remain extremely concerned for those that are being left behind,” Rintoul said.

The Refugee Action Coalition shared a statement from one of the refugees, who said he was “very happy to be free of the hell that the Australian government made for us on Manus.”

“But we are sad for those who are still waiting so long. We can’t stop thinking of everyone who are still on Manus. We all need freedom,” the unidentified man added.

The resettlement arrangement was the subject of an early, infamous phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last January, where Trump called the arrangement under his predecessor “an embarrassment,” “rotten” and “stupid.”

Referring to the refugees, Trump asked, “Are they going to become the Boston bomber in five years?” according to a transcript of the conversation published by The Washington Post.

In the conversation and a later tweet, Trump appeared to be unaware of the scope of the deal, claiming he had “heard five thousand” people were to be involved. Turnbull stated that the deal was for up to 1,250 refugees.

Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017

Refugees from Australia’s other offshore facility, on the Pacific island of Nauru, are also involved in the resettlement deal. On Monday, around 500 of them ― men, women and children who had not yet been allowed to leave ― signed a letter to the Australian government asking for more information on their status.

Rintoul said U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials were currently on Nauru assessing claims, but were not providing any updates.

“We have no answers about what will happen to our future. Our lives are in limbo,” the letter read.

“We are getting more helpless and hopeless. More people are becoming mentally sick. More people are self-harming from despair ... we demand [the government] provides us with full information about the US deal and when the next group of people will go to the US.”

Rintoul said he expected another group of people from Nauru, up to 130 refugees, to be transferred to the U.S. sometime next month, but said they had received no concrete information about their status.

He also said the Trump administration’s controversial travel ban on people from largely Muslim-majority countries was affecting the deal. Many of the families on Nauru are from Iran or Somalia, two countries named in the travel ban, meaning they will almost certainly not be eligible for U.S. resettlement.

“The consequence of the ban is that the vast majority of families will be left behind,” Rintoul said.

TOKYO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - One man was killed and at least 11 people injured, some critically, when rocks from an erupting volcano rained down on skiers at a mountain resort in central Japan on Tuesday and an avalanche soon after the eruption engulfed about a dozen skiers.

Six of those trapped were members of Japan’s Ground Self Defence Force (SDF) engaged in winter training maneuvers, Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said.

All were rescued but most were injured and one of them later died, the Defence Ministry said.

Japanese media reported that at least 12 people were injured, many apparently hit by volcanic rocks. Two were critically injured and three seriously, national broadcaster NHK said.

One person was trapped in the avalanche for some time before being dug out by rescuers, who included SDF members.

Kusatsu-Shirane, a 2,160-meter (7,090 ft) volcano, erupted on Tuesday morning, the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. The agency warned that further eruptions could not be ruled out and that rocks could be thrown as far as 2 km (1 mile) from the peak.

Video footage from the top of the resort’s gondola showed skiers gliding down the slopes as black rocks plummeted from the skies and snow billowed up as they struck the ground, sometimes just missing skiers. A cloud of black smoke later drifted in.

“There was this huge boom, and a big plume of totally black smoke rose up,” one skier told NHK. “I had absolutely no idea what had happened.”

A photograph taken at the site and shown on NHK depicted a gondola with a shattered window. At least several of the injuries were due to broken glass.

“Other people appeared to be hurt by the stones, which appeared to be around 10 to 20 cm in size,” another skier told NHK.

The resort temporarily lost power, leaving a number of skiers suspended in gondolas for around half an hour until they resumed moving. Around 80 skiers at a hut at the top of the mountain were awaiting rescue, which began by helicopter on Tuesday afternoon.

It was unclear whether the avalanche was caused by the volcanic activity but they occurred nearly simultaneously.

The warning level for the peak was raised to 3, meaning that people should not climb the mountain, the JMA said.In cities and towns around the world, car exhaust, coal-burning stoves, factories and farms are among the causes that add to the urgent problem of air pollution ― a risk to public health that research shows is linked to around one in six deaths globally.

As part of a new series, mayors from some of the world’s major metropolises told HuffPost about the unique challenges of reducing smog, soot and other pollutants that threaten the safety of their cities, calling on everyone to do more to protect the air we breathe.

Although the challenges are immense, the mayors argue that there’s no time to waste. As major cities have become frontline spaces in the fight against climate change and air pollution, mayors and city officials have become some of the most prominent advocates for environmental protections.

“We know we have a lot more to do. It’s going to take a lot of resources. It’s going to take public education. It’s going to take community organizing. But this is the way of the future if we’re going to save our Earth,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The growing research highlighting the deadly and debilitating risks of living with air pollution has spurred many city leaders around the world to launch initiatives and push for new laws to reduce dangerous emissions.

Breathing in air pollutants can lead to heart disease, respiratory problems, stroke and a range of other fatal illnesses, as well as greatly reduce the quality of life for people living without clean air. Air pollution is linked to millions of premature deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization, including tens of thousands in the United States alone.

“The battle against climate change is a challenge that concerns every one of us: It is a matter of public health and preservation of the planet,” said Manuela Carmena, the mayor of Madrid.

It’s a problem that especially hurts the world’s most vulnerable groups, including children in developing countries like Bangladesh and Somalia, where air pollution is linked to over one in four deaths. But air pollution is also a universal issue that every country must address as an environmental and public health risk, and in recent years scenes like the Eiffel Tower being shrouded in smog have shown that no city is immune to its effects.

“In London – one of the richest and most well-resourced cities on earth – it’s shameful this problem has been ignored for so long,” said London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan. “It is a scandal that air pollution claims the lives of thousands every year and that children have been allowed to grow up in our capital with stunted lungs, while no meaningful action has been taken to safeguard their health.”HuffPost Illustration

Air pollution may be a global problem, but it’s one where local action makes a big difference.

Across the nation, cities like Houston are stepping up to address air pollution and air quality, often in the face of inaction by state and federal governments. City Hall is the first call most residents make when they face a problem, and for good reason. City government is closest to the people, and it is, by nature, the most responsive. Cities have the responsibility to do everything in their power to protect the air our residents breathe.

The legal limits of that power will always be a challenge. A regular struggle for many cities, including Houston, is the issue of jurisdiction, or what cities have the power to regulate. Industries located in cities may be regulated by state agencies that are less tied to the community, and cities may have no direct control over where these industries locate their facilities. And this is where cities must get creative to bring about change.

In many cases, it is simply being an advocate for people affected. These facilities don’t open in poor neighborhoods just because the land is cheap. They locate there because the people are too often voiceless. It’s up to city officials to give them a voice.

Concrete batch plants, which prepare concrete for construction, present a significant environmental justice issue in Houston. Concrete batch plants emit cement dust and other particulates into the air, which can cause respiratory problems for nearby residents. We have more concrete batch plants in the Houston area than anywhere else in Texas: There are nearly 20 of these plants within a four-mile radius in the Sunnyside/Hiram Clarke area in the southern part of Houston, a historically economically disadvantaged area.

These facilities are regulated at the state level by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which regulates air quality and issues permits allowing them to operate. The City of Houston has no control over these plants or the TCEQ. All we have is a voice in the process, and we must work hard to ensure that our voice is heard.

Whenever a new concrete batch plant opens in a neighborhood, you can be sure the TCEQ will hear from me. Since taking office in 2016, I have protested new permits sought by concrete batch plants and am awaiting the decisions.

Cities must also get creative with the powers that we do have at our disposal to fight concrete batch plants and other facilities that pose a threat to air quality. Houston’s Health Department receives 800 to 1,000 complaints about air quality every year. If an investigation determines a threat, the Health Department and legal departments of the City of Houston pursue every avenue to protect our residents, including use of the nuisance law and permitting requirements.

“Cities can lead the way on climate change, even when the levels of government above us will not.”

The power of cities to make positive change on air pollution goes beyond affecting the quality of the air in our neighborhoods. Air pollutants released in carbon-based energy production are a major factor in human-caused climate change.

Cities can lead the way on climate change, even when the levels of government above us will not. Houston may be known as an oil and gas city, but we are also leading the way on renewable energy. And we put our money where our mouth is. Houston is the largest municipal purchaser of renewable energy in the nation, and we have been recognized by the U.S. EPA three times in the past decade for renewable energy leadership. Last year we launched a 50-megawatt solar power agreement, bringing clean energy to the Houston zoo, airport terminals and municipal buildings across the city.

As co-chair of Climate Mayors, I helped rally nearly 400 mayors across the nation to vow that our cities would continue to honor the Paris Agreement. Together, Climate Mayors are working on projects to speed the adoption of electric vehicles and protect the Clean Power Plan. Most importantly, we are working to empower mayors from states red and blue and cities big and small to lead healthy, vibrant cities.

If 2017 taught us anything, it is that we must be prepared for a changing climate. We are still recovering from Hurricane Harvey in Houston and will be for some time. Rising oceanic temperatures caused by climate change will result in more powerful hurricanes occurring more frequently. The residents of coastal cities in Houston are among those who will suffer the consequences if we don’t change course.
