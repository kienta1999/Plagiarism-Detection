Chrissy Teigen and family are “in love” with their new baby boy.

The cookbook author and supermodel announced the arrival of her second child with husband John Legend on Thursday morning, simply stating on Twitter that “Somebody’s herrrrrrre!” alongside a pair of baby bottle emojis.

Teigen has stayed away from social media since then, except to answer a fan’s question about whether the newborn looks like his big sister, Luna, whom the couple welcomed in 2016.

“Same nose! He is a few weeks early so he’s litttttttle and makes the teeniest noises,” she wrote on Friday. “We are in love.”

Teigen revealed during an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in February that the baby was due in June.

“I’m having a baby boy in the spring,” she told the talk show host. “I’ll tell you — it’s June!”

The couple has yet to announce the baby’s name or share a photo of the child, but updates could be on their way soon. Just three days after giving birth to Luna, Teigen posted a first look of her daughter cradled in her arms.

The 32-year-old told DeGeneres she was struggling to pick a name for the baby, considering Legend has requested that they not name the baby after him.

“John and his ego was like, ‘I don’t want him to feel like he has to live up to that,’” she said. “And I was like, ‘Wow, you are a jerk.’”

“Boy names are really tough and I don’t think he will even have a middle name because we can’t even come up with a first name,” she added.

AdvertisementThe Trump Store, run by the family of President Donald Trump, tried to troll late-night host Jimmy Kimmel on social media on Thursday.

It didn’t go as they had hoped.

On “Jimmy Kimmel Live” earlier this week, Kimmel bought ― and mocked ― a bunch of Trump Store merchandise, pretty much all of which was made overseas despite the president’s “Buy American” slogan.

Kimmel also said he planned to file a complaint about two of his purchases, which didn’t list a country of origin, an omission that could lead to fines if the products were made overseas.

The store took to Twitter to retaliate against Kimmel’s segment:

Hey @JimmyKimmel, it appears you make an even better salesman than comedian – Thanks for the pitch! https://t.co/uw6A6RS81n pic.twitter.com/1ih2mREDpx — Trump Store (@TrumpStore) March 15, 2018

Kimmel fired back:

You are most welcome and, may I say, the Chinese do a BEAUTIFUL job making your products! @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump https://t.co/te6L2pNkw0 — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) March 15, 2018

He wasn’t the only one who thought the Trump Store’s tweet rang hollow:

Practice what you preach, Trumps. Make your products in The USA. — Paul Geoghegan (@PaulGeogheganNY) March 15, 2018It is not hard to find a list of the many, stupid ways Larry Kudlow has been wrong about major economic calls in the past quarter century. He has a childlike faith in the power of tax cuts and is a committed Republican partisan, both of which drive him to say consistently outlandish things. He celebrated the dot-com bubble heights of the stock market as a triumph of Reaganomics, denied the existence of a housing bubble during the George W. Bush years, insisted the Great Recession was not a recession, claimed Barack Obama’s stimulus package would usher in raging inflation, and so on.

Such unflagging technocratic incompetence makes Kudlow ― a former Bear Stearns economist better known as a CNBC personality ― an excellent fit for the bumbling Donald Trump administration. But Kudlow shares an even deeper spiritual connection with elite Republicans embarrassed by their party’s current standard-bearer: He worships wealth. And more than any other policy idea or political principle, public reverence for the rich has been the central organizing concept of the Republican Party from Barry Goldwater through Trump. Kudlow’s nomination to serve as the next director of the National Economic Council is an efficient distillation of a half-century of conservative thinking.

Kudlow is not, as he and some of his fiercest critics insist, a “supply-side” economist who believes tax cuts cure all ills. For Kudlow, tax cuts are merely instrumental. They are “the key to prosperity and freedom,” as he subtitled one of his books, because they are a simple, sure-fire way to elevate stock values.

Kudlow believes the stock market to be the ultimate measure of human progress. His economic commentary and analysis typically reduces all of social existence to one simple quantitative metric, enabling him to ignore or even celebrate every other accompanying evil. This is most explicitly stated in his semi-infamous 2002 National Review column urging Bush to invade Iraq. “The shock therapy of decisive war will elevate the stock market by a couple-thousand points,” Kudlow declared.

During the Cold War, such straightforward enthusiasm for war profiteering would have been laughed off as Leninist propaganda (Lenin believed imperialism to be the last phase of capitalism before its inevitable collapse). But Kudlow was perfectly sincere. He saw the stock market as a “manifestation of the pained expressions on our faces” and wanted a “small war” to “revive the American spirit.”

Kudlow expressed similar sentiments about the Bill Clinton presidency. When Clinton raised taxes on the highest-earning households in 1993, Kudlow called it a ”wet blanket″ that would impede growth. By the end of the Clinton presidency, however, he was declaring the previous eight years an economic victory … for Ronald Reagan. This was revealed not by looking at economic growth, or unemployment or wage levels, but by a quick glance at the stock market. According to Kudlow, the Clinton-era prosperity had really started much earlier ― the Gipper had ushered in an 18-year bull market on Wall Street. And for once, Kudlow missed an opportunity to score partisan points against Clinton. The Democratic president’s welfare reform doubled severe poverty in America, and the low unemployment of the late 1990s was built on a stock market bubble.

The stock market, of course, is not a measure of national prosperity. It doesn’t tell us very much about the financial health of individual companies, much less how families are making ends meet. It is only incidentally related to the way corporations raise capital, which is why the high priest of Enlightenment economics, Adam Smith, had nothing to say about it. But the stock market is a pretty good way to gauge how the wealthiest Americans are doing day to day. Over 85 percent of all stock market wealth is owned by the richest 10 percent of households. When the market goes up, those people get richer. When it goes down, the opposite happens. And Kudlow is quite open about his belief that rich people are the best people.

“Wealthy folks have no need to steal or engage in corruption,” Kudlow wrote in December 2016. “Their business success demonstrates that they know how to achieve goals.”

While wealth comes from personal excellence, poverty “is caused by family breakup,” Kudlow told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2016. “The problem is American values, traditional American values, and the decline of the culture of family and marriage.”

Economists often talk as if they are merely scientific experts analyzing cold, statistical certainties. While there are some numerical truths to be accessed in economic data-mining, economists are first and foremost warriors in the realm of political ideas. They use money and numbers to tell ideological stories about politics and values. So Kudlow deserves some credit for being open about the roots of his economic faith. He thinks the rich are better than you.Geoffrey the Giraffe is done sticking out his neck for Toys R Us.

The longtime mascot appeared pretty drunk and sad when he stopped by “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Thursday, one day after the chain announced plans to liquidate.

“It’s gonna be OK,” Kimmel said.

But Geoffrey wasn’t having it. “No, it’s not,” he responded, turning his attention to the audience, “because all you bitches bought toys on Amazon. Now I’m out of a job.”Police officers in southwest England said they were “lapping it up” after a truck spilled its load of milk on a main road.

No one was injured when the vehicle carrying thousands of bottles of the white stuff shed its cargo at a roundabout on the A40 highway near Gloucester at 9:05 p.m. local time Thursday.

Gloucestershire Police shared photographs of the area blanketed in crates, bottles and spilled milk:

With no serious consequences from the incident, Twitter users saw the humorous side of the situation and shared jokes:

The record-breaking arc was seen Nov. 30 last year in the skies over Chinese Culture University near Taipei. It lasted a whopping eight hours and 58 minutes, according to science professor Chou Kun-hsuan.

“It was amazing. … It felt like a gift from the sky. ... It’s so rare!” he told the BBC back in November.

Guinness World Records agreed and will officially declare the rainbow the longest ever recorded at a ceremony at the university on Saturday, according to Taiwan News.

The Taipei area rainbow handily beat the former record-holder, which arched for six hours over Wetherby, Yorkshire, on March 14, 1994.

Rainbows typically last less than an hour. Chou told the BBC he knew he was seeing something special around the four-hour mark and notified students and faculty to take pictures.

“When we broke the previous record after passing six hours, I was hardly able to stay seated for lunch,” he said. “I was so excited. I wanted to make sure we captured the rainbow. But then it did something even more incredible ― it went on to beat the previous record by another three hours!”

The university’s main campus is located in the Yangmingshan mountain range. Conditions common to its winter microclimate are being credited for the rainbow’s longevity, including a cloud-forming northeast monsoon, sunlight and relatively low wind speeds, according to the Straits Times.Reddit has an entire “Shower Thoughts” subreddit dedicated to “the miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.” In honor of those weird, wonderful and sometimes profound musings, here are 25 of the best posts from the last week:When Thomas Hofeller travelled across the country at the beginning of the decade to talk to lawmakers about the redistricting process, he brought a warning: “Don’t get cute.”

Republicans were fresh off a remarkably successful effort to take control of state legislatures so they could control the redistricting process ― a significant victory, because redistricting is normally only done every 10 years. Hofeller, a veteran Republican redistricting consultant and mapmaker, cautioned lawmakers against drawing “stupid irregularities” in boundaries obviously contorted to include voters likely to support them, The Atlantic reported.

But in 2011, Republicans were focused on maximizing every possible advantage they could squeeze out of the redistricting project, and saw an opportunity to entrench their control of at least 20 seats in the U.S. House. They took it.

Republicans have since enjoyed considerable advantage from those maps. According to an estimate by the Brennan Center for Justice, Republican gerrymandering accounts for 16 or 17 GOP seats in the current Congress that the party may not otherwise control.

But now, that gerrymandering greed of Republicans is coming back to haunt them.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January struck down the congressional map state Republicans drew, saying it was so partisan that it violated the state constitution. That same month, a panel of three federal judges struck down North Carolina’s congressional map. In October, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in a Wisconsin case may set a standard for defining unconstitutional gerrymandering on partisan grounds. (The court also will consider a case challenging a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland at the end of March.)

As these legal contests settle out, it’s worth looking back on how the GOP got here.

The reckoning Republicans are seeing now is one that could have been avoided, lawyers and redistricting experts say, had the GOP not been so ruthless.

Both Democrats and Republicans have gerrymandered in the past to their advantage, but Republicans took it to a new level in 2011. In an amicus brief to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, political science professors Keith Gaddie and Bernard Grofman wrote that there was as much as three times more partisan bias in congressional maps this decade than in ones drawn in 2000. Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor at the University of Chicago helping challenge a Wisconsin map, said a “dramatic number” of the worst gerrymanders of the last half-century have occurred since 2010.

Until the courts began stepping in, Republican gerrymandering paid off. From 2012 to 2016, the GOP won 13 of Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional seats, even though the party’s candidates only got around half of the vote. In Ohio, the party consistently won 12 of 16 congressional seats, but 50 percent of the statewide vote. In Wisconsin, they won at least 60 of 99 state assembly seats, with about half of the popular vote.

As a lawyer, Stephanopoulos said the clear egregiousness of the Republican redistricting made it easier to show something was amiss. It would have been harder to make a case, he said, if Republicans had only been winning slim majorities.

“In Wisconsin, if Republicans had been winning a narrow majority of the statehouse with roughly a tied election, Democrats would have been upset by that, but it probably wouldn’t have risen to a major constitutional challenge,” Stephanopoulos said.

Republican mapmakers in 2011 may have been emboldened by a 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case in which justices declined to strike down Pennsylvania’s congressional plan on partisan grounds.

Republicans could have been cautious. They could have drawn maps that benefitted their party, but at the same time were fairer, compact and contiguous, said Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues. The Constitution gives state lawmakers the broad responsibility of drawing electoral districts, and the GOP maps would have stood up better against judicial scrutiny had lawmakers offered public justification in their legislatures for the boundaries, Wice added.

“You can draw a plan to benefit a party, but do so in a fair way through a more transparent, objective process that follows criteria,” Wice said. “If politicians weren’t as greedy and secretive, then we wouldn’t be seeing as many challenges to plans for the egregious overreaching in the last round.”

In many cases, Republicans didn’t offer a defensible justification. In North Carolina, a Republican said his party’s lawmakers drew a map that gave Republicans a 10-3 advantage because he didn’t see a way to draw one that was 11-2. In Wisconsin, GOP lawmakers sought to avoid scrutiny by hiring a law firm to draw the maps, hoping the work would be hidden by attorney-client privilege.

Without a public explanation for the redrawn boundaries, it’s easier for those challenging the maps to claim Republicans intended to dilute Democratic votes.

Michael Li, redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center, pointed to the GOP-drawn congressional map in Pennsylvania as a good example of a brazen Republican attempt to maximize control. The districts were clearly contorted into odd-looking shapes, and there was no attempt to explain why ― other than partisan advantage.

“The 2011 map in Pennsylvania resulted in such contorted districts, it was hard to explain away as product of neutral decisions, such as about keeping towns or counties together. It just was so nakedly partisan,” Li said in an email. ”That’s not to say a map that was less contorted couldn’t have been challenged if it also produced durable bias in favor of a party. But at least there would be a colorable defense that a court would have to take seriously.”

Such strong evidence also could make it more palatable for courts to wade into political redistricting ― a topic the judiciary had long avoided.

“The courts are going to police outlier cases, rather than trying to wade into each and every one,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “The same principle’s true in any kind of discrimination: The more blatant, the easier it is to establish, and the more likely the courts are to call it out.”

Even if the Supreme Court does decide Republicans went too far with gerrymandering, its anticipated ruling in the spring would likely come too late to affect this year’s congressional elections, and wouldn’t have an impact on maps until at least 2020. Even if Republicans lose the ability to gerrymander in the future, their ruthlessness will have helped them for nearly an entire decade.Jenna Jameson took to Instagram on Thursday to share her heartfelt thoughts on motherhood, breastfeeding, and how her childhood affected her relationship with her own children.

In addition to mentioning how she grew up without a mother and with an absentee father, the former adult film star says motherhood is her “calling” in the caption and says she hopes she’s the mother to her daughter, Batel Lu, that she had dreamed of for herself.

The photo is accompanied by the hashtags #dropthecover and #normalizebreastfeeding.

A post shared by Jenna Jameson (@jennacantlose) on Mar 15, 2018 at 11:24am PDT

The movement to normalize breastfeeding has been happening to various extents for decades. Celebrities like Pink, Maya Rudolph, Olivia Wilde and many more have taken to social media to share their experiences with their children in an effort to remove the stigma associated with the act.

Jameson has never been shy about posting photos of her breastfeeding, frequently sharing her trials and tribulations with fans.

In one post earlier this month, she mentioned how she hadn’t “slept for two days” and Batel had been “vomiting every 40 min like clockwork,” adding that she and her daughter were “in this together.”

“So here’s to all of you selfless mamas out there, you make this world go round,” the caption reads.

A post shared by Jenna Jameson (@jennacantlose) on Mar 6, 2018 at 2:40pm PSTThe mother of Stephanie Clifford, aka porn actress Stormy Daniels, is very concerned about the pending legal battle between her daughter and President Donald Trump.

But it’s not because she fears something might happen to her little girl. It’s Trump she’s worried about.

“If Mr. Trump runs four more times, I would vote for him every time,” Sheila Gregory told the Dallas Morning News this week. “I like him. I like the way he handles things. It’s time this country is put back where it belongs — taking care of the people here instead of the people who don’t belong here.”

Gregory said she hadn’t spoken to Clifford in 12 years, coincidentally going back to around the time the actress said she had her affair with Trump.

The two have apparently never discussed the affair. The 64-year-old Gregory said her daughter stopped talking to her and she doesn’t know why.

“It hurts me deeply,” she said. “My friends all say the same thing: ‘I can’t believe that is the same sweet child — you took such good care of her.’”

“I say, ‘How do you think I feel?’”

Clifford’s estranged dad, Bill Gregory, is also feeling torn between his concern for his daughter and his love for Trump.

“I see her in the news — everything that’s going on — it’s hard,” he told Inside Edition this week. “It’s become a real mess, looks like to me. I like Trump and I like my daughter. I don’t want to pick sides. It’s unfortunate that it’s gotten to this point.”

Bill Gregory divorced Sheila Gregory when Clifford was about 4, and he admits he didn’t have much contact after that. He said father and daughter have not spoken in 20 years.

But when prompted by Inside Edition, Bill Gregory couldn’t help but offer some fatherly advice.

“Be very careful,” he said. “When you start challenging powerful people with a lot of money, they can ruin your life.”Alec Baldwin almost has enough players for a Baldwinitos basketball team.

Some on the conservative network even said he should get a Nobel Peace Prize if he makes a deal.

Barack Obama said he was willing to meet “not just with our friends, but with our enemies,” many on Fox News ― including some of those same personalities ― slammed him for it.Anderson Cooper and his boyfriend of nine years, Benjamin Maisani, broke up, the CNN host told People on Thursday.

In a statement to the magazine, Cooper said, “Benjamin and I separated as boyfriends some time ago. We are still family to each other, and love each other very much.” He added that the pair “remain the best of friends, and will continue to share much of our lives together.”

The couple was photographed together last year at Cooper’s Brazilian vacation home for the July issue of Architectural Digest. In October, Cooper and Maisani spoke with Town & Country magazine about their growing art collection. According to Us Weekly, the pair had been seen together as recently as Saturday, when they attended a benefit for New York City’s The Windward School.

In a 2014 interview in the publication French Morning, Maisani, a nightclub owner, spoke of how he avoided the limelight while dating Cooper.

“I understand that it interests people, but it doesn’t interest me,” Maisani said of dating a celebrity, according to People. “I knew I’d have to be careful right from the start before it had a chance to get out of hand.”

As a result, the pair kept a low-key profile over the years, though there was the occasional Instagram post.Briggs & Riley Baseline Suiter Duffel Bag

Summer is undoubtedly a popular time for Americans to travel. With kids out of school and office environments a little more relaxed, it seems only natural to use your vacation days and get out of town.

But the big question is: Where should you go? Obviously, the possibilities are endless, but there are also certain places you might not want to visit between June and August. Most major European cities, for example, are overwhelmingly crowded during the summer, and many establishments shut down in August as locals leave town. And traveling in parts of Asia can be less than ideal, thanks to very high temperatures and humidity levels.

HuffPost asked some travel experts for recommendations of where not to go in the summer ― and when they would suggest visiting those places instead.

Paris

“Summer is the high season for the French capital, with expensive hotel rooms, tons of tourists and ridiculously long lines to museums. March and October are better times to go. The weather may be a bit colder but the lines are much shorter! If you’re looking for old-world European glamour, art and culture during the summer, go to Vienna instead. Bonus: You can take a tram to the many wineries that surround the city.” ― Jessica van Dop, travel media specialist and blogger at The Dining Traveler

Thailand

“I lived in Thailand for two years, and from May/June to October, the weather would change drastically. It would rain every day for hours to the point that flooding pictures would be seen all over my Facebook. The islands ― Koh Phi Phi, Koh Tao and Phuket ― are very popular travel destinations, and they receive the worst rain during those months. I had a lot of family members and friends try to visit me during American summer, and I spent a lot of those visits apologizing for the weather because it affected our plans. A great time to visit Thailand is November to February. It is known to be their winter and high season for travelers. It has perfect beach weather and lots of open activities to do on the water. However, I have also been Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia during those rainy season months and the rain didn’t effect or disrupt any of my plans.” ― Tosin Idowu, educator and travel vlogger

Ibiza

“If you’re traveling with kids and want a peaceful beach, the south of Ibiza is not a great choice. I would recommend going in May or September. You’ll have lovely weather and the beaches to yourself.” ― Laura Hall, director of communications at Kid & Coe, a family-friendly vacation rental service

Southern Africa

“Visiting much of Africa will result in similar weather year-round if you stay close to the equator, but if you are thinking of visiting southern Africa, remember they have opposite seasons, so our winter is their summer. You do not want to explore Cape Town wearing a parka, so save a visit to southern Africa for December to March, their summer.” ― Jessica Nabongo, founder of boutique travel agency Jet Black and travel blogger at The Catch Me If You Can

Venice

“Venice, Italy gets very, very busy. Any time after September, it’s a lot less crowded and you’ll have the canals to yourself” ― Hall

And Pretty Much The Rest Of Italy

“Ferragosto (which comes from ‘Festivals of Emperor Augustus’) is the Italian holiday on Aug. 15 of each year, coinciding with the Assumption of Mary, a Roman Catholic holiday. Many families and businesses close up shop and head to the mountains or beaches for fun and summer heat relief. You’ll find several restaurants closed, even in big cities like Rome. ... August welcomes blazing hot temperatures throughout Italy. If you are sensitive to the heat, it is not an ideal time to go. I would recommend May or October, which are filled with great spring and harvest festivals, milder temperatures and less tourists. December and January are recommended for those who prefer colder temperatures and Christmas markets. February is great for ‘Carnival Collectors,’ since many carnival celebrations are held in cities and villages throughout the boot.” ― Lisa Vogele, a travel consultant, author and blogger

Agra

“Tempting as it may sound to lay eyes on the Taj Mahal over your summer vacation, resist the urge! Summer in India, which lasts from April until June, can see scorching temperatures of more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) ― not the best weather for jostling with hundreds of other tourists as touts try to part you and your money. After June, the monsoon season begins, raining until September or so. Though a bit cooler than summer, torrential downpours and sticky humidity aren’t the best ingredients for an idyllic summer vacation. Instead of sweating it out at the Taj in summer, schedule your Indian adventure in October or November. An explosion of greenery follows the monsoon, and temperatures will drop back down to a balmy 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit ). The Taj Mahal is beautiful all year-round, but you’ll appreciate it much more if you don’t have to wipe a waterfall of sweat from your eyes to see it.” ― Alex Reynolds, travel blogger at Lost With Purpose

Miami

“If you’re craving a bit of beach time, Miami may come on top of your list. However, the hot balmy weather may not be as fun, even the water is lukewarm in the summer months! Instead go to Puerto Rico. The island needs visitors more than ever after suffering from Hurricane Maria. You have gorgeous beaches with a nice Caribbean breeze. If you’re more of a mountain person, head to the center of the island and explore the many local hiking trails, with a view of the ocean.” ― van Dop

Scottish Highlands

“If you’re planning a summer holiday in the Highlands of Scotland, make sure you go prepared. The Scottish midge season is at its height in July and August, so you’ll need to keep skin covered and wear insect repellant to avoid being bitten. Or, alternatively, you could visit in September or October, when the changing color of the trees adds to the beauty of the scenery, and the midges are not so vicious.” ― Sally Akins, travel and food blogger

Seville

“Andalucia’s charm is well-known all over the world. Passionate flamenco dances, mouth-watering tapas and warm sunny days ― those are the main factors that attract people to visit Seville, the seductive capital of Andalucia. Moreover, Seville strikes with jaw-dropping architecture, a result of the Moorish influence in the region, and a pure Spanish spirit. Not to mention those lovely orange trees on the streets. However, in order to enjoy your Andalucian fairy tale, do not go there in summer. In July and August, the temperature hits 104 degrees Fahrenheit and might cause serious health consequences. Instead, visit Seville in spring or autumn for the best experience.” ― Evelina Radoycheva, travel blogger at Little Big Traveler

Martha’s Vineyard

“I have always found that tourist-filled Martha’s Vineyard is much, much better in September. The water is warmer! That’s true for Nantucket and the Cape. These days the closing-up date is always Columbus Day in early October, when a final mini-surge of visitors is guaranteed.” ― Max Hartshorne, editor of the travel website GoNOMAD.com

South, Southeast and East Asia

“South, Southeast and East Asia should definitely be off your list for summer unless you are a glutton for temperatures that reach above 100 degrees, coupled with humidity of above 80 percent. The best time to visit these regions are early fall and late spring.” ― Nabongo

Marrakesh

“It gets very hot and very busy. Visit in spring or autumn for sunny days but cooler nights ― and a little bit of elbow room in the bazaars to yourself.” ― Hall

Amsterdam

“Amsterdam is another overcrowded European city during the summer months. The locals (I have a lot of friends in Amsterdam) try to escape the madness that the summer brings. If you still want the Dutch experience, stay in Rotterdam. This modem Dutch city is the perfect place for the lovers of modern architectural with masterpieces such as the Markthal and Erasmus Bridge.” ― van Dop

Tulum

“Far enough away from Cancun to forget about the throngs of tourists, Tulum embodies a back-to-basics ethos, with a real ‘no shoes, no problem’ kind of vibe. There’s a lot to love about this little piece of paradise. From the perfection of the pristine beaches to the hotels, restaurants and bars, everything in Tulum emits a certain boho-rustic (yet incredibly chic) vibe, which defines the culture of this beautifully free-spirited community. All of this being said, Tulum is best enjoyed from October to February, just when you’re up to your knees in snowfall and in need of a little vitamin D. We suggest avoiding a visit during the summer months when the heat can (at times) become unbearable and the tropical weather is most unpredictable.” ― Molly McCorkle, senior editor of AHotelLife.comPope Francis, right, greets Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI at St. Peter's Basilica on Feb. 14, 2015.

The Vatican has admitted that it digitally blurred out a portion of a media handout photo of a letter in a way that The Associated Press claims alters the image’s significance and violates the standards of photojournalism.

The photo was released on Monday by the Vatican’s communications office, one day before the fifth anniversary of Pope Francis’ election and a few weeks after Francis condemned the spread of fake news as “evil” in a message to journalists.

The photo, shown below, is of a Feb. 7 letter from the retired Pope Benedict XVI to the Vatican’s chief of communications, Monsignor Dario Vigano. In the letter, Benedict responds to Vigano’s request that he review a new volume of books about Pope Francis’ theology. But a blurred portion of the letter reveals that Benedict told him he didn’t have time to complete the request.

In the part of the letter that is more visible in the photo, Benedict writes that the new book series is evidence of the “foolish prejudice” of Francis’ critics. He adds that the books demonstrate the “interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.”

The letter was reportedly read out in full by Vigano during a news conference. According to AP, Vigano appeared to use it to repudiate Francis’ critics who claim his papal style is a significant departure from that of his predecessor.

However, at the very end of the letter, Benedict appears to state that he hasn’t read the entire 11-part book series and, as a result, won’t be able to deliver a sound theological assessment.

On Wednesday, the Vatican told AP that it had blurred the final two lines of the first page ― the part where Benedict starts to explain that he didn’t actually read the new book project. The spokesman didn’t explain why the lines were blurred but said that the Vatican never intended for the full letter to be released.

Vatican officials did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Edward Pentin, a Vatican expert and Rome correspondent for the National Catholic Register, published an English translation of Benedict’s full letter online. According to Pentin, Benedict tells Vigano that he doesn’t feel like writing a theological assessment on the books because “throughout my life it has always been clear that I would write and express myself only on books I had read really well.”

“Unfortunately, if only for physical reasons, I am unable to read the eleven volumes in the near future, especially as other commitments await me that I have already made.”

Photographs of My Lai by Ron Haeberle

This story originally appeared on FOTO.

Ron Haeberle was a combat photographer in Vietnam when he and the Army unit he was riding with — Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment — landed near the hamlet of My Lai on the morning of March 16, 1968. Villagers weren’t alarmed; American GIs had visited the region near the central Vietnamese coast before, without incident. But within minutes, the troops opened fire. Over the course of the next few hours, they killed old men, women, and children. They raped and tortured. They razed the village. And when Haeberle’s shocking photographs of their atrocities were published — more than a year later — the pictures laid bare an appalling truth: American “boys” were as capable of unbridled savagery as any soldiers, anywhere.

To mark the 50th anniversary of the massacre, I spoke with Haeberle — in an exclusive interview, at his home in Ohio — about that March morning; the routine Army operation that devolved into a waking nightmare; and how his photos changed the course of the war in Vietnam.

Bettmann Archive

I first met Ron Haeberle in 2009 when I was a reporter at the Cleveland Plain Dealer — the newspaper that, in November 1969, first published his My Lai photos. I was assigned to write a story on the 40th anniversary of that landmark exposé, and while much had previously been written about the Plain Dealer reporter who wrote the article that ran alongside Haeberle's photos — Joe Eszterhas, later the screenwriter of "Basic Instinct" and other controversial films — I found almost nothing about the man who took the grisly, iconic pictures at My Lai. Was he still alive? Did he still live in Ohio?

I found a name, address, and phone number, but wasn’t sure if it was the Ron Haeberle. Knowing that a reticent Haeberle might hang up if I called, I drove to the address, knocked on the door, and introduced myself. It was Ron, all right, and he graciously asked me in. I stayed at his house for two hours, as he told me about My Lai and his own life since 1968. It was his first major interview since the story broke four decades earlier. (He gave the BBC a couple of quotes in 1989, he said, and that was the extent of his contact with the press.)

Recently, FOTO asked me to approach Haeberle and ask if he would revisit the story for the 50th anniversary of the massacre. He agreed, and he and I returned to one of the darkest chapters in American history, and his role in bringing it to light.

Ron Haeberle was drafted in 1966, after attending Ohio University, where he was a photographer for the school paper. He ended up in Hawaii with the Army’s Public Information Office. By the end of 1967, it was beginning to look like his "tour" would end there — a disappointing prospect. “As a photographer, I wanted to see what was happening in Vietnam for myself," he told me. He requested a transfer, and was sent to Vietnam. At 26 years old, he was older than most members of Charlie Company, where the average age was just 20.

Charlie Company had been together for about a year before Haeberle joined it in March 1968. The unit had been in no firefights, but had lost men to booby traps and land mines. When they landed at My Lai, they were primed for action; Viet Cong troops were reported to be hiding in the hamlet. That information was wrong. But in the end, it didn't matter: My Lai was doomed. Within four hours of Charlie Company's arrival, the village's huts were burned to the ground and hundreds of civilians were dead. (The exact number of those murdered is disputed to this day, with the official American estimate running to around 350; the Vietnamese say more than 500 were killed.)

Haeberle told me that he had just met the men in his unit that morning. Almost as soon as they landed, he said, “I heard a lot of firing and thought, ‘Hell, we must be in a hot zone.’ But after a couple of minutes we weren’t taking any fire, so we started walking toward the village. I saw what appeared to be civilians. Then I saw a soldier firing at them. I could not figure out what was going on. I couldn’t comprehend it.”

The photograph of murdered villagers in My Lai appeared — in black and white, not in its original color — on the front page of the Cleveland Plain Dealer on November 20, 1969. (Haeberle took the pictures not with his Army-issued Leica camera, but with his own camera, a Nikon.) Most of the victims at My Lai were shot; some were bayoneted. Women and girls were raped, and then killed. At least one soldier later confessed to cutting out villagers’ tongues, and scalping others. Of course, My Lai was hardly the only instance of rape, torture, and murder by U.S. troops in Vietnam. But in terms of intensity and scale — and because of Haeberle’s memorable photographs — it remains the emblematic massacre of the war.

Today, Ron Haeberle lives about 40 miles from downtown Cleveland, in an attractive house on a quiet cul de sac. His home is simply furnished, clean and orderly. Original works of art by Vietnamese artists, mostly abstracts, adorn the walls. One is a delicate needlework portrait of a woman, gracefully reaching an arm toward the sky.

The suddenness of the violence at My Lai was especially terrifying. Haeberle told me that he saw an old man with two small children walking toward U.S. troops, their belongings in a basket. “The old man was shouting, ‘No VC! No VC!’ to let the soldiers know he wasn’t Viet Cong,” Haeberle recalled. To his horror, the man and the children were cut down in front of him. “A soldier shot all three,” he said.

It was more than a year after the massacre before Haeberle approached the Plain Dealer with his photos, but he had begun sharing his My Lai pictures, in slideshow talks to civic groups and even local high schools, after he returned home to northern Ohio in the spring of 1968. The first slides he showed were innocuous: troops with smiling Vietnamese kids; medics helping villagers. Then images of dead and mutilated women and children filled the screen. “There was just disbelief,” Haeberle said of the reaction. “People said, ‘No, no, no. This cannot have happened.’”

At one point in the killing spree, Haeberle and Army reporter Jay Roberts came upon a group of villagers huddled in fear after troops assaulted a number of young women. Haeberle took this photo — a tearful, frantic mother filling the center of the frame — and as he and Roberts moved on from the scene, rifle fire exploded behind them. “I thought the soldiers were interrogating them,” Haeberle told me. “Then I heard the firing. I couldn’t turn to look. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw them fall.”

Haeberle’s picture of terror and distress on these faces, young and old, in the midst of slaughter remains one of the 20th century’s most powerful photographs. When the Plain Dealer (and later, LIFE magazine) published it, along with a half-dozen others, the images graphically undercut much of what the U.S. had been claiming for years about the conduct and aims of the conflict. Anti-war protesters needed no persuading, but “average” Americans were suddenly asking, What are we doing in Vietnam?

At times, the discovery of a single body was as jarring as coming upon dozens of corpses. Walking toward a dirt road known as Route 521, Haeberle and Jay Roberts noticed a woman in the distance. “She was hiding behind a rock. I saw her stand up, then heard shots,” Haeberle told me, the scene obviously sharp in his mind’s eye 50 years later. “I knew she’d been hit because she fell back behind the rock. Later, I found her lying there and took this photo.”

Awful images, not all of them captured on camera, remain with Haeberle to this day: a soldier nonchalantly shooting a young boy; another riding a water buffalo, repeatedly stabbing it with his bayonet.

The massacre was first reported by journalist Seymour Hersh and distributed by a small wire agency, Dispatch News Service, in the second week of November 1969. (Hersh won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his work.) A week after Hersh’s article appeared in dozens of papers around the U.S., the Plain Dealer ran its own story — along with Haeberle’s photos to bolster the reports of a massacre.

Haeberle said it was an automatic response to continue taking pictures, even as the brutality escalated. “As a photographer, my role was to capture what was happening during the operation," he told me. "I did feel that what I was shooting was historic, especially the carnage. I kept thinking, 'This is not right.' It was mind-boggling." (Above: Haeberle's reflection, with camera, can be seen at the top of this picture, as he photographs a corpse in a well. A soldier had shot an old man and dumped his body. "They told me they threw him down there to poison the water supply," Haeberle said.)

Today, trying to make sense of the unfathomable, Haeberle recalls the message imparted to so many soldiers before their arrival in Vietnam. "We were told, 'Life is meaningless to these people,'" he said, leaving unspoken the rest of that sentiment: The enemy is not like us. They're not quite human.

In the photo above, American troops help a wounded comrade at My Lai. According to Haeberle, the soldier shot himself in the foot with his own gun. Haeberle can't say if the injury was a genuine accident or self-inflicted — perhaps a way to "honorably" avoid taking part in the carnage.

By the late morning of March 16th, bodies were scattered everywhere in My Lai: some, like those above, were covered with straw and set alight. Elsewhere, soldiers had herded dozens of villagers into a roadside ditch and shot them. A few children survived by hiding under corpses. “Early on, after the old man and those two children were killed, Jay Roberts and I confronted (Charlie Company Capt. Ernest) Medina," Haeberle said, "and told him what we'd seen." But Medina could not, or would not, help. Haeberle said that he and Roberts saw Medina again later, in the village, but the captain was on a field radio and would not speak to them.

Medina faced a court martial in 1971, and was acquitted. (American helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson, gunner Lawrence Colburn, and crew chief Glenn Andreotta, who arrived in the midst of the massacre, were each awarded the Soldier's Medal for heroism on the 30th anniversary of My Lai, in recognition of their attempts to intervene and save villagers' lives, while risking their own.)

Haeberle's searing photos, along with stories in the Plain Dealer and other outlets in the fall of 1969, sparked outrage and soul-searching in much of America. The Army, meanwhile, had known about the massacre from the start, and had engaged in a long (and ultimately fruitless) cover-up. Of the dozen or so officers and others in Charlie Company who eventually faced court martial, only Lt. William Calley (pictured, center) was convicted. In the spring of 1971 he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. President Richard Nixon reduced the sentence to house arrest; Calley served three and a half years in his quarters at Fort Benning, Georgia. He is the only person found guilty in military or criminal court for the atrocities at My Lai.

Ron Haeberle never sought the spotlight. But he gets some solace knowing that his pictures mattered. “Photography can be a powerful medium," he said. "It serves as evidence, as documentation. Without those photos, My Lai would have stayed hidden. Calley would not have been charged. After seeing the pictures, people had to re-think the war."

Haeberle told me that he returned to My Lai in 2011, where he met Duc Tran Van, a survivor of the massacre. Duc was eight years old in March 1968, and as Haeberle spoke with him, through an interpreter, he realized with a jolt that the woman he had photographed dead behind a rock 43 years earlier was Duc’s mother, Nguyen Thi Tau.

Duc told Haeberle that his mother urged him to run, with his 20-month-old sister, to their grandmother's house. When he heard a helicopter above them, Duc threw himself to the ground to protect his sister, who was already wounded. Haeberle had captured that moment, as well.

Duc and Haeberle have since become friends (above: Haeberle and Duc in Vietnam in 2011), and the Army veteran has visited Duc in Germany, where he now lives. “Duc has a small shrine to his family in his home,” Haeberle said. “I took the last photo of his mother. So I gave him my camera, the Nikon I used at My Lai, for the shrine.”

Haeberle is a thoughtful, plainspoken man. When I asked him if the publication of his pictures from My Lai changed the course of his own life, his response was characteristically muted. “How can we know that sort of thing?” he asked me. “What can we really know when we’re looking to the future? The photos made me more well-known than I might have been. But I just kept moving ahead.”

When Haeberle left Vietnam in 1968, he flew to his brother’s home in Seattle, overlooking Puget Sound. “I sat without moving, for six hours,” he told me. “The sky and the water were so blue — I looked out the window and just tried to let everything go.” Many others in Charlie Company turned to alcohol and drugs. A number later spoke of the guilt they felt. At least one is known to have committed suicide.

Haeberle is 76 years old, retired after years in manufacturing, divorced, with a grown daughter. He skis in winter, and kayaks in summer. An avid cyclist, he often heads west in the spring — Utah, California — for long cycling trips. He likes “feeling like an ant amid the mountains,” he said.

He has returned to Vietnam (above), and to My Lai several times, and will be there again on the 50th anniversary of the massacre. “The people in My Lai say they forgive us,” he told me. “They are a very forgiving people.” Haeberle has never regretted sharing his photos with the world. But that one act, he said, does not define his life. In his living room, 8,000 miles from My Lai, he said he’s proud that he still has “an adventurous spirit” — connecting, for example, with Duc and other survivors in Vietnam.

As he spoke, the afternoon light in Ohio was fading. “I’m still learning,” Haeberle said, “about what the world has to offer.”

—WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States slapped sanctions on 19 Russian individuals and five groups, including Moscow’s intelligence services, for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and malicious cyber attacks, the Treasury Department said on Thursday.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said there would be additional sanctions against Russian government officials and oligarchs “for their destabilizing activities.” Mnuchin did not give a timeframe for those sanctions, which he said would sever the individuals’ access to the U.S. financial system.

“The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,” Mnuchin said in a statement.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign using hacking and propaganda, an effort that eventually included attempting to tilt the race in President Donald Trump’s favor. Russia denies interfering in the election.

Those targeted by the new sanctions include the Russian nationals and entities charged on Feb. 16 by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller with conspiring to tamper in the election. The indictment said Russians adopted false online personas to push divisive messages, traveled to the United States to collect intelligence and staged political rallies while posing as Americans.

The new sanctions also include Russian intelligence services, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and six individuals working on behalf of the GRU.

Thursday’s action blocks all property of those targeted that is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits American citizens from engaging in transactions with them.

Treasury said the sanctions were also meant to counter destructive cyber attacks including the NotPetya attack that cost billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the United States. The United States and Britain last month attributed that attack to the Russian military.

Russian government hackers since at least March 2016 “have also targeted U.S. government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,” the Treasury Department statement said.

A senior administration told reporters on a conference call that Russian actors infiltrated parts of the U.S. energy sector.

“We were able to identify where they were located within those business systems and remove them from those business systems,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress, which nearly unanimously passed a new sanctions bill against Russia last summer, had criticized Trump for not punishing Moscow. The Trump administration in January did not announce sanctions against Russia, for now, under the new law.

Republican Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, welcomed the new sanctions as an important step. “But more must be done,” Royce said in a statement, promising that his committee would “keep pushing to counter Russian aggression.”

The Treasury Department said it would keep pressure on Russia for its ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine and occupy the Crimea region, as well as corruption and human rights abuses.

“The recent use of a military-grade nerve agent in an attempt to murder two UK citizens further demonstrates the reckless and irresponsible conduct of its government,” it said.

Britain, the United States, Germany and France jointly called on Russia on Thursday to explain a military-grade nerve toxin attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent in England.After initially refusing to explicitly blame Russia for the poisoning of a former spy in Britain, the Trump administration said Wednesday that the Kremlin “is responsible for the attack” — though the president himself has remained mum on the topic.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the White House agreed with U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May’s assertion that Russia was likely to blame for the poisoning, which left 66-year-old Sergei Skripal and his daughter hospitalized in the city of Salisbury earlier this month.

Speaking at a Security Council emergency session, Haley added that “immediate” action was needed to prevent similar attacks.

“If we don’t take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used,” Haley said. “They could be used here in New York or in cities of any country that sits on this council.”

The White House backed Haley’s remarks, saying it believed the Russian state was “responsible for the reckless nerve agent attack” on Skripal and his daughter, both of whom remain critically ill. May said this week that the Skripals had been poisoned with novichok, a highly toxic nerve agent developed in the former Soviet Union.

“The United States stands in solidarity with its closest ally, the United Kingdom,” the White House said in a statement, adding that it supported the U.K.’s decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats “as a just response.”

The remarks by Haley and the White House represent the strongest stance the Trump administration has taken on the issue since London identified Russia as the likely culprit.

On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced criticism for pointedly avoiding saying “Russia” while discussing the incident. That same day, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson apparently broke with the official White House narrative when he explicitly called out Moscow as a possible source of the poisoning. Tillerson was fired the next day.

Even as the White House line appears to have shifted, Trump himself has not personally blamed Russia for the attack. Trump has been lambasted in the past for his hesitance to criticize Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his government, including over alleged Russian meddling in American politics.
