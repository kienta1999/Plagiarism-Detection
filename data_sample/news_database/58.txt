In the month before he shot to death six Muslim men at a Quebec City mosque last year, Alexandre Bissonnette searched online for Donald Trump 819 times. He obsessively checked Twitter accounts of alt-right figures and Fox News pundits.

The day after the attack, 27-year-old Bissonette told a police interrogator he committed one of Canada’s worst mass shootings in decades to stop refugees from resettling in the country. He believed they’d carry out terror attacks and kill his family.

Bissonnette is currently awaiting sentence in a Quebec court after pleading guilty to six counts of first-degree murder last month. Up until the release of his online history, the full extent of his infatuation with the radical right wasn’t known. Discussions of his motive were often muddied with characterizations of him as a nerdy and isolated young man.

But experts say the evidence that has emerged during the trial highlights how in Canada, both society and law enforcement treat Islamist and far-right attackers fundamentally differently ― a dynamic that downplays the danger of the far-right.

“If Bissonnette was a jihadist attacking a church and it was found out that he Googled Anwar al-Awlaki and he Googled ISIS, that would have been the end of any discussion about motive,” said Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a counter-extremism think tank.

An Islamist-inspired attack in the U.S. or Canada is often followed by an instant public demand for information about the assailant’s links to terror groups, the media they viewed and any interactions they had with other extremists. But that’s not always the case when it comes to far-right attackers such as Bissonnette, whose actions are treated as anomalies that are the product of mental health issues.

“It’s not simply isolated cases of individuals who decide to do random things. Much like global jihadism, there is a global extreme-right movement that has its own network of writers and thinkers and activists and groups,” Amarasingam said. “It’s about time that we start thinking about these individual cases as part of that broader network as well, and see how these groups are impacting these kids.”

Despite ample evidence of Bissonnette’s political ideology and advance planning of the attack, prosecutors chose to not try him on terrorism charges. Media and the court proceedings have also heavily focused on Bissonnette’s mental health, after he claimed to be suicidal and suffering anxiety issues in his guilty plea.

A court-ordered psychiatric assessment of Bissonnette last month found him fit to stand trial. A prison social worker testified this week that rather than showing remorse, Bissonnette told her that he carried out the attack for “glory” and regretted not killing more people.

“In cases of extreme right-wing violence and terrorism, there is a stronger tendency in Western countries to look for mental health issues and an isolated individual as explanation,” said Daniel Koehler, director of the German Institute on Radicalization and De-Radicalization Studies.

Instead, experts say there should also be a focus on what kind of media and extremist networks contribute to a far-right terrorist’s radicalization. Chalking up far-right, predominately white, attackers as simply a product of isolation, bullying and mental health issues ignores important ideological factors that would be the focus in another kind of attack.

In Bissonnette’s case, it’s become clear that he feverishly sought out anti-Islam and anti-refugee viewpoints as well as information on how to commit acts of mass violence.

Along with Trump and alt-right Twitter accounts, Bissonnette looked up other mass shootings, including Dylann Roof’s 2015 killing of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina and Montreal’s 1985 École Polytechnique massacre, where Marc Lépine killed 14 women in an anti-feminist attack.

“It’s quite clear from his browser history, from all that’s been reported, that he was very much inspired and influenced by the Trump-esque rhetoric,” said Dr. Barbara Perry, professor in social science and humanities at University of Ontario Institute of Technology and expert on the far-right.

“We would be making arguments about the role of the internet in radicalization if we were looking at someone’s Islamist-inspired extremism,” Perry said. “That seems to be a little watered down in this particular case.”

Activist groups, including refugee support organizations, also said after the attack that Bissonnette was known online for harassing their members. He often also posted anti-feminist and anti-Islam views. But for years Bissonnette was written off as just another internet troll or isolated bigot, rather than someone who was potentially on a path toward extremism.

“In many respects Bissonnette’s views, not his actions obviously, are very in line with the history of Islamophobia nationally,” Perry said.Missouri lawmakers have called on Republican Gov. Eric Greitens to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct and blackmail, along with other legal turmoil.

Top Republicans from Missouri’s House and Senate released statements Tuesday calling for Greitens to resign from office. Greitens tweeted soon after that he would not.

“I will not be resigning the Governor’s office,” Greitens tweeted. “In three weeks, this matter will go to a court of law — where it belongs and where the facts will prove my innocence.”

I will not be resigning the Governor's office. In three weeks, this matter will go to a court of law—where it belongs and where the facts will prove my innocence. Until then, I will do what the people of Missouri sent me here to do: to serve them and work hard on their behalf. — Eric Greitens (@EricGreitens) April 18, 2018

The governor has been embroiled in several scandals over the past months.

Last week, a state House report revealed details from the testimony of a hairdresser Greitens had an affair with in 2015. The woman, who remained anonymous, testified before a Missouri House special investigative committee that her relations with the then-future governor were not always consensual. She accused Greitens of coercing her into oral sex and said he once slapped her.

Greitens was indicted in February on charges of first-degree felony invasion of privacy over photographs he allegedly took of the woman without her consent, which she claimed he then used to blackmail her. The governor is set to stand trial in May.

Greitens has admitted to having an extramarital affair but denied the accusations of blackmail.

On Tuesday, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley announced that Greitens may have committed a felony in connection to a separate issue, an investigation into a veterans charity Greitens had founded. Hawley said his office had uncovered evidence that Greitens may have used a donor list for the charity to later solicit donations in his 2016 campaign for governor, reported the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

“After thoughtful consideration of the findings in the House committee’s report and today’s news that the Attorney General has evidence to support another felony charge, we believe the governor needs to take responsibility for his actions,” a statement from Republican House Speaker Todd Richardson and other Missouri House representatives read. “The time has come for the governor to resign.”

A letter from Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard (R-Joplin) echoed the call for Greitens to step down.Steven Spielberg is directing his attention toward the DC Universe.

The “Ready Player One” director has agreed to produce and possibly direct a movie based on the World War II-era character “Blackhawk” for Warner Brothers.

The series debuted in 1941, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but isn’t well known to today’s audiences. Still, it fits in Spielberg’s World War II wheelhouse, since it’s about an international squadron of Nazi-fighting pilots led by a man named Blackhawk.

There is no release date for “Blackhawk” but “Jurassic Park” screenwriter David Koepp will write the script, according to Polygon.com.

Warner Brothers has not made it clear whether “Blackhawk” will interact with Superman or Wonder Woman in the DC Universe.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is restoring voting rights to thousands after the New York legislature failed to do so. Eduardo Munoz / Reuters

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed an executive order on Wednesday to restore voting rights to New York felons on parole.

New York and 47 other states strip people of the right to vote when they’re convicted of a felony. In the Empire State, felons can vote again once they’ve completed their sentence, which previously included any time on parole.

The governor’s office notes that there are currently about 35,000 people in New York who have been barred from voting while on parole following a felony conviction.

The governor announced the executive order during a speech at the National Action Network’s annual convention. Standing next to him was former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group focused on voting rights issues.

Cuomo said the state legislature had failed to make the change, so he would act alone.

“I’m unwilling to take no for an answer, I’m gonna make it law by executive order and I announce that here today,” the governor said to a standing ovation.

The executive order will apply to those currently on parole and those who will become eligible for it in the future. The state’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will begin by submitting a list of those now on parole to the governor’s office. Starting May 1, the department will produce a monthly list of those newly on parole. Those individuals will be reviewed to determine whether they will receive a conditional pardon restoring voting rights.

In the United States overall, there were more than 6.1 million people in 2016 who had been disenfranchised due to felony convictions, according to the Sentencing Project. The idea of stripping the right to vote from criminals dates back to ancient Greece and Rome. Several U.S. states began to adopt felon disenfranchisement laws around the Civil War as a way of targeting black voters. In 2016, 1 in every 13 African-Americans were disenfranchised, four times the rate of other Americans.

Cuomo’s decision comes as he faces a primary challenge from actress-activist Cynthia Nixon, who has positioned herself as more progressive than the governor. Some have criticized Cuomo for not doing enough to expand voting rights in New York.

Nixon issued a dismissive statement Wednesday afternoon, saying Cuomo’s executive order was long overdue.

“For eight years, Cuomo governed like a Republican ― handing control of our state to his ultra-rich donors and the party of Trump. Now he’s scared of communities all across New York who want to replace him with a real Democrat. We don’t buy the Governor’s new song-and-dance routine. Voter suppression in New York should have ended eight years ago, from the rights of parolees to access to early voting and automatic registration,” she said.

On Thursday, Cuomo spokeswoman Hazel Crampton-Hays said the governor’s office would immediately begin assessing the eligibility of people on parole for conditional pardons based on a “set of basic criteria.” Those individuals don’t have to apply to have their voting rights restored, she said, and those deemed eligible would automatically receive their pardons.WASHINGTON ― CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s nomination to be the nation’s next secretary of state appears to be on track for confirmation despite growing Democratic opposition this week and a likely unfavorable committee vote in the Senate.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, became the latest member of his caucus to oppose the nomination of Pompeo, who was tapped by President Donald Trump to replace Rex Tillerson at the State Department.

Menendez called Pompeo’s hawkish record “deeply troubling” and chided him for not being fully forthcoming about his involvement in the investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, as well as his recently revealed trip to North Korea to meet with its dictator, Kim Jong Un. Pompeo reportedly made the secret visit to the Korean peninsula over Easter weekend to prepare for direct talks between Trump and Kim, who plan to discuss Pyongyang’s nuclear program.

“I believe our nation’s top diplomat must be forthright, and, more critically, his past sentiments do not reflect our nation’s values, and are not acceptable for our nation’s top diplomat,” Menendez said in a statement on Wednesday. “The American people deserve better.”

Pompeo’s extraordinary meeting with Kim did not appear to perturb Republicans, however, who gave the administration good marks for its handling of negotiations they hope will produce a thaw in relations between the U.S. and North Korea.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he was glad the administration was engaging in precursory negotiations before the two leaders meet in coming months.

“I like the fact that Pompeo met with him,” Corker told reporters Wednesday at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “I think that’s intelligent. I hope that a lot of other people would be doing the same thing. And I thought it was a good thing.”

Conservative groups, meanwhile, argued that rejecting Pompeo now, when he is engaged in sensitive diplomatic talks with an infamously reclusive leader, would seriously jeopardize the chances for peace and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. Several groups are reportedly targeting vulnerable red-state Democrats who are on the fence about his nomination.

“Mike Pompeo is already helping President Trump negotiate denuclearization of North Korea. Senate Dems should confirm him immediately as Secretary of State,” tweeted Steve Forbes, the editor-in-chief of Forbes.

The campaign to bolster Pompeo’s bid to be the nation’s next chief diplomat appeared to be coordinated at least in part by the Trump administration. The revelation about his secret meeting with Kim “was timed to shore up Pompeo’s image as a diplomat capable of executing sensitive negotiations on the president’s behalf,” one senior administration official admitted to Politico.

Still, it’s not clear whether the late effort by the administration to help put Pompeo over the top will sway enough recalcitrant Democrats, who hold reservations about his aggressive worldview and past statements about minorities.

“The reality is even Democrats who’ve been inclined to support some of our nominations haven’t [changed their minds about Pompeo], so I don’t know that it moves the ball in either direction,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told HuffPost.

Although 15 members of the Democratic caucus voted to confirm Pompeo to lead the CIA last year, most of that group has since announced their opposition to his leading the State Department. Several holdouts remain, however, including a mix of red state and centrist senators, including Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

Manchin told reporters on Wednesday that he is “wide open” to supporting Pompeo but that he had not yet decided whether to do so.

“We had good conversations, and we’re going to have some more,” he said of Pompeo.

Pompeo’s path to the State Department could be a tricky one. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has already said he intends to vote against Pompeo. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is battling brain cancer, is not expected to return to the Senate before the vote. That means that if Paul and every member of the Democratic caucus put up a united front against Pompeo, they could tank his nomination.

But Pompeo is likely to win over at least a few moderates who are up for re-election this year, such as Manchin, Donnelly or Heitkamp.Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, executive director of Sri Lankan LGBT organisation Equal Ground, said the speech “paves the way for making some positive change for the LGBT communities of the Commonwealth”, nations home to about 2.4 billion people.

“I welcome this acknowledgement of the deep wounds left in our countries by bad colonial laws, wounds from which many of us are still bleeding today,” Malaysian activist Pang Khee Teik told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“It’s time to listen, learn, and heal.”

Some activists, however, did not think May’s comments would lead to permanent change even though she said Britain would support any country wanting reform.

“I am all to aware that these laws were often put in place by my own country, They were wrong then and they are wrong now,” May said.

Founder of NAZ Male Health Alliance in Pakistan, Qasim Iqbal, said May needed to create a policy on how the British government would help end discrimination.

“The prime minister needs to now present an advocacy framework on what role the UK government will play in ensuring that the entire Commonwealth is a place where people have the freedom to love a person of their choice,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) appears in court to face a charge of misdemeanor assault after he was accused of attacking a reporter on the eve of his election, in Bozeman, Montana, U.S., June 12, 2017. Tommy Martino / Reuters

One of the brothers who runs local TV news giant Sinclair Broadcast Group donated more than $10,000 to Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who was jailed for assaulting a reporter during his campaign.

Robert E. Smith, a director of Sinclair since 1986, donated $5,400 to Gianforte’s campaign last month, and the same amount last year, according to The Guardian, whose reporter, Ben Jacobs, was attacked by Gianforte.

Smith, who described himself in a federal campaign filing as self-employed in real estate, also donated to President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Smith’s brother, Sinclair vice president Frederick Smith, donated $1,000 to Gianforte the day after the May 2017 attack on the reporter.

Gianforte was charged with assault after he body-slammed Jacobs and broke his glasses when the reporter asked a question about health care during a campaign office interview. Gianforte initially lied to police, blaming the reporter for the violence, but won the election anyway. He pleaded guilty and was given a six-month deferred sentence, with requirements for community service and anger-management counseling.

Sinclair, the largest U.S. owner of local TV stations by number of outlets, has been accused by its journalists of right-leaning bias. The company has demanded local anchors record statements bashing mainstream media. One former Sinclair reporter complained about the company’s “culture of misogyny and xenophobia” in an interview with CNN this month.Josh Groban and Sara Bareilles will co-host the Tony Awards at New York's Radio City Music Hall on Sunday, June 10.

Both Bareilles and Groban grew up as theater kids, and have endeared themselves to theater fans in recent years.

Groban received a Tony nomination last year for “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812”; he also released “Stages,” an album of songs from classic Broadway shows, in 2015. Bareilles wrote the score for “Waitress,” which received a Tony nod two years ago, and went on to star in the musical. She also earned rave reviews earlier this month for playing Mary Magdalene in NBC’s “Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.”

Groban, who is set to kick off a tour with singer-actress Idina Menzel this fall, said he was “humbled and ecstatic” to be co-hosting the awards show with “brilliant artist and wonderful friend” Bareilles.

“The dedication and inspiration surrounding live theatre gave me my life path as a young kid and the warmth and support of the Broadway community has been the highlight of my career,” he said in a statement.

Bareilles echoed those sentiments.

“I have never felt more embraced and encouraged by a professional community, and I am so grateful for that,” she said.Americans have until midnight on April 18 to file their income tax returns this year. Bloomberg via Getty Images

The Internal Revenue Service is giving American taxpayers another day to file their taxes after a glitch temporarily shut down its online payment site on deadline day.

“This is the busiest tax day of the year, and the IRS apologizes for the inconvenience this system issue caused for taxpayers,” David Kautter, the agency’s acting commissioner, said in a statement. “The IRS appreciates everyone’s patience during this period. The extra time will help taxpayers affected by this situation.”

Taxpayers were unable to make payments or view their tax records on the IRS website for hours on Tuesday due to “technical difficulties,” an agency spokesperson told NPR. Those individuals who went to the site hoping to file last-minute tax returns were greeted by a message with the heading “Planned Outage: April 17, 2018 - December 31, 9999.”

The error was resolved by Tuesday evening, but to make up for the interruption, the IRS announced it would allow people an additional day to file their income tax returns and to pay those taxes.

Everybody who had to file and pay by April 17 now has until midnight on April 18 to do so. The agency said taxpayers don’t need to do anything to receive the extra day.Lizzie Pannill Fletcher won the Democratic nomination for Texas' 7th Congressional District. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher for Congress/Facebook

Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a corporate attorney, won the Democratic nomination for Texas’ 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, reassuring national Democrats eager to flip the GOP-held seat.

Fletcher’s win in a runoff reflects the preference of primary voters for a mainstream Democrat capable of appealing to enough of the affluent, suburban Houston district’s Republican voters.

It also delivers a victory for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official body charged with electing the party’s candidates to the House. The DCCC backed away from an active role in the campaign after provoking outrage among some progressives with a February opposition research memo against Fletcher’s more liberal opponent, Laura Moser.

Fletcher finished first in a seven-candidate March primary, but the controversy over the DCCC helped propel Moser to a close second-place finish, setting up the runoff race.

With Fletcher’s nomination, “Texas Democratic primary voters chose their heads over their hearts,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who lives in the district. “Rather than opting for the aggressive progressive Laura Moser, they opted for the nearly equally liberal Lizzie Fletcher.”

In November’s general election, Fletcher faces Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term Republican.

Although Culberson has often easily won re-election, this year Democrats came out of the woodwork to challenge the deeply conservative congressman. Texas’ 7th is one of just three GOP-held districts in the state where voters narrowly opted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in he 2016 presidential vote, making it a prime Democratic pickup opportunity in the midterm elections. The district went for Clinton 49 percent to 47 percent, a sharp swing from 2012 when it went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 21 percentage points.

The devastating effect of Hurricane Harvey last year has also made Culberson more vulnerable than normal. He promoted the expansion of an interstate highway that some of his constituents believe left their neighborhoods more vulnerable to flooding.

For the most part, however, the district’s sizable majority of so-called country-club Republicans remains loyal to the GOP. Any Democrat hoping to unseat Culberson will need to convert at least some voters who traditionally support Republicans down the line, but might appreciate a member of Congress willing to hold Trump more accountable.

Fletcher, who supports abortion rights and shoring up the Affordable Care Act, is more moderate than Moser, a proponent of Medicare-for-all and founder of the anti-Trump “Resistance” text-message app, Daily Action.

Perhaps more important than policy distinctions, the two candidates differed in their styles.

“Without question, Fletcher’s rhetoric and style were much more consensual and less anti-Republican and anti-Trump,” Jones said.

While Fletcher had the endorsement of the establishment-linked group EMILY’s List, Moser drew support from less well-heeled progressive grassroots groups like Democracy for America and Our Revolution, the successor group to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign.

Fletcher’s win is also a major setback for organized labor, which bitterly opposed her bid. She was anathema to regional labor unions because she is a partner at AZA Law, a firm that represented a Houston janitorial services company in a dispute with the Service Employees International Union, which was seeking to unionize the company’s workers.

AZA successfully won a $5.3 million lawsuit against the state’s SEIU chapter, forcing it to declare bankruptcy.

AZA Law also boasts on its website of successfully defending a Houston-based oil equipment supplier against a discrimination lawsuit filed by eight current and former African American employees.Reminder: Donald Trump still hasn't released any of his tax returns to the public.

President Donald Trump will not file his 2017 tax returns by the federal deadline and has requested an extension from the Internal Revenue Service, the White House announced on Tuesday.

“The president filed an extension for his 2017 tax return, as do many Americans with complex returns,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “He will file his tax return by the extension deadline of October 15, 2018.”

The White House did not disclose why Trump needed more time to prepare his returns.

The IRS extended the tax filing deadline an additional day after a glitch temporarily shut down its online payment system on Tuesday.

“This is the busiest tax day of the year, and the IRS apologizes for the inconvenience this system issue caused for taxpayers,” David Kautter, the agency’s acting commissioner, said in a statement. “The IRS appreciates everyone’s patience during this period. The extra time will help taxpayers affected by this situation.”

Taxpayers now have until midnight on April 18 to file their tax returns or request an extension. About 15 million people will join Trump in asking for a later deadline, the IRS said.

The issue of tax returns has long been a point of contention for Trump. During the last presidential election, he refused to release his past returns, even though almost every president and presidential nominee since Richard Nixon had routinely done so in an effort to provide a lens into their past financial history and charitable giving.

In 2016, Trump said he couldn’t release his own returns because the IRS was conducting an audit of his finances. IRS officials said any person can release the documents, whether they’re being audited or not.Jason Aldean wore a gold pin for Route 91 victims at the ACM Awards in Las Vegas.

You may call Jason Aldean his own worst critic.

The country star will often listen to his music over and over, or watch tapings of his performances.

“I pick all my stuff apart. I listen to it a lot. But I do that with everything,” Aldean told HuffPost. If we have a live performance on TV, I go back and watch it and go, ‘I should have done this different or that different. Or I should have done this here.’ I analyze everything.”



Aldean did that with his new album, “Rearview Town,” released on Friday. The title track, in particular, is one he analyzed a lot before releasing it. Though, now it appears he listens to it more for enjoyment that anything else. He likes its relatable premise about “leaving your hometown and putting the past behind you and moving on to something else down the road that maybe you couldn’t achieve in your hometown.”

Aldean's new album features an appearance by Miranda Lambert. Broken Bow Records

For his eighth studio album, Aldean wanted to “push the envelope,” similar to what he did with his self-titled debut in 2005.

“Early on in my career when we would make records we had a little bit of an ‘anything goes’ mentality as far as songs, and finding songs that let us step outside the box — from what everybody else was doing,” he said. “I think on the last couple of albums we played it safe ... I just wanted to get back to finding and recording songs where people would never know what’s going to come next.”

The new set of 15 songs includes a mix of sounds ranging from country and blues to rock and hip-hop. It also features an appearance by Miranda Lambert on “Drowns the Whiskey.” The two previously collaborated on “Grown Woman” from Aldean’s 2007 sophomore effort. The trickiest part this time involved making sure he found the right track to introduce to Lambert.

“I actually sent her a song before I sent her ‘Drowns the Whiskey,’ and she just wasn’t loving it. She didn’t hate it. She didn’t love it. I told her if you’re going to sing on it, I want it to be something that you really like,” Aldean recalled.



Luckily, Lambert fell in love with “Drowns the Whiskey.” It’s a more traditional song ― something right in her wheelhouse, Aldean said.

“One thing a lot of people don’t know about her is that she’s a really great harmony singer. Like really good,” Aldean said. “She doesn’t necessarily sing it like if I brought in a background singer. But that’s what makes it cool. It’s very stylistic, and you can tell that it’s her. We had her come in and cranked her into the mix and it sounded great. Highlight of the record for sure.”

This album is Aldean’s first release since the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October. Aldean was performing onstage at the country music fest when a gunman started shooting from a nearby hotel room, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds. It was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history.

Although the new songs were neither influenced nor inspired by Vegas (he completed them prior to Route 91), Aldean does mention the victims and survivors of the massacre in the liner notes; he doesn’t want people to forget what happened that night.

“I think about those people every day, and that night, I still think about all the time.””

“I feel like a lot of times it becomes less and less of a headline as times goes on. For me, it was a way to acknowledge people that were there and let them know that a lot of time has passed now, but it’s still something I think about. I think about those people every day, and that night, I still think about all the time.”

In the days after the shooting, Aldean visited hospitals and met with survivors, something that impacts him to this day.

“I don’t think you can go through something like that and have it not change you. It’s a life-altering kind of thing. It made me view a lot of things differently,” he said. “I think going and talking to some of the victims and their families and seeing the spirit that those people had was pretty amazing to see. I was going through my own stuff in private and dealing with all of it. But to go talk to all the people and see the way they were dealing with it — that had been shot. They were in great spirits and just glad to be alive. I was like, ‘Oh man, maybe I’m looking at this all wrong.’ It really helped me have a different view on it. But it’s tough. I don’t know if you ever really get over it. Hopefully it gets better.”

Since the Vegas shooting, a lot of talk has surrounded gun control ― with eyes on the country music community. Aldean, a gun owner himself, recently said it’s too easy to get guns.

“When you can walk in somewhere and you can get one in five minutes, do a background check that takes five minutes, like how in-depth is that background check? Those are the issues I have. It’s not necessarily the guns themselves or that I don’t think people should have guns,” he told The Associated Press. “I have a lot of them.”

But when pressed on the hot-button gun debate during our interview, Aldean didn’t want to elaborate.

“I feel like it gets taken out of context, and the headline becomes that I speak out on gun control. ... I’m not saying that people should have their guns taken away,” he said. “Because I don’t think that. It’s just one of those things ― it’s like a no-win. For me, I’ve said my piece on that and people can take it for what they want to.”

With that, Aldean wants to focus on his new music and his return to the stage, with a major tour kicking off in May. Playing live is still where he feels most at ease.

“I know I’m not the best singer,” Aldean, ever the self-critic, said. “That’s my thing ― you put me onstage and you put me in front of people, that’s where I’m comfortable.”

Now, more than a decade into his career, Aldean continues to attract a large audience. Over the weekend, he returned to Las Vegas for the Academy of Country Music Awards, where he took home Entertainer of the Year for the third consecutive time.On Tuesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the comedian pretended to visit infant Trump in his ostentatious crib. This time around, however, Kimmel gave Trump a heads up about former FBI Director James Comey’s new book A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.

It was in a bid to “potentially get him to change his ways,” Kimmel explained.

But Kimmel’s bedtime story didn’t exactly turn out as planned.The Titanic sailed with eight Chinese passengers, six of whom survived only to be met with racism on shore. Universal History Archive via Getty Images

While the RMS Titanic left a lasting cultural legacy, the fate of its wealthiest passengers discussed in news and entertainment media, the history of the ship’s Chinese passengers has remained largely hidden.

And racist policies have a lot to do with it.

Out of the eight Chinese passengers aboard the ship, six survived the disaster that occurred off the coast of Newfoundland on April 15, 1912. But following their escape and eventual landing in the U.S., they were met with fierce anti-Chinese sentiment and strict immigration policies targeting those from China. The six were ultimately turned away at Ellis Island.

Their story is the subject of an upcoming documentary, “The Six,” to be released later this year. The film’s chief researcher, Steven Schwankert, told the South China Morning Post that his team hopes to set the record straight and address the attitudes that obscured the fate of the six travelers.

“Six Chinese guys made it off the Titanic alive and 24 hours later were written out of the story,” Schwankert said. “That wasn’t an accident. That was deliberate. It’s something that the culture of the time made happen.”

The passengers, who appeared to be from southern China, boarded the British ship in the English city of Southampton. In line with the way many ships handled third-class passengers a century ago, all eight of their names were written on a single ticket.

After the crash into an iceberg, four of the men escaped aboard the final lifeboat, according to news site Quartz. One made it onto another lifeboat while another, who was reportedly named Fang Lang, was picked up after being spotted floating in the wreckage. Records reveal that even that rescue was tinged with racism.

Officer Harold Lowe, who manned lifeboat 14, was said to have hesitated over saving the Chinese passenger, whom he called a “Jap,” a derogatory term used to describe individuals of Japanese descent.

“What’s the use?” Lowe said, according to lifeboat passenger Charlotte Collyer as reported in Encyclopedia Titanica. “He’s dead, likely, and if he isn’t, there’s others better worth saving than a Jap!”

But other passengers convinced Lowe to act. After he recovered his strength, Fang Lang proved to be a valuable member of the lifeboat and “worked like a hero,” rowing until they were rescued, Collyer later said. Lowe soon walked back his comments.

In part because most of the Chinese men survived the sinking of the Titanic ― even though women and children had been prioritized in the rush to the lifeboats ― their appearance in the U.S. was greatly scrutinized. A story in a 1912 issue of the Brooklyn Eagle offers a snapshot of the anti-Chinese bias aimed at the six men. Referring to them as “creatures” and “coolies,” the newspaper claimed that some of them were “found, wedged beneath the seats” of the lifeboats.

But documentary director Arthur Jones doesn’t believe that is accurate.

“We visited a large number of foreign archives and museums, worked with historians from the United States and China, searched and studied many [pieces of] evidence,” he told Xinhua News Agency. “There is no single [piece of] evidence to prove the Chinese survivors were stowaways [on the lifeboats]. I believe they did not do anything dishonorable.”

Other Western media outlets at the time also claimed that the Chinese passengers disguised themselves as women to escape the doomed ship ― another detail that the team producing “The Six” don’t buy.

“The press at the time labeled the Chinese survivors, referred to in places as ‘celestials,’ as cowards who dressed as women to sneak into lifeboats,” Schwankert told Quartz. “They had no basis for that, and we believe it’s just not true. … It’s time for these men to have their rightful place in history.”

Unlike the other passengers, these six survivors were ordered to leave the U.S. A century ago, American immigration policy was firmly set against the Chinese. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had initially barred all immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years; the discriminatory policy was extended in 1892 by the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902 with even further restrictions. (The policy would not be ended until 1943 when China was a World War II ally.)

Little is known about the lives of the six men after their expulsion from the U.S. Their stories were mostly forgotten and if they were brought up in the press, “it was to say they did something dishonorable,” Jones told the South China Morning Post.

With the help of a social media campaign, however, the documentarians set out to track down their descendants. It was a difficult task, given that the survivors’ names have been recorded with varying spellings. But the team did make headway, according to the South China Morning Post. Their research led them from Wisconsin to the port city of Guangzhou.

Soon, the passengers will receive the treatment they deserve.

“We don’t accept the reports and the history as it is presented. The six Chinese men have been put into a position of injustice for more than a hundred years. We can finally tell their story rightly,” Schwankert told Xinhua.

AdvertisementPoliticians came together on Tuesday to honor the legacy of former first lady Barbara Bush after a spokesman for the Bush family announced her death at age 92.

Barbara Bush, the wife of former President George H.W. Bush and mother of former President George W. Bush, had been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. The family announced on Sunday that the former first lady would no longer seek treatment after a series of hospitalizations.

The Bushes celebrated their 73rd anniversary in January, making them the longest-married couple in presidential history.

Bush, née Barbara Pierce, was the matriarch of a political dynasty and paved her own path in public service to focus on domestic issues, such as literacy, AIDS awareness, homelessness and poverty. In 1989, she established the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy with the goal of raising awareness about the importance of reading and writing at a young age

George W. Bush released a statement to the press on behalf of himself, his wife, and his twin daughters.

My dear mother has passed away at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barabara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love and literacy to millions. To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I’m a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes.

President Donald Trump celebrated the life of the former first lady in a statement released on his Twitter account, offering prayers for her family and friends.

“Amongst her greatest achievements was recognizing the importance of literacy as a fundamental family value that requires nurturing and protection,” Trump’s statement read. “She will be long remembered for her strong devotion to country and family, both of which she served unfailingly well.”

A woman known for her sharp wit and fierce personality, the former first lady was fondly nicknamed “the enforcer” by her family. She was honored by her family and political figures on social media for her influence on American society.Former Playboy model Karen McDougal has been released from a contract with American Media Inc. that restricted her ability to openly discuss her alleged 2006 affair with President Donald Trump.

McDougal reached a settlement with the publishing company on Wednesday, freeing her from a 2016 legal agreement with The National Enquirer. News of the affair broke in February when The New Yorker detailed an alleged attempt during Trump’s campaign to prevent McDougal from going public about the 2006 affair.

The magazine, owned by AMI, reportedly bought the exclusive rights to McDougal’s story for $150,000 and then spiked the article shortly before the presidential election in what is called a “catch and kill.”

AMI added an amendment to the contract after the election to allow McDougal to respond to legitimate news inquiries. The model filed a lawsuit in March to invalidate the contract, however, claiming that the agreement was created to silence and intimidate her.

“I am pleased to have reached a settlement with AMI on my own terms, which restores to me the rights to my life story and frees me from this contract that I was misled into signing nearly two years ago,” McDougal said in a statement to HuffPost.

AMI told HuffPost in a statement that the company “reached an amicable resolution with Karen today that provides both sides what they wanted as a result.”

The former model will be on the cover of the September issue of the AMI-owned Men’s Journal, which will include a feature-length article about her. AMI also will publish five fitness columns by McDougal, the publishing company told HuffPost. “AMI is maintaining a financial interest in any re-sale of an exclusive on Karen’s personal story,” AMI added.

AMI’s settlement with McDougal comes a week after the FBI seized material from Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The New York Times reported that investigators are examining Cohen’s legal agreement with porn star Stormy Daniels, who also claims to have had an affair with Trump.

McDougal told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in March that after having sex with Trump, the president attempted to pay her for it. She also mentioned that Trump compared her to his daughter Ivanka, saying McDougal was “beautiful like her.”

UPDATE: 7 p.m. ― The Senate unanimously agreed Wednesday to change its rules to allow senators to bring their infant children onto the chamber floor during floor votes, for which a lawmaker must be present in person.

#senate passes by UC S Res 463 allowing Senators to bring babies on the Senate floor. — Senate Press Gallery (@SenatePress) April 18, 2018

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who became the first sitting senator to give birth while in office earlier this month, applauded the move, saying that the Senate was “leading by example” and that making accommodations for new parents was “a common-sense economic issue.”

“I would like to thank my colleagues ... for helping bring the Senate into the 21st Century by recognizing that sometimes new parents also have responsibilities at work,” Duckworth said in a statement. “By ensuring that no Senator will be prevented from performing their constitutional responsibilities simply because they have a young child, the Senate is leading by example and sending the important message that working parents everywhere deserve family-friendly workplace policies. These policies aren’t just a women’s issue, they are a common-sense economic issue.”

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, said he was “glad we were able to get this done.” He had expressed support for the change earlier in the week alongside the committee’s ranking member, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

“Being a parent is a difficult job, and the Senate rules shouldn’t make it any harder,” Blunt said in a statement.

Previously: Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) made history earlier this month when she became the first sitting senator to give birth while in office. She wants to make history again by doing away with the archaic chamber rule that newborns are not allowed onto the Senate floor.

Her effort has gained what’s become a rarity in Congress ― bipartisan support.

The Iraq War veteran submitted a resolution this week that would allow senators to bring children under the age of one onto the Senate floor. The resolution needs to pass the Senate Rules Committee and then be approved by the full chamber. If passed quickly, Duckworth would be able to vote with her daughter by next week.

“As leaders of the Senate Rules Committee, we support Senator Duckworth’s resolution and intend to move it swiftly through our committee,” Senate Rules Committee Chairman Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a joint statement on Tuesday, according to CNN.

Politico reported that Senate leaders are ready to have the full chamber act on the request once the Rules Committee approves it.

Duckworth told Politico in February that she couldn’t “technically” take maternity leave because senators are required to appear in person to vote.

“If I have to vote, and I’m breastfeeding my child, especially during my maternity leave period, what do I do? Leave her sitting outside?” Duckworth asked in the interview.

In a recent essay for Elle Magazine, she discussed how exhausting it can be to always be the “first.”“While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity’s informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday, we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support,” a spokeswoman for Fox News told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.

On his late-afternoon MSNBC show “Meet The Press Daily,” Todd said he was “stunned” by the network’s response, which he called a message to journalists that such conflicts of interests are permissible at Fox News. It was also another example of how Hannity is not held to the same standards as other journalists, possibly even those working at the same network, he argued.

“I am stunned that Fox had no punitive response,” Todd said. “Not a ‘Sean Hannity must disclose every night,’ not a ‘He can’t cover this story,’ not a ‘He’s been suspended for the week.’ Nothing! Not a single thing!”

Hannity defended himself on his Monday show, minimizing his connection to Cohen and telling audiences he has a “right to privacy.”

A group of students who survived February’s Parkland, Florida, school shooting had some special visitors Tuesday at a rehearsal for their production of “Spring Awakening.”

Former “Glee” star Lea Michele, Jonathan Groff and other cast members from the show’s original Broadway run traveled to Florida to help the teens as they prepare to put on the Tony Award-winning rock musical.

Three survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School ― Alfonso Calderon, Sawyer Garrity and Cameron Kasky ― have lead roles in the Boca Raton production. Calderon and Kasky helped found the student-led gun control advocacy group Never Again MSD in the wake of the tragedy.

Michele tweeted a photo of the combined casts, writing: “What an honor joining my original Broadway Spring Awakening cast in Florida yesterday to work with some of the Stoneman Douglas students and their cast mates on their production of Spring Awakening.”

Also on hand was “Pitch Perfect” star Skylar Astin, as well as Remy Zaken, Gideon Glick, Lauren Pritchard, Brian Charles Johnson and Phoebe Strole from the original cast.

“Very honored to meet such incredible, talented and inspiring young adults who are fighting to make a change!” Michele tweeted with a selfie showing Groff, Kasky and Garrity.

The musical, adapted from a 1891 German play of the same name about a group of teenagers coming of age, was actually conceived in response to a school shooting.

Playwright Steven Sater and composer Duncan Sheik originally collaborated on the project to address “the unheard, anguished cries of young people” in the wake of the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, according to Topic.

“Now more than ever, this musical carries important weight,” the show’s producers write on the theater’s website.Tennessee’s Republican-controlled House on Tuesday retaliated against Memphis for removing two Confederate monuments by withholding $250,000 previously earmarked for the city’s 2019 bicentennial celebration.

Democrats in the House condemned the move, which came in the form of a last-minute amendment to an appropriations bill and triggered a heated debate. State Rep. Antonio Parkinson (D) said the amendment was the most “vile, racist” measure he had seen, while state Rep. Raumesh Akbari (D) called it “un-Christian.”

“The amendment and the explanation is hateful,” Akbari said before the vote.

But Republicans were not moved, and the amendment passed with a strong majority. In a largely party-line vote, only five Republicans joined 22 Democrats in opposing the measure.

Memphis itself had been legally blocked from removing the statues of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis from two public parks, according to The Commercial Appeal. But in December, the city council voted unanimously to sell the parks to a local nonprofit, for a reported $1,000 each. That evening, the nonprofit took down the monuments.

Some people in the majority-black city had been voicing their discomfort with the lingering reminders of the Confederacy for well over a decade. Tennessee House Republicans strongly opposed removing the statues, however, and have called for an investigation into the legality of the parks’ sale.

“The law was very clear, and they got smart lawyers to figure out how to wiggle around the law,” state Rep. Gerald McCormick (R) told Nashville Public Radio.

Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland (D) said on Twitter that officials “followed the state law down to the letter of it.”

Ahead of the city’s 200th anniversary in May 2019, Memphis government officials have been working on a plan that Strickland calls “Memphis 3.0.” According to the project’s website, organizers aim to develop “great neighborhoods” and “walkable/bikeable communities connected by effective transportation options,” among other goals.

“While we would have appreciated the additional funding, the ongoing planning for the joint city-county bicentennial will continue unchanged,” Strickland said.

A Memphis resident has set up a GoFundMe page to help recoup the $250,000.

The story has been updated with comment from Mayor Strickland and news of the GoFundMe page.WASHINGTON ― After months of delays by Republicans, senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Wednesday that cracks down on sexual harassment in their ranks.

The bill, hashed out by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), makes badly needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing victims of sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and a 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court.

Here’s a section-by-section overview of their bill.

The most contentious provision in the bill is its requirement that lawmakers pay out of pocket for sexual harassment and discrimination settlements.

That language was part of similar legislation that easily passed the House in early February. But when the House bill arrived in the Senate, some anonymous male GOP senators opposed that provision and stopped the bill in its tracks.

In the months that followed, senators who had been demanding action grew agitated. All 22 female senators from both parties ripped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for not making the bill a priority. Every male Democratic senator ― plus Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who co-sponsored a sexual harassment bill with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) ― wrote to McConnell urging him to do something.

The Senate’s delays looked particularly bad as the Me Too movement hit Capitol Hill last fall and triggered a series of sudden retirements by lawmakers accused of sexual misconduct. One of them, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), quit without repaying $84,000 in taxpayer money he spent on a sexual harassment settlement.

But Wednesday’s breakthrough means the bill has a good chance of moving ― and moving quickly. Blunt and Klobuchar have support from their party leaders, and they presented their proposal to their respective caucuses on Tuesday afternoon. Barring any last-minute objections, Blunt suggested the Senate could vote on the bill by the end of the week.

“With this agreement, both parties are coming together to update the laws governing how the Congress addresses workplace claims and protecting staff and others from harassment,” McConnell and Schumer said in a joint statement. “We’re optimistic that after our members review the legislation, this bill will pass the Senate in short order.”

Congress clearly needs to deal with this. Four out of 10 female congressional aides say sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill, according to a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey. The same survey found that 1 in 6 said they had been personally victimized.

Notably, the Senate bill takes steps to prevent another Farenthold-type situation. It authorizes withholding compensation from a lawmaker if he or she doesn’t repay a harassment settlement initially paid out with taxpayer money. If the lawmaker hasn’t paid up within 180 days, the Treasury Department is authorized to take money out of that lawmaker’s compensation or annuity.

The bill now heads to the House, where lawmakers may not like the changes made by the Senate. Both chambers will have to agree on its final language before it can go to President Donald Trump to become law.

It took months, but Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) have hashed out a deal to require lawmakers to pay out-of-pocket for sexual harassment settlements. Bloomberg via Getty Images

It’s not entirely clear how the Senate plan differs from the House bill, but Klobuchar said there are dozens of changes. One difference is that the House bill proposed a 45-day limit on when a staffer can bring a federal court case against a member of Congress allegedly harassing him or her. The Senate proposal doubles that time frame to 90 days.

“There were many, many, many things we worked on,” Klobuchar said. “We were able to negotiate them one by one and get, what I think, is a very good bill.”

It’s still a mystery which GOP senators opposed the provision requiring them to be personally liable for sexual harassment settlements. Under the current system, the U.S. government ― i.e., taxpayers ― is considered lawmakers’ employer and foots the bill for any settlement involving a lawmaker or an aide.

Blunt, for one, got snippy Tuesday when asked if his bill would require staff and members of Congress to pay out of pocket for settlements. That is the case under the House bill. But Blunt said the Senate bill would only apply to lawmakers.

“Non-members would still be covered by their employer ― like every other employee in America is for their actions,” he told reporters.

This article has been updated to reflect that the bill has been introduced.WASHINGTON — Three weeks before the National Park Service denied an activist group’s request to erect a giant statue of a nude woman on the National Mall, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke received an email from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.).

The Oct. 3 message forwarded an exchange between Gingrich, his wife, Callista, and Claire Christensen, the co-author of his 2016 book about the election of President Donald Trump. In it, the three seemed perturbed by the proposal to place the sculpture near the Washington Monument for three months.

“Have you heard about this?” Callista Gingrich, now the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, wrote to her husband. Newt Gingrich asked Christensen in an email later that day whether it was real.

“Unfortunately, yes it’s true,” Christensen responded. “Still needing approval and funding so nothing definitive yet.” She provided links to several news articles on the proposal.

Gingrich pinged Zinke a few hours later, passing along the email chain without comment. The subject: “Are you aware of this newt.”

The emails were released this week as part of a public information request.

Zinke forwarded Gingrich’s email to one of his staffers the following day, with the message: “Pls contact Mr Speaker and arrange for an office visit. I hour. The subj is monuments. I had ta ked (sic) to him at the WH. Late in the day would be preferred.”

SCREENSHOT/DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

It’s unclear if the two ever met — Gingrich is not listed on Zinke’s calendar between October and February — and if they did, whether the statue was part of that conversation. It’s possible that Gingrich’s email simply reminded Zinke to meet with Gingrich about national monuments; Gingrich later wrote a blog post on his website applauding Zinke and President Donald Trump for gutting Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah.

Three weeks after Gingrich’s email to Zinke, the National Park Service, which Zinke oversees, blocked a request from organizers of Catharsis on the Mall, a three-day art and music festival held in November, to install the 45-foot-tall statue. The group planned to keep the statue up for 91 days.

In a letter to the group on Oct. 25, the service’s acting regional director, Rick Obernesser, said the exhibit was “likely to significantly damage the underlying turf” and “have an adverse effect on the aesthetics, including the cultural identity, of the area.”

The sculpture, which debuted at the Burning Man festival in 2015, was slated to go up in front of the Washington Monument, facing the White House and the Capitol. The artist, Marco Cochrane, has said the piece is aimed at de-objectifying women and raising awareness about violence against women.

“What I see missing in the world is an appreciation and respect for feminine energy and power that results when women are free and safe,” Cochrane said in a statement about the piece. “It seems obvious to me that feminine energy is being suppressed and this must change.”

Contacted Wednesday, an Interior Department spokeswoman referred HuffPost to an official at the National Park Service, who forwarded along the agency’s October statement explaining its decision to grant a permit for the event but not allow the nude statue. The Interior spokeswoman did not answer questions about whether Zinke discussed the proposal with Gingrich or was involved in NPS’ final decision.

The Gingriches and Christensen did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

In an October release, organizers of Catharsis on the Mall blasted the park service for what it described as a “sudden last-minute retraction” and threatened legal action. In its letter to the group, the park service said its earlier approval of a height variance for the statue had been an “error.”
