On Tuesday, Stephen Colbert’s crew sliced and diced audio of the pair to imagine one of their late-night conversations.John Oliver began his show on Sunday night with a brief moment of celebration.

Last week, a West Virginia judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Oliver that was filed by coal baron Robert E Murray, the target of a biting “Last Week Tonight” segment last year.

Murray Energy told The Hill it planned to appeal.

Oliver’s 2017 segment featured a giant talking squirrel who mocked a report that said Murray was told to operate his own mines by a squirrel ― something Murray has denied.

On Sunday, the squirrel ― Mr. Nutterbutter ― was back with a new message for Murray.Kristen Nelson was a softball coach at West Catholic High School for five seasons. akajhoe via Getty Images

A lesbian softball coach for a Michigan Catholic school was forced to resign after her employer found out she wanted to get married.

Kristen Nelson, a coach at West Catholic High School for five years, revealed on Friday that a “parent concern” about her relationship with her girlfriend had recently provoked a series of “unpleasant” conversations with school administrators and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids. Nelson said that the Catholic leaders made it clear that if she got married, she wouldn’t be able to continue coaching for the school.

So Nelson decided to resign.

“I am hurt and mostly disappointed that I will no longer be able to continue,” Nelson wrote in a statement posted on her Facebook page. “I hope you can understand that I simply cannot continue to work in an environment that refuses to support me.”

Nelson, a 2008 graduate of West Catholic High, said that she “always wanted and intended to give back to the community I came from, a community my family and I have always loved and supported.”

The coach helped lead her softball team to a 16-15 record, according to MLive.

She added that she doesn’t believe her sexual orientation has ever hindered her ability to coach her team, but, “unfortunately, leadership does not agree.”

In a Facebook post published on Sunday, West Catholic High claimed its leaders were “saddened and disappointed” by Nelson’s resignation, “especially this close to the softball season.”

“When someone is living outside of Church teaching or participating in behavior not in line with Church teaching and makes it known publicly, they cannot fulfill their primary mission to lead by example,” the message read.

The school insisted that it was not “judging” Nelson by enforcing Catholic teaching on same-sex marriages and said that the coach was still a “welcome and beloved member of our community.”

The administrators said it was Nelson’s planned “public act of same-sex marriage” and not her “same-sex attraction” that stood in contrast to Catholic teaching. “Same-sex attraction” is a phrase commonly invoked by conservative religious groups to attack queer relationships by creating a distinction between feeling attracted to someone of the same sex and acting upon those feelings.

“The teachings of the Church are written for happiness,” the statement read. “This issue is about love and wanting what is best, not necessarily in the immediate moment, but for a lifetime.”

HuffPost’s requests for comment from West Catholic High were directed to the Diocese of Grand Rapids. Annalise Laumeyer, director of communications for the diocese, refused to confirm whether Nelson was a paid employee of the school or discuss how the diocese learned about the coach’s upcoming marriage.

In a statement, the diocese said that its leader, Bishop David J. Walkowiak, was “grateful” to the administrators at West Catholic High School for standing by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.

“As a mission of the Catholic Church, Catholic schools are places where students come to learn and know the Church’s teachings, one of which is the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman,” the statement read. “For this reason, Catholic school administrators, teachers, or staff members that persist in public acts that are contrary to Catholic teachings disqualify themselves from the opportunity to continue in their leadership role within a Catholic school.”

On Facebook, Nelson’s girlfriend, Maria Roberts, was critical of how the school treated her partner, saying that “this is not how God would treat someone.”Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza is launching Black Futures Lab with a census project to explore black lives in America.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza has created a new initiative aimed at helping black communities achieve greater political power.

Garza on Monday announced the launch of Black Futures Lab, which promises to “develop strategies that help Black people imagine the political, social and economic alternatives needed at the local, state, and federal level, while also building the political power needed to implement those alternatives.”

Conditions for black people in America are “incredibly dire,” and it’s important to have avenues for policy changes that benefit black communities, Garza told HuffPost.

“We have a president that is openly supportive of white nationalist groups and working alongside his administration to dismantle the tatters of what was left of a safety net in this country and also working hard to dismantle organizations that work for the end of economic and political and emotional support of black people,” Garza said.

“Coming out of the 2016 election there was a few things that became really clear,” she continued. “One, that black people deserve to have vehicles that represent the breadth of our interests. Two, that we really need to do a better job of being able to communicate what conditions and experiences our communities are facing.”

Non-black politicians often try to explain issues black people are facing to them, Garza said. But it’s time for a change ― a reason for Black Futures Lab, created in partnership with Demos, Color of Change, Center for Third World Organizing, Socioanalitica Research and the Tides Foundation.

Their first initiative is the Black Census Project, which the group said is the first large survey focusing on black lives in America in more than 150 years. The project aims to capture the range of issues black people are facing in their lives ― something the U.S. Census is limited in doing.

A post shared by Alicia Garza (@chasinggarza) on Feb 26, 2018 at 6:45am PST

Survey questions include such subjects as political attitudes and participation, organization affiliation, experiences with racism and police violence, perceptions of social movements, access to adequate health care and economic well being.

“We really have a wide breadth of questions that we’re asking folks to tell us more about and the census doesn’t really do that,” Garza said. “There’s a lot of questions about what a census will be under the Trump administration and so, data is not neutral. Our data is also not neutral. We want to know about the full breadth of experiences that black folks are having, and we also are asking about our business and what it is we want to see happen in order to address the problems in our communities.”

The project’s goal is 200,000 completed surveys before Aug. 1. In addition to an online survey, representatives will collect responses door to door. The Black Census Project will target 20 states, looking at urban and rural communities as well as neighborhoods with a high population of LGBTQ people, immigrants, and incarcerated people.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump’s personal pilot is reportedly one of several people under consideration to lead the Federal Aviation Administration.

Axios was the first to report that John Dunkin, who has worked for Trump since before he became president, was on a shortlist to lead the FAA. A White House official later confirmed to The Washington Post that Dunkin was under consideration.

The FAA regulates all civil aviation in the U.S. and has an annual budget of more than $16 billion.

“John Dunkin isn’t just a pilot,” an unnamed White House official told Axios. “He’s managed airline and corporate flight departments, certified airlines from start-up under FAA regulations and oversaw the Trump presidential campaign’s air fleet, which included managing all aviation transportation for travel to 203 cities in 43 states over the course of 21 months.”

Trump has touted the expertise of his pilot before. In a meeting with executives from the aviation industry last year, the president called Dunkin a “smart guy” who “knows what’s going on.”

“I have a pilot who’s a real expert,” Trump said.

Dunkin was brought in for a preliminary conversation about the role. Several other people have also been interviewed, including Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) and Dan Elwell, who has served as acting administrator of the agency since January.Gov. Scott Walker insists he's refusing to hold special elections in order to save money. Joshua Roberts / Reuters

A Democratic group is suing Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) over his refusal to call special elections for two seats in the state legislature.

In December, two Republican lawmakers ― an assemblyman and a state senator ― resigned to take jobs in the Walker administration. The governor has said he won’t call a special election for the vacant seats, leaving them to be filled in the regularly scheduled November election, in order to save the state money. The winners of those two races wouldn’t be seated until January of 2019, meaning voters in their districts will go over a year without representation.

Democrats contend that Walker is delaying the vote in hopes of holding on to two GOP seats after Democrats unexpectedly won a January special election in a Wisconsin district that Donald Trump had carried handily in 2016.

On Monday, the National Redistricting Foundation, an affiliate of the Eric Holder-chaired National Democratic Redistricting Committee, sued Walker on behalf of eight Wisconsin voters, saying they had a right to representation in the state legislature that the governor was blocking. The suit, filed in Dane County Circuit Court, asks a judge to order Walker to call special elections.

Wisconsin law says a legislative vacancy that occurs before the second Tuesday in May of a regular election year “must be filled as promptly as possible by special election.”

“Governor Walker’s improper refusal to issue writs of election ... as promptly as possible” is causing “substantial injury to Plaintiffs, who have been and will remain unrepresented,” the complaint says. Some 175,000 people are currently without their full voice in the state legislature.

In January, Democrat Patty Schachtner won a special election for a state Senate seat in a district that Trump had won by 21 points in 2016. Walker said Schachtner’s victory was a ”wake-up call” for Republicans in Wisconsin.

Amy Hasenberg, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the voters would get to elect new representatives this year and accused Democrats of trying to waste taxpayer money.A new gun-control campaign aims to show President Donald Trump the scale of gun violence via Twitter.

#BackfireTrump, launched by the state-based group States United to Prevent Gun Violence, promises to automatically tweet “a powerful message” from supporters’ Twitter accounts to Trump every time someone dies from gun violence.

Over 33,000 Americans die each year from gun violence. I just joined https://t.co/egnPoekIK9 to help create change. Join me to make our voices heard. #BackfireTrump pic.twitter.com/nWV81F2QDS — Backfire Trump (@backfiretrump) February 26, 2018

The campaign, in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, hopes to serve as a “relentless reminder” to compel the president to “address the 33,000+ deaths caused by gun violence each year in America,” according to a press release.

The campaign asks that supporters volunteer their Twitter accounts on BackfireTrump.com. The group said it will automatically send Trump tweets from those accounts with each update to “real-time data of daily preventable gun violence deaths” on gunviolencearchive.org, an independent research group that collects data verified by law enforcement, government and commercial sources.

Users will have the option to set up automatic tweets to the president with each deadly shooting, or with daily or weekly summaries. The automatic tweets will be sent at 3 a.m. ― perfect for Trump, who often begins tweeting before 7 a.m.

Victoria Coy, States United to Prevent Gun Violence national director, said the campaign wants to continue raising public pressure on the issue of gun violence.

“Every death lost to gun violence is preventable,” Coy said in a statement. “Given Trump’s prolific use of the platform, Twitter seems the most effective place to reach” him.Kim Kardashian shared the first public photo of her five-week-old baby Chicago West on Monday, with the mother-daughter pair looking mighty cute in matching Snapchat filters.

Apparently, they were paying no mind to the fact that aunt Kylie Jenner may have contributed to wiping out $1.3 billion of Snapchat’s stock value last week.

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Feb 26, 2018 at 1:55pm PST

The adorable photo does not mark Chicago West’s social media debut, however. She first appeared in Kylie Jenner’s birth announcement video earlier this month.

Kardashian and husband Kanye West welcomed baby Chicago via a surrogate in January.

“Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it’s the easy way out is completely wrong,” Kardashian wrote about the experience. “People assume it’s better because you don’t have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint.”

“The connection with our baby came instantly and it’s as if she was with us the whole time,” Kardashian added.

Actress Jennifer Lawrence and former E! News host Catt Sadler are bringing their talent to the small screen.

The duo is working on a television series inspired by the Me Too movement and Time’s Up initiative, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Lawrence reportedly let the news slip during a Friday appearance at The Wing, a women’s co-working space in New York City.

“I wasn’t supposed to announce that but I am,” Lawrence told the crowd.

HuffPost reached out to Lawrence and Sadler for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Although Lawrence declined to expand on the series during her visit to The Wing, an insider told THR that the project will center around sexism in Hollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement that took the world by storm. Sadler and Lawrence reportedly looped in documentary filmmaker Stephanie Soechtig to direct the series.

Both Lawrence and Sadler have been outspoken about the gender wage gap in Hollywood. In a 2015 essay for Lena Dunham’s Lenny Letter, Lawrence was candid about the pay inequity she’s faced and referenced the 2014 Sony hack in which it was revealed that the actress made less than her male co-stars in “American Hustle.”

Sadler recently made waves in December when she suddenly quit her job at E! News after nearly a decade of working there. She explained on her website that she left after learning that her co-host, Jason Kennedy, “made close to double my salary for the past several years.”FedEx will not end its partnership with the National Rifle Association, the company said Monday, even as other companies are heeding calls from activists and severing their ties with the organization.

The shipping company said in a statement that it sees assault-style rifles and large-capacity magazines as an “inherent potential danger.” But it added that it would not end or change its relationship with the NRA.

“The NRA is one of hundreds of organizations in our alliances/association Marketing program whose members receive discounted rates for FedEx shipping,” the company said. “FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues.”

NRA members are eligible for discounts of between 18 percent and 26 percent on certain FedEx shipping services.

Teenagers have become a leading voice in challenging the NRA in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month. Students across the country have organized walkouts, protested in front of the White House, challenged lawmakers and started social media movements such as #BoycottNRA.

David Hogg, a Parkland survivor advocating for gun reform after the shooting, has specifically been calling on FedEx and other companies to cut ties with the NRA.

“No matter who you are or what organization are I’d be a huge help if you changed your shipping service over to @ USPS or @ DHLUS or @ UPS in support of us. In fact tweet out at companies that use only use @ FedEx and demand action! Let’s get this done!” Hogg tweeted Monday before FedEx issued its statement.Silver medalists Lauren Gibbs and Elana Meyers Taylor of Team USA celebrate during the medal ceremony for Bobsleigh.

The 2018 Winter Olympics have concluded, and for the first time in two decades, women competing on Team USA brought home more medals than their male counterparts.

Team USA won a total of 23 medals in Pyeongchang, South Korea ― nine gold, eight silver and six bronze medals among them. Twelve of the 23 medals were won by women ― not including two that were achieved in mixed events (ice dancing and the team figure skating competition). When it came to the gold medals, five of the nine were won by women in history-making performances.

Cross-country skiers Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins won gold in the sprint freestyle, winning a medal in the event for Team USA for the first time since 1976 (and its first gold, to boot). Seventeen-year-old snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim won gold in the halfpipe, becoming the youngest ever gold medalist in the history of the event. The women’s hockey team won gold in the finals, beating longtime rival Canada and giving the team its first Olympic gold since the event debuted at the Winter Games in 1998.

Even when the women didn’t win gold, they still made history. Women athletes won three of six silver medals and four of six bronze medals. Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn took bronze in the downhill event to become the oldest Olympic female alpine medalist at the age of 33.

Team USA’s female athletes also surpassed their male teammates in medal count. As the Washington Post noted, only alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin, snowboarder Jamie Anderson and ice dancing siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani won two medals at the games.

There were more men on Team USA, too. A total of 244 athletes made up America’s delegation ― the largest U.S. delegation in Winter Olympics history. There were 135 men and 109 women.

After the Associated Press obtained a medal tally projection chart created by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), it became clear that Team USA did not meet the organization’s expectations for awarded medals in Peyongchang. USOC projected Team USA would bring home a target of 37 medals, setting a minimum of 25 medals and a top-line expectation of 59.The rapper T.I. was arrested on Wednesday morning in Georgia and charged with disorderly conduct and public drunkenness.

The Henry County Police Department told local news Channel 2 that the 37-year-old, whose legal name is Clifford Harris Jr., was arrested around 4 a.m.

He had arrived at the gated community where he resides but didn’t have his key, according to police. They said the “Whatever You Like” singer demanded the guard let him in and asked, “Don’t you know who I am?”

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that T.I. was “allowed into his gated community after an initial argument with the guard, but then returned on foot shortly afterward to confront the guy again.”

T.I. then reportedly called a friend who joined him to argue with the guard, which led to the police being called. The friend, who police said had a warrant out on him, was also arrested.New Jersey Democrats proposed legislation on Monday that would allow people to vote while they are in prison, a move that could expand the franchise to about 100,000 people in the state.

New Jersey, like several other states, does not allow felons to vote after their conviction, including while they are on parole or probation. If the bill becomes law, New Jersey would join just two other states ― Maine and Vermont ― in allowing any felon, including murderers, to vote while they are in jail and after they have been released.

The bill would allow prisoners to vote by mail-in ballot in the district where they lived prior to being incarcerated.

The measure comes as a handful of other states have been reexamining longstanding laws that disenfranchise felons. In Florida, where more than 1.5 million people can’t vote because a felony conviction, voters will choose in November whether to automatically restore voting rights to those who have completed their sentences.

Alabama lawmakers passed a law last year clarifying the specific felony charges that cause someone to lose the right to vote. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), unilaterally restored voting rights on a case-by-case basis to over 172,000 former felons before he left office earlier this year, something his successor, Gov. Ralph Northam (D), has pledged to continue. (A court challenge blocked McAuliffe from issuing a blanket order on the matter.)

“At the end of the day, voting is a fundamental right,” said Scott Novakowski, associate counsel at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, a group pushing for the bill in that state. “The very idea of a fundamental right is that you don’t lose your fundamental rights if you’re incarcerated or on parole.”

The idea of disenfranchising people who commit crimes has roots in ancient Greece and Rome and has existed in the United States since its founding. To some, the laws make sense.

“If you’re not willing to follow the law, then you can’t demand the right to make the law for everybody else,” said Roger Clegg, a former Justice Department official in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

State Sen. Gerald Cardinale, the ranking Republican on his chamber’s Judiciary Committee, said he hoped the bill went nowhere.

“People who make public policy should be people who are decent people in the community, people not criminals. And if you have the right to vote you have the right to make public policy,” he said in an interview. “I do not believe the average person wants to see their vote diluted by the vote of criminals who are still serving a sentence in jail.”

Some states in the 19th century began to use criminal disenfranchisement provisions as a way to block black voters from casting a ballot. Critics say those laws have left a legacy that continues to disenfranchise blacks at a disproportionately higher rate than others. According to one estimate, 1 in every 13 voting-age blacks is disenfranchised, a rate more than four times higher than that for non-African Americans.

New Jersey wrote its voting ban for people with criminal convictions into its state constitution in 1844. According to the Institute for Social Justice, five of the state’s 21 counties have almost half of the people removed from the rolls because of a felony conviction. Those same five counties have 46 percent of the state’s black population.

Democrats control both chambers of the New Jersey legislature and the governor’s mansion, and Novakowski said he is optimistic about the voting bill’s chances of passing. He noted Gov. Phil Murphy (D), elected in November, campaigned on a platform of aggressively expanding voting rights.

Murphy spokesman Dan Bryan said the governor “believes that we are a better, stronger, and more representative democracy when more New Jerseyans participate. He looks forward to working with the Legislature to pass legislation that expands access to the ballot.”

Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter, one of the Democrats supporting the bill, said New Jersey could serve as a model for other states in expanding the right to vote.

“Every person of voting age should have the ability to cast their ballot without interference and without judgment of their personal history,” she said.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22, 2018. SOPA Images via Getty Images

The Education Department announced on Monday that it will open an investigation into Michigan State University and how the school handled reports of child sexual abuse involving former doctor Larry Nassar.

“This new Title IX investigation will look at systemic issues in the University’s handling of sex-based incidents involving Dr. Larry Nassar,” Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in a press release.

Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and for several different sports teams on MSU’s campus. During this time, he sexually abused over 260 young girls and women under the guise of medical treatment. He recently received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison for child sexual abuse and child pornography.

Several of Nassar’s victims say they reported the abuse to MSU coaches and trainers over the course of two decades, but their accusations were continually disregarded or swept under the rug. According to an investigative report from the Detroit News, at least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar’s abuse and failed to report it.

According to the Education Department’s statement, the Office for Civil Rights is heading to East Lansing, Michigan, where the school is located, to join the Federal Student Aid team to begin the investigation.

“I appreciated seeing acting President [John] Engler’s directive to the entire university to cooperate fully with our ― and with all ― inquiries into the university’s actions,” DeVos said. “We expect MSU’s full and complete disclosure about its actions to protect students from sexual assault.”

MSU’s last president, Lou Anna K. Simon, resigned in January after 13 years in the role amid criticism that she did not do enough to stop Nassar’s abuse.

In a statement to HuffPost, MSU’s vice president for communications and brand strategy, Heather Swain, said the university was notified last week of the Title IX investigation.

“As we have been, MSU is cooperating fully with this and all investigations,” Swain said. “Our focus is on taking the actions that demonstrate the voices of the survivors have been heard and on creating a culture that provides a safe environment for all members of our community.”

DeVos said the crimes Nassar committed are “unimaginable,” and went on to applaud the bravery of the dozens of survivors who spoke out against him.

“The bravery shown by the survivors has been remarkable. My heart goes out to them as they have had to relive their horrific experiences and as they begin the long road to healing,” she said.

“Every student across every campus should know that I am committed to ensuring all students have access to a learning environment free from sexual misconduct and discrimination and that all institutions that fall short will be held accountable for violations of federal law,” DeVos added.

During Nassar’s sentencing hearings earlier this year, 265 survivors and family members read impact statements in court. Their statements were emotional, cathartic and powerful, taking the news cycle by storm. Many of the survivors called for investigations into MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for how poorly the organizations handled the accusations against Nassar.Oath Keepers carry rifles in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 10, 2015.

In the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a far-right armed militia group called the Oath Keepers is urging its members to station themselves outside of schools to provide protection, HuffPost has learned.

The Oath Keepers, a group of thousands of former and current police officers, first responders and military service people, is “one of the largest radical antigovernment groups in the U.S. today,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The Oath Keepers website says the group’s goal is to defend the Constitution at all costs, and that members pledge not to “obey orders to disarm the American people.”

In Indiana, at least one member of the group, Mark Cowan, stationed himself outside of a Fort Wayne high school last week. He wielded a handgun and AR-15 while keeping watch near the premises, per local outlet WPTA-21.

On Monday evening, the Oath Keepers will be holding a webinar on this type of vigilante protection, titled “The Florida School Shooting and How to Counter Renewed Efforts to Disarm Us.” According to the event description, members will be urged to “standby for a formal call to action for all Oath Keepers across the nation to do the same” as Cowan in Indiana.

“The recent school shooting in Florida is now being used by the leftist ‘blood dancers’ to push for more infringements on our right to keep and bear arms,” reads the webinar description. “We will discuss the false choice that has been intentionally set up by turning America’s schools into disarmed victim killing zones.”

The event description says politicians who are interested in infringing on the Second Amendment will cause a cycle of “repeated murder of children and raping of the Bill of Rights.”

“We’re just hoping that we can be a little added security.” - Bryan Humes, Oath Keepers

Bryan Humes, a leader in the Oath Keepers chapter in Indiana, said he’s not sure how many Oath Keepers are currently stationed outside of local schools, although he believes there are several. He said he also knows of other Oath Keepers keeping watch of schools outside of Indiana, but could not provide specific numbers.

“We’re just hoping that we can be a little added security. If the schools already have a resource officer, then the local sheriff, city and state police have another set of eyes and ears keeping an eye on things,” said Humes.

However, not all Oath Keepers agree with the strategy. The head of the Oath Keepers chapter in New York, Dan Devlin, said he will not be calling on chapter members to spend their time policing schools.

“There’s some discussion about whether or not that’s a good idea. Not all Oath Keepers are bound to do the same thing. I know that people’s intentions are good, but some of us are ex- or retired policeman and military people and sometimes you have to work with the police agencies. If they want you there, that’s one thing, but sometimes it’s a case of, they already have it covered,” Devlin said.

The group’s webinar follows President Donald Trump’s repeated proposals to arm teachers to combat school shooters.

Krista Stockman, spokeswoman for Fort Wayne Community Schools in Indiana, said she does not believe having an Oath Keeper guard a school “adds to the safety of our students.”

“At all of our schools, we have security procedures in place, including armed police officers at most buildings. We do not endorse this kind of activity.”

Parents complained to the district about the Oath Keeper’s presence outside the school last week, Stockman said.

Oath Keepers are part of “right wing anti-government extremist movement,” Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League, told HuffPost.

“None of these kids need those armed paramilitaries in front of their high schools or middle schools or what have you. That in itself is simply going to make the kids fearful,” he said.Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman was finally booted off “Celebrity Big Brother” on Sunday, but not before viewers were treated to more barbs against the Trump administration.

In her most explosive comments yet, Newman complained that she was shunned by others in the administration because she was a black woman in a White House that she compared to a “plantation.” Newman also said she was ”thinking of writing a tell-all” about her experiences.

“I was literally the only African-American woman on the senior staff,” Newman said in a montage of clips that aired in a recap episode on Saturday. “I’m inside trying to fight for my own political life while I’m going into meetings with people who are ignoring me. Because I was black, people wouldn’t even talk to me.”

When Newman finally left her job as the communications director of the White House Office of Public Liaison in December, she said to herself: “Ooh, freedom, I’ve been emancipated. I feel like I just got freed off of a plantation.”

As for her tell-all tome, Newman said President Donald Trump was “going to come after me with everything he has. Like, I’m going up against a kazillionaire.”Donald Trump’s approval rating has slumped again to match the lowest of his presidency, according to two new polls.

The surveys were conducted amid mounting activism for gun control and security clearance problems in the White House. Support for stricter gun laws has spiked to the highest level since 1993 and Americans aren’t happy with Trump’s position on the issue, CNN has found.

Despite Trump’s bullish take on his performance, the president’s approval rating fell five points over last month to 35 percent, according to a CNN survey, conducted by polling firm SSRS. That number matches the lowest rating of his presidency in December.

A separate poll by USA Today and Suffolk University’s Political Research Center found similar results, with the president’s approval rating also slipping to match the lowest point that survey has found at 38 percent, with 60 percent disapproving of the job he’s doing.

Gun control looks to be a particular problem for the president.

The CNN poll was conducted Feb. 20 to 23 amid outrage over guns in the wake of the Parkland school shooting that killed 17 people. Only a third of those polled approve of how Trump is handling gun control policy, with 54 percent disapproving, the CNN poll found. Just over 12 percent of those surveyed said they have yet to make up their mind on the issue.

CNN’s poll on the gun issue found that 70 percent of those surveyed now back stricter gun laws. That’s up significantly from 52 percent who took that position in an October survey shortly after the mass shooting in Las Vegas killed 58 people. Just 27 percent of those polled oppose more stringent laws, CNN found in its latest poll.

An increasing proportion of Americans are worried that they or a family member will become a victim of gun violence. Almost six in 10 people (57 percent) are worried now — compared with 44 percent after the 2016 mass shooting in Orlando. Fears are higher among parents of children under the age of 18 (62 percent to 55 percent for non-parents), CNN found.

The USA Today poll found that 76 percent (to 12 percent) of those polled believe that people who have been treated for mental illness should be prohibited from owning guns. The accused gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had reportedly been treated for mental illness. Despite Trump’s expressed support to toughen up background checks for gun purchases, he and Congress a year ago rolled back stricter checks on people with mental illnesses who purchase guns.

The survey also found that 63 percent (to 29 percent) of those polled believe that semi-automatic guns like the AR-15 used by the Florida shooter should be banned. The president has said he would support raising the minimum age for buying such firearms from 18 to 21, but hasn’t supported a ban and is not likely to.

The USA Today survey also found that 66 percent (to 33 percent) of those polled believe tightening gun-control laws and background checks would prevent more mass shootings.

Of those polled, only 19 percent believe there’s a ‘good to excellent’ chance Congress will take action on gun control in the foreseeable future.

The polls were also taken during more bad news for the administration, including new charges against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and following revelations of domestic abuse allegations against staffers in the White House amid continuing concerns about the lack of security clearance for personnel.

Among the least supportive groups for Trump in the CNN survey, the president’s approval stands at just five percent among Democrats, 22 percent among Americans ages 35 and younger, 23 percent among non-whites and 29 percent among women. Only 35 percent of independents approve of Trump’s performance in the White House.

Among Republicans, 80 percent approve of Trump’s performance, though that’s down a point from Trump’s lowest rating among self-described party members last September. Among people over 50, 43 percent approve of the job Trump is doing, and 42 percent of all men give him a favorable rating.

Trump’s approval rating is well behind former presidents at this point in their presidency: 12 percent behind the previous low set by Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, and 14 percent behind Barack Obama.A Hollywood stylist who worked for Ryan Seacrest for years told Variety that the TV personality repeatedly subjected her to sexual harassment and assault over seven years.

Suzie Hardy told the Hollywood trade publication that the 42-year-old Seacrest used to stand behind her in his underwear and grind his penis against her, groped her vagina on a few occasions and once slapped her buttocks so hard that it left a welt for hours.

Hardy said in the article that she stuck with the job because she was a single mother with a daughter.

“I didn’t know how to deal with it,” Hardy said. “I really didn’t. I was battling finally being in a decent financial position to breathe and be a mom, that I didn’t have to be freaking out all the time, and then dealing with this infantile celebrity person who was testing me on every level and manipulating me and knew that I was in a vulnerable position.”

Read more of Hardy’s claims at Variety.

The stylist said that after she reported Seacrest to E! News’ human resources executives in 2013, she was terminated.

Hardy, who was interviewed three times by the independent investigator, said she remained skeptical of the E! News findings.

“I felt like by the third interview, it was obvious the investigator was whitewashing it for Seacrest’s side,” she told Variety, adding that the investigator never contacted four witnesses who she said would corroborate elements of her story.

On Monday, an E! Entertainment spokesperson said in a statement, “E!’s investigation was extremely comprehensive and thorough. Over the course of a two-month process, our outside counsel interviewed more than two dozen people regarding the allegations, including multiple separate meetings with the claimant and all firsthand witnesses that she provided. The investigator is an attorney with nearly 20 years experience and is highly regarded professionally. Any claims that question the legitimacy of this investigation are completely baseless.”

Seacrest denied the initial accusations in November and is refuting Hardy’s allegations to Variety through his attorney Andrew Baum:

“On January 31st the network notified us that their independent third-party investigation had concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support her claims, effectively, clearing my client’s name. It’s telling that after my client refused to pay her money, and the E! investigation resulted as it did, that she is now coming forward to share her debunked story to the press.”

Hardy’s attorney Howard King said his client has never asked Seacrest, E! or the cable channel’s corporate parents for any payout.

Variety says Seacrest’s representatives have not shown any evidence that Hardy requested money.For some reason there’s not a full-service cleaning crew constantly tending to Reese Witherspoon’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, so she had to do it herself.

The “Wrinkle In Time” star, who’s the best thing to happen to Instagram since Beyoncé’s twins, hilariously documented her trip to visit her five-pointed friend on the app on Sunday.

“I’m running a little bit late for work today but it’s really important,” Witherspoon said on Instagram story with a furry filter. “I heard my friend is really close by, so I want to go meet her really quick and I want you guys to meet her too.”

When Witherspoon found her star, she couldn’t contain her enthusiasm and proceeded to get down on her knees to properly polish the pavement.

“This is so exciting guys, here she is!” the actress said.

“Oh, now you’re looking good, girl!” she joked, adding, “And don’t you let people walk all over you!”

Witherspoon received the honor in 2010 and and was joined by her look-a-like daughter, Ava, and son Deacon at the ceremony.

She later commemorated the moment on Instagram sharing a photo of herself at the Walk of Fame, adding, “When you run into a friend on the street” in the caption.

A group of skaters and sweepers gathered for a selfie on the ice on Saturday after the Olympic figure skating exhibition gala, an event where athletes are given an opportunity to express themselves. Hanyu definitely showed his own flair in the photo, striking a pose in the air after being hoisted up by pair skater Ondřej Hotárek of Italy.

The result is a thing of beauty.

Naturally, people freaked out across social media at the extremely extra pose. Many praised fan favorite Hanyu for always bringing the fire, as well as Hotárek for being a true friend during selfie time.

Hanyu, who has a fierce fanbase, has been known to charm hearts everywhere with his quirky personality and selflessness. After winning gold in the men’s singles competition, Hanyu ushered fellow Japanese skater Shoma Uno, the silver medalist, and Spain’s Javier Fernandez, the bronze medalist, onto his podium. The moment prompted praise from social media users who admired Hanyu’s good sportsmanship.

Hanyu is also loved for his own appreciation of lovable bear Winnie-The-Pooh. Back in 2010, the Olympian began to carry around a Winnie-The-Pooh tissue box and also ensured that a plushie would be placed on the side of rink that would “watch” him skate. Fans soon began to catch on to his love of the bear.

Fans toss him stuffed Poohs after he finishes his routines, as was widely seen at the Winter Games this year in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The skater typically donates the bears to the area’s children, because that’s the kinda guy he is.

A British actor who played a religious leader on the HBO series “Game of Thrones” has uncovered a document that sheds light on a real priest whose writings were once censored by the Roman Catholic Church.

Actor Paul Bentley was digging through folders at the Jesuit Archives in Rome when he found a paper that French priest and scientist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was pressured into signing by the church some 90 years ago.

That’s a bit ironic because in “Game of Thrones,” Bentley played the High Septon, essentially the pope for the Faith of the Seven, a dominant and politically influential religion in George R.R. Martin’s fantasy world. But in real life, he has been delving into Catholic religious history ― in particular the works of Teilhard, who was part of the Jesuit religious order and studied paleontology.

Last week, Bentley presented his research, including the long-unseen document, at Scotland’s University of Edinburgh. He also staged a reading of “Inquisition,” a play he wrote about the moral dilemma Teilhard faced before signing that document.

Teilhard’s theological writings were heavily influenced by his beliefs about evolution. The priest, who was born in 1881, attempted to blend modern science with the teachings of Christianity, arguing that evolution was progressing toward a final point of unity that would bring all creation closer to God and usher in the second coming of Christ.

Teilhard’s belief in a “cosmic redemption” didn’t sit well with the Catholic Church of his time. In 1925, he was asked to sign a document affirming six traditional church teachings about the Biblical creation story. As Bentley explained to the Scottish Catholic Observer, Teilhard acquiesced to five of the six theological statements, but struggled with one because of his scientific convictions.

“He had to sign up to all six and he was prepared to sign five of the six, but the fourth proposition he felt he couldn’t sign up to because, as a scientist, he didn’t believe it was true,” the actor said.

Eventually, Teilhard signed and affirmed all of propositions.

But even after he signed the six propositions, he faced pushback from the church for his beliefs. In 1962, the Vatican office now known as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a monitum, an official warning, against unquestioning acceptance of Teilhard’s ideas. The Jesuits banned his major works from publication during his lifetime.STOCKHOLM, Wis. ― On a cold, icy day in February, a couple dozen people were tucked into the Stockholm Pie and General Store, the heart of this tiny village along the Mississippi River. The gathering was actually sizable, considering the population of Stockholm is just 66.

Stockholm is right in Donald Trump country. Pepin County went for Trump by a solid 25 points in the last election, the first time it backed a Republican presidential candidate since 1972.

But Pepin County also voted for Democrat Tammy Baldwin by 3 percentage points, when she ran for Wisconsin’s open U.S. Senate seat in 2012. So for now, Pepin is also Baldwin territory, and the people who turned out on Presidents Day were there to meet with her and figure out how they can help her get re-elected in November.

Pepin is one of 13 unusual counties in Wisconsin that voted for Trump and Sen. Ron Johnson (R) in 2016; President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012; Gov. Scott Walker (R) in 2010, 2012 and 2014; and Baldwin in 2012. More than any other place in the state, they have gone back and forth between parties in recent years.

Pepin County and other rural areas in the western part of Wisconsin may not seem like fertile land for one of the Senate’s most liberal members. But they’re key to Baldwin’s re-election strategy this year.

Tony Bowe, a dairy farmer in Chippewa Falls, is the type of voter Baldwin needs. Bowe voted for Trump, but he said he’s also backing Baldwin, who has visited his farm in the past.

“I think she’s been working real well, especially trying to get the Dairy Pride Act passed through,” Bowe said after a roundtable discussion on dairy farming in Altoona with Baldwin.

Bowe, who said he backed Trump “because the Democrats didn’t have a good candidate,” chuckled when asked how he thinks the president is doing.

“It’s hard to say,” he said. “One day he’s one way, the next day he’s the other way.”

Baldwin is not like most of her Democratic Senate colleagues who are up for re-election from states that went to Trump and are known as moderate or conservative Democrats.

The site FiveThirtyEight, which tracks how often members of Congress vote with Trump, found that Baldwin is near the bottom ― right along with Democratic senators from significantly bluer states such as Massachusetts, New York and California.

So when Trump was looking for Senate Democrats from states he carried to potentially cross the aisle and back the tax bill, he wasn’t looking toward Baldwin.

“If your solutions are progressive solutions, I think that’s OK,” Baldwin told HuffPost in an interview.

Wisconsinites in the western part of the state who like Baldwin, however, rarely mentioned her progressive bonafides when they were naming reasons they support her. Over and over, they said she’s responsive and willing to work with others. She is, in other words, typically Midwestern nice. (Being nice is so prized that one woman at the Stockholm meet-and-greet objected to the term “Minnesota nice,” saying that state shouldn’t get to own the quality.)

“Her reaching out across the aisle to work on bills is really important...because that shows she’s hopefully able to bridge that divide,” said Todd Macklem, a teacher in Cameron who attended a gathering of local Democrats and grassroots activists for Baldwin in Rice Lake Monday night.

Many of the issues that Baldwin emphasizes when she’s back home aren’t traditionally partisan either. With the dairy farmers in Altoona, talk centered around her Dairy Pride Act ― which would bar competitive products like almond and soy milk from being labeled “milk” ― and an amendment she successfully included in the recent budget deal that provides help for dairy farmers.

She and her staff also promote her “Buy America” legislation that would require the federal government to use U.S. manufacturers for certain public projects. Trump has said he backs this idea, lending some bipartisan bonafides to Baldwin’s bill ― but the senator is always quick to note her position has nothing to do with the president.

“I have worked on ‘Buy America’ since back when Donald Trump ran beauty pageants,” Baldwin said to the crowd at Rice Lake.

Baldwin told HuffPost she thought it was “pretty great” that Trump touted the legislation, which she told the president about when she first met him. But she’s skeptical anything more will happen on his side.

“Again, I’m willing to sit down with anyone who wants to solve problems. But he’s a lot of words and no action,” she told HuffPost. “He’s never taken a follow-up of calling [Republican congressional leaders] Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and saying, let’s work together on getting this through. Then his infrastructure plan came out with no mention of Buy America, which is horrifying to me.”

It isn’t all local, nonpartisan issues. She often stresses the importance of Obamacare and criticizes the recent Republican tax law.

Baldwin said she has no problem criticizing Trump. But she isn’t making him a focus of her campaign, and she’s not bringing him up every chance she gets. Indeed, during her three-stop swing through western Wisconsin last week, she mentioned Trump only once or twice by name, although she referenced “the president” a few other times. For one of the most liberal members of the Senate, Baldwin hardly talked fiery resistance rhetoric all day long.

“I’m not afraid to stand up to anyone who’s trying to rig the system. And I’m not afraid to sit down with anyone who can help come up with solutions,” Baldwin said.

As of now, two Republicans are duking it out in the primary to face Baldwin in November. Leah Vukmir is a conservative member of the state Senate who has won endorsements from powerful Wisconsin GOP politicians.

She’s up against Kevin Nicholson, a veteran with degrees from Ivy League universities who also presents himself as a conservative. Nicholson is, however, also the former president of the national College Democrats of America who spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Supporters say he’s a fresh face who came around to the power of conservative ideas, while detractors say he’s an opportunist who can’t be trusted.

But in addition to running for re-election in a state that has been trending Republican, Baldwin is up against an enormous amount of conservative spending and the political machine of the state’s Republican governor, who is also on the ballot this year.

Conservative groups have so far spent at least $3.1 million against Baldwin, which is more than what all the other Democratic Senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to a Center for Responsive Politics report in November.

Those figures reflect what these groups have publicly reported to the Federal Election Commission. But the Baldwin campaign has tracked the spending on ads ― which so-called dark money groups don’t necessarily have to report to the FEC ― and found there’s even more money flowing into the state.

According to data from the Baldwin campaign, outside groups have spent $6.3 million against her. About $3.1 million of that has come from groups connected to Illinois billionaire Dick Uihlein, who is supporting Nicholson. And $3 million has come from groups affiliated with the conservative megadonors, Charles and David Koch.

Liberal groups, meanwhile, have spent about $3.1 million to support Baldwin.

It’s not a fluke that there’s so much money on the air now against Baldwin, one of the last remaining Democrats serving statewide. The Koch brothers have made clear that their strategy is to go up early, to shape voters’ opinions long before the election.

But expect this dark money to stay on the air until the end too. In 2016, when much of the GOP establishment stopped investing in the race, because it figured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) would lose, conservative super PACs stayed on the air. Ultimately, all that money helped him pull off a surprise upset of his Democratic opponent, Russ Feingold.

“Special interests have special interests, and I stand up to them,” Baldwin said, on why she’s facing so much conservative spending. “It sometimes defies the imagination how much change we’ve seen with regard to spending on campaigns.”

Republican ads against Baldwin initially focused on her support for Obamacare, but as that issue has receded for Republicans, they’ve focused more on her opposition to the tax law and on a scandal at the Veterans Affairs’ medical center in Tomah, Wisconsin, which is likely to come up more throughout the race.

The GOP has accused Baldwin of not acting aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at the facility, where the Center for Investigative Reporting has noted there have been dozens of suspicious deaths.

Baldwin ended up firing an aide and disciplined three others over the controversy and introduced legislation intended to address opiate drug prescriptions at the VA. VoteVets, a progressive group, recently went up with an ad trying to counter some of the Republican messaging on Tomah.

One major thing Baldwin has going for her this time is the energy of the resistance on the left. Baldwin said the difference between this year and her run in 2012 is “night and day” in terms of the grassroots help she’s getting.

That energy showed its force in Wisconsin state Senate district 10. Democrat Patty Schachtner pulled off a surprise victory in a special election in this district bordering Minnesota in January, winning by 11 percentage points.

The seat was solidly red in recent years. A Republican, who left to join Walker’s Cabinet, had held the state Senate seat since 2001. Trump won the district by 17 points. Walker called Schachtner’s win a “wake-up call” for his party.

Schachtner said she never expected to win. She figured that if she lost by 10 points, it would be considered a successful race.

She credited her victory, in part, to the volunteers who promoted her candidacy: Groups like the Forward Action Wisconsin Network and Indivisible chapters were incredibly active. Schachtner also said she appreciated the support of Postcards to Voters ― a national network of volunteers who handwrite personal postcards to voters in districts all over the country. She said people in her district who received those postcards really appreciated them.

“That big money machine is going to be there, but it’s really that grassroots network ― it’s really there,” Schachtner said.

Schachtner said she knew of plenty of folks who voted for Trump; but they told her they backed her because they knew and trusted her. She didn’t talk about Walker or Trump in her race.

Her advice to Baldwin on how much to mention the president? “Never.”"We believe that it’s probably time to go ahead and call the question on the Goodlatte bill,” said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows. Alex Wong/Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― House Freedom Caucus leaders are pushing a legislative gambit this week in which roughly a dozen conservatives offer their support for the farm bill in exchange for a vote on a hardline immigration bill. The scheme would at least temporarily kill an effort from moderate Republicans to pass an immigration plan palatable to Democrats.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) emerged from a meeting with the conservative group late Tuesday night, telling reporters that they had not taken an official position on making a vote on the immigration bill a condition of their support for the farm bill. But Meadows said a “significant number” of conservatives would be “moved” if leadership promised a vote on the hardline immigration bill authored by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), which is also known as the “Goodlatte bill.”

“Since we’re whipping the farm bill very hard for a vote this week, we believe that it’s probably time to go ahead and call the question on the Goodlatte bill as well,” Meadows said.

Meadows noted it was his understanding that voting on the Goodlatte bill would effectively kill a discharge petition that Republicans who favor a fix to the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals or DACA program have been pushing. The discharge petition could be used to force a vote on a number of immigration proposals if 218 members sign on. (Moderate Republicans are using the Goodlatte bill as a vehicle for a rule that allows different immigration proposals to get a vote, including one they and Democrats prefer.)

Meadows acknowledged that Republicans supportive of a DACA fix could still get another discharge petition rolling to force a vote, but said the bigger issue for them would be time. “The clock would start all over again,” he said, noting there are certain rules in how many legislative days it takes for a discharge petition to ripen before it’s eligible for a vote.

Meadows noted that conservatives might not have enough votes to pass the Goodlatte bill, but he said conservatives in his group would still support the farm bill as long as they got a vote on the immigration bill, as their primary objective at the moment seems to be killing the discharge petition.

“Mark Meadows said conservatives in his group would support the farm bill as long as they got a vote on the so-called Goodlatte bill on immigration.”

GOP leadership already promised the Freedom Caucus a vote on the Goodlatte bill back during spending negotiations months ago, but leadership still hasn’t brought up the legislation. Asked why the Freedom Caucus would trust leadership again on holding the vote, Meadows made it clear he wanted a vote on the Goodlatte bill this week, concurrent with the farm bill, though he also said he would accept assurances from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to put it on the floor next week.

The Freedom Caucus is in some position to negotiate because leadership is still clearly short on the votes to pass the farm bill. There are a number of moderates who are apparently uncomfortable with the farm bill’s food stamp provisions, and conservatives seem somewhat indifferent ― maybe even slightly opposed ― to the legislation over a host of issues, notably some concerns that there aren’t enough savings in the five-year reauthorization of farm provisions and the food stamp program.

With only a few Democrats expected to support the farm bill ― Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told HuffPost Monday night he thought there might be some Democrats voting for the bill, but not many ― Republicans need to find votes from either conservative or moderate Republicans. But with moderates looking ungettable, it’s the conservatives who are in the driver’s seat to negotiate.

Giving in to the Freedom Caucus’ demands of a vote on the immigration bill could always endanger support from moderates, but if the Freedom Caucus holds strong, it’s hard to see GOP leaders finding the votes elsewhere. There are roughly 35 members in the Freedom Caucus, and while not every member is participating in this gambit, one member told HuffPost there are around a dozen and a half Freedom Caucus members who are.

The other option for GOP leaders is to simply ignore the Freedom Caucus demands and press ahead, hoping that adoption of some individual amendments could be enough to win over just enough Republicans. Plus, the farm bill isn’t exactly must-pass legislation. Congress could end up doing a one-year extension of existing programs, which might happen regardless of whether the House passes the farm bill if the Senate doesn’t take up the measure.
