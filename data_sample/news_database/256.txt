"Black Panther" is the third film Coogler has directed, following "Fruitvale Station" and "Creed." The 31-year-old Oakland native told the San Francisco Chronicle that he used his own struggles with his cultural identity and desperate need for positive representation of Africa on screen as fuel for this project.“You see media that can make you feel ashamed to be African. They can make it feel like it’s a shameful thing,” Coogler said. “I think it’s not. For me, the biggest thing on this was making this awesome, globe-trotting political thriller that just happens to be about Africans. It’s the best way to accomplish that goal and that’s what Marvel was interested in doing — that’s what I was interested in doing.”Instead of supporting a bill to provide female inmates with free and unlimited menstrual products, the Arizona Department of Corrections said it is revising its sanitary pad policy to try to put the issue to rest.

The department said in a statement Tuesday that inmates will now be granted 36 menstrual pads a month, up from the previous allowance of 12 pads. Tampons or other sanitary products would still have to be purchased.

“The department will continue to provide sanitary napkins free of charge to all of its female inmates, regardless of need,” the statement said.

It added: “As is the current practice, an inmate may request and, without charge, receive additional pads, if necessary. Additional product options will continue to be available through the inmate store.”

“We believe this change addresses and resolves, in an appropriate and timely fashion, the concerns raised in the last week,” the department said.

The announcement comes in the wake of news in recent days that state Rep. T.J. Shope (R) had decided not to hear a bill that would guarantee female inmates unlimited access to menstrual products.

Introduced by state Rep. Athena Salman (D), House Bill 2222 would give incarcerated women a free, unlimited supply of menstrual products, including tampons, pads, cups and sponges.

The bill narrowly passed its first hearing in the House Military, Veterans and Regulatory Affairs Committee. It then moved on to the Rules Committee, chaired by Shope, who said he doesn’t intend to hear the bill. Without a hearing from Shope, the bill is essentially dead.

Matt Specht, the House Republican communications director, cited the Department of Corrections’ policy revision in justifying Shope’s decision not to hear the bill.

“In light of the Arizona Department of Correction’s decision to revise their administrative policy on feminine hygiene products, HB 2222 would now be redundant and Rep. Shope does not intend to hear it in the House Rules Committee,” Specht said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.

Shope’s decision not to hear the bill prompted dozens of women to respond on social media using the hashtag #LetItFlow. Some took their complaint a step further and said they were sending the representative pads and tampons in the mail with a note urging him to act on the bill.

Rebecca McHood, an activist who helped spearhead the response, was wary of the Department of Corrections’ assumption that its new policy would solve the issue.

“The Department of Corrections could have changed this policy at any time before this, and they haven’t,” she told HuffPost on Tuesday. “They just made a policy change, but there’s no statute keeping them from going back.”

The Department of Corrections is currently facing up to $650,000 in fines for failing to improve health care in state prisons. McHood, who is running as an independent candidate for the Arizona Senate, said providing female inmates with unlimited access to menstrual products is a “humanitarian issue” and shouldn’t be controversial.

“There’s no means without a statute to guarantee the humane treatment of our sisters who are in prison,” she said.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons announced a similar new policy last year, and other states may follow suit. But given that the majority of incarcerated women are housed in state prisons and local jails, the federal policy affects fewer than 10 percent of female inmates.The interview appeared to validate a Wall Street Journal report that Trump’s lawyer arranged a $130,000 payment to Clifford in October 2016 to buy her silence about the relationship. Trump’s legal team and Clifford initially denied both the affair and the payment.

But on Tuesday, Cohen acknowledged to The New York Times that he’d paid Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket ― although he would not address why he made the payment or whether Trump was aware at the time.

“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Cohen told the Times. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”

Another article published Tuesday at The Daily Beast reported that Cohen is shopping a book proposal about Trump that would discuss Clifford’s story.

In the wake of these reports, Rodriguez said her client is now free to speak publicly about her alleged relationship with Trump and will soon announce how and when she will do so.

Rodriguez, Clifford and the White House press office did not respond to requests for comment.Veterans Affairs Secretary David J. Shulkin and his chief of staff committed ethics violations that saddled taxpayers for extravagances on a trip to Europe last summer, according to an inspector general’s findings released Wednesday.

Shulkin’s 10-day trip to London and Copenhagen was planned under the guise of business travel, but involved only 3-1/2 working days, according to the report. He effectively used a VA subordinate as “a personal travel concierge” to plan leisure activities, and improperly accepted free tickets to the Wimbledon tennis match, the report said.

Shulkin’s chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, doctored language in an email from another VA official to falsely convince government ethics officials that Shulkin was receiving an award from the Danish government, according to the inspector general. She used that lie as justification for Shulkin’s wife, Merle Bari, to be included in the trip, said the report, which noted investigators found no evidence that Shulkin knew about the falsehood.

Shulkin is among five current or former Cabinet members under President Donald Trump who have come under investigation by their agencies’ inspectors general over taxpayer-funded travel. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last year after billing taxpayers more than $1 million for military and private flights, and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt this week claimed security concerns force him to stick taxpayers for his first-class travel.

Questions about Shulkin’s Europe trip were first raised in September by The Washington Post.

The VA probe recommends that Shulkin reimburse the government for more than $4,000 spent on his wife’s airfare.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Shulkin’s office is still reviewing the report.

“Accountability and transparency are important values at VA under President Trump, and we look forward to reviewing the report and its recommendations in more detail before determining an appropriate response,” he said in a statement to HuffPost.

Investigators also found that Shulkin misused VA resources by instructing a VA program specialist to work with his wife planning several days of leisure activities, including tours of palaces, an impromptu dinner in Sweden, a river cruise and several other high-priced excursions.

“Personal conveniences” added more than $15,000 to the cost of the trip, including last-minute flight changes to avoid longer layovers and a flight change so that Shulkin and his wife could attend Wimbledon with expensive tickets gifted to them by Victoria Gosling, a U.K. woman involved in several sports governing bodies, the inspector general found.

Shulkin claimed Gosling is his wife’s friend, which would allow for a “personal friendship” exception to the rules against accepting such gifts. But investigators found Gosling said she didn’t even know the name of Shulkin’s wife. The report recommends that Shulkin reimburse Gosling for the tickets.

The trip in total cost the VA at least $122,334, the report found. Because Shulkin’s team failed to properly document expenses, the investigators couldn’t fully assess how much of the spending was misused. The investigators concluded that the VA should audit all of the trip’s expenses.Anyone? Anyone know that Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs will increase costs for American consumers? That’s the message from U.S. retailers who launched an ad on Monday inspired by a scene from the cult classic “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”

Economist and actor Ben Stein ― “Ferris Bueller’s” memorably impassive teacher ― stars in the new ad, explaining that tariffs are “B-A-D economics.”

A “student” in the ad, which you can watch above, suggests that Trump’s tariffs will “raise prices on everything from clothes to cars. I guess it’s pretty serious.”

The ad by the National Retail Federation ends: “Tell Washington: tariffs are B-A-D economics.”

The ad began airing Monday on “Fox & Friends,” and will air this weekend on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and ABC’s “Roseanne.”

The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and newsprint that have raised costs for newspapers and a variety of manufacturers. Experts predict that higher prices will affect all consumers.

Matthew Shay, CEO of the retail federation, warned that a trade war will erase the benefits of tax cuts “and result in higher prices for a wide range of consumer products.”

As for jobs, “the new tariffs are likely to lead to a net loss in U.S. employment,” the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded in a blog post last month. The post cited an earlier report citing a similar effort in 2002 that cost some 200,000 American jobs.

The steel industry — which the tariffs are expected to help — employs some 140,000 workers. Steel-intensive manufacturers that employ some 2 million workers are expected to be hurt by the tariffs.DACA recipients and their supporters call for renewal of the program outside Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on Jan. 22, 2018.

A second federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, dealing another blow to the president’s efforts to end protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children.

The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California. Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis’ order won’t have any immediate effect on Dreamers.

But the second injunction marks a win for Trump’s opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress.

It could also complicate Trump’s own efforts in the courts. His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process.

The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration’s request ― unless the new injunction delays that process. As of Tuesday, the justices were only scheduled to consider a request to overturn the injunction in the consolidated case out of California, according to Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing the administration over DACA.

Trump declared he would rescind DACA in September, claiming it was unconstitutional. The White House aimed to terminate the program in phases, allowing recipients whose work permits and deportation protections would expire by March 5 to apply for renewal during a four-week window, but barring all new applicants. The plan was that Dreamers whose permits were set to expire after March 5 would be unable to apply for renewal, creating that deadline for Congress to act before an estimated 1,000 people per day began losing protections.

Under the injunctions, however, those who have been approved for DACA are eligible to keep renewing it until the courts decide otherwise.

Because President Barack Obama created the program by executive action, Trump has the authority to scrap it. But the consolidated New York lawsuit ― which combines a case originally filed on behalf of DACA recipient Martín Jonathan Batalla Vidal with a suit filed by attorneys general from 15 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia ― argues that the administration violated DACA recipients’ due process rights and the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act when changing the policy. The APA requires federal officials to offer a reasonable justification before changing a major policy.

The Trump administration’s claim that the program is unconstitutional isn’t likely to stand up in court, according to Garaufis’ order. Trump’s decision to end DACA appears instead to be “arbitrary and capricious” and “an abuse of discretion,” the judge wrote.

“The question before the court is thus not whether Defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,” the order says. “Based on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that Defendants have not done so.”

In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley responded, “Today’s order doesn’t change the Department of Justice’s position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens.”

The judge did not weigh in on the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump violated the Constitution by discriminating against DACA recipients based on animus toward Latinos. Nearly 80 percent of DACA recipients are originally from Mexico, a country the president has accused of sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S.

These injunctions are just a stop-gap solution for DACA recipients. Although they can still apply for renewal, it can take months for permits to be reviewed and approved, and many people’s protections are likely to lapse in the meantime. And, of course, the Trump administration is fighting to overturn the rulings and go back to rejecting applicants.The antics of the North Korean cheerleading squad at the Winter Olympics just got really weird ― at least in a comedy bit on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Tuesday.

WASHINGTON ― The Justice Department’s watchdog ― currently overseeing a politically sensitive investigation into how DOJ and the FBI acted in the lead up to the 2016 election ― told Congress this week that the Trump administration’s budget request would “substantially inhibit” his office’s work.

In a little noticed message included in a congressional budget submission, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote that President Donald Trump’s budget request would “essentially keep the OIG’s budget flat in FY 2018 and FY 2019 even as budgets for other Department law enforcement components such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are recommended for increases.”

Horowitz’s office is currently wrapping up a long-awaited investigation that will examine the actions of former FBI director James Comey and other Justice Department officials in the lead up to the 2016 election. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has blamed Comey’s actions on her electoral college loss, while Trump has convinced many of his supporters that the FBI was actually biased against him.

Horowitz said that under the Trump budget, he’d be forced to reduce his office’s staffing levels by 4 percent. The Trump administration asked for a $95.886 million budget for the Office of the Inspector General for fiscal year 2019. Horowitz wrote that his office needs a $100.106 million budget for that year, noting that there’s a request pending before Congress for $97.380 million for the 2018 fiscal year.

“Funding at $100.106 million represents a modest increase from our FY 2018 budget request of $97.380 million, and will allow the OIG to maintain its current services into FY 2019, have budget parity with other DOJ law enforcement components, hire five additional lawyers and one non-lawyer to handle the substantial increase in FBI and other whistleblower retaliation matters that we are investigating, and permit us to sustain our efforts to curb waste, fraud, and abuse in DOJ programs,” Horowitz wrote.

Horowitz’s office conducts audits and investigations for the Justice Department, which has more than 100,000 employees. Horowitz said that his office recovered nearly $28 million in the 2017 fiscal year and identified another $27 million in potential cost savings.

“We appreciate the support we have received both from the Department’s leadership and Congress for this important oversight work. However, in order for the OIG to continue to promote more efficient and effective DOJ programs, and to continue to conduct effective oversight of the Department’s largest components, the OIG must be adequately funded,” Horowitz wrote. “The OIG cannot effectively oversee the Department’s largest components if their budgets and staff grow disproportionately to ours.”

Horowitz’s office recently met with lawmakers, discussing his ongoing probe of the DOJ’s handling of the Clinton email investigation ahead of the 2016 election. The inspector general’s investigation turned up text messages exchanged by two FBI employees that were subsequently turned over to Congress and have provided fodder for President Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill who have used anti-Trump texts to portray the FBI as a law enforcement agency that attempted to stop Trump’s election.

Back in November 2017, Horowitz told Congress that he hoped they would release the Clinton email report in March or April 2018.WASHINGTON ― The personal attorney of the president of the United States acknowledged this week that he paid an adult film star $130,000 just before the 2016 presidential election. The bombshell admission would have almost certainly rocked any previous administration, raising a whole host of questions, like, “Did this in any way violate campaign finance law?” and, “Dear God, why would the president’s lawyer ever pay a porn star?”

Republican lawmakers, however, said on Wednesday they had no interest whatsoever in the matter. They ducked and dodged questions about the payment, explaining they were not closely following a story about a president and a porn star. Some begged off inquiries by saying they were wholly engrossed by this week’s ongoing debate over immigration in the Senate.

“That’s the least thing on my mind right now,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost.

Graham, who was one of the House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, added he was “not remotely curious” about why the lawyer paid a porn star $130,000 shortly before Donald Trump won the White House race.

Trump’s long-time lawyer, Michael Cohen, told The New York Times on Tuesday that he paid Stephanie Clifford, the adult film entertainer known as Stormy Daniels, out of his own pocket and that “neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction.”

“The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,” Cohen said in a statement to the Times.

The statement did not address whether Trump himself had anything to do with the matter. Nor did he answer questions about whether Trump had been aware of the payment, why it was made or whether Cohen had made similar payments to other people in the past, according to the Times.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported the payment was made to Clifford to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Trump in 2006, the year after he married his third wife, Melania, and a few months after the birth of their son, Barron. Daniels was reportedly paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement and keep silent about the affair.

Cohen and White House officials have previously denied the affair occurred. In his Tuesday statement about the payment, Cohen said, “Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump.”

Clifford supposedly revealed the affair in previously unpublished 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly that the outlet wrote about after the Wall Street Journal story.

After initially denying the affair and the payment, Clifford over the past month has been silent or given coy answers about her relationship with Trump.

But on Wednesday Clifford’s manager, Gina Rodriguez, said that she believes the porn actress is now free to discuss her alleged sexual encounter with Trump because Cohen had invalidated the non-disclosure agreement by publicly discussing the payment.

“Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,” Rodriguez told The Associated Press.

If Clifford does end up revealing more information about her alleged relationship with the president ― including why she received the $130,000 ― GOP lawmakers can expect additional questions about whether it had been made properly during the campaign. Common Cause, the government watchdog group, has argued the payment was an in-kind contribution to Trump’s campaign.

“I’m going to leave those inquiries to others” - Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)

For now, however, most Republican senators seemed more comfortable simply punting on thorny questions about the subject.

“I would think that that’d be something — instead of you asking me — I would expect if it’s a campaign issue, that the Federal Election Commission would be looking into it,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told HuffPost.

Other GOP senators similarly said it was someone else’s job to investigate the matter.

“I’m going to leave those inquiries to others,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said. He added that he was chiefly focused on “substance and policy” on issues like health care and immigration.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said it was simply “not a high priority at this time,” while Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said he wasn’t sure “whether there’s congressional interest” in opening an investigation.

Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), on the other hand, conjectured that the “press will do more than investigate it.” Asked if he was personally curious why a lawyer for a president would ever pay such a large sum to a porn star ― or anyone, for that matter ― Shelby demurred.

“I don’t know why a lot of things happen around here,” he said.

Several Democratic senators, meanwhile, suggested that it wasn’t too hard to figure out why an attorney for a former reality television star who once proudly graced the cover of Playboy magazine would pay a porn star just before the election.

“I think it’s pretty obvious why he did it,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-V.t.) said before walking into an elevator.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Republicans would be more interested in investigating the story if a lawyer for a Democratic president had made a similar admission.VH1 MTV

By now, even casual “RuPaul’s Drag Race” fans have likely heard the hottest “All Stars” season three theory: Bebe Zahara Benet is a mole. What started as a Facebook comment from one fan named Chris White has blown up into a conspiracy that has fans going full Carrie Mathison with their proverbial cork boards to prove it right.

As first laid out by White, the theory hinges on RuPaul’s use of The Handmaid’s Tale as a recurring motif this season. Chad Michaels and Alaska, the first two “All Stars” winners, keep appearing at the end of the episodes in full Handmaid garb, and Ru’s messages to the eliminated queens include a lot of jargon from the Margaret Atwood novel and Hulu series adaptation. White thinks that’s no coincidence, and like in the fictional Republic of Gilead, Bebe is acting as a mole for the higher powers — in this case, the judges. Considering she won the first season, she’s the perfect pick for this:, loyal to Ru, but not very well-known to the audience.

“Bebe is going to coast by never landing in the bottom two or winning a challenge; she will always be safe,” White explained. “When the finale comes, Bebe will be announced as the mole and helps Ru decide which queen will become the winner. By doing this, it allows Bebe to showcase her talent to new fans every episode without her winning a single thing from lip syncs to the grand prize since she already won. This also allows Mama Ru to do an “All Stars” season of just winners only in the future.”

I was personally lukewarm on this theory — until the most recent episode of “All Stars,” which featured Bebe being called safe despite a pretty terrible challenge performance in “The Bitchelor.” Honestly, I can’t explain her being safe and Aja being in the bottom three without relying on the mole theory. And so I find myself believing White more and more, though I’d make some adjustments to his thinking (namely, I think the twist will be revealed during this season’s “Revenge of the Queens” equivalent episode, not the finale).

Details aside, the bigger question is: What if this theory is correct? What if Bebe is the mole? Here are my four big takeaways:

It would speak tremendously to Bebe’s acting skills. That’s no small thing: Bebe’s season didn’t have any acting challenges. This is a case for her to flex a muscle that all other Drag Race queens get to, and do it in an all-new way.

It would make the all-winners season seem like a near-inevitability.

When RuPaul first floated the idea of a winners season on her podcast with Michelle Visage, “What’s the Tee?”, I brushed it off as a flight of fancy. Bebe’s announcement for this cast made it only seem less likely. But if I’m a former winner, and I see how Bebe’s star is rising thanks to the exposure on “All Stars” Season 3, and I have the chance to get in on that myself? I’m way more likely to do it now than I was before. If Ru really wants to do it, this is the best way to make it happen.

It would make a potential Trixie Mattel win even more special.

Trixie has talked previously about how she went to see Bebe her first time in drag at 21. A single comment — “Stick with drag, it’ll take you anywhere” — inspired her to keep going. Now imagine Bebe gets to help choose Trixie as the winner of “All Stars” Season 3. That’d be pretty damn heartwarming.

It would be, to quote Bebe herself, the gag of the season.

RuPaul’s Drag Race is a show that does best when it’s shocking the audience. Look at Season 9: What was perceived as a fairly weak season was saved by a mask, a rebellion, and a format change. This season, for all its delights, has been pretty much a replication of “All Stars” Season 2 so far. It’s going to need a major shock to rise to the heights of the most iconic seasons. Bebe being the mole would do that. Executed well, it could honestly elevate the show to challenge Season 5 and “All Stars” Season Two as the best of the series.Cameron Spencer via Getty Images

American snowboarder Shaun White has won Winter Olympics gold for a historic third time in the snowboarding halfpipe, besting the field in Pyeongchang with a phenomenal 97.75 score in his final run and becoming the first person to win a trio of gold medals in the sport.

White led the field after the first round, as judges gave his initial effort a 94.25 score, but Japanese snowboarder Ayumu Hirano edged to the front with a 95.25 in the second round.

In the last round, with the last run of the final, White managed to pull out a near-perfect run to steal gold.

REDEMPTION FOR SHAUN WHITE!



HE WINS GOLD on his final run in men's snowboard halfpipe! #BestOfUS #WinterOlympics https://t.co/E1XuTKbGvd pic.twitter.com/b4Yn2jVVGN — NBC Olympics (@NBCOlympics) February 14, 2018

Hirano scored the silver medal, while Australian snowboarder Scotty James won bronze.

The 31-year-old White is now on top of the all-time Olympic gold medal tally for snowboarding, which was introduced to the Winter Games in 1998, with wins at the 2006 Turin Games and the 2010 Vancouver Games in addition to his gold in Pyeongchang.

NBC has been celebrating White and his quest to make history with a third gold medal win, though the network was called out this week for failing to acknowledge that the athlete settled a sexual harassment suit in 2017.

Asked about the harassment allegations on Wednesday, White told reporters that, “I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not gossip and stuff.”

White joins fellow American Kelly Clark (who won a gold and two bronzes) on top of the overall medal tally for the sport. Both have three Olympic snowboarding medals each.

In another milestone, White’s win was the 100th gold won by U.S. athletes in the Winter Games.

It was also the fourth gold for the United States in Pyeongchang, with all four medals coming in snowboarding events. U.S. athletes have managed to claim golds in all the snowboarding competitions thus far, with Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson taking honors in men’s and women’s slopestyle, and Chloe Kim winning the women’s halfpipe.

After White’s disappointing showing at the 2014 Sochi Games and a scary practice fall that left him with 62 stitches on his face last October, he’s reclaimed his place on top of the snowboarding world after the phenomenal performance. The early signs pointed to a White win after he posted a 98.50 score on his second run in the qualifying rounds of the halfpipe on Tuesday.

“I started seeing everyone putting these great runs in and I figured I would step it up,” White told NBC Sports. “They motivated me to send it on that last one.” He later tweeted that he had been looking forward to the final for four years, since his disappointing performance in Sochi, where he dropped out of the slopestyle competition and placed fourth in the halfpipe.U.S. Olympic skier Gus Kenworthy may be a king on the slopes.

But folks online think he’s also a dead ringer for the (fallen) “King in the North.”

Earlier this week, Twitter users decided that Kenworthy bore an uncanny resemblance to actor Richard Madden, aka Robb Stark in “Game of Thrones.”

Fox-4 Dallas’ reporter Edward Egros made the statement via Twitter on Monday as skaters were competing in this year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

But it’s not a sport. https://t.co/SGw3KwGr7n — Edward Egros (@EdwardEgrosFox4) February 12, 2018

Egros claimed in a follow-up tweet that figure skating was “too subjective” to “have quantifiable metrics that determine a winner” and so was “an art form.”

“Still, figure skating is really hard,” he added.

Vincent Zhou, who at 17-years-old is Team USA’s youngest Olympian competing in this year’s games, told Egros to “stick to reporting on ‘real sports,’ do your job, and we’ll do ours.”

Does that logic apply to all of the “sports” that include any degree of subjectivity. Any sport with an umpire, a ref, or an adjudicator.

Nearly three years after the TV series “Parks and Recreation” aired its final episode, some of the cast members have reunited to pay tribute the sitcom’s most enduring legacy: Galentine’s Day.

Every Feb. 13, women around the world celebrate each other, sans romantic partners, to “come and kick it, breakfast-style,” Amy Poheler’s character explains on the show.

The comedian posed for a pic with fellow “Parks and Rec” alums Rashida Jones, Aubrey Plaza and Kathryn Hahn. It’s unclear if any frittatas were present.

″💘happy happy galentine’s day. these women keep me alive. 💘,” Plaza wrote alongside the photo.

Jones shared the same pic, but added the caption, “Galentine’s Day! Forever and ever 💖💕💝.”

Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls, the former “Saturday Night Live” star’s organization, encouraged fans to share how they’re ringing in what should be by now a national holiday.

All these years later, the “Parks and Recreaction” cast seems to be one of the few former TV series crews whose members actually still like each other.

Last summer, Poehler, Retta, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, who was married to Plaza’s character in the series, reunited at the premiere of Plaza’s film “Ingrid Goes West.” Pratt actually joined Plaza on the red carpet, and the two posed for photos together.

Watch some highlights from Galentine’s Day below.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), pictured, and Washington's secretary of state, Kim Wyman, jointly announced the state would pay for postage on mail-in ballots in 2018. Fotoholica Press via Getty Images

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman (R) announced Tuesday that the state would pay the postage for all ballots in the 2018 general and primary elections.

Officials said they hope that paying the postage will eliminate a barrier and make it easier for people to vote. Washington, Oregon and Colorado are the only three states that conduct all their elections by mail, but Washington will be the first state to pay for postage among them.

The state will contribute a combined $1.2 million to cover election postage, but only for contests this year, Wyman and Inslee said. The governor added that he and Wyman plan to lobby the legislature so the state can pay for the postage permanently.

“More voter participation makes for a stronger democracy. Because Washington is a vote-by-mail state, pre-paid postage is one important way we can reduce barriers to casting ballots,” Inslee said in a statement.

“Finding a stamp and placing [the ballot] in the mailbox could be a barrier to someone participating in the process ... Not many people have a book of stamps in the drawer like they used to.” - Erich Ebel, spokesman for Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman

The push for funding came after King County, home of Seattle and the state’s most populous county, approved $381,000 in funds to pay for the postage on its residents’ ballots. Wyman requested additional funding to make sure it would be just as easy to vote in other parts of the state.

The move was particularly important this year because there are elections in districts that contain King as well as neighboring counties, and it would be unfair if some voters had to pay to vote for a candidate while others did not, Wyman spokesman Erich Ebel told HuffPost.

“This is about leveling the playing field and making elections equal for all citizens of Washington State,” Wyman said in a statement.

“Somebody finding a 49 cent stamp and placing [the ballot] in the mailbox could be a barrier to someone participating in the process,” Ebel explained. “Not everybody has a 49 cent stamp. The data that has been uncovered in those few test examples has shown that millennials and people who are of a younger generation, they do most of their communication via email and texting and phone calls. Not many people have a book of stamps in the drawer like they used to.”

(Perhaps strengthening his own argument, Ebel later acknowledged he didn’t realize the price of a stamp had in fact gone up to 50 cents.)

It can be hard to pin voter turnout on a single factor, but King County tested prepaid postage in two 2017 special elections and saw a correlation with higher turnout.

Charles Stewart, an MIT professor who is founding director of the MIT Election Data + Science lab, cautioned that there needs to be more research to understand the effect of a state paying postage on ballots.

“In the end, whether paying for return postage increases the number of votes cast in an election is an empirical question,” Stewart said in an email. “I would prefer for us to answer these questions empirically, before just jumping in to pay the cost.”

Stewart also said he wasn’t a big fan of returning ballots through the mail because people lose track of who handles their ballot once they put it in the mailbox. Washington has already invested in drop boxes where people can deliver their ballots without a stamp, and Stewart said he would like to see the state create more of those.Snowboarder Shaun White responded on Wednesday to sexual harassment allegations that resurfaced this week ahead of his winning performance in the halfpipe event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

During a press conference held shortly after the snowboarder won his third career gold medal, White was asked about the allegations, which were first made public in a 2016 lawsuit. In court filings obtained by Deadspin at the time, White’s former bandmate, Lena Zawaideh, accused him of having “repeatedly sexually harassed her and forced his authoritarian management style on her for over seven years.” The suit was reportedly settled privately last year.

“I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not, you know, gossip,” White told reporters on Wednesday of the accusations.

Asked whether he thought the controversy would tarnish his legacy, the 31-year-old said: “I don’t think so. I am who I am and proud of who I am. And my friends love me and vouch for me and I think that stands on its own.”

Later on Wednesday, White apologized for using the word “gossip,” telling NBC’s “Today” show that “it was a poor choice of words to describe such a sensitive subject in the world today.”

U.S. Snowboarding and Freeskiing event director Nick Alexakos eventually cut off the journalists, telling them the interview should focus on the competition.

White had previously admitted to sending sexually explicit texts to Zawaideh, but denied her other allegations.

“Many years ago, I exchanged texts with a friend who is now using them to craft a bogus lawsuit,” he told TMZ in 2016.

According to the lawsuit, White “sent sexually explicit and graphic images to Zawaideh of engorged and erect penises, forced her to watch sexually disturbing videos, including videos sexualizing human fecal matter, and made vulgar sexual remarks to her such as, ‘Don’t forget to suck his balls!’ when commenting on her boyfriend.”A Colorado teacher has been charged with child abuse and third-degree assault after allegedly assaulting a student for not standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.

Karen Smith, who has been employed at the Boulder Valley School District for 20 years as a physical education teacher, was placed on paid leave on Feb. 1 after she was accused of forcibly lifting a student to his feet by his jacket when he refused to stand for the pledge. That student, who has not been named because he is a minor, was then removed from the classroom by Smith, according to The Daily Camera.

On Wednesday, the Boulder County District Attorney’s office announced formal charges against Smith.

Principal Mike Medina sent a letter to students’ parents to update them on the investigation.

“I, again, want to reaffirm that our focus remains firmly on our students,” Medina said in the letter.

Both of Smith’s charges are misdemeanors, and she was released Wednesday with a summons following her processing.When Olympian Lindsey Vonn realized it was Valentine’s Day, she didn’t want to be left out in the cold.

So the single skier, whose much-publicized relationship with golfer Tiger Woods ended in 2015, took to Twitter in an attempt to crowd source romance from Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Lindsey’s response?Democrats flipped a GOP-held Florida state House seat on Tuesday, handing the party its 36th state legislative pickup nationwide since Donald Trump won the presidency.

Democrat Margaret Good, an attorney, defeated Republican James Buchanan, son of Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), 52 percent to 45 percent. Libertarian Alison Foxall received 3 percent of the vote.

“Representative-elect Margaret Good’s campaign was dedicated to the people of Sarasota County who are tired of Florida Republicans peddling a Trump agenda counter to their values,” Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “Rep.-elect Good went door-to-door, talking with voters about affordable health care, fully funded public schools, safeguarding LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights, and protecting Florida’s beautiful environment.”

The district voted for Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by about 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.

The special election was prompted by the August resignation of state Rep. Alex Miller, a Republican, midway through her first term. Miller won the Sarasota seat in November 2016 by about 16 percentage points.

Good ran on a platform of protecting the environment by preserving Florida’s public lands, opposing use of public funds for charter schools and using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid.

She benefited from the support of grassroots Democratic groups that arose in response to the 2016 election, including Sister District, which encourages liberals across the country to donate to Democrats in tight state legislative races. The organization’s volunteers raised over $34,000 for Good and placed over 25,000 calls on her behalf, according to Sister District.

Republicans continue to control both of Florida’s legislative chambers. The state’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, is term-limited after two four-year terms that will come to a close at the end of 2018.

Democrats have been on a roll in state-level special elections. Last Tuesday, the party picked up a Missouri House seat in an exurban St. Louis district that Trump had won.

And last month, Democrats flipped a state Senate seat in a rural stretch of Wisconsin that went heavily for Trump. Republican Gov. Scott Walker called the outcome a “wake-up call.”

Democrats still have a long way to go to reverse the losses they have endured in state legislatures since 2009. The party lost about 1,000 state legislative seats from 2009 to 2016.New CEO, same old problem.

Uber lost $4.5 billion in 2017 and posted sales of just under $7.5 billion, the ride-hailing company told investors Tuesday. The loss was 61 percent more than the year before, according to data obtained by CNBC.

Despite the eye-popping figures, Uber is making headway on slowing the bleeding.

Uber, a private company, doesn’t have to publicly disclose earnings. But The Wall Street Journal, which reviewed the company’s figures, reported Uber increased sales by at least 10 percent every quarter in 2017. In the fourth quarter ― the first three-month period under new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi ― the company increased the total value of all its fares 60 percent from the prior year, to $11.06 billion.

Bloomberg notes Uber ended 2017 with about $6 billion in cash on hand, 13 percent less than the year earlier.

Last month, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. acquired a roughly 15-percent stake in the company, giving it a fresh infusion of cash and becoming Uber’s largest shareholder.

Khosrowshahi said previously he wants to take the company public by 2019, which means Uber eventually will have to pull back the curtain on details of its financial performance. Complicating matters, the company has been without a chief financial officer since 2015.On Valentine’s Day, love is typically celebrated as an intense, personal feeling ― an intimate, romantic bond that ties two humans together. But a Sikh American activist wants to challenge people to think about love in much more expansive terms.

Valarie Kaur, a lawyer and a longtime interfaith organizer, believes love can be used as a force for social justice. She points to the examples of Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela, whom she said used love to ground their social movements.

“I believe ... that the greatest social movements in history were rooted in the ethic of love,” the 37-year-old told HuffPost.

On Wednesday, Kaur teamed up with other activists to launch a social media effort that she hopes will encourage people to “reclaim love” as a force for good in the world during a time of increased polarization.

She’s enlisted the help of others interested in tackling rising white nationalism and hate during the presidency of Donald Trump ― CNN host Van Jones, founder of the activist organization #LoveArmy, the organizers of the Women’s March, and Our Three Winners, a foundation created to honor three Muslim students who were killed in a shooting in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 2015.

The #ReclaimLove campaign is a “cultural intervention,” Kaur said, that seeks to unite a divided America.

“Last year we saw an onslaught of executive orders, Muslim bans, border walls, pipelines, budget cuts, hate crimes. We barely had a chance to breathe between the crises,” she said. “But we know that unless we ground our resistance in love, unless we ground our movement in love, we will burn out or we will become the very thing that we are resisting.”

Dozens of social media users have chimed in to support Kaur’s campaign online.

Kaur’s work as an activist began years ago. She was deeply affected when a close family friend, Balbir Singh Sodhi, was killed in a hate crime days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The injustice of Sodhi’s death inspired Kaur, a California native, to seek out ways to increase interfaith understanding and solidarity. For years, the Sikh American woman worked as a filmmaker and an activist who sought to bring awareness to the discrimination faced by marginalized groups in the U.S.

Then, the 2016 presidential election happened. Muslims and those perceived to be Muslims experienced an increase in hate crimes and rhetoric during the election at levels similar to those that followed the 2001 attacks.

She began to think that the world she was going to leave her young son would be much more dangerous than the one she inherited. Kaur wrestled with those feelings in a sermon she preached during an interfaith service at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., in December 2016. She sought to approach these issues from the lens of a feminist and a woman of color ― comparing the work of those fighting against white supremacy and hate to the struggles of a mother in labor. A video of her sermon went viral online last year.

In a Ted Talk released on Feb. 9, Kaur outlined three ways that she believes “revolutionary love” can be put into action. First, she advised, love others by seeing no other human beings as strangers. Second, love opponents by tending to their wounds, or in other words, looking for what has hurt them. Lastly, she said it was important to “love ourselves” and seek out joy in times of darkness.

“If we can cultivate love in the directions that we’re missing, not just toward others but also to our opponents and toward ourselves as well, then we can last,” she said. “Not only just outlast this administration, then we can start to imagine birthing a different future for our children.”

Japanese snowboarder Yuto Totsuka suffered an awful accident in the final of the men’s halfpipe event that left him lying motionless after he collided heavily with the lip of the pipe.

Totsuka, 16, had just started his second of three runs in the halfpipe final and was attempting a complex trick. As he tried to land the move, his rear appeared to land heavily on the edge of the halfpipe, knocking him over. His body slid, limp, to the middle of the halfpipe, where he ended up lying still.

Medical personnel quickly descended, and Totsuka was stretchered off the snow for medical attention.

A post shared by yuto_totsuka (@yuto_totsuka) on Feb 15, 2018 at 5:19am PSTRussia wants videos on YouTube and Instagram showing a senior government official cavorting on a yacht with an oligarch once close to Russian President Vladimir Putin taken down, leaving both companies scrambling to respond.

Alexey Navalny, a prominent opposition figure, posted a video Thursday on YouTube describing his investigation into Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with ties to Putin and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Navalny found 2016 videos of Deripaska on his yacht with Sergey Prikhodko, Russia’s deputy prime minister, and said Deripaska could have been bribing Prikhodko and offering information about the 2016 U.S. election he had received from Manafort. (Manafort did offer to send Deripaska updates on the campaign via email in 2016, The Washington Post reported.)

Both men denied wrongdoing. Prikhodko said the issue would have to be settled “man to man,” and Deripaska accused Navalny of trying to ruin his reputation.

Actress, escort and model Anastasia Vashukevich ― who goes by the name Nastya Rybka ― took the videos and posted them online. She claimed in a book she wrote that she was hired as an escort on Deripaska’s boat, but her allegations weren’t taken seriously until Navalny’s expose last week, according to The New York Times.

Deripaska filed suit following Navalny’s investigation, accusing Vashukevich of illegally using private images. The government’s media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, then gave YouTube and Instagram three days to take the videos down or be investigated. It also demanded that YouTube remove the Navalny clip.

Navalny’s video was still on YouTube as of Wednesday, and had been viewed almost 5 million times. He tweeted that both sites were up and running in Russia, but could be shut down Wednesday night.

Instagram said it had no comment on Russia’s threat. YouTube didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. YouTube told the Times it hadn’t yet figured out how to react. Navalny, in an interview with the The Times of London published Wednesday, called for both companies to resist the demands of the Russian government.

Navalny has built a reputation on poking into well-known Russian figures and their questionable behavior. Russia banned Navalny from running in next month’s presidential election.

Deripaska’s ties with Manafort date back to 2005, when they reportedly signed a $10 million contract. But things went sour, and Deripaska sued Manafort and his associate Rick Gates earlier this year for $25 million in damages over the failed business dealings.Henrietta Schubert and Christopher Bromberg are the grandchildren of Henry and Hertha Bromberg, a German-Jewish couple who fled Germany before World War II. France officially returned the Triptych of the Crucifixion painting by Joachim Patenier to the Brombergs' descendants this week. Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images

France has returned three 16th-century oil paintings to the descendants of a German-Jewish couple who sold the artwork in order to flee the Nazis.

On Monday, France’s culture minister, Francoise Nyssen, handed the paintings over to Henrietta Schubert and Chris Bromberg, descendants of Herta and Henry Bromberg, during an official ceremony at The Louvre Museum in Paris.

Herta and Henry Bromberg left their home in Hamburg, Germany, in late 1938, during a period when Adolf Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies were making life increasingly dangerous for German Jews. The couple relocated with their four sons to Paris. There, they sold their art collection to help them pay to get to the United States, Agence France-Presse reports.

The collection included artwork by the Flemish painter Joachim Patinir, a master of landscape painting. One of Patinir’s pieces, “Triptych of the Crucifixion,” is an oil painting depicting Christ on the cross surrounded by his followers.

After the Nazis occupied Paris, the triptych was sold for a cheap price. It was reportedly destined to be added to Hitler’s Fuhrermuseum, an unrealized art museum the Nazi leader wanted to build in his hometown of Linz, Austria.

The Brombergs’ Patinir paintings were discovered in Munich after World War II. They were then added to France’s state collections and remained unclaimed for decades.

In 2016, France returned another painting to the Bromberg family, “Portrait of a Man,” which was created by a follower of the Antwerp artist Joos van Cleve.

It’s estimated that about 100,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and antiquities were either looted by the Nazis in France around World II, or sold by Jewish families under duress, The New York Times reports. Many of the pieces ended up in Germany. Between 1945 and 1949, more than 61,000 were returned to France. About 45,000 were reclaimed by their owners.

The country has been working on handing the remaining artwork over to descendants, although not much progress has been made since the first wave of restitutions. The French government still has possession of 2,143 pieces, which are entrusted to museums like The Louvre.

Last December, The Louvre opened a special exhibition space for works looted by the Nazis, in an effort to bring awareness to the issue.
