ROME (Reuters) ― Rome’s ancient Colosseum was lit in red on Saturday in solidarity with persecuted Christians, particularly Asia Bibi, a woman condemned to death under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.

Hundreds gathered on a rainy night outside the Roman amphitheater that is a symbol of the martyrdom of early Christians to hear the husband and daughter of Asia Bibi.

The Catholic woman has been living on death row in Pakistan since 2010, when she was condemned for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.

Human rights groups such as Amnesty International say the blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores.

“The aim of the blasphemy laws is crush people who believe differently,” Archbishop Nunzio Galantino, secretary-general of the Italian bishops conference, told the gathering.

The law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offense. There are no penalties for false accusations.

Asia Bibi’s case drew international attention after the murder of two politicians who tried to intervene on her behalf.

At the Rome gathering, her husband Ashiq Masih said his wife was innocent of blasphemy. “This is just hate against Christians, who are considered impure,” he said.

The husband and daughter, who broke down in tears as she addressed the group, were earlier received by Pope Francis, who told her: “I think often of your mother and I pray for her”.

European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, who has been tipped as a possible Italian prime minister after next week’s election, said that persecution of Christians was “a genocide”.

“A message must be sent from this place. It is the duty of Europe to defend these values [of religious liberty] wherever on earth they are trampled on,” Tajani said.

Rebecca Bitrus, a Nigerian Christian woman who was held for two years after she was abducted by Boko Haram Islamist militants, told of how she was repeatedly beaten and raped.

During the event, organized by the Catholic group “Aid to the Church in Need,” there were live link-ups with Aleppo, Syria and Mosul, Iraq, both of whose minority Christian populations have been hit hard by wars.Actress Sridevi Kapoor, pictured in September 2012. Mark Blinch / Reuters

NEW DELHI (Reuters) ― Indian actress Sridevi, arguably Bollywood’s first female superstar, died in Dubai after cardiac arrest, media reported on Sunday. She was 54.

Sridevi is survived by her husband ― producer Boney Kapoor ― and daughters Jhanvi and Khushi. She was in Dubai to attend a family wedding and died late on Saturday.

In a career spanning five decades, Sridevi acted in 300 films and was awarded the Padma Shri, India’s fourth-highest civilian honor in 2013.

Born Shree Amma Yanger Ayyapan in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, she started acting at the age of four, appearing in several Tamil-language films in the 1960s and 1970s, and eventually dropping out of school for a career in the movies.

She acted in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films, performing alongside leading men such as Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth.

Sridevi made her Bollywood debut in 1979 with “Solva Sawan” (16th spring), but it was in 1983, with Balu Mahendra’s “Sadma” (Shock) that she made her mark in the Hindi film industry.

The year, she also acted with Jeetendra in K. Raghavendra Rao’s blockbuster “Himmatwala” (The courageous one), cementing her place as one of Bollywood’s top actresses.

Through the 1980s and 1990s she charmed audiences in female-centric films such as “Chandni” (Moonlight) and “Lamhe” (Moments), drawing praise for her comic timing in “Chaalbaaz” (Trickster) and Shekhar Kapur’s “Mr India”, playing feisty characters in contrast to the traditionally coy Bollywood heroine.

Sridevi took a break from films soon after she married producer Boney Kapoor in 1996.

A noticeably leaner Sridevi made a successful return to the big screen 15 years later in Gauri Shinde’s “English Vinglish” (2012), playing a housewife taking English-language lessons. Her last screen appearance was in “Mom” (2017), as a mother avenging her daughter’s rape.

Sridevi’s death triggered an outpouring of tributes from Bollywood luminaries and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“I have no words. Condolences to everyone who loved Sridevi. A dark day. RIP,” actress Priyanka Chopra said on Twitter.

“She was a veteran of the film industry, whose long career included diverse roles and memorable performances,” Modi said in a tweet.

“We all grew up watching her and suddenly to hear that she is no longer with us is hard to digest,” said cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar.BEIJING (Reuters) ― China’s ruling Communist Party on Sunday set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely, with a proposal to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office.

Since taking office more than five years ago, Xi has overseen a radical shake-up of the party, including taking down top leaders once thought untouchable as part of his popular war on deep-rooted corruption.

Sunday’s announcement, carried by state news agency Xinhua, gave few details. It said the proposal had been made by the party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies. The proposal also covers the vice president position.

Xi, 64, is currently required by China’s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament opening on March 5.

There is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. He began his second term as head of the party and military in October at the end of a party congress held once every five years.

Zhang Lifan, a historian and political commentator, said the news was not unexpected, and it was hard to predict exactly how long Xi could stay on in power.

“In theory he could serve longer than Mugabe but in reality, no one is sure exactly what will happen,” Zhang said, referring to Zimbabwe’s former president whose four decades in office ended in November, after the army and his former political allies moved to force him out.

Though positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the People’s Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service,

“If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!,” wrote one Weibo user.

EMPEROR XI

Constitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament, which is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party - meaning the reform will not be blocked.

There has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms.

The October party congress ended without appointing a clear eventual successor for Xi.

However, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point, Xi could be given a party position that also enables him to stay on as long as he likes.

Xi is currently the party’s general secretary, but not chairman. China’s first three leaders after the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 all carried the title party chairman -Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since.

“Whether Xi ends up being Party Chairman or just remains Party Secretary doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether he holds onto power,” said Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University of China in Beijing.

“Titles don’t matter as much in China as they do in the West. Here what matters is whether you are the emperor,” he added. “In China, ordinary people already consider Xi Jinping to be the emperor.”

EYES ON VICE PRESIDENT

Mao, the founder of Communist China and still held in god-like awe by many Chinese, died while still Communist Party chairman in 1976, having never retired.

State media has also increasingly been using the term “lingxiu” to refer to Xi, which means “leader”. Distinct from the standard usage of “lingdao” for leader, “lingxiu” evokes grander, almost spiritual, connotations.

Mao, for example, was referred to as “lingxiu”, but Xi’s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, were not.

In a Sunday commentary on its WeChat account, state television said: “The people love the people’s ‘lingxiu’!”, above a picture of Xi being greeted by an adoring crowd in Sichuan province earlier this month.

The move to lift the presidential term limits is not unexpected. The party has been laying the groundwork for Xi not to have to go.

One of Xi’s closest political allies, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, stepped down from the party’s Standing Committee - the seven-man body that runs China - in October.

Aged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire. But he has been chosen as a parliament delegate this year and is likely to become vice president, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say.

The move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that would set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power too after he reaches what is normally considered retirement age.

The Central Committee also proposed other changes to the country’s constitution, including inserting “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” into the constitution, referring to Xi’s rather wordy guiding political thought that is already in the party constitution.

The constitution will further ensure that party control over the country is not in any doubt, too, strengthening existing clauses about the leading role of the Communist Party in China.

“The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics,” Xinhua cited one of the proposed new clauses as saying.

WELLINGTON/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - At least one company began evacuating non-essential personnel after a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Papua New Guinea’s energy-rich interior on Monday, causing landslides, damaging buildings and closing oil and gas operations.

The tremor hit in the rugged, heavily forested Southern Highlands about 350 miles northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, at around 3.45 a.m. local time, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

A spokesman at Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Center said by telephone the affected area was very remote and the agency could not properly assess damage until communication was re-established.

He said there were no confirmed casualties, although the International Red Cross (IRC) in Papua New Guinea said some reports indicated there were “fears of human casualties.”

“It’s a very serious all across the Southern Highlands and also all over the western highlands. People are definitely very frightened,” Udaya Regmi, the head of the IRC in Papua New Guinea, said by telephone from Port Moresby.

The PNG government also said it had sent disaster assessment teams. At least 13 aftershocks with a magnitude of 5.0 or more rattled the area throughout the day, according to USGS data, but no tsunami warnings were issued.

“The Papua New Guinea Defense Force has also been mobilized to assist with the assessment and the delivery of assistance to affected people as well as the restoration of services and infrastructure,” Isaac Lupari, the chief secretary to the government, said in a statement.

ExxonMobil said it had shut its Hides gas conditioning plant and that it believed administration buildings, living quarters and a mess hall had been damaged. It also said it had suspended flights into the nearby Komo airfield until the runway could be surveyed.

“Due to the damage to the Hides camp quarters and continuing aftershocks, ExxonMobil PNG is putting plans in place to evacuate non-essential staff,” the company said in an emailed statement.

Gas is processed at Hides and transported along a 435-mile line that feeds a liquefied natural gas plant near Port Moresby for shipping.

PAPUA PANIC

PNG oil and gas explorer Oil Search said in a statement it had also shut production in the quake-affected area.

The giant Grasberg copper mine operated by the Indonesian unit of Freeport McMoRan in neighboring Papua province was not affected, a Jakarta-based spokesman said.

However, the quake and several aftershocks caused panic in Jayapura, the capital of Indonesian Papua, Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency said in a statement, but there were no reports of casualties or damage there.

The IRC’s Regmi said communications were “completely down” in Tari, one of the larger settlements near the quake’s epicenter, and that landslides had cut roads.

Several other aid and missionary agencies said poor communications in the area made damage and injury assessment difficult.

“The bush structures that they build tend to handle earthquakes extremely well,” Christian missionary Brandon Buser told Reuters after contacting several remote villages by shortwave radio.

Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.

“This is the Papuan fold-and-thrust belt, so it’s a typical movement of faults in that region, but it’s big,” said Chris McKee, acting director of the Geohazards Management Division in Port Moresby.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a ballistic rocket launching drill of Hwasong artillery units of the Strategic Force of the KPA on the spot in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 7, 2017.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Senior officials from Pyongyang visiting South Korea on Sunday said North Korea was open to talks with the United States, hours after it accused Washington of trying to stir up conflict on the peninsula with new sanctions.

In Pyeongchang for the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, the visiting delegation also said developments in relations between the two Koreas and between North Korea and the United States should go hand in hand, the South’s presidency said in a statement.

The delegation met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at an undisclosed location in the Olympic city.

Earlier a statement released by North Korean state media accused the United States of provoking confrontation on the Korean peninsula with Friday’s sanctions announcement.

Sunday’s closing ceremony was attended by Moon, the North Korean delegation, and U.S. President Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, among other dignitaries.

The Olympics have given a boost to engagement between the two Koreas after more than a year of sharply rising tension over the North’s missile tests and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. sanctions.

But the closing days of the Games were overshadowed by the U.S. announcement that it was imposing its largest package of sanctions aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs.

“Thanks to our supreme leadership’s noble love for the nation and strong determination for peace, long-awaited inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation have been realized and the Olympics took place successfully by the inter-Korean collaboration,” the North’s KCNA state news agency said, citing North Korea’s ministry of foreign affairs.

“On the eve of closing of the Olympics, United States is running amok to bring another dark cloud of confrontation and war over the Korean peninsula by announcing enormous sanctions against the DPRK,” it said, using the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Earlier, about 100 conservative South Korean lawmakers and activists staged a sit-in near the border with North Korea, facing off against about 2,500 South Korean police to protest against the arrival of a northern delegation led by Kim Yong Chol, an official accused of being behind a deadly 2010 attack on a South Korean warship.

The delegation took a different route, prompting the opposition Korea Liberty Party to accuse President Moon Jae-in’s administration of “abuse of power and an act of treason” by re-routing the motorcade to shield it from the protest.

Moon met Kim in Pyeongchang, where the Olympics are being held, before the closing ceremony, the South Korean government said in a statement.

The North’s decision to send former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol as delegation leader to the closing ceremony has enraged families of 46 sailors killed in the torpedo attack on their ship and threatens the mood of rapprochement that Seoul wants to create at what it calls the “Peace Games”.

North Korea has denied its involvement in the sinking.

TRUMP WARNING

For the opening ceremony, the North sent Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

She was the center of a frenzy of attention, especially when she appeared at the opening ceremony and stood only a few feet from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. They did not speak together.

Kim Yo Jong and the North’s nominal head of state were the most senior North Korean officials to visit the South in more than a decade. The North Korean leader later said he wanted to boost a “warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue”.

U.S. President Donald Trump, in announcing the new sanctions on Friday, warned of a “phase two” that could be “very, very unfortunate for the world” if the sanctions did not work.

North Korea denounced the sanctions in a statement carried on its state media and said a blockade by the United States would be considered an act of war.

China also reacted angrily to the new U.S. measures, saying on Saturday the unilateral targeting of Chinese firms and people risked harming cooperation on North Korea.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser, met Moon on Friday as part of a weekend trip to lead the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, but no official meeting between the American and North Korean delegations was planned.

Moon won election last year promising to try to improve relations with the North.About 100 conservative lawmakers and activists staged a sit-in at Tongil Bridge, anticipating it would be along the route traveled by the motorcade after crossing the heavily militarized border into the South on Sunday morning.

About 2,500 police were deployed at the bridge, but the motorcade took another road, broadcaster YTN said. Later, the delegation arrived at a hotel in Seoul before heading to Pyeongchang for the ceremony that starts at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT).

The apparent diversion angered protest organizers who then directed their criticism toward South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is hosting the North Koreans.

The opposition Korea Liberty Party accused the Moon administration of “abuse of power and an act of treason” by re-routing the motorcade to shield it from protesters.

North Korean delegation leader Kim Yong Chol, now a ruling party official, was chief of a top North Korean military intelligence agency. He has been blamed for the sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy corvette.

North Korea has denied its involvement in the sinking.

The protesters held signs which said Kim, who is making a three-day visit to the South, was the main culprit behind the attack and called for his visit to be canceled.

“Kim Yong Chol is our sworn enemy who took away our precious 46 navy sailors’ lives by the sudden torpedo attack,” a Korea Liberty Party protester, Chang Je-won, told Yonhap.PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) dashed Russian athletes’ hopes of marching behind their national flag at the Winter Games on Sunday, deciding against immediately lifting Russia’s Olympic suspension after fresh doping violations.

Russians have been competing as neutral athletes at the Games, their Olympic status suspended, as IOC punishment for years of drug scandals involving allegations that Russia ran a systematic, state-backed drug-cheating program.

The IOC said two Russian doping violations during the Pyeongchang Games had marred an otherwise clean report card for the Russian delegation at the Games.

“This was hugely disappointing and, in addition to other considerations, prevented the IOC from even considering lifting the suspension for the closing ceremony,” IOC President Thomas Bach said in presenting the recommendation to IOC members.

Bach said Russia’s Olympic status would be restored automatically once it was confirmed there were no other doping violations by Russian athletes at Pyeongchang. It does not require any further decision by the IOC.

“That is an automatic decision,” he told reporters. “This is an objective condition ... and then the sanction is lifted.”

The suspended Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it hoped to return to the Olympic family in the coming days.

“We hope and really count on that in the next few days, the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee in the IOC will be completely restored,” it said in a statement.

“In light of the situation, we consider that the restoration of the rights of the ROC and all Russian athletes will be the main result of the Olympic Games that are ending today.”

Competition at the Winter Games concludes on Sunday and final drug testing results might not be known for several days or even weeks.

“I’m very disappointed,” said Elena Valbe, president of the Russian cross-country skiing federation.

“Some athletes stayed behind later with the hope that they would be walking under the Russian flag. I’ve heard athletes say that they were staying just because they wanted to walk with the flag and in our uniform.”

Former Olympic ice hockey champion Igor Larionov told Reuters it would be hard for Russian players to stand on the podium under the Olympic flag if they won the ice hockey gold medal in their final against Germany later on Sunday.

“Time needs to pass for the right to have the flag back, I think,” the Russian said. “It is difficult for me to understand how any figure skater, hockey player or skier can win gold and stand on the podium without their flag. It’s sad.

‘DROWNING MAN’

Russia’s Olympic delegation chief and its figure skating silver medalist, Evgenia Medvedeva, had made a last appeal to the IOC on Saturday for their suspension to be lifted, apologizing for the two doping violations during the Games.

Medal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva failed doping tests, angering a team that had been through extensive testing before and during the first days of Games competition without returning any positive results.

The lawyer for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian doping laboratory director who turned whistleblower and helped expose the drugs scandal, said “cooler heads” at the IOC had prevailed and stopped Russia’s immediate Olympic return.

Rodchenkov currently lives in hiding in the United States.

“Thomas Bach was a drowning man, but finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver,” Jim Walden said in a statement.

“Yet, in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia ‘respected’ its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension. The acrimony caused by Bach’s mismanagement should be his undoing,” Walden said.

At the Games, the Russians have been unable to wear national uniforms or have their anthem played at medal presentations.

Russian delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov has said that the prospect of flying the flag at Sunday night’s closing ceremony meant more to his athletes than winning medals.

In December, the IOC had held out the prospect of lifting Russia’s suspension for the closing ceremony, on the condition its athletes met a strict code of conduct, including compliance with anti-doping rules and observance of athlete neutrality.Teresa Stadlober of Austria is seen left of Kerttu Niskanen of Finland, center, and Krista Parmakoski of Finland during Sunday's 30-kilometer race.

In what could easily be any Olympic athlete’s worst nightmare, an Austrian cross-country skier took a wrong turn during the Pyeongchang Winter Games on Sunday, destroying her chance of earning a medal.

Teresa Stadlober was in second place in Sunday’s 30-kilometer mass start, with just 7 kilometers (or around 4 miles) to go, when the 25-year-old mistakenly veered right on a downward slope as her competitors went left.

By the time she realized her mistake, Stadlober was in eighth place. She eventually crossed the finish line in ninth.

“I don’t know. I really don’t know,” she later told The Associated Press. “I took the wrong way, and I did this twice. The second time I wasn’t sure anymore. I had a blackout. I don’t know why I took the wrong way.”

Stadlober said she cried and embraced her father at the finish line.

“He just said, ‘It was not your day today.’ But when you want to win a medal you have to know the track,” she added.

Norway’s Marit Bjoergen, who is now the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, finished first to secure her 15th Olympic medal.

Bjoergen entered the 2018 Games with 10 medals and recently broke the previous record of 13 medals held by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen. Sunday’s gold medal is her eighth of her Olympic career.The 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, went out with a bang on Sunday, with its closing ceremony featuring an array of fireworks, light shows, roller-blading pandas, K-pop musicians and ― of course ―some of the world’s top athletes.

The vibrant, action-packed ceremony capped more than two weeks of competitions between 92 countries and more than 2,000 athletes. It also opened the doors to the next Winter Olympic Games, with the Olympic flag being lowered and handed to the mayor of Beijing, whose city will host the 2022 Games.Actor Morgan Freeman spoke out again in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him, saying Friday that he was “devastated” by the turn of events.

Several women accused the Oscar winner of inappropriate behavior, including lewd comments and unwanted touching, according to a CNN investigation.

“I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,” Morgan said in a statement sent to media, according to outlets. “All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor.”

Credit card company Visa and Vancouver transportation company TransLink (in a Visa promotion) suspended campaigns featuring Freeman after the accusations surfaced.

In the CNN report, one unidentified woman who worked on the film “Going in Style” in 2015 accused Freeman of repeatedly trying to lift up her skirt and asking her if she was wearing underwear.

Freeman initially apologized for unintentionally making anyone feel uncomfortable or disrespected and reiterated those sentiments in part of his statement on Friday.

But, he added, “I also want to be clear: I did not create unsafe work environments. I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false.”James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” has become a staple of the “Late Late Show.” But the segment that aired on Thursday night went a little off-script when he was stopped by a deputy from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department while filming with Adam Levine of Maroon 5.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House has eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator after President Donald Trump’s first appointee for the job departed last week, a spokesman for the National Security Council confirmed on Tuesday.

“Today’s actions continue an effort to empower National Security Council Senior Directors. Streamlining management will improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and increase accountability,” NSC spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement replying to a question about the role’s elimination.

The NSC’s two senior cyber policy directors sit near one another so will be able to coordinate matters in real time, Palladino said.

Politico first reported earlier on Tuesday that the position had been scrapped, citing an email from an aide to national security adviser John Bolton that was sent to NSC employees, and provided to the newspaper by a former U.S. official.

Rob Joyce, Trump’s first coordinator, left the White House on Friday and planned to return to the National Security Agency where he had worked previously. His expected departure was announced in April.

The position was established during the administration of President Barack Obama and was aimed at harmonizing government policy on cybersecurity and digital warfare.

Cyber policy experts, legislators and former officials had urged Trump to replace Joyce and not abolish the position.

“I don’t see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats,” Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday.

Politico reported last week that Bolton was trying to eliminate the top cyber policy role.

Joyce’s departure follows that of his boss, Tom Bossert, who oversaw his work on cybersecurity and was pushed out of the administration last month.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump phoned in a rambling, virtually non-stop talk with Jeanine Pirro on her Fox News program Saturday night, calling the newly released Democratic intelligence memo a “nothing,” and blasting Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) as a “total phony” and a “bad guy” who has done something “probably illegal.”

Nearly each time Pirro tried to speak, Trump bulldozed right over her.

Trump patted himself on the back as a “champion” of the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms on “Justice with Judge Jeanine.” But he also pledged in the wake of the shooting this month at a Parkland, Florida, high school that killed 17 people to stiffen background checks (he rolled back checks for the mentally ill just last year). He predicted a bill would emerge in Congress addressing guns that would be “getting rid of certain things and keeping other things.”

“Somebody’s who’s mentally ill should not have a gun,” he said.

He said what happened at the Florida school “would have been a whole different story” if “brave” football coach Aaron Feis, killed protecting children, had been packing a gun. “He’d be alive today,” Trump said.

Had 15 percent or 20 percent of the teachers been armed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Trump also said, the gunman “would never have run into the building if he thought that bullets were going to come flying back into him.”

He said “gun-free zones are very dangerous because the bad guys love gun-free zones.”

Trump slammed the memo released Saturday by the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, led by Schiff, to debunk claims by a GOP memo that the FBI abused its power during an investigation into former Trump campaign official Carter Page.

“Certainly the memo was a nothing,” Trump said of the Democratic document, adding that it was a “confirmation” of the GOP memo.

“That’s a very bad document for their side,” he added. As for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who was responsible for the Republican memo, “I really think someday he’s going to be greatly honored for his service ... he’s been very, very brave,” Trump added.

The president leveled multiple insults at Schiff, calling him a liar, a likely law breaker and a “bad guy.”

As for his hoped-for military parade, Trump said: “I’d like to have a parade. A lot of the generals would like to have a parade to celebrate what we’re doing.”

As to when the parade might occur, he mentioned July 4th or Veteran’s Day as possible dates.

He added that “our military was very depleted; it was going in the wrong direction” before he took office.

Democrats, he said, “don’t care so much about the military, sadly.”A Donald Trump and Mike Pence “weekly newsletter” laments the horror of the Parkland school shooting that killed 17 people, then ends with a “contribute” button so people can give money ... to Trump and Pence.

The message adds: “The President is now engaging in an important national conversation about school safety and ways to prevent any future attacks. President Trump is taking steps towards banning gun bump stocks and strengthening background checks for gun purchasers. The President has made his intent very clear: ‘making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority.’”

Despite Trump’s proposed plan to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, he and Congress rolled back tougher checks on people with mental illnesses who purchase guns a year ago. The Obama-era regulation would have barred guns to people receiving Social Security checks for mental illnesses.

The suspected shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Nikolas Cruz, was reportedly treated for mental illness.

Trump’s proposed budget also cuts funds for the background checks system by millions of dollars.

Survivors aren’t likely to see the aftermath of their tragedy as something to tout in a fundraising newsletter. Students and parents of the school have slammed Trump, other politicians and the National Rifle Association for lack of action on stricter gun control to avert future tragedies.

Parkland mom Lori Alhadeff, screamed at Trump on a CNN video to “do something” the day her 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was killed. “You can stop the guns from getting into these children’s hands,” she cried.

Teachers have slammed the president’s recommendation that 20 percent of teachers be armed in schools so they could shoot it out with attackers.The closing ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics on Sunday was an epic spectacle featuring the world’s top winter athletes several mesmerizing performances, and even a drone light show.

But if one had relied on Twitter to determine what was happening at the ceremony, you would’ve been forgiven if you’d thought the whole event was just about one performance: That of K-pop boy band and global musical sensation, EXO.

Fans of the band, hailing from all over the world, were tweeting with fervent expectation in the hours leading up to and during the closing ceremony. The hashtag #Olympics_EXO, which was featured in more than 5 million tweets, was trending on the social media platform for several hours on Sunday.

Viewers had to wait till almost the end of the closing ceremony for EXO’s performance. And fans could barely contain their excitement:

I can’t stop crying and shaking. I am really so nervous. I need someone to hug me right now. #Olympics_EXO @weareoneEXO — 94 ♥️ Sehun (@morningpassages) February 25, 2018

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach announced the official closure of the games. And then, finally, as the anticipation reached a fever pitch, EXO took the stage.

Eight members of the band performed two of their biggest hits “Power” and “Growl.” The group’s performance did not disappoint fans.

K-pop singer CL, a former member of the popular bad 2NE1, also performed at the closing ceremony to great fanfare.

Both acts served as a reminder of the enormous popularity of K-pop ― a genre that has amassed a huge following across the globe, well beyond the boundaries of its native South Korea.GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian ice hockey players sang their national anthem after clinching the gold medal in overtime against Germany at the Winter Games on Sunday, despite the anthem being banned as punishment for a years-long Russian doping scandal.

Russia, competing as neutral athletes at Pyeongchang, scored in overtime through Kirill Kaprizov for a 4-3 victory in one of the most surprising finals in the history of the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament.

Later, at the medal ceremony, the winning team sang the Russian anthem over the sound of the Olympic anthem at the hockey arena, despite being barred by Olympic authorities from having their flag raised or anthem played.

With Germany’s Patrick Reimer off for high sticking midway through the extra period, the Olympic Athletes from Russia went on a four-on-three man advantage and Kaprizov one-timed a pass from Nikita Gusev past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken.

The OAR found themselves evenly matched by a German team that had surprised the hockey world by making it to their first Olympic final. The Germans won silver, their best finish ever in Olympic ice hockey.

Both teams scored twice in a back-and-forth third period with Nikita Gusev knotting the game with a short-handed goal with less than a minute to go to force the overtime period.

The Russians hit the ice hours after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided not to restore their delegation’s Olympic status, which would have enabled them to march under their flag at the closing ceremony later on Sunday. [nL4N1QF015]

As the OAR players received their gold medals on the ice, the Olympic flag was raised in place of the Russian flag and the Olympic anthem was played. But the players, arms around each other, sang the Russian anthem instead.

Singing the Russian anthem on the field of play is a violation of the IOC’s rules on neutrality, which were imposed on Russia as part of sanctions punishing the nation over systematic doping across many sports.

On paper the final shouldn’t have been a fair fight but the Germans skated evenly with the OAR.

Loaded with top home-grown talent from Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League, seen as the world’s second-best league after the NHL, and led by ex-NHL all stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk, the OAR finally edged past a team that had punched above its weight.

Aside from Kaprizov with the game winner, Gusev was the other hero for the OAR, scoring two third-period goals and getting an assist to become the tournament’s points leader.The 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, drew to a colorful conclusion on Sunday.

More than two weeks of fierce competition ended with an upbeat closing ceremony at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, featuring artistic displays, fireworks, K-pop performances and dignitaries’ speeches.

In a poignant address, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach praised athletes from both Koreas who came together to compete in the women’s ice hockey event.

“You have shown how sport brings people together in our fragile world; you have shown how sport builds bridges,” Bach said. “The IOC will continue this Olympic dialogue, even after we extinguish the Olympic flame.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping also addressed the crowd via video message, in anticipation of Beijing hosting the Winter Olympics in 2022.

AdvertisementThe Republican National Committee used Twitter to promote a prize of attending a dinner with President Donald Trump.

But many people replied to the Saturday tweet by saying they’d rather go hungry than attend the RNC’s Annual Spring Retreat Dinner in Palm Beach, Florida, in March with Trump.

The RNC linked to a GOP.com fundraising page with its post.

It offered one person the chance to win transportation, accommodation and a ticket to the Florida bash, and invited people to donate to the RNC in exchange for entry into the sweepstakes. The small print, however, contained another link which allowed people to enter before 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday for free.

The RNC valued the prize at $3,000, but some folks on Twitter “barfed” at the offer:

Facebook’s booth at the conference in Maryland included the game, which had players shooting virtual people, less than two weeks after 17 people were shot dead at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.

In Bullet Train, created by Epic Games, players fire on “resistance forces” at a train station. The demo featured Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality headset, making the scenes particularly realistic for players.

The website for Bullet Train boasts that players are “in the middle of the action,” with Oculus Touch motion-controllers allowing players to “physically interact with an array of weapons, from guns to grenades to missiles, and even feel them through haptic feedback.”

The chilling exhibit was first exposed by reporter Scott Morrow of Now This, who posted a video of a player aiming at a Bullet Train scene on Twitter Friday.

After Morrow reached out, Hugh Barra, Facebook’s vice president of virtual reality, tweeted back that the game demo was removed, noting: “We got this wrong.”

Bullet Train is part of a standard set of VR game demos that are shown at venues like CPAC. Facebook said it had removed all violent games from the demo Friday, The Washington Post reported.

We removed the demo & regret failing to do so at the start. We got this wrong. Our demos come w a standard set of content, some are action games w violence. These shouldn't have been present, especially in light of recent events & out of respect for the victims & their families. — Hugo Barra (@hbarra) February 23, 2018

Bullet Train was part of the Facebook exhibit when National Rifle Association head Wayne LaPierre spoke at CPAC Thursday to angrily blast efforts at greater gun control in the wake of the Florida shootings, calling them efforts to “make you less free.” He blamed the killings on the “failure of school security, the failure of the family.”

Barra’s tweeted response to Morrow about withdrawing violent games from the CPAC exhibit triggered a storm of angry comments:

At first, Taufatofua ― whose chiseled appearance at the opening ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics set pulses racing and made him a viral sensation ― entered the closing festivities at the Winter Games bundled up in a heavy coat. (And who could blame him? Temperatures in Pyeongchang reportedly hovered around 31 degrees Fahrenheit Sunday.)

But rest assured: he soon doffed his seasonally appropriate duds, stripping down to little more than a red-and-black grass skirt, a pair of gloves and a smile.

“I’ve got to stay warm, get the flowers out, let people see the color of Polynesia,” he told USA Today. “What’s different here is that we’re no longer individual countries. We’re coming out together. That’s why I’m dressed the way I am. We’re all together, all the same.”

It’s been an eventful two weeks for Taufatofua, who competed as a cross-country skier. He didn’t exactly wow on the snow, finishing 114th out of 119 competitors in the 15K cross-country event.

The 34-year-old’s only goal, however, was not to finish last. He told NBC, “It’s not about winning medals for me. It’s about inspiring people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, to not fear failure, to fail and then laugh at it and then try again.”

It’s safe to say he succeeded.Nearly every Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives is calling on Gov. Rick Scott (R) to suspend a county sheriff over his office’s response to a deadly mass shooting at a local high school earlier this month.

Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran (R) tweeted a letter he sent to Scott on Sunday, urging him to suspend Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for “incompetence and dereliction of duty.”

In the four-page letter, 74 out of Florida’s 76 Republican state House representatives accused Israel of failing to take significant action to prevent the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which a 19-year-old suspected gunman confessed to killing 17 people using an assault-style rifle.

“In the years leading up to this unspeakable tragedy, Sheriff Israel, his deputies, and staff ignored repeated warning signs about the violent, erratic, threatening and antisocial behavior of Nikolas Jacob Cruz,” the legislators wrote, referencing the suspected gunman.

Today I sent the following letter to @FLGovScott Asking that he suspend Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for incompetence and dereliction of duty. I was honored to be joined by 73 Republican colleagues. You can read the letter attached here. pic.twitter.com/exZVwGQ3DR — Richard Corcoran (@richardcorcoran) February 25, 2018

Florida House Rep. Bill Hager (R), who signed the lawmakers’ shared plea, also sent his own letter to Scott on Saturday to demand Israel’s ouster. Hager pointed to reports that Israel’s office received at least 18 phone calls between 2008 and 2017 from community members concerned about Cruz’s behavior.

In 2016, multiple people told the sheriff’s office they worried about Cruz’s cache of weapons, according to The Naples Daily News. One caller told a deputy he believed Cruz “could be a school shooter in the making,” the news outlet reported.

The sheriff’s office has also been slammed following reports that at least four deputies, including the high school’s armed resource officer, opted not to enter the building after responding to the shooting. The sheriff’s office announced Thursday that the agency was conducting an internal investigation into the deputies’ actions.

Israel defended himself during a heated interview Sunday with CNN’s Jake Tapper, adding that he had no plans to resign.

“I can only take responsibility for what I knew about,” Israel told Tapper. “I exercised my due diligence. I’ve given amazing leadership to this agency.”

Israel has been outspoken in his criticism of Florida lawmakers ― many of whom are Republican ― who refuse to push for stricter gun laws.

“If you’re an elected official, and you want to keep things the way they are ― if you want to keep gun laws as they are now ― you will not get re-elected in Broward County,” Israel said earlier this month at a vigil to honor the Parkland victims.

A representative for the Broward County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) announced Sunday that Scott had directed the agency to “investigate the law enforcement response” to the Parkland shooting.

“So proud of all these people,” he tweeted as Team USA prepared to participate in the closing ceremony for the 2018 Olympics Pyeongchang, South Korea. Kenworthy, who came in 12th place in the slopestyle final, noted that “everyone has worked so hard to make it to the Olympics.”

“Well ... Everyone except Ivanka,” he quipped. “Honestly, tf is she doing here?”

The first daughter traveled to South Korea to head the U.S. delegation during the closing ceremony. She met and dined with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday and greeted athletes from Team USA earlier on Sunday.

Trump has faced backlash over her presence at the event, as did Vice President Mike Pence, who led the delegation during the games’ opening ceremony.Former Allentown City Solicitor Susan Wild won the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, a victory boosted by EMILY’s List and party officials who backed her bid.

Wild’s hard-fought primary win in the Lehigh Valley-area district reflects the resilience of mainstream candidates against challenges from a resurgent populist left and the party’s conservative old guard.

Her candidacy in the general election provides Democrats with a crucial opportunity to flip a GOP-held seat as the party seeks to win a House majority.

Christopher Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, described Wild as the “goldilocks” candidate capable of both exciting progressives and winning over centrist Democrats, Republicans and independents.

“She brings a lot to the table with her nomination and will pose a matchup problem for the Republicans,” Borick said.

Wild’s candidacy is also historically significant: If elected, she would be the first woman to represent the Lehigh Valley, located north of Philadelphia, in Congress.

Pennsylvania currently has no women in its 18-member House delegation. Wild is now one of several women on the ballot in the Keystone State with a serious chance of changing that in November.

“We see a lot more energy among women than men this cycle and with a woman on the ticket, there is an outlet for a lot of that energy,” Borick said.

Wild, 60, defeated five other Democrats. Two of them ― Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli, 62, and progressive pastor Greg Edwards, 48 ― were major contenders in the primary race.

In the general election, Wild will face former Olympic cyclist Marty Nothstein.

Wild benefited from the support of EMILY’s List, which backs pro-choice Democratic women. The influential group bought television ads promoting Wild in the Philadelphia and Allentown markets and sent some 250,000 pieces of mail to support her bid.

The stakes in the primary race were high for liberal groups spooked by the prospect of a Morganelli win. The veteran prosecutor publicly sought a political appointment in President Donald Trump’s administration, opposes abortion rights and backs hardline immigration policies.

Liberal billionaire Tom Steyer’s millennial-focused organization, NextGen America, didn’t endorse a candidate in the race but spent $100,000 on digital ads and mail attacking Morganelli.

“I’m not here fighting for the billionaire class.” - Susan Wild

For her part, Wild survived a six-figure digital ad and direct-mail attack blitz from United Together, a pro-Morganelli PAC affiliated with the centrist group No Labels. The group criticized Wild’s tenure in the administration of former Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski, who awaits sentencing after being convicted on federal corruption charges.

The PAC went so far as to allege in a mailer that Wild was part of a cover-up of Pawlowski’s crimes, but the Allentown-based Morning Call said the literature’s claims were “not supported by the facts.”

The redrawn 7th district is one of several Pennsylvania House seats that Democrats hope to flip this year. The party benefits from the retirement of moderate Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, who has represented much of the Lehigh Valley district since 2005, and a state Supreme Court remapping and renumbering of Pennsylvania’s congressional district lines in February.

Trump won Dent’s old 15th district by 8 percentage points but the new 7th, which includes the Democratic-leaning city of Easton, would have voted for Hillary Clinton by 1 point.

In a previous election cycle, Wild would likely have been the most progressive Democrat in the race ― Edwards, who was backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held that distinction this time. Wild, a longtime corporate litigation specialist, supports a $15 federal minimum wage, legalizing marijuana and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. And she professes her commitment to the eventual adoption of single-payer health care, even as she emphasizes the more incremental step of fixing the Affordable Care Act.

Wild has vowed that passing tougher gun regulations, including an assault weapons ban, would be her top priority in Congress.

As a primary candidate, Wild showed an occasional flair for populist rhetoric.

“We’ve gotta fight for ordinary people, for families. I’m not here fighting for the billionaire class. Frankly, they don’t need our help,” Wild said at a candidate forum in Fogelsville.

At the same time, she highlighted a penchant for bipartisan deal-making that might prove useful in the general election.

“A big part of my skill set is negotiation,” she told HuffPost. “Those are the kinds of skills that we need in Washington. We need people who negotiate, who reach across the aisle.”

Unlike some Democrats running in swing districts, Wild has so far declined to run as an opponent of the potential speakership of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.

She took issue with the premise of a question about Pelosi, claiming it had “a lot of inherent sexism” in it.

“If any other political official had done what she has done, but had been male, that question would not constantly be coming up,” Wild said.

Still, she stopped short of pledging to back Pelosi for the speaker’s post should Democrats win the House majority, saying she would wait to decide based on the available candidates.President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, on Friday. Joshua Roberts / Reuters

A speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference drew the ire of audience members on Saturday when she expressed disappointment that “people on our side” have been silent about allegations of sexual harassment lodged against President Donald Trump and other Republicans.

Booed and heckled by the crowd, Mona Charen, had to be escorted out by security for her own safety following the event.

Charen, a veteran conservative political analyst and writer, was on a panel discussing feminism when she said she was “disappointed in people on our side for being hypocrites about sexual harassers and abusers of women who are in our party, who are sitting in the White House, who brag about their extramarital affairs, who brag about mistreating women.”

Charen added: “And because he happens to have an ‘R’ after his name, we look the other way, we don’t complain.”

Although she did not explicitly name the president, Trump talked about grabbing women by their genitals in a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape that surfaced late in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Trump also has been accused by at least 21 women of sexual harassment and misconduct. He has denied the allegations.

Charen, who was a speechwriter for former First Lady Nancy Reagan, went on to criticize the Republican Party for supporting Alabama U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore “even though he was a credibly accused child molester.”

“You cannot claim that you stand for women and put up with that,” she said.

Her comments prompted boos and jeering from the audience. “Prove it!” shouted one audience member. “It was a witch hunt!” yelled another.

In an upset, Moore ended up losing the December special Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones

A Newsweek reporter at CPAC said Charen’s words were the most critical of Trump that he’d heard since the annual gathering began on Thursday. A straw poll of attendees showed a 93 percent approval rating for the president.

CHAREN: "The fact that CPAC invited her is a disgrace." — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) February 24, 2018

Following the panel discussion, Charen had to be escorted out of the event by three security guards, according to a Politico reporter.

Charen wrote about the experience in a New York Times Op-Ed that published on Sunday. The guards, she said, “seemed genuinely concerned for my safety.”

She also said she had been “dreading” her appearance on the CPAC panel, because she anticipated a negative reaction to what she was prepared to say about hypocrisy.

But when the crowd booed and jeered her, “I almost welcomed it,” she said. “There is nothing more freeing than telling the truth. And it must be done, again and again, by those of us who refuse to be absorbed into this brainless, sinister, clownish thing called Trumpism, by those of us who refuse to overlook the fools, frauds and fascists attempting to glide along in his slipstream into respectability.”
