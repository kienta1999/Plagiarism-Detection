Former host Jay Leno returned to “The Tonight Show” Wednesday, telling a slew of sexual harassment jokes when he subbed in for Jimmy Fallon on the monologue.

After Fallon feigned a muscle pull, Leno tagged in to unleash minutes of shtick about the scandal that has taken down numerous entertainment and news figures.

Leno served as the previous host of “The Tonight Show” until Fallon took over in 2014. In an occasional bit, he has appeared on the program to finish Fallon’s monologue. This time Leno took aim at Steven Seagal, Kevin Spacey and others facing sexual misconduct accusations.

Riffing on allegations that Charlie Rose exposed himself to female staffers, Leno tried to envision Walter Cronkite doing the same to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.There ain’t no workout like an RBG workout.

Stephen Colbert tried out Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s fitness routine on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.”

It’s fair to say that what Colbert lacked in gym etiquette and technique, he more than made up for with enthusiasm — and gags.

“Let’s get fully ripped and exploded, let’s get shredded, let’s get stupid strong,” Colbert joked to 85-year-old Ginsburg, before later asking: “How strong are you on the Second Amendment? Because welcome to the gun show.”Actress and writer Lena Waithe, best known for her role in the Netflix comedy series “Master of None,” is the star of Vanity Fair’s April cover.

The cover, released Thursday and photographed by Annie Leibovitz, is the first under the magazine’s new editor Radhika Jones, and suggests a major shift in the magazine’s largely mainstream focus by showcasing an up-and-coming black, openly lesbian woman. The final cover under former editor Graydon Carter featured the A-list actress Jennifer Lawrence.

“When I thought about the kind of person I’d like to see on the cover of Vanity Fair, I thought about Lena Waithe — a member of the new creative elite remaking entertainment for her generation,” Jones wrote in a note to readers of the new issue.

Waithe has become a creative force in recent years. After working behind the scenes as a writer and assistant for directors like Ava DuVernay and Gina Prince-Bythewood, she broke out as a star of Aziz Ansari’s Netflix series “Master of None,” and created the Showtime series “The Chi.”

After “Master of None’s” second season last year, she became the first black woman to win an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, for “Thanksgiving,” an emotionally moving episode based on Waithe’s own experience coming out to her mother.

“The things that make us different, those are our superpowers,” Waithe said in her acceptance speech, after thanking her “LGBTQIA family.” “Every day when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape, and go out there and conquer the world. Because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren’t in it.”

In addition to “The Chi,” which was recently renewed for a second season, Waithe appears in Steven Spielberg’s next movie “Ready Player One.” She is also developing an upcoming TV series centered on a queer black woman.

Waithe on Thursday thanked the magazine “for seeing me so clearly.”

Jones enlisted Jacqueline Woodson, author of “Another Brooklyn” and “Brown Girl Dreaming,” to write Vanity Fair’s profile of Waithe.

AdvertisementActress Drew Barrymore might have some explaining to do after rating Jake Gyllenhaal the least-talented costar she’s worked with.

Granted, the “Santa Clarita Diet” actress did so under duress on “The Late Late Show” Wednesday. But still.

In a game of “Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts” with fellow guest John Boyega and host James Corden, Barrymore was faced with the choice of eating a turkey testicle or responding to Corden’s demand to “rank your costars from most to least talented.”

The choices were Gyllenhaal (whom she appeared with in “Donnie Darko”), Adam Sandler (“The Wedding Singer” and others), and Hugh Grant (“Music And Lyrics”).

Barrymore tabbed Gyllenhaal as the weakest thespian. Reminded by Corden that she had to rank them from most to least talented, she answered: Adam, Hugh, Jake.

“I’m sorry, Jake,” she said. “It was the turkey testicle.”

Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school is implementing a new rule in hopes of preventing the gun violence that left 17 dead at the South Florida school on Feb. 14. Many of its students, however, are not happy with the change.

Beginning after spring break, all students will have to wear clear backpacks, Robert W. Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, announced on Wednesday, according to The New York Times.

If students can’t afford a clear backpack, Runcie said in the announcement letter he sent to students and parents, the district will provide them for free.

In addition, students and staff will be required to carry ID badges with them at all times during school hours. Runcie added the district is considering metal detectors at all school entrances.

In the last month, officials found two students at the South Florida high school with knives on campus and officers arrested another student for making threats on social media. On Monday, authorities arrested the younger brother of accused gunman Nikolas Cruz for trespassing on school grounds.

While school safety should be a priority, many Marjory Stoneman Douglas students are not happy with the announcement of the new rule, which comes just days before the student-led March for Our Lives is set to take place in Washington, D.C.

Some students pointed out that clear backpacks are not going to stop gun violence, while others said the change will make their school look like a prison.

Great. Because clear backpacks are gonna fix everything. I appreciate the attempt, but I’d rather have common since gun laws than a clear backpack.

The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas have been pushing for gun law reform since the massacre last month. Their social media campaign, #NeverAgain, has galvanized a movement and garnered support from big names like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and George Clooney.

The teens also organized last week’s 17-minute walkout at high schools across the country and even pressured Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) to enact the state’s first gun control measure in over two decades.

Other Twitter users criticized the clear backpack rule, with many echoing the issues stated by Marjory Stoneman Douglas students.

Some users also pointed out that the translucent backpacks will impact teen girls disproportionately because many have no other place to conceal sanitary pads and tampons.

They'd rather inconvenience teenagers and make teen girls showcase every pad and tampon at school than to stop selling assault rifles made for combat zones.

They really out here turning Stoneman high school into a prison making them wear clear backpacks and ID badges at all times... — Kiarra McMellon (@ughkeeks) March 22, 2018WASHINGTON ― A Republican House majority that rode to power in 2010 with promises including making sure bill text is available for at least three days before it’s voted on ― and statements that lawmakers ought to read the bills before voting ― approved a 2,232-page measure Thursday that nobody could have possibly read.

The text of the massive $1.3 trillion spending deal dropped around 8 p.m. Wednesday. Almost exactly 17 hours later, at 1 p.m. Thursday, House lawmakers passed the bill 256-167.

As Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) asked on the House floor Thursday: What happened to the tea party that “harangued” Democrats about having time to read bills?

“Is there no shame?” Hoyer asked. “Is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed?”

In interviews with more than 20 GOP lawmakers Thursday, the answer was, largely, no.

Time and again, Republicans who came to Congress using hashtags like #ReadTheBill were happy to vote for a beginning-of-the-year bipartisan spending deal ― a fiscal year that was supposed to have begun on Oct. 1, mind you ― and they dismissed arguments that lawmakers and the public ought to have time to read the legislation before it gets a vote.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was asked about the broken procedural promises of his speakership Thursday ― there hasn’t been an open rule vote, where any member could offer an amendment to a bill on the floor, in two years; Republicans have routinely stripped provisions from legislation using rules (so-called “legislating on the rule”); and leadership has broken the three-day rule often. Ryan claimed, “By and large, we’ve done a phenomenal job.”

Ryan said lawmakers were working against a hard deadline and that Republicans had passed much of this legislation in September when they advanced two spending bills encompassing the 12 appropriations bills, so it wasn’t as if there were any “big surprises.”

But those bills were passed under different spending numbers, and scores of provisions were added to this final legislation in the past few months. Lawmakers and the public don’t know what they don’t know about the bill until they’ve actually read it ― or, more likely, a news organization or member discovers a controversial provision and it becomes an issue.

Just don’t tell Republicans that.

“Everyone knows what’s in this,” Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) told HuffPost.

When we challenged that claim, noting that the public had hardly any time to review the bill, Jenkins said the public “can go through it just like we are.”

“The ‘Read the Bill’ sentiment is in full bloom and on full display.” - Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.)

When we raised the point that it would be impossible for someone to have read the bill in the time before the vote, Jenkins said the bill was being drafted by the Appropriations Committee since December. And when HuffPost noted that the public still wouldn’t have had an opportunity to read the bill when it was being negotiated behind closed doors, Jenkins said the public could “visit with their member of Congress. Their member of Congress can communicate to them what’s in it.”

Time and again Thursday, Republicans acted as if they weren’t violating the promises they made when they took over the majority and issued the “Pledge to America” ― a 45-page document that promises, among many other things, that the text of a bill will be online for at least three days before lawmakers votes on it.

When we asked Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) what happened to the “Read the Bill” sentiment in Congress, Roskam said, “The ‘Read the Bill’ sentiment is in full bloom and on full display.”

When we asked Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) about reading the bill, he told us, “We don’t live in a perfect world.”

“I’d like it to be better, but again, you have to do what you have to do. Democracy isn’t pretty but it works,” King said, mentioning that he relies on staff and legislation summaries from leadership to make up his mind.

Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) was sympathetic to concerns about reading the bill, but he noted that Congress was coming up against a funding deadline. When we raised the possibility of passing, say, a five-day continuing resolution to keep the government open while giving lawmakers more time to read the bill, Wilson said he would have supported that.

Other Republicans responded to questions about reading the bill by pointing out frustrations with the Senate and the 60-vote threshold for cloture, while some argued that it was perhaps immaterial that the public didn’t have time to read the bill.

“As you know, the bills are written in legalese,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) told HuffPost. “Very few people can understand the bill.”

But there were some Republicans who did speak out against GOP leaders quickly scheduling a vote on the omnibus.

“We can’t even keep our military and intelligence secrets, but we can sure keep a secret from members of Congress on what is being negotiated on a spending bill.” - Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.)

“I think it’s disgusting,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said. “Totally irresponsible. Totally violates our duty to our constituents.”

When we asked Amash about whatever happened to the GOP promises of “Read the Bill,” he was straight-forward. “Yeah, they lied,” he said. “Flat out.”

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) was also disgusted by the broken promises, saying there was not a single member who had read the bill. “You know why I know that? Because I stayed up all night trying to read it, and as fast as I was reading, there’s no way they read it,” Meadows said, mentioning that he got to pages numbered somewhere in the 700s.

Other members also pointed out that, despite claims from some Republicans that everyone has known what this bill would look like, the omnibus was kept under wraps.

“This has been the best-kept secret in Washington,” Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said. “We can’t even keep our military and intelligence secrets, but we can sure keep a secret from members of Congress on what is being negotiated on a spending bill.”

Loudermilk and Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio) both said they were voting against the bill because of their procedural concerns.

Some Republicans did seem to sense that voting for a 2,232-page bill hours after it was introduced could be politically toxic. (Renacci is currently in a tough Senate election in Ohio.)

But National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (Ohio) doesn’t think this vote will come back to bite Republicans.

“If they want to attack something they voted for,” Stivers said of Democrats, “I think that’s hard to justify.”

Never mind that the Democrats who would be attacking incumbent Republicans for their votes on the omnibus aren’t currently in Congress. GOP leaders were celebrating the passage of the omnibus as a big win.

In the words of Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho): “These people have no shame. And they’ll say whatever to get elected. But I think the American people deserve better than this.”It was only a matter of time before the simmering feud between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden got transformed into a savage meme mocking the pair.

Biden lit the fuse Tuesday when he announced at a University of Miami rally that he’d have “beat the hell out of” Trump in high school over his treatment of women. Trump tweeted his explosive reply early Thursday:

Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018

Biden received widespread criticism for using the threat of violence against Trump as a response to Trump’s derogatory treatment of women. Needless to say, Trump also caught heat for his overly aggressive reply.

Most people on Twitter who addressed the exchange recognized the senselessness of it and took the opportunity to ridicule the two politicians ― with some also exploring the possibility of a fight between the duo:

Oh Look! It’s Joe Biden “going down fast and hard”!

How much would an MMA style fight between Trump and Biden make on paper view? I mean I'd pay up. — Nick Robertson (@NickRobertson10) March 22, 2018AUSTIN, Texas ― On Tuesday, this city was completely a different place.

It was less than 24 hours before Mark Anthony Conditt would be identified as the bomber who’d been taunting and terrorizing locals with a string of explosive attacks, and Austin was in panic mode.

Austinites had woken up to the news that a package headed for their city exploded at a FedEx facility outside San Antonio, signaling that their bomber had changed his tactics yet again. There was no indication that police were even close to the killer, let alone ready to confront him.

For 64-year-old James Barnes, who walked his dog daily past the site where a tripwire bomb exploded and injured his neighbors, Tuesday was the day he decided that maybe help wasn’t coming. If police were offering a reward, he said, the trail could be cold. Austin was under siege from an unknown assailant, and as he walked, Barnes couldn’t help but think of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

“When that happened, you felt like the U.S. is under attack,” he told HuffPost. “And I felt that way this morning. I felt like, wow, Austin is under attack. It’s a sick feeling.”

That feeling of helplessness had spread like a virus since the first bomb killed a man on March 2. Some locals took the investigation into their own hands. No rumor was too small, no pub gossip too wacky.

Hours after the FedEx explosion, we found 18-year-old Walker Weeden investigating the crime scene in his southwestern Austin neighborhood. The high schooler stood over a blast site, just four houses down from his own, pointing out the last bits of evidence available to him: a small patch of dirt and a hole in a nearby fence, scars of the tripwire bomb that detonated there two days prior, injuring two of his friends and sending shrapnel flying through the fence and outward toward his suburban neighborhood.

He, like everyone else in Austin that day, had his own ideas about the nature of the bombings. Tangible evidence and clues were hard to come by, so Weeden filled in the blanks himself.

What a difference 24 hours did for a community’s psyche. On Tuesday, 18-year-old Walker Weeden was showing me the site where a tripwire bomb injured his friends in Austin. He was trying to figure out where the next bombing location would be. That night, the bomber was dead. pic.twitter.com/EfBKOgMwQL — Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell) March 22, 2018

He offered that bombs were being planted in a pattern, circling the city center, each attack hinting at the next bomb’s general location. The assailant struck in the north on March 2 and circled down “in a clockwise manner” with two more bombings, and then he hit the residential neighborhood where Weeden lives. If the bomber was planning to strike again using that pattern, Weeden said, he’d probably choose a northwestern neighborhood as his next target.

“We’re thinking Northwest Hills, West Lake, or maybe even the Arboretum,” Weeden said.

His hypothesis was one of many in a city that had no answers. Six bombing incidents left locals on high alert, each fully prepared for the next explosion and with nowhere to turn but their own anxiety. As of Tuesday, exhausted Austin police had fielded more than 1,200 reports of suspicious packages since March 2, and at that moment, there was no resolution in sight for the residents who had called them in. There were no suspects, no descriptions of the bomb-making material, no rhyme or reason for the attacks.

Some wondered whether the assailant was current or former military, given the sophistication of the devices; they’d soon learn that Conditt had no military service under his belt. Others pointed to dozens of white supremacist groups that have ties to the city, noting that the first three bombings hit areas where black and Hispanic residents live. Those neighborhoods are still on edge. Even after Conditt was confirmed to be dead, residents in a largely African-American community where 17-year-old Draylen Mason was killed by a bomb on March 12 said they were on the lookout for more explosives. They, too, had their theories.

“I knew police were on [Conditt’s] trail because it got too quiet on Tuesday,” said Clifton Bailey, a 40-year resident of Mason’s neighborhood who said he hugged the boy and congratulated him on his acceptance into college five days before he died.

“I think this young man was trying to get caught. He started in communities like this one, without any cameras, then he went to a FedEx with a big blond wig and dropped off a bomb,” he said of Conditt.

When Bailey saw photos of Conditt circulate in the news on Wednesday, he saw anger.

“When I saw his face, I thought about South Carolina, where a young white gentleman sat down in a church and then killed everyone inside. There’s anger there,” Bailey said. ” ... [Conditt] was homeschooled, he wasn’t around other kids very much, he didn’t have college, and here in my neighborhood is a successful boy who had college and a career ahead of him. People like him don’t want to work hard to change, and they get angry at the world, and want to go out and do some harm.”

Other residents said the neighborhood had changed — that locals were more reserved since the bombing, mostly out of fear that it would happen again. At the time they were less worried about why and more worried about what was coming next.

Beyond that neighborhood, though, gossip was as good as evidence. People were happy to disclose where they thought the next bomb would detonate, based on theories like Weeden’s.

“Go talk to people in Tarrytown,” a Northwest Hills resident told HuffPost on Tuesday. “That’s the only logical place for the next attack, if there is one.”

Over in Tarrytown, a bartender scoffed at the idea that this ritzy neighborhood would be targeted. He was, however, jarred by a bomb threat on Saturday that led to the cancellation of a Roots concert he attended at the South by Southwest festival.

“I went down there, it was a complete shitshow,” said the bartender, who declined to give his name. “How could they let all those people gather in one space and then announce that it was canceled because of a bomb threat?”

As locals suffered from a collective hysteria over the bombings, each new incident bred mayhem, whether or not it had a connection to Conditt.

On Tuesday night, a throng of police, reporters and residents raced to the scene of a reported explosion at a Goodwill on the city’s south side. Jerry Davis, the CEO of Goodwill Central Texas, declared at the time, “Someone donated a bomb to us today,” telling HuffPost that one of the employees there had picked up a device that detonated in his hands. Minutes later, Austin police confirmed that an odd “incendiary device” had indeed injured the employee, but didn’t bear any connection to Conditt and instead resembled “some type of military ordinance or memento” that caught fire.

Explosions, rumors, false alarms, anxiety. Tuesday felt like the new day in the life for Austin. Its residents were carrying on, but now they had to watch where they stepped.

Then Wednesday morning happened. Just after 2 a.m., police confronted Conditt, who blew himself up in his car as SWAT personnel approached on Interstate 35 near Round Rock, north of Austin.

By the time the sun rose and news reports began detailing who Conditt was, locals weren’t interested in finding out whose armchair detective work had been correct the day prior. They were surprised and relieved that police had been closer than they thought, and that the madness of the past 24 hours had subsided.On Friday, the late-night host said he was also skeptical about how much the American public really cares about the big event.

So he decided to put people on the streets of Los Angeles to the test ― by asking them what they thought of the ceremony before it had even taken place.

Check out the full clip above.Seth Meyers once again had some fun at President Donald Trump’s expense on Wednesday’s broadcast of “Late Night.”

The comedian noted that “with all the questions swirling around Trump right now, you’d think he’d (Trump) be eager distance himself from Russian President Vladimir Putin.”

Meyers then likened Trump calling Putin to congratulate him on his election victory to “cheating on your wife and then posing for a picture with the woman you cheated with.”

“And, oh right, he did that too,” Meyers quipped as a photograph of Trump with porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleges she had an affair with the then reality television personality in 2006, flashed up on screen.

“I forgot who we were talking about for a second,” Meyers added.

Check out the clip above, and Meyers’ monologue below:Samantha Bee delivered a blistering message to outgoing White House communications director Hope Hicks on Wednesday’s “Full Frontal.”

“I cannot let another week go by without saying, ‘Fuck you, Hope Hicks,’” Bee began.

The late-night host said she’d “never talked much about Hope,” who quit her job in February, because “unlike every other member of the Trump orbit she doesn’t careen onto our television screens lobbing lies and racial invective every damn day.”

“But that doesn’t mean she should get a pass,” Bee added, before imagining how St. Peter would welcome Hicks at the gates of “nice white Protestant heaven: “You think you’re getting in here? You helped burned down democracy, bitch.”A proposed budget to fund the U.S. government carves out an additional $2 billion annually toward wildfire disaster response after a series of record-breaking wildfire seasons have plagued the West.

The bipartisan measure would allow for an additional $20 billion in wildfire disaster funding over 10 years to prevent “fire borrowing,” which occurs when officials from the Forest Service and other federal agencies use money set aside for fire prevention and reforestation programs to fight wildfires.

Fire borrowing has become an increasingly common practice as wildfires grow more destructive due to climate change. The eight worst wildfire seasons on record have all occurred in the past 15 years, according to the National Wildlife Federation.

The provision creates a contingency account through 2027 that can only be tapped by officials once funds from the usual firefighting accounts have been drained, according to The Associated Press.

Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), along with Reps. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), played key roles in securing the funding in the spending bill, which is awaiting Senate approval.

“This long-overdue, bipartisan solution to the madness of ‘fire borrowing’ will at last treat these infernos like the natural disasters they are, with the benefit that millions of dollars will now be liberated each year for essential wildfire prevention,” Wyden said in a statement Thursday.

Environmental groups praised the additional wildfire disaster funding as a major step for conservation efforts.

“The comprehensive solution to the wildfire funding problem included in the bill is a tremendous victory,” Lynn Scarlett, co-chief external affairs officer for the Nature Conservancy, said in a statement Thursday.The first museum devoted to honoring and documenting historically black colleges and universities has opened its doors in Washington, D.C.

The HBCU Museum, located on Georgia Avenue, opened March 9, and it’s been attracting national media attention this week.

“Our goal is to highlight the accomplishments of not only HBCUs, but some of their most accomplished graduates,” reads the museum’s mission statement.

The venture is both family-run and mostly family-funded, museum executive director Terrence Forte told the Washington Business Journal. Both of his parents attended Howard University and, together, the family hopes the museum will serve as a point of education.

“We want to bridge the gap for those who might not know about historically Black college and universities’ stories,” Forte said.

A post shared by The HBCU Museum (@thehbcumuseum) on Feb 28, 2018 at 5:26pm PST

With a $10 admittance fee, the museum houses historic photos from HBCU students and culture throughout the years. But Forte hopes this is only the beginning. He noted that members from the community have already been asking to donate their own memorabilia.

Richard Humphreys founded the first HBCU, Cheyney University, in Pennsylvania in 1837, like many subsequent HBCUs it dedicated itself to providing higher education for black students during the segregation era. Most white universities and colleges openly barred black students from enrollment until the late 1960s.

There are currently 102 HBCUs. These colleges were founded out of a need to provide black students with access to higher education during times of segregation. HBCUs are still a necessity today, as they center black academia and culture while fostering a strong sense of community for black students, a void left by many predominantly white institutions.

Some notable alumna of HBCUs include: Taraji Henson (Howard Univeristy), Oprah Winfrey (Tennessee State University), Erykah Badu (Grambling State University), and Spike Lee (Morehouse College).

The statement from Chief Justice Thomas Saylor comes days after a dozen Republicans in the state House filed articles of impeachment to remove four of the five Democrats on the court. The Republicans say the Democratic justices exceeded their constitutional authority in implementing their own congressional map after striking down the current one as unlawfully gerrymandered. Therefore, the lawmakers said, the justices should be removed from office.

The state Supreme Court imposed its own map only after giving lawmakers and the governor three weeks to come up with a replacement map. Republicans enjoyed a consistent 13-5 majority with the old district boundaries, despite GOP candidates earning just 50 percent of Pennsylvania’s popular vote in recent presidential elections. The new map is expected to make congressional elections more competitive in the state.

“As Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, I am very concerned by the reported filing of impeachment resolutions against Justices of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania related to the Court’s decision about congressional redistricting,” Saylor said in a statement. “Threats of impeachment directed against Justices because of their decision in a particular case are an attack upon an independent judiciary, which is an essential component of our constitutional plan of government.”

Saylor and Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy, the only other Republican on the seven-member court, were the only justices who voted against striking down the map.

Christopher Borick, a professor of political science at Muhlenberg College, said it was uncommon for a sitting Supreme Court justice to speak out the way Saylor did.

“This is a very unusual move on the part of the Chief Justice and reflects the unprecedented calls for impeachment against a number of justices,” he wrote in an email. “The Court rarely makes such public statements toward another institution of government and in this case the rattling of the impeachment sword was loud enough to make Saylor react to a threat to the independence of the judiciary.”

State Rep. Cris Dush (R), who has led the call for impeachment, denied in a Wednesday interview that he sought retribution or to intimidate Democrats on the court. He also said he had received guarantees from House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R), the chair of the state government committee, that they would allow a vote on the impeachment legislation.

A majority of the House must vote to advance impeachment proceedings to the Senate, where two-thirds of the body must vote to remove an official from office. As of January, Republicans control 120 of 203 seats in the state House and 34 of 50 seats in the state Senate. The impeachment power is rarely used in the state.In a series of media interviews Wednesday night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally apologized for the social media giant’s role in enabling a massive data breach by British firm Cambridge Analytica and said his company is open to “the right” government regulation.

Zuckerberg gave interviews to a number of media outlets after days of silence on reports that Cambridge Analytica used data obtained through Facebook to help Donald Trump’s campaign target users in 2016. Zuckerberg covered a range of other topics, including speaking in front of Congress, possible government regulations and a long-awaited apology.

“This is a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry that this happened,” Zuckerberg said immediately during an interview with CNN’s Laurie Segall. He said the company would soon inform “everyone whose data was affected by these rogue apps” that have misused users’ information. He added that he’s “sure” someone is trying to influence the midterm elections.

“There are going to be some new tactics that we need to make sure that we observe and get in front of,” he said.

Zuckerberg also expressed the need for greater transparency at Facebook and said the company was open to some government regulation akin to that imposed on television and print media.

“I’m actually not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” he told CNN. “I think the question more is what is the right regulation rather than should we be regulated.”

His avalanche of interviews Wednesday covered quite a few issues that Zuckerberg had been criticized for not addressing in his statement earlier that day.

Zuckerberg posted a statement on Facebook in which he outlined several steps the social media platform would take to fix the mistakes that allowed Cambridge Analytica to violate company policy and access user data, including a full forensic audit. He failed to acknowledge, however, why Cambridge Analytica held on to the data for two years after Facebook realized the problem.

In an interview with Recode, Zuckerberg said he was open to testifying in front of Congress about the Cambridge Analytica incident, although he added a caveat saying he would be “open to doing it” if he was the “right [person]” to do so.

“We actually do this fairly regularly,” he told Recode. “There are lots of different topics that Congress needs and wants to know about, and the way that we approach it is that our responsibility is to make sure that they have access to all of the information that they need to have.”

Zuckerberg also said an audit of those tens of thousands of apps would take months and cost “many millions of dollars.”

In another interview with Wired, Zuckerberg pointed to legislation, such as the proposed Honest Ads Act, that would require social media companies to disclose who paid for advertisements on their websites.

“We’re building full ad transparency tools; even though it doesn’t necessarily seem like that specific bill is going to pass, we’re going to go implement most of it anyway,” he told Wired. “And that’s just because I think it will end up being good for our community and good for the internet.”

In an interview with The New York Times, he noted the company would soon institute new policies to cut back on the data given to the third-party apps that many Facebook users have opted into over the past decade.

“A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we’re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven’t used them for three months.”

Zuckerberg also addressed the ongoing #DeleteFacebook movement, which has urged social media users to delete their accounts on the platform.

“I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it’s not good,” he told the Times. “I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.”Joe Biden and Donald Trump face off. Reuters/Getty

Former Vice President Joe Biden was speaking at a rally against sexual violence on Tuesday night when he said he would have “beat the hell out of” President Donald Trump in high school for the way he treats women.

It was an odd sentiment, though Biden’s comments were met with laughter and applause from the crowd. And, of course, Trump responded.

“Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!”

As most things on the internet do, the feud ― between two grown men over 70 years old, might I add ― was retweeted, turned into a meme and quickly went viral. People on both sides of the aisle defended their party’s politician and dragged his opponent.

While I welcome any non-lady feud, there’s something troubling about the root of Biden’s and Trump’s comments. Biden boasted about beating up the president while he was at a rally against sexual violence for his organization It’s On Us. He later bizarrely suggested that men who treat women poorly are likely to be physically unattractive, essentially fat-shaming Trump.

Biden declined to comment further on his remarks through a spokesman.

Trump’s response ― specifically pointing out that Biden is “weak” both “mentally and physically” ― is a clear sign that Trump felt his masculinity was threatened by Biden’s remarks.

Both comments are peak toxic masculinity: Biden attempted to defend the honor of women with his brawny man strength and Trump responded to violence with more violence.

This macho rhetoric is, in fact, the root cause of the very issue Biden is campaigning against with It’s On Us. Responding to violence against women with more violence is wildly problematic. This feud, but specifically Biden’s initial comments, are exemplary of how men feel they need to prove themselves through violent or sexual acts to be seen as “real men.”

Toxic masculinity ― the concept that men are confined to strict gender roles that perpetuate violent and overly sexualized behavior ― is often the very reason for rampant sexual violence on college campuses and around the country.

When Biden essentially challenges Trump to a duel, he perpetuates the myth that women need good guys to protect them from the bad guys. In fact, what all sexual assault survivors need, but especially women, is to be seen as humans. Once women are seen as equals, they can no longer be used as objects men can consume haphazardly to make them look more manly to other men.

It’s safe to say that Trump’s track record with women is much worse than Biden’s. The president, who once bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. Trump regularly denies allegations of sexual and domestic abuse against not only him but also his former staffers as “fake news.”

Biden has a somewhat storied history with his treatment of women. The former vice president, who launched It’s On Us with President Barack Obama in 2014, has long advocated for women’s rights, including drafting the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.

He has, however, been widely criticized for how he handled professor Anita Hill’s accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during the latter’s 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Many people believe that Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn’t do enough to ensure those allegations were given full consideration. More recently, Biden has taken on the good old “Uncle Joe” persona, during which time he has been caught on camera being creepy and borderline inappropriate toward women.

While Biden’s behavior toward women is nowhere near that of Trump’s, his recent actions call into question his understanding of rape culture and the root cause of sexual violence on college campuses.Retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey did not mince his words on Wednesday when asked for his opinion about Jared Kushner.

“Putting Jared Kushner, a 30-something person with no foreign policy experience or defense policy experience, as a leading representative of the United States is simply outrageous,” McCaffrey told MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes.”

President Donald Trump has charged his son-in-law and senior adviser with bringing peace to the Middle East.

McCaffrey made his comments in response to a report by The Intercept which alleged that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had boasted about having Kushner “in his pocket.”

“The officers of our government, under the Constitution, have to be confirmed by the Senate whether they are ambassadors, generals or senior officials of the government,” said McCaffrey. “So reading out the State Department and having one-on-one contact with Jared Kushner, by phone and in person, is a huge threat to a rational policy making process.”

“It just has no precedent, in my view, in American government in modern times,” McCaffrey added. “This is the personalization of a family business dealing with U.S. policy.”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― Having failed to get Mexico and then Congress to pay for his promised “great wall” along the southern border, President Donald Trump’s White House nevertheless described 33 miles of levees and fencing in a new spending bill as a substantial victory Thursday.

Trump and his staff had been trying to carve out $25 billion in U.S. taxpayer money in the appropriations package for the budget year that ends Sept. 30, even though Trump had promised hundreds of times during his campaign in 2015 and 2016 that Mexico would pay for the wall’s construction.

“Generally speaking, we think this is a really, really good immigration package,” budget director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday while acknowledging that Trump was unable to get anywhere near what is needed to build a wall along the border, which is nearly 2,000 miles. “If Congress would give us the money to do it, we would do it now.”

Some of Trump’s political advisers, though, see wall construction as critical to Trump’s survival. He promised a wall along the Mexican border so many times over the course of his presidential campaign that failing to deliver would be disastrous ― in the November midterms and then in his presidential re-election campaign.

Although his base has been patient so far, the thinking goes, that could evaporate instantly if Trump signs the $1.3 trillion spending bill that does not make good on the wall promise. The Senate faces a midnight Friday deadline to pass the bill, which cleared the House on Thursday.

“You could key yourself up to lose 50 seats if you fuck around with this thing,” one Republican close to Trump said on the condition of anonymity. “He ought to shut down the government if he doesn’t get the money to start building the wall,” the Republican added.

At a White House press briefing, Mulvaney assured that Trump would not be doing that. “Let’s cut right to the chase: Is the president going to sign the bill? The answer is yes,” he said.

Mulvaney blamed Senate rules that require 60 votes to move most legislation ― including appropriations bills ― to a final vote. This allows Democrats to extract “their pound of flesh” in the spending package, he said.

“We don’t control all of the government,” Mulvaney said, even though Republicans hold the White House and control both chambers of Congress. “We do not control the Senate, under the current rules. Therefore we have to give the Democrats something.”

Yet, in this case, Trump was unable to get the wall money he wanted because he was unwilling to give Democrats what he has claimed he also wants: a permanent answer for the undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children, often called the Dreamers.

Trump tried to end protection from deportation for nearly 700,000 of those immigrants by rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September. Two courts temporarily have blocked Trump and forced him to reopen the program to current applicants, who can continue to renew their two-year work permits and deportation relief.

Trump has nonetheless insisted since he ended DACA that he is the champion of DACA recipients and that it is the Democrats who do not care about them.

“Democrats refused to take care of DACA,” Trump tweeted Friday evening. “Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care.”

White House legislative affairs director Michael Short said Trump offered Democrats three years of wall funding for three years of DACA protections but that Democrats rejected it. Short said the White House was willing to negotiate but Democrats were not.

“The Democrats in the House and the Senate have made it clear they think they’re winning in the courts and they do not want to fix this legislatively,” Mulvaney said.

But Democrats point out that they offered to support the full $25 billion to build Trump’s wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers. The White House rejected that offer, said Matt House, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Outside of the recent spending bill negotiations, Democrats have also proposed a number of bills to protect DACA recipients and other Dreamers, some of them with Republican support. They argue any solution should be permanent ― not renewable permits but a path to citizenship.

The White House worked to sink two of those bipartisan proposals in February while pushing its preferred plan to give a path to citizenship for Dreamers in exchange for wall funding, cuts to legal immigration and changes in asylum policies. That plan received only 39 votes on the Senate floor last month, while one of the bipartisan measures his administration successfully undermined had received 54 votes.

The failure to resolve DACA, however, has left Trump unable to deliver on one of his signature campaign promises.

Trump promised from the day he began his campaign in June 2015 that he would build a “great wall” to end illegal immigration from Mexico.

“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively,” Trump said in his Trump Tower announcement. “I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”

Over the coming 17 months, Trump promised many hundreds of times that he would build the wall quickly and at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Trump said that his wall would be at least 30 feet tall and extend deep underground to prevent people from tunneling beneath it. At a December 2015 visit to Manassas, Virginia, Trump even went into construction details.

“It’s going to be made of hardened concrete, and it’s going to be made out of rebar. That’s steel,” Trump said to a question from a young boy in the audience. “And we’re going to set [the rebar] in nice, heavy foundations.”

But having Mexico pay for a wall that country does not at all support has proved unrealistic. A planned meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto was recently canceled because Peña Nieto would not back away from his refusal to pay.

In the new “omnibus” spending bill, a grand total of 33 miles of the border between Mexico and the United States that is currently unsecured will get fencing, with 25 miles of that going atop new levees along the Rio Grande. A total of 14 miles of modern “wall,” such as the examples Trump recently visited in San Diego, will be built, Mulvaney said, but it will be on the U.S. side of an existing barrier in Southern California. In all, $1.6 billion was appropriated for border security enhancements, of which only $641 million are for the new fencing.

“We want the whole wall funded. You’ve heard the president say he wants $25 billion to finish the wall,” Mulvaney said. “Congress will not give us that without a DACA fix.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) used to hate deficits.

WASHINGTON ― Republicans are learning to love deficits and debt again, now that they are in power.

The $1.3 trillion budget package congressional leaders unveiled this week would boost spending to defense and domestic programs, and balloon the deficit. It’s a huge win for lawmakers of both parties and a bit of a setback for President Donald Trump, whose draconian spending proposals were largely ignored by Congress.

Republicans on Thursday touted new funding for the military, upgrades to the nation’s infrastructure system, and money to fight the growing opioid epidemic. The spending spree follows another budget buster ― their $1.5 trillion unpaid tax cut.

The splurge sets a drastically different tone for a party that not long ago professed to be extremely worried about the budget deficit, whose members screamed about a looming fiscal apocalypse and demanded dollar-for-dollar cuts in exchange for proposed spending increases by former President Barack Obama.

“If we don’t begin to deal with our debt and deficit in a serious way, we’re not going to have many options,” then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) warned in 2012, during one debt ceiling showdown. “I’m not going to apologize for leading. The real issue here is, will the president lead?”

Boehner’s successor as speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), became the poster boy for fiscal conservatism at the time. As chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee, Ryan crusaded around Washington with charts and PowerPoint presentations, saying the nation was at a “tipping point” because of its debt.

“The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy, and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead,” Ryan said in a 2011 response to Obama’s State of the Union speech. “On this current path, when my three children ― who are now 6, 7, and 8 years old ― are raising their own children, the federal government will double in size, and so will the taxes they pay. The next generation will inherit a stagnant economy and a diminished country.”

When Republicans are in power, they spend. When they are out of power, they harp about deficits and debt. It’s a strategy they have shamelessly executed with success over the course of several presidencies. During George W. Bush’s administration, for example, Republicans ran up the national credit card with two unpaid wars, two tax cuts, and a huge expansion of Medicare. And, it’s a tactic they’ll likely use in the future if Democrats succeed in clawing their way back into power ― by claiming the need to cut spending on entitlements and welfare programs.

The Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative group focused on cutting spending and taxes that has gone largely ignored during Trump’s presidency, urged lawmakers not to support the spending bill.

“It’s hard to see how any member of Congress ― liberal or conservative ― can vote on this 2,232-page deal less than 24 hours after the contents were made public,” the group said in a statement. “On top of that, this monster proposal simply fulfills the budget-busting deal that GOP leaders made with the Democrats last month. Voting for it would only affirm one’s support for permanent trillion-dollar deficits.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) similarly derided the budget deal and the rush to push the bill through Congress.At least two organizations have decided to drop Morgan Freeman after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment.

Women who previously worked with the Oscar-winning actor told CNN that he repeatedly made comments about their bodies or their clothing and frequently engaged in inappropriate touching.

In response to the allegations, Visa announced it had suspended him from its marketing campaign.

“We are aware of the allegations that have been made against Mr. Freeman. At this point, Visa will be suspending our marketing in which the actor is featured,” Visa said in a statement.

TransLink, Vancouver’s public transit system, also decided to stop using Freeman’s voice as part of an ad campaign to promote its Visa credit card and mobile payments on bus and Skytrain operations.

“In light of information we’ve learned ... of allegations regarding actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign on our transit system,” the transit system said a statement. “We will be reaching out to Visa to discuss further.”

A few hours after the report was released, Freeman, 80, issued an apology:

“Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy, I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent.”

A production assistant working on the 2015 film “Going in Style” said Morgan made numerous comments about her body, asked her several times if she was wearing underwear and tried to lift her skirt. Another worker on the set said women wore loose-fitting clothing in an effort to avoid Freeman’s attention.

Entertainment Tonight released footage on Thursday evening of two on-air interviews with Freeman that also revealed his attitude toward women. During an interview for the 2016 film “London Has Fallen,” Freeman asked a young female reporter, “My goodness, are you married? Fool around with other guys? I’m just asking.”

In 2015, he told author Janet Mock: “You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.”

Mock, who was a special correspondent for the interview, said Freeman’s treatment of her was an “exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women’s bodies.”

Freeman’s union, SAG-AFTRA, is considering what to do about Freeman’s Life Achievement Award. The award is given to actors who represent the “finest ideals of the acting profession,” CNN reported.Wedding fever is in the air in anticipation of Saturday’s royal nuptials between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

Such as the one about a mosquito that caused the bride to punch the groom in the face.In a fiery Thursday morning tweet, Trump ― referring to himself in the third person ― countered the argument that Hillary Clinton’s social media strategy was more sophisticated than his during the 2016 election cycle.

“Well, not saying that anymore!” he wrote, seemingly referring to the scandal engulfing Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, the social network from which the firm reportedly obtained its user data. Cambridge Analytica created a technology to better target and influence individuals on Facebook through a personality quiz, allowing it to reportedly collect data on 50 million people.

Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018

The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica ― former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was on the board ― to identify voters and the issues they were most passionate about, leading to questions about whether the technology helped propel Trump to victory. The firm has also been connected to various other political machinations, including the push for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Tex.) presidential run.

The company has denied that data acquired through Facebook was used as part of the services it offered the Trump campaign.
