A movie about a mute janitor romancing a godly fish-man won the Oscar for Best Picture.

Let’s maybe take a minute to consider how weird that is.

The same institution that has handed its top prize to movies about Gandhi, Shakespeare, William Wallace and Forrest Gump opted to honor an outré sci-fi ballad in which an amphibian’s erection is pantomimed in graphic detail. It’s certainly not the dullest outcome that could have occurred at Sunday’s awards.

“The Shape of Water” found itself in a heady position throughout the season. Based on the nebulous mix of horserace bellwethers ― precursor accolades, campaign machinations, box-office figures, media buzz ― it seemed Guillermo del Toro’s film lagged behind “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” the Martin McDonagh dramedy whose muddy racial politics didn’t prevent it from netting the Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA. Meanwhile, “Get Out,” “Dunkirk” and “Lady Bird” were considered potential spoilers, each representing a distinct idea about where Hollywood stands right now and where it is headed.

Such is the agony and ecstasy of Oscar season: As self-indulgent and frivolous as the whole affair can be, there is, for better and worse, a political substance behind the grand foxtrot toward Best Picture. It’s perhaps American popular culture’s most transparent statement about itself. “This is the movie we’re the most proud to have made ― its values reflect our values,” some 7,000 Hollywood constituents collectively say.

By comparison, “Get Out” was the academy’s most transgressive option, both in terms of its genre (a horror-comedy hybrid) and its themes (racist white suburbanites touting liberal ideals turn out to be the villains); no film like it has won in the Oscars’ 90-year history. “Lady Bird” offered a feminist vote, proving that pleasant coming-of-age movies about girls are just as important as World War II epics (“Dunkirk,” “Darkest Hour”) and polished Steven Spielberg productions (“The Post”). “Call Me By Your Name” would have signaled that, yes, a so-called gay movie can in fact win this award two years in a row.

“The Shape of Water” had none of those distinguishing medals to trumpet. Instead, it’s the year’s happy medium. It’s the nominee that fits safely inside Hollywood’s current narrative: Deeply rooted power structures are being excavated and abusers cast aside, but tangible progress will occur only in increments. We aren’t ready to let a sociopolitically conscious crowd-pleaser like “Get Out” take the big kahuna, but we will valorize an old-fashioned adventure sprinkled with queer undertones otherwise summarized via the rallying cry “love is love.”

Because, again, a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) fucks a godly fish-man (Doug Jones), and we swoon with the same emotional heft once devoted to “Titanic,” “West Side Story” and “Casablanca” ― all (deserving) Best Picture winners of yore. What a seemingly repulsive concept, brought to life in the dreamiest of fairytales and packaged for uncynical audiences willing to embrace such lore. Not bad for a fable about otherness.

It makes all too much sense, really, that “The Shape of Water” edged out more polarizing fare like “Three Billboards” and “Get Out.” If “Moonlight” was tasked last year with the somewhat unfair burden of representing Trumpian resistance, “Water” is the movie that sends us gliding into the future without making too pointed a statement along the way. The media spent a lot of energy picking apart the meaning of “Three Billboards,” so much so that a supposed backlash lit up the internet. And when Vox, Vulture, CNN, USA Today and Vanity Fair are all narrativizing a polarization that mostly exists among film critics and Twitter pundits, it sure can seem real. But I don’t believe that’s why “Billboards” lost on Sunday, nor could I believe that certain criticisms of Hawkins’ disabled protagonist would have cost “The Shape of Water” had it not won. The academy doesn’t care whether anyone online is angry because Sam Rockwell’s racist cop got a redemption arc. They do, however, care whether a movie has something concrete to say, because its ability to say something succinctly and entertainingly reflects the quality of its filmmaking.

With recent diversity initiatives that have broadened the group’s membership to include more women and young voters of color, we’re looking at a savvier academy than the one that thought “Crash” tackled America’s social ills. “Three Billboards” substituted mayhem for nuance, and its wishy-washy messaging made it inferior to the charm of “The Shape of Water,” in which, yep, a mute woman who feels unseen fucks a fish-man unfamiliar with the concept of love. Voters didn’t need any mass-media backlash to point them away from “Three Billboards”; all they needed was the compassion embedded in del Toro’s story.

RuPaul, the world-famous drag queen and host of VH1′s critically acclaimed “RuPaul’s Drag Race” franchise, is facing backlash for comments made last week about allowing openly transgender contestants to compete on his hit reality program.

The initial comments appeared in a profile of RuPaul in The Guardian. “Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it’s not men doing it, because at its core it’s a social statement and a big f-you to male-dominated culture,” RuPaul said in the interview. “So for men to do it, it’s really punk rock, because it’s a real rejection of masculinity.”

The interviewer then asked about Season 9 contestant Peppermint, the first openly transgender woman to compete on “Drag Race.”

“Mmmm. It’s an interesting area,” RuPaul responded. “Peppermint didn’t get breast implants until after she left our show; she was identifying as a woman, but she hadn’t really transitioned.”

The interviewer then followed up, asking Ru if he would accept a contestant who had “really transitioned” onto the show. The “Drag Race” host responded by saying, “Probably not. You can identify as a woman and say you’re transitioning, but it changes once you start changing your body. It takes on a different thing; it changes the whole concept of what we’re doing. We’ve had some girls who’ve had some injections in the face and maybe a little bit in the butt here and there, but they haven’t transitioned.”

Over the weekend, Ru began facing backlash for these initial comments. But the reality star then doubled down on his statements, re-sharing The Guardian interview Monday morning on his Twitter and posting a series of controversial tweets.

RuPaul almost immediately faced backlash from fans and former contestants alike. Many accused him of being a gatekeeper of sorts for the idea of “what drag is,” and lobbed accusations that the star was excluding women ― cis and trans alike ― from the prospect of competing on “Drag Race.”

Many queens who have been on your show have struggled w gender identity and many are trans. How disgusting to compare performance enhancing drugs to hormone replacements or other aspects of transitioning. This is incredibly disrespectful. — tori (@toritouzinsky) March 5, 2018

you have zero right to gatekeep drag, drag is an art form, it can be interpreted and executed in many different ways, drag was always about freedom, liberty and self confidence, disallowing particular people that luxury in your eyes is limiting and wrong, but go ahead block me — ANGUSRAZE (@ANGUSRAZE) March 5, 2018

How is transitioning to female "performance-enhancing"? That would seem to imply that the end goal of drag is simply to look like the fishiest woman. I was led to believe it was about charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent. And turning the very idea of gender on its head. — Quiçá (@lackOfDaysical) March 5, 2018

I am heart broken that a community begging for inclusivity and acceptance would be so hypocritical as to profit from the trans community while simultaneously acting as oppressor — VICKY VOX (@TheVickyVox) March 5, 2018

Gia Gunn, who appeared on Season 6 of “Drag Race” and came out as transgender in 2017, also spoke out.

Although I do feel the separation from being a drag queen and now a trans woman, there should not be any reason to be “not accepted” when it comes to the art of drag. If you are a fierce artist, your a fierce artist & should be judged based on your art. NOT your gender identity! — Gia Gunn (@GiaGunn) March 5, 2018

Monica Beverly Hillz, another former contestant who came out as trans during the fifth season of “Drag Race,” told Into, “I’ve always been a woman, so what I’ve done to my body or that I hadn’t started hormones while on the show doesn’t take away my identity. Our bodies do not equate our identity.”

“Drag Race” faced criticism in the past for using the phrase “she-mail,” which many viewers perceived as transphobic. The show’s producers stopped using the controversial phrase in 2014.

RuPaul addressed the controversy on Twitter Monday evening, saying he regretted “the hurt I have caused.”

“The trans community are heroes of our shared LGBTQ movement. You are my teachers,” he said. On “Drag Race,” he noted, “the only thing we’ve ever screened for is charisma uniqueness nerve and talent.”

“And that will never change,” he concluded.

Each morning I pray to set aside everything I THINK I know, so I may have an open mind and a new experience. I understand and regret the hurt I have caused. The trans community are heroes of our shared LGBTQ movement. You are my teachers. pic.twitter.com/80Qi2halN2 — RuPaul (@RuPaul) March 5, 2018

Season 10 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” is slated to premiere at 8 p.m. ET/PT on March 22 on VH1.

This story has been updated with a statement from RuPaul.New recruits of the Vatican's elite Swiss Guard march in front of the tower of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) during the swearing-in ceremony at the Vatican May 6, 2014. Tony Gentile/Reuters

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A former president of the Vatican Bank has been ordered to stand trial on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, the Vatican said, the highest ranking Holy See financial official to be indicted.

A statement by the bank, officially known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), said the former president’s legal counsel was also indicted.

The two are Angelo Caloia, 78, who was president of the IOR from 1999 and 2009, and lawyer Gabriele Liuzzo, 94. A third person who was originally under investigation, former IOR director general Lelio Scaletti, died several years ago.

Caloia and Liuzzo have both repeatedly denied wrongdoing. They were not immediately available for comment on Friday.

The bank said “unlawful conduct” by the three was carried out between 2001 and 2008 during “the disposal of a considerable part of the institute’s real estate assets.”

It said damages had been estimated to be more than 50 million euro, or about $61 million, and that the IOR would be seeking compensation for damages. The trial is due to start on March 15.

Reuters reported exclusively in December 2014 that the Vatican’s top prosecutor, Gian Piero Milano, had frozen millions of dollars in accounts held by the three men.

They were suspected of embezzling money while managing the sale of 29 buildings sold by the Vatican bank to mainly Italian buyers between 2001 and 2008, according to a copy of the freezing order reviewed by Reuters at the time.

In the freezing order, Milano said the men regularly under-represented the proceeds from real estate sales in the Vatican bank’s official books. The men allegedly received the difference between the real sale prices and the amount officially recorded separately and often in cash, according to the order.

Some of the proceeds were deposited in a Rome bank account that was not registered on the IOR’s balance sheet, the prosecutor said.

The bank’s internal investigation into the alleged scam begun in 2013 by then-president Ernst von Freyberg, a German businessman.

Freyberg commissioned an independent audit of the sale of properties that had been owned by the bank after noting suspicious accounting procedures under previous administrations.

Feyberg, who was president until 2014, began an overhaul of the bank, which for decades was embroiled in numerous financial scandals.

Thousands of accounts were closed and last year Italy put the Vatican on its “white list” of states with cooperative financial institutions, ending years of mistrust and providing an endorsement of efforts by Pope Francis to clean up finances.

Moneyval, the monitoring body of the Council of Europe, has said in several evaluations that while the Vatican has made great strides in cleaning up the IOR and other financial departments, it needed to be much more aggressive in bringing cases to trial.MILAN (Reuters) - Fiorentina captain and Italy international Davide Astori died of a sudden illness at the age of 31 on Sunday, leaving Italian football in a state of shock.

Serie A postponed all of Sunday’s matches, including the derby between AC Milan and Inter Milan, as Italian and European clubs and dozens of players sent messages of condolence and expressed their disbelief.

“Fiorentina is deeply upset to have to announce that its captain Davide Astori has passed away, victim of a sudden illness,” said Fiorentina in a statement.

“Due to the terrible and delicate situation, and above all for the respect of his family, an appeal is made to everyone’s sensitivity.”

Defender Astori, in his 10th Serie A season, was found dead in his hotel room in Udine, where Fiorentina had been due to face Udinese at the Dacia Arena later on Sunday.

The Fiorentina staff became worried when Astori, who was married with a daughter, did not join his team mates for breakfast at around 9.30 a.m. local time, club spokesman Arturo Mastronardi told reporters outside the hotel.

Astori, who made 289 top-flight appearances, joined Fiorentina on loan in August 2015 and the club signed him outright one year later. He previously spent six seasons at Cagliari and one on loan at AS Roma.

He was raised at AC Milan but never played for their senior team.

He made 14 appearances for Italy between 2012 and 2017 and was in the squad at the Confederations Cup in 2013 where Italy finished third.

Udine state prosecutor Antonio Di Nicolo was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying it was believed“that the player died from a cardiac arrest, the result of natural causes”.

“GOODBYE CAPTAIN”

Fiorentina president Andrea Della Valle said Astori had been due to sign a new contract on Monday that would have kept him at the Florence-based club for the rest of his playing career.

“Davide was a true captain, a great person and it was an honour to have him hear for these years,” he told reporters.

Former Italy Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was one of the first to pay tribute to the player.

“It seems impossible. I’m in a state of disbelief and I cry with his family and all of Fiorentina. Goodbye captain,” he said on Twitter.

AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso said football became meaningless in such circumstances.“I can’t think of the derby after a tragedy like that,” he said on Twitter.

The teams were already on the pitch and warming up for the lunchtime match between Genoa and Cagliari when news broke of Astori’s death.

Fans applauded when Astori’s picture was shown on the stadium screen and left in silence when it was announced that the game would not go ahead.

Italian media reported that Cagliari coach Diego Lopez, a former team mate of Astori, needed medical treatment on hearing the news.

Veteran Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon wrote on Instagram:“You were the best expression of an out-of-fashion, old world ruled by values such as generosity, elegance, politeness and respect towards other people. You’ve been one of the best sportspeople I’ve ever met.”

Former AS Roma playmaker Francesco Totti said he was “shocked, incredulous and speechless for this tragedy”.

Cesare Prandelli, Astori’s coach in most of his Italy games, said he was“deeply upset, I feel a great emptiness inside”.

Giovanni Malago, the head of the Italian Olympic Committee and acting head of Serie A, said it was his duty to call off Sunday’s matches, which he did at the request of the clubs.

“I have spoken to more than one doctor and I don’t want to get involved in speculation,” he said.“I believe that no doctor in the world can ever tell you that there is a foolproof remedy when it comes to the risk of sudden death.”ROME (Reuters) - Italy faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, spurning traditional parties and flocking to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers.

With votes counted from more than 75 percent of polling stations, it looked almost certain that none of the three main factions would be able to govern alone and there was little prospect of a return to mainstream government, creating a dilemma for the European Union.

A rightist alliance including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) held the biggest bloc of votes.

In a bitter personal defeat that appeared unlikely last week, the billionaire media magnate’s party looked almost certain to be overtaken by its ally, the far-right League, which campaigned on a fiercely anti-migrant ticket.

But the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement saw its support soar to become Italy’s largest single party by far, and one of its senior officials said on Monday that forming a coalition without it would be impossible.

The League’s economics chief on Monday raised the possibility of an alliance with 5-Star. Any government based on that combination would be euro-skeptic, likely to challenge EU budget restrictions and be little interested in further European integration.

The full result is not due until later on Monday and, with the centre-right coalition on course for 37 percent of the vote and 5-Star for 31 percent, swift new elections to try to break the deadlock are another plausible scenario.

Despite overseeing a modest economic recovery, the ruling centre-left coalition trailed a distant third on 22 percent, hit by widespread anger over persistent poverty, high unemployment and an influx of more than 600,000 migrants over the past four years.

Prolonged political stalemate could make heavily indebted Italy the focus of market concern in Europe, now that the threat of German instability has receded after the revival on Sunday of a grand coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel.

In early European trading, the euro dipped while investors dumped Italian government debt, with the yield on its 10-year bonds jumping 10 basis points.

“Italy is far from having sorted its long-standing problems, and now it will have new ones. Be prepared for long and complex negotiations,” said Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at the Italian Treasury.

Parliament will meet for the first time on March 23 and President Sergio Mattarella is not expected to open formal talks on forming a government until early April.

“ITALY UNGOVERNABLE”

During two months of election campaigning, party leaders repeatedly ruled out any post-election tie-ups. However, Italy has a long history of finding a way out of the apparently intractable political stalemate.

The 5-Star once rejected talk of any power sharing, but it now says it is willing to discuss common policies but not negotiate over cabinet posts.

Led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, the movement was formed in 2009 and has fed off public fury over institutional corruption and economic hardship. Some have questioned whether other parties would be able to work with it.

“Di Maio wins, Italy ungovernable,” was the front page headline on La Stampa newspaper.

Claudio Borghi, the League’s economics chief, on Monday suggested that, with Berlusconi on course to lose the leadership of the center right for the first time since he entered politics in 1994, a centre-right headed by League leader Matteo Salvini could find a modus vivendi with 5-Star.

Borghi cited as an example the cancellation of a constitutional requirement to balance the budget.

Meanwhile senior 5-Star member Riccardo Fraccaro said nobody would be able to govern without his party. “We will ... (talk) with all the parties about what this country needs.”

Five-Star and the League once shared strong anti-euro views. The League still says it wants to leave the single currency but 5-Star now says the time for quitting it has passed.

Its flagship proposal in the election campaign was a minimum monthly income of up to 780 euros ($963) for the poor, helping it draw massive support in the underdeveloped south.

By contrast, Salvini and Berlusconi - heading for 18 percent and 14 percent respectively - appeared to have dominated the wealthier north, with the centre-left squeezed into a narrow stretch of central Italy.

“We did not anticipate this rationalization of the electorate... We are going to have to ... find a response,” said senior PD politician Ettore Rosato.

There was much speculation on Sunday night that PD leader and ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi would step down.“Saturday Night Live” cast member Pete Davidson claims President Donald Trump faked a congratulatory phone call during rehearsals for his November 2015 hosting appearance.

“He was like, ‘Hello,’” Davidson said, mimicking the call. “He goes, ‘Oh, fantastic. OK, great.’ And then he hung up and he goes, ‘Hey, everybody! My book just went number one.’”

Davidson told Complex’s “Open Late” that the call seemed fishy.

“I swear on my life, we were all, like, ‘Yo, that phone didn’t ring,’” he said.

WOW. 😳

Another cast member had a different recollection of the moment.

“During the table read, [Trump] stopped the table read in the middle the sketch to take a three-minute phone call to hear about his book becoming number one and announced it to everybody at the time,” Taran Killam told Larry King last year.

Killam, who often portrayed Trump on the show, also said the future president “didn’t have a great sense of humor” and was “stiff” on-air with no natural sense of timing.The region had already been badly damaged on Feb. 26, when the largest quake to hit the seismically-active highlands in nearly a century flattened buildings, triggered landslides, and closed oil and gas operations.

The toll on Monday stood at 55 killed, said James Justin, a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby, as news of more deaths arrived in the capital by shortwave radio.

Most of the confirmed fatalities were in and around the provincial capital of Mendi and the township of Tari, he said, where landslides buried homes and buildings collapsed on families.

“People are in great fear of their lives as the quakes are continuing ever since it started,” he said. “They actually want to know when it will stop.”

While the region has no major urban centers, around 670,000 people live within 62 miles of the epicenter, according to the Red Cross.

The quake has been felt on global natural gas markets, with ExxonMobil Corp declaring force majeure on exports from Papua New Guinea, according to an industry source, pushing Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices 5 percent higher.

The company declined to comment on the force majeure but said production would be knocked out for about 8 weeks.

Aid agencies have said nearly 150,000 people remain in urgent need of emergency supplies.

Australia, New Zealand and the Red Cross have all pledged aid, though reaching the remote area has proven challenging as forbidding terrain, bad weather, as well as damaged roads and runways have delayed aid efforts.

“The only way for people to go out is by chopper, and it’s slow for information to come through,” said Martin Mose, director of Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Centre, which has yet to complete a full assessment of damage.In the midst of a joke-filled monologue at a dinner with journalists, President Donald Trump suggested on Saturday that the United States will be meeting with North Korea but has told Pyongyang it must first “denuke.”

“Now we are talking and they, by the way, called up a couple of days ago. They said that ‘we would like to talk.’ And I said ‘So would we, but you have to denuke, you have to denuke,’” Trump told attendees at the annual Gridiron Club dinner.

“We will be meeting and we’ll see if anything positive happens,” he added.

It was unclear if Trump was joking or if formal U.S.-North Korea talks were imminent.

“I won’t rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un. I just won’t,” he said, referring to North Korea’s leader.

Trump did, however, make a joke at his own expense.

“As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that’s his problem, not mine,” Trump said.Workers have protested at the state capitol every day the legislature has been in session since the strike began Feb. 22. Dave Jamieson/HuffPost

The West Virginia teachers strike appeared all but certain to carry into next week after state legislators passed a bill late Saturday that would give educators a smaller raise than the governor had told them they would get.

The state Senate approved a measure granting teachers, other school personnel and state employees a 4 percent raise to end a statewide walkout that has closed schools in every county for seven days.

But the deal announced by Gov. Jim Justice (R) earlier this week ― and the one that the West Virginia House of Delegates had overwhelmingly approved in order to end the work stoppage ― would have given teachers and other school employees a 5 percent raise and state employees a 3 percent raise.

Unions representing school employees weren’t happy with the Senate’s decision to split the difference on raises. If the numbers proposed by Gov. Justice were going to be changed, they said they wanted all state workers brought up to a 5 percent pay hike.

BREAKING: The amendment to the teacher pay raise bill passes 9-8, meaning the 5 percent raise for West Virginia teachers, school service personnel and State Police is trimmed to 4 percent. — Jake Jarvis (@NewsroomJake) March 3, 2018

In a joint statement, the unions said, “You do not equalize pay for different groups by simply taking away from one and passing it to another. The purpose of this is clear ― to divide us and pit us against each other.”

They called on protesters to fill the halls of the state capitol in Charleston again next week: “All public schools will be closed again on Monday and remain closed until the Senate honors the agreement that was made.”

Teachers and other school personnel began their walkout on Feb. 22, closing schools in all 55 of the state’s counties in an unprecedented show of solidarity. It was the first teachers strike of its kind to hit the state in nearly 30 years.

Workers are demanding that the state curb their rising health insurance costs and give them significant pay hikes after years of stagnant wages. Teachers haven’t seen an across-the-board raise since 2014, and increasing health premiums have caused some workers’ take-home pay to decrease. West Virginia ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, according to the National Education Association.

On Tuesday, it seemed the strike might be resolved when Justice announced his pay raise plan alongside union leaders. But many rank-and-file workers didn’t trust that Justice had the necessary votes, and they decided to continue the strike until a resolution was guaranteed.

Their concerns were well justified. Republican state senators apparently were not onboard with the plan that the governor announced. After it was passed by the House, they amended the bill so that the teachers’ pay hike would be dropped to 4 percent, all but guaranteeing that the unions would reject it.

The late Saturday night at the capitol came with some added drama. At first, senators accidentally passed a bill with language giving teachers the 5 percent raise they did not intend to give them.

Now they're moving to reconsider the passage of the bill. Basically, they're walking back all the previous steps. — Brad McElhinny (@BradMcElhinny) March 4, 2018

The lawmakers had to go through several procedural steps to recall the bill, amend it to a 4 percent raise and pass it again.President Donald Trump may not have had a role in the release of three California college basketball players arrested in China.

ESPN reported Friday that the three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players, who were allegedly caught shoplifting in China, were already scheduled to return home by the time Chief of Staff John Kelly said the White House was getting involved.

LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were in China for a game at the time of their arrests.

To recreate a timeline of the arrests, ESPN’s reporters spent three months conducting interviews with sources close to the team who were in China at the time of the incident.

“The situation was already resolved by the time we heard about Trump’s involvement,” one source told ESPN. “That’s not to take away from the fact that he got involved, but the players already had their passports back and their flights booked to go home Tuesday night when Gen. Kelly called the players.”

Earlier reports claimed the basketball players were released after Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump reportedly brought the issue up with Xi at a dinner during a visit to Beijing in November.

The incident sparked a feud between Trump and LiAngelo Ball’s father, LaVar Ball.

In an interview with CNN, Lavar said he’d rather thank Xi than Trump. He also expressed skepticism that Trump orchestrated his son’s release.

“Did he help the boys get out? I don’t know,” Ball said during the interview. “If I was going to thank somebody, I’d probably thank President Xi. He’s the president in China. Somebody can make a suggestion and somebody can do something.”

During their feud, Trump called Ball “very ungrateful” and claimed he was not taking his son’s shoplifting charges seriously enough.

Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017

Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017The 90th Academy Awards air March 4. Carlo Allegri via Getty Images

The countdown to the 90th Academy Awards is almost over, which means you might have some questions about the big night.

Of course, everyone wants to know who will take home the trophies on Sunday, but we can’t help you with that. We can, however, fill you in on some fun details about what many consider the biggest night of awards season, from what the statuette is made out of to whose names are popular when it comes to acceptance speeches. Here are seven facts below.

The statuette has an official name, and we’re not talking about Oscar.

The trophy given out at the big show is actually called the Academy Award of Merit, but it’s known as an Oscar. Why? No one really knows. According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences site, there’s a theory that a librarian and later executive director for the academy noted that the statuette resembled her uncle named Oscar. The nickname wasn’t officially associated with the trophy until 1939 despite it gaining popularity years earlier, thanks to a story that discussed Katharine Hepburn’s past Best Actress win.

The award is 13 1/2 inches tall and weighs 8 1/2 pounds. It shows a knight holding a sword, standing on a film reel with five spokes. The spokes represent actors, directors, producers, technicians and writers.

The trophy is made up of solid bronze and plated in 24-karat gold ― except for three years in which there was a metal shortage because of the Second World War and the trophies were made of plaster. Don’t worry: Winners were able to trade them out for the regular trophies after the war.

The academy credits Cedric Gibbons, chief art director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, as the statuette’s designer and artist George Stanley as the sculptor. It takes about three months for 50 statuettes to be made.

This year, there are about 140 pieces of music that the orchestra must be prepared to play.

The show’s musical director, Harold Wheeler, told HuffPost that he handpicks his orchestra players “for their proficiency, for their versatility.” Wheeler and his musicians must be ready to play a variety of music, including hip-hop, pop, rock ‘n’ roll and scores from Hans Zimmer and John Williams. Although the orchestra must know more than 100 pieces, only a fraction of them are played.

There used to be awards specifically for young performers.

In the 1930s, Shirley Temple was the first performer to receive the Academy Juvenile Award, a mini Oscar trophy given to young stars to recognize their talent. As The Hollywood Reporter noted, the award relieved the stress for those who thought having a child compete with adults was awkward and inappropriate. It wasn’t given out every year like the usual awards, since there wasn’t always a contender to receive it. The academy stopped giving them out in 1962.

Ties can actually happen.

There have been six ties in the history of the Oscars. Being within three votes of the winner used to constitute a tie, but the academy changed the standards by 1950 so that an actual tie is necessary to give out the award to more than one contender.

As HuffPost senior entertainment reporter Leigh Blickley noted:

According to a source close to the academy, 23 out of the 24 Oscars categories are tabulated using a “winner-takes-all” system, meaning the person or movie with the most votes in each category wins ― period. If two or more nominees achieve this with the exact same number of votes, they all become winners.

Yep, that means there could be a three-way, four-way, or even five-way tie, depending on the number of nominees. Read more about the nomination and voting processes and the possibility of a tie here.

Someone once won an Oscar without even being included on the ballot.

In the 1930s, Hal Mohr became the first filmmaker to win an Oscar via write-in vote (for his cinematography work on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”). No one else has been given the opportunity for such an achievement, as the academy did away with the practice for its next award show.

Mohr didn’t need it, though: He later won another Oscar for his work on “Phantom of the Opera” in 1943.

According to Slate’s deep dive into actors’ Oscar acceptance speeches, Meryl Streep is one of the most popular people to thank. In a comparison done in 2014, of 47 speeches given in the last 12 years, she even beat out God for the coveted honor of being thanked most frequently in other people’s speeches. Oprah Winfrey and Sidney Poitier were not far behind.

That same year, Slate found that actresses more frequently give a shoutout to the academy first compared to actors, and giving thanks to your agent first is actually more rare than you’d think.

An Oscar isn’t actually worth that much. Kind of.

The academy has official regulations regarding the sale of its awards. They include the stipulation that a winner cannot attempt to sell or “dispose” of the statuette without “first offering to sell it to the Academy for the sum of $1.”

What if you’re an heir and you want to try it? Too bad. The rule applies to you, too.Me Too movement founder Tarana Burke is speaking out against E! News’ decision to continue having Ryan Seacrest spearhead its Academy Awards red carpet coverage despite recent sexual misconduct allegations against him.

The decision, she told Variety in a story published Sunday, is unfair to actresses who will have to decide whether to cooperate with his interview efforts at tonight’s telecast.

“We shouldn’t have to make those choices of, ‘Do we or don’t we?’” said Burke, whose campaign exploded last fall as dozens of women in Hollywood came forward with stories of sexual harassment and abuse they’ve faced working in the entertainment industry.

“This is not about his guilt or innocence,” Burke said. “It’s about there being an accusation that’s alive, and until they sort [it] out, it’s really on E! News and shouldn’t be on us. … It will let us know where they stand in terms of how respectful E! News is of this issue ― and of women.”

In a story published last week, Seacrest’s former personal stylist told Variety that the E! host sexually harassed and assaulted her over a period of seven years. The stylist, Suzie Hardy, said the network fired her in 2013 after she reported her allegations to the E! human resources department.

Seacrest has denied the accusations, and E! said last week that an independent third party carried out a comprehensive, two-month investigation that cleared his name of any wrongdoing.

But those advocating for fairer treatment of women in Hollywood may have other reasons to stay clear of E! and Seacrest on the red carpet.

In December, then-E! host Catt Sadler announced she was leaving the network, largely because she was only being paid half the salary of her male co-star and her requests for a raise were denied once she discovered that.Just in time for the Oscars, “Saturday Night Live” unveiled the Grabbies, mock awards for bad behavior by Hollywood’s “Academy of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct.”

The riff on the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements included a “pair of hands” statuette. Categories included “Most Open Robe,” “Best Animated Grope” and the “Cecil B. Molestin Lifetime Achievement Award.”

“I’m sure excited, and as a man, I’m nervous,” said Beck Bennett, playing a red carpet host with Cecily Strong in the sketch. He’s swapped out later for bad behavior. Chris Redd takes his place, but he’s also switched for the same thing.

“It’s really upsetting to be here tonight,” admitted Alex Moffat playing a nominee for the “Handsiest Actor.” He admits he’s in a tough category; the “competition is so stiff.”

“SNL” host Charles Barkley played a nominee up for “Best Non-Apology,” who initially urged women to come forward about sex harassment.

But when he was accused, what did he do to his accuser? “I called her a lying troll and had my lawyer post her home address,” he explained. And no, the pin on his lapel did not say “I’m With Her;” it said: “I’m With Herpes.”

“This is such a huge moment for you, you must be so ashamed,” Strong told Pete Davison, playing another potential Grabbie winner.

“You’d think so but no,” he replied.

Fans’ response was mixed on Twitter. Some absolutely loved the sketch. Others thought it wasn’t right to goof on Hollywood’s sexual harassment history.

The Grabbies Award bit on #SNL was too awkward and too inappropriate. It's kind of like rape jokes... DON'T GO THERE!... especially not for a 2-minute skit over and over again! — Quadrants4Change (@Quadrant4change) March 4, 2018Actor Alec Baldwin called into a radio station Friday pretending to be President Donald Trump scarfing down a “gigantic piece of chocolate cake.”

It was the latest blast in a bitter feud between Trump and Baldwin. On Friday, Trump blasted Baldwin’s career as “mediocre” and his impersonation of the president as “terrible.” Baldwin shot back, saying he planned to “hang in there for the impeachment hearings ... You know. The good stuff.”

Baldwin also spoke as himself when he called the Syracuse radio program on TK99 hosted by his brother Daniel.

Baldwin conceded that the “Saturday Night Live” crew may be creating its weekly sketches, including Trump impersonations, “by the seat of our pants.”

“We’re doing our civic duty,” he added. “We’re doing the best we can with what we have. Here we have this guy who is probably the greatest presidential impersonator we’ve ever seen in history.”

He said he hoped Trump would have a sense of humor about the program, then quipped that he wants the president to “tell his wife to stop calling me for tickets to the show.”

When Baldwin, impersonating Trump, was asked if the president should be blasting the actor instead of running the country, he said: “I got this. I’m the president. I won. I’m a multi-tasker. I’ve always done lots of things. I’ve always had five or six girlfriends at a time.”

Trump was harshly criticized Friday on MSNBC by former CIA director John Brennan, who expressed concerns about the president taking time to attack Baldwin while ignoring national security concerns, such as Russia’s announcement of new nuclear weapons.

“This is surreal,” Brennan said.

Agony though it may be, I’d like to hang in there for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride to Mara-A-Lago. You know. The Good Stuff. That we’ve all been waiting for. — ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) March 2, 2018Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday “if it’s true” that White House senior adviser Jared Kushner swayed U.S. foreign policy against Qatar for personal financial reasons, he “has to go.”

“If it’s true, it’s damning. If it’s true, Jared Kushner has to go,” Murphy, a prominent voice on foreign policy, said of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”

The Intercept reported on Friday that representatives of Kushner Companies, including Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, met with Qatari Finance Minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi in New York in April in a bid to secure Qatari financing for the firm’s distressed signature property, 666 5th Avenue.

There was a follow-up meeting between Kushner Companies representatives and Qatari officials the following day. But a deal never materialized.

Then, in early June, a coalition of nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates abruptly severed diplomatic relations with Qatar. They proceeded to blockade the small, natural gas-rich nation, ostensibly in retaliation for Qatar’s support of islamist movements abroad and cordial relationship with Iran. The blockade remains in effect.

Trump surprised many in the diplomatic community by initially backing the Saudis and Emiratis so whole-heartedly. Qatar, a longtime American partner, is home to a key strategic base for the U.S. military in the Middle East where thousands of troops are deployed.

“We could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudis’ side in this dispute between the Saudis, the Emiratis and Qatar, because the United States has very important interests in Qatar,” Murphy said Sunday.

Murphy noted the large U.S. troop presence in Qatar.

“To so firmly take the side of the Saudis against the Qataris that could potentially result in the downward spiral of the Qatari economy put thousands of Americans at risk,” he said.

Jared Kushner’s friendship with UAE Ambassador to the United States Yousef al-Otaiba and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman raised suspicion at the time he had encouraged Trump to take a hard line against Qatar.

News of the Kushner family’s attempts to gain Qatari financing for a family-owned property raises the prospect that Kushner advised the president to side with the Saudis and Emiratis for personal financial reasons.

If verified, that should be grounds for Kushner’s ouster, Murphy said.

“If the reason this administration put U.S. troops at risk in Qatar was to protect the Kushners’ financial interests, then that’s all the evidence you need to make some big changes in the White House,” he said.

NBC News reported Friday that special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Kushner’s business discussions with foreign powers during the presidential transition, well before his father’s April 2017 meeting, later influenced American foreign policy. In addition to Qatari representatives, Kushner met with figures from Turkey, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to the report.

The potentially damaging revelations about Kushner surfaced during an already punishing week for the Trump relative and confidant. Kushner, who had enjoyed a temporary top-secret security clearance, saw his clearance downgraded by the White House to merely “secret.”

Although the justification for the downgrade was not immediately clear, experts note that it was unusual for someone to have a temporary clearance for so long without receiving permanent access. The White House’s decision not to grant him a permanent security clearance likely sprang from intelligence agencies’ concerns that foreign governments have tried to influence him and that he initially failed to report his meetings with officials from those governments.

Also speaking on “This Week,” former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a onetime Trump transition team chief, implied that Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump (who’s also a White House adviser), should consider stepping down from their posts for the good of the president. (As a United States attorney, Christie sent Kushner’s father to prison, which likely chilled his relationship with Jared.)

Asked by Stephanopoulos whether Trump should fire Kushner, Christie responded, “The president’s going to have to make that judgment.”

He went on to suggest that Kushner and Ivanka might do well to spare Trump the difficulty of spurning family members by volunteering their resignations.President Donald Trump pulled no punches in his gibe-filled remarks at the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, joking about his top aides and opponents alike to the journalists and lawmakers in attendance.

Even son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner was not spared a roasting. The president opened his comments by mocking the recent downgrading of Kushner’s security clearance.

“Before I get started, I wanted to apologize for arriving a little bit late,” Trump began, according to pool reporters. “You know, we’re late tonight because Jared could not get through the security.”

Trump, who’d turned down an invitation to attend the annual event last year, went on to rib several other members of his administration — both current and former. He said former aide Steve Bannon spoke too much to the press, and “leaked more than the Titanic.” He referred to Vice President Mike Pence as his “apprentice.” And he joked that he’d offered a ride to Jeff Sessions, but the attorney general had “recused himself.”

The president also told a joke about his wife, Melania, who was in attendance.

“So many people have been leaving the White House. It’s invigorating since you want turnover. I like chaos. It really is good. Who’s going to be the next to leave ― [aide] Steve Miller or Melania?” Trump said.

“That’s terrible. But you love me right, honey?”

The quip was met with “gasps from the audience,” according to NPR.

In a nod to his penchant for over-the-top praise of his accomplishments, Trump said, “My staff was concerned that I couldn’t do self-deprecating humor. And I told them not to worry, nobody does self-deprecating humor better than I do.”

At the closed-door event, where filming was prohibited, Trump also discussed more somber issues like North Korea, saying he was open to direct talks with its leader, Kim Jong Un.

But he also quipped: “As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that’s his problem, not mine.”

He needled Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who he called “crazy” (but also “a fine woman”).

Noting that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) regularly calls for his impeachment, Trump said, “And I say — and I get in trouble for this — ‘she has to immediately take an IQ test,’ and people go crazy.”

The taunt has been criticized as “racist.”

Trump also took aim at one of his favorite targets: the press, who he described as his “opposition party.” The president told the journalists in the room that he wanted to “ruin your evening in person.”Jimmy Kimmel says he might have to apologize to President Donald Trump.

The “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host gave his audience the “Laurel vs. Yanny” test that swept the internet this week, then reached a conclusion on what it really means.

“Whether you hear ‘Laurel’ or ‘Yanny,’ there’s one thing I think we can all agree on: Nothing has ever mattered less than this,” Kimmel said.

But the whole debate got him thinking about how we perceive what’s real, and that led him to another conclusion.

“I may owe Donald Trump an apology,” Kimmel realized.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping Saturday after the ruling Communist party announced it was eliminating the two-term limit for the presidency, paving the way for Xi to serve indefinitely, according to audio aired by CNN.

“He’s now president for life, president for life. And he’s great,” Trump said, according to audio of excerpts of Trump’s remarks at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida aired by CNN. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday,” Trump said to cheers and applause from supporters.

It is not clear if Trump, 71, was making the comment about extending presidential service in jest. The White House did not respond to a request for comment late Saturday.

U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, said on Twitter that “whether this was a joke or not, talking about being President for life like Xi Jinping is the most unAmerican sentiment expressed by an American President. George Washington would roll over in his grave.”

U.S. presidents by tradition served a maximum of two four-year terms until President Franklin Roosevelt was elected a record four times starting in 1932. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution approved in 1951 limits presidents to two terms in office.

In order to change the current prohibition, it would require initial support of two-thirds of both houses of Congress or support of two-thirds of state legislatures - and then would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states.

China’s annual parliament gathering kicks off on Monday as Xi presses ahead with efforts to ward off financial risks without undermining the economy. The Communist party announced on Feb 25 the end of the two-term limit for the president - and the parliament is expected to ratify the move.

During the remarks, Trump praised Xi as “a great gentleman” and added: “He’s the most powerful (Chinese) president in a hundred years.” Trump said Xi had treated him “tremendously well” during his visit in November.

Trump has often praised Xi, but in January Trump told Reuters the United States was considering a big “fine” as part of a probe into China’s alleged theft of intellectual property. He has been critical of China’s trade policies.

Trump told The New York Times in December that because of North Korea he had “been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war.”Shaun White took home his third career snowboarding gold medal at this year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The Aguirres are foster parents — great ones, according to Maraldy Gutierrez, a social worker who places children with them — and the little girl called them mommy and daddy from the moment she met them. The Aguirres want to have biological children, too, and although Lisben has suffered a series of miscarriages, she recently had two surgeries she hopes will eventually allow her to carry a pregnancy to term.

It should have been a good year. But the Aguirres are scared it will all fall apart.

The married couple are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to temporarily stay and work without imminent fear of deportation.

President Donald Trump rescinded DACA in September and told Congress to pass legislation to help recipients by March 5 ― a deadline that is about to go by without action. If Trump and lawmakers fail to reach an agreement, all of the so-called Dreamers could eventually lose their status. The Aguirres would be unable to work legally and could find themselves at risk of deportation, leaving behind the children they want to give a home.

But for now, the Aguirres are trying to live normally. On weekdays, Lisben drives the little girl and a 17-year-old girl in their care to school near her job in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, where she cares for children for two families. The boy who lives with them, who just turned 18, goes to school at night. By the time Lisben leaves, Alex is long gone: He gets up at 4:30 a.m. so he can take a bus around 5 and make it to the breakfast and lunch shift at a Capitol Hill restaurant where he works as a waiter. He sometimes sees lawmakers there, and a few times has told them he’s a Dreamer and gotten hugs or promises to fight for him in return.

So far, Congress hasn’t acted. All the Aguirres — and the social workers and children who depend on them — can do for now is pray, and keep on doing the best they can.

“They are one of our most committed foster homes,” Gutierrez said. “I can’t think of a time that we have called them and they have said no.”

The Aguirres were both born in Guatemala and came to the U.S. when they were 15 years old, but they didn’t meet until years later. Alex came here to work, hoping to send money back for his family. Lisben’s parents sent her to the U.S. after she ran away with her then-boyfriend, whom she later married. Lisben is now 35 and Alex is 36.

The next years weren’t easy. Lisben’s first husband left her because they had trouble getting pregnant. Her next boyfriend hit her. He threatened to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement if she left him or told anyone about the abuse. One day, he hit her in the stomach so badly she had to see a doctor. She found out that she had been pregnant, but the blow caused her to suffer a miscarriage. The surgery to remove the fetus left her with scar tissue. She has had five miscarriages since.

When Lisben met Alex at a karaoke bar around 2002, she wasn’t ready for a relationship. They didn’t start dating until more than a decade later, after running into each other at an immigration rally. Alex sent Lisben a Facebook message asking her to meet up one evening. She had just poured a glass of wine and was planning on a relaxing evening in, but decided to go out anyway. They wound up at karaoke again. They started hanging out more often, and by the fall of 2015, their friendship developed into a relationship.

They got serious quickly. As their relationship progressed, Lisben decided to tell Alex she wasn’t sure she could have a baby. He reassured her he didn’t see her as any less of a woman and that if she couldn’t get pregnant, they’d build their family another way. Within two months, Alex and Lisben were engaged. They were married the following summer.

That same year, Lisben was approved for DACA. Her new status meant she would finally be able to apply for positions with her nursing assistant and teaching assistant certifications. Alex received his in two years earlier.

In September 2016, a woman from their church community suggested they become foster parents, arguing they could be enormously helpful to bilingual children in need of a home. Alex and Lisben decided to go for it.

“We’re giving our hearts. We’re trying to make a better place for other people. We’re helping as much as we can.” - Lisben Aguirre

They went through months of screenings and trainings to become foster parents — and finally got their license and became foster parents last June.

But before the Aguirres could take in foster kids, they needed a bigger place. They told the foster care agency that they would move, but Gutierrez didn’t expect them to act so quickly. It’s a struggle to find foster parents in D.C. at all in part because high rents make it difficult to find people with enough space to do it.

The Aguirres first looked at two-bedroom apartments when a friend suggested they try to buy a house instead. They were surprised to find one they could afford, and with four bedrooms ― enough to take in three kids at a time. Alex felt he had finally accomplished the American dream. Thanks to years of hard work, he owned his own home. The couple’s framed foster care home license stands displayed on top of a glass bookcase in their new dining room. The lower shelves of the case are dedicated to wedding photos and religious paraphernalia.

“I can say I made it,” he said. “We made it.”

Taking in foster children changed Alex and Lisben. When they first met the little girl who embraced them as mommy and daddy, Alex cried.

“I need them and they need me,” he said. “That fills the space in my heart to be a dad.”

The Aguirres’ next dream is to have a baby or adopt. Lisben found out last month that she will need a third surgery to remove scar tissue from her uterus so she can successfully carry a child. If not, they’d like to look into adoption.

But since Congress hasn’t passed any legislation to help Dreamers like the Aguirres, even though lawmakers in both parties say they want to, those plans are on hold. Multiple proposals, including Trump’s, failed in the Senate last month, and the House hasn’t even voted on bills to firm up DACA recipients’ status. The Trump administration is accepting renewal applications, but only because a court forced it to. Lisben applied to renew her DACA protections after the injunction and is waiting to be approved, while Alex’s permit is set to expire next year. They want a permanent fix.

Now the Aguirres are afraid of having children, since their child would be a U.S. citizen and they would not. They wouldn’t want the baby to have to leave his or her native country should they lose DACA and need to leave.

The failure to pass Dreamer legislation would also complicate their plans to adopt.

“If we want to adopt, how can we adopt if they don’t pass the Dream Act?” Lisben said, referring to a bill that would grant Dreamers legal status. “We’re going to cut our dreams and the dreams of the kids who were born here, so it’s not fair for them and it’s not fair for us.”

The Aguirres have a Plan B for if Congress fails to step in to help them. Neither wants to go back to Guatemala, where there are few job opportunities and they worry they’d be in danger as new arrivals back from the U.S. But maybe they could go to Canada or somewhere in Europe.

For now, the U.S. doesn’t feel safe. Their house doesn’t have a peephole in the front door, and since they applied for DACA and became foster parents, the government is well aware of where they are, should Trump decide to target Dreamers for deportation.
