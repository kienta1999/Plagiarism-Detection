May 4 can’t come soon enough.

The official trailer for the critically acclaimed documentary film on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appropriately titled “RBG,” was released on Wednesday ― just in time for International Women’s Day.

In the sneak peek, Ginsburg reflects on her barrier-breaking career as a lawyer and her rise to the nation’s highest court.

“I did see myself as kind of a kindergarten teacher in those days, because the judges didn’t think sex discrimination existed,” she says in the documentary, describing her early legal advocacy for women’s rights in front of skeptical male judges.

Bader also speaks candidly about her marriage to her late husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, who died in 2010. And adding to her impressive feats, there are a few delightful shots of Ginsburg’s notoriously challenging workout routine ― planks and all.Broadway and television star Sara Ramirez broke barriers when she played the openly bisexual doctor Callie Torres on “Grey’s Anatomy.” Owning her personal truth as a queer and bisexual woman off-screen, however, was a different matter.

“I was concerned it would affect my career in a negative way. I was afraid of the discrimination I might face not just outside of Hollywood, but within,” Ramirez says in an interview for “Coming Out Stories,” a new video series produced by People and Entertainment Weekly.

Witnessing incidents of anti-LGBTQ violence around the world, including the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, made Ramirez feel “an organic, incremental urgency to use my platform to empower those who are a part of these communities that I’m a part of,” and she came out at the 2016 True Colors Fund’s 40 to None Summit.

Before the “Madam Secretary” actress made her speech, however, she decided to open up about her sexuality with friends during a movie night.

Their response, however, was not nearly as dramatic as she’d anticipated.

“Everyone was very supportive, very happy for me,” she recalled. “The reaction went something like, ‘Huh? Cool. Can we get back to the movie now?’”

These days, Ramirez feels very “lucky and privileged” to have the support of her friends, family and her chosen family. She had a few words, however, for what she’d tell her younger, less-confident self.Amariyanna Copeny

When she was 8 years old, Amariyanna aka "Mari" Copeny of Flint, Michigan, wrote a powerful letter to President Barack Obama asking him to meet with her and others from the city during their visit to D.C. for the congressional hearings on the water crisis. Obama responded by saying he would be going straight to Flint to learn more about the public health crisis and see what could be done. Over the past years, "Little Miss Flint" has become a well-known activist working to better her community . “Letters from kids like you are what make me so optimistic for the future,” Obama wrote in their correspondence.To celebrate International Women’s Day this Women’s History Month, HuffPost rounded up 55 photos of girls going to school around the globe.

The photos feature girls of all ages from Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan, France and more getting an education. Whether they’re walking to school with friends or excited about learning something new in class, these photos are proof that all children should have the right to get an education, no matter their gender.Youtube/Tammy Penhall

There are two things you need to know about Australians, from an Australian. One, we’re an enterprising and ingenious people, and two, we love a drink.

One Aussie man has perfectly exemplified those characteristics by wading through an impressive collection of beer cans in a backyard shed, prompting some social media fans to nickname him “the Australian Scrooge McDuck.”

In a series of videos posted on Youtube, a woman identified as Tammy Penhall narrates the scene as she pans around the room in all its glory.

At one point, she films an unidentified older gentleman, dressed in a cap and tank top with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, who wades around among the cans.

“Some guys actually commented this would actually be their dream ball pit. Well, this is your dream beer pit, guys,” Penhall joked, adding, “The VB shed at its finest.”

The beer pit is located in the Moonta region of the state of South Australia, securely stored behind a rusted “Danger, out of bounds” sign at the base of a corrugated iron shed.

Penhall said the room contained “tens of thousands” of cans of Victoria Bitter, one of the most popular Australian beer brands (contrary to popular belief, Australians do not really drink Foster’s).

A second clip shows another glimpse of the beer pit as someone tips in a few more empties.

HuffPost was not immediately able to reach Penhall for more details about the VB beer pit.

As the videos rocketed around social media and news websites in Australia, more than a few people remarked on the beer pit’s resemblance to Scrooge McDuck’s pile of money.

AdvertisementBritain has stepped up its investigation into the possible poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, with the U.K. government facing the possibility of yet another Russian dissident being assassinated on British soil.

On Sunday, 66-year-old Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in the Russian military intelligence, was found unconscious on a bench at a mall in Salisbury, along with his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia. As of Tuesday, the two were still in critical condition, being treated “for suspected exposure to an unknown substance.”

Skripal was sentenced to prison by Russia in 2006 for spying for Britain. In 2010 he was given refuge in the U.K. as part of a “spy swap” with the United States.

Britain’s counterterrorism unit took over the investigation Tuesday from local law enforcement because of its “unusual circumstances.” Samples from the scene were being tested at a military research laboratory, The Guardian reported. The police had not declared it a terrorist incident, and law enforcement officials were still investigating whether a crime occurred.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday that, although it was “too early to speculate” about what happened to Skripal and his daughter, Britain would “respond appropriately and robustly” if the Russian government were found to be responsible, the Press Association reported. The Kremlin has denied having any information about the incident.

Boris Johnson warns Russia it will be 'punished' if found responsible for Sergei and Yulia Skripal incident https://t.co/JhLNko6wCE — HuffPost UK (@HuffPostUK) March 6, 2018

If the incident is found to be a poisoning attempt by the Russians, it would join a long history of suspected assassinations of Russian dissidents abroad, and specifically in the U.K.

The incident has recalled the high-profile assassination in 2006 of another Russian spy, former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned in London. A 2016 inquiry by the British government found Russian agency FSB (which succeeded the KGB) had Litvinenko killed in an operation “probably approved” by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied involvement.GENEVA/YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday he strongly suspected that “acts of genocide” may have taken place against Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state since August.

His comments come as Myanmar’s military published a lengthy response to widespread allegations over its campaign in Rakhine and said its investigations had cleared troops of almost all alleged abuses.

Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council that reports of bulldozing of alleged mass graves showed a “deliberate attempt by the authorities to destroy evidence of potential international crimes, including possible crimes against humanity.”

The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria.

Zeid said last December that Myanmar’s security forces may be guilty of committing genocide.

“This Council is aware that my office has strong suspicions that acts of genocide may have taken place in Rakhine State since August,” he said, noting that his office said on Tuesday that it believes ethnic cleansing is still underway in Rakhine.

Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown in August, joining 200,000 refugees from a previous exodus.

Rohingya are still fleeing because of “systematic” if lower-intensity persecution and violence there, Zeid said.

“Victims have reported killings, rape, torture and abductions by the security forces and local militia, as well as apparently deliberate attempts to force the Rohingya to leave the area through starvation, with officials blocking their access to crops and food supplies,” he said.

The True News Information Team said in a Facebook post containing the army’s position that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) armed group had “threatened, coerced and persuaded other villagers to flee to Bangladesh”.

The post addressed a letter last month from British lawmakers to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson calling for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court – which it said was based on “one-sided accusations” and ignored attacks on civilians by the ARSA - and a European Union decision to prepare sanctions targeted at Myanmar generals.

Zeid said his office had received reports of land inhabited by Rohingya being appropriated and members of other ethnic groups replacing them.

“A recent announcement that seven soldiers and three police officers will be brought to justice for the alleged extra-judicial killing of ten Rohingya men is grossly insufficient,” he added.

Myanmar’s government must take steps to provide real accountability for violations and respect the rights of Rohingya, including to citizenship, Zeid said.

A fact-finding mission set up by the Council, headed by former Indonesian Attorney-General Marzuki Darusman, is due to report on Monday on its initial findings based on interviews with victims and survivors in Bangladesh and other countries.Protesters raise their hands as they're surrounded by police on the sidelines of the Jan. 20, 2017, inauguration in Washington. Adrees Latif / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Sixteen months after police swept up hundreds of people in mass arrests on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, federal prosecutors in the nation’s capital are trying to secure their first guilty verdicts against four defendants who participated in an anti-capitalism march that resulted in property damage in downtown D.C.

Three of the four people they’re trying to convict actually damaged property, prosecutors contend. Each is facing five felony destruction-of-property charges, as well as one felony rioting charge, because the government argues they were part of a broader rioting conspiracy and can be held responsible for the broader damage.

The second J20 trial ― a reference to Jan. 20, 2017 ― comes five months after a D.C. jury acquitted six other Inauguration Day defendants on all charges following a lengthy trial. Prosecutors admitted from the beginning of the first trial that there was no evidence any of those defendants personally damaged any property, but told jurors they should be found guilty because they were part of a rioting conspiracy. Jurors disagreed.

A few weeks later, in January of this year, the Justice Department dropped felony charges against 129 defendants but said it would press forward with 59 other cases. Another 20 individuals have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor charges.

The new trial unfolding in D.C. Superior Court this week involves defendants Michael Basillas, Seth Cadman, Anthony Felice and Casey Webber. All but Webber, the government alleges, actually took part in the destruction.

Using the same language about a “sea of black masks” that she used in the first trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff’s opening statement walked jurors through the property damage that occurred during the protest march and how it affected ordinary people.

She talked about the Starbucks worker who watched other workers dive for cover as glass windows “rained down upon them.” She spoke of the BP gas station employee who stacked cases of water against the door because the employee thought rioters would try to break inside. She talked about the limo driver who watched as his windows were smashed, the sandwich shop owner whose store was damaged, the hotel worker who hurried guests inside to prevent any injuries. She mimed the way protesters tossed newspaper vending boxes into the street and smashed windows. She said the defendants made the choice to participate in the destruction that day.

“This trial is not about protest or disagreement or dissent,” Kerkhoff said, noting that protests can be powerful and beautiful and bring about change. But this wasn’t a protest, she said. “You can’t hide ― like a mask ― behind a protest.”

Present in the courtroom for Wednesday’s opening arguments were Jessie Liu, the Trump-named U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and Chelsea Manning, the WikiLeaks source whose lengthy prison sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama and who is now running for U.S. Senate in Maryland.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington is unique in that it’s an office headed by a presidential nominee that prosecutes crimes that would elsewhere be handled by local prosecutors. In the first trial, defense attorneys said the government’s actions against those who disrupted Inauguration Day were politically motivated. Defense attorneys may try similar tactics this time around and may also try to align their clients’ actions with the broader opposition to Trump.

Rich Gallena, who represents Basillas, said his client took to the streets of Washington to exercise his First Amendment rights and stand up for minorities, immigrants and American workers. Only a small percentage of the group smashed windows, the lawyer said, and the photos that the government says show his client throwing a brick and attacking windows at a Starbucks outlet and a hotel are “grainy” and “blurred.” He pointed out how much time and effort the government had spent on the case.

“They are desperate to pin that damage on someone, anyone,” Gallena said. But the evidence isn’t there, he added.

Cadman’s attorney, Seth Schrager, spoke of his own participation in protests against the Vietnam War and said the extensive amount of video that prosecutors would use in the case wouldn’t prove anything against his client. Kerkhoff said video shows Cadman chucking an object at a Bank of America location.

Matthew Rist, representing Felice, called the trial a case of “guilt by association” and described what he said was excessive force against his client, who is also charged with resisting arrest. Kerkhoff said that Felice lit flares and tried to break a window and that he’d also nearly escaped the police “kettle” maneuver that ensnared the group. Rist said police gave Felice “a good baptism” of pepper spray after he was thrown to the ground and posed no threat to them.

Webber’s attorney, April Downs, started by listing all the things that her client didn’t do. He didn’t hit a window or toss a trash can. He didn’t have any hammers or rocks. The only reason he was on trial, she said, was that he received messages about the planning of the event ahead of time that contained information the government didn’t like.He said the government will implement the rule of law impartially in the overwhelmingly Buddhist nation in which Muslims make up 9 percent of the 21 million population, the smallest minority after ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus.

Government experts in the U.K. have tested and identified the specific nerve agent, according to a police report. However, authorities are not commenting further on whether they know the source of the agent.

Skripal, 66, a former colonel in the Russian military intelligence, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday. They were both still in critical condition as of Wednesday and in intensive care. A police officer who responded at the scene is also in serious condition and is being treated in intensive care.

Skripal was convicted by Russia in 2006 of spying for Britain, and was given refuge in the U.K. in 2010 as part of a high-profile “spy swap.”

Police are still looking into who was behind the attack, which they say specifically targeted the victims.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday that it was “too early to speculate” about what had happened to Skripal and his daughter, but noted that Britain would “respond appropriately and robustly” if the Russian government were found responsible.

The Kremlin has denied having any information about the incident.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on Tuesday revoked a human rights award it had bestowed on Myanmar civil leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 2012, citing the ongoing massacre of Rohingya Muslims under her watch.

The Rohingya, a Muslim minority group from Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state, have long suffered state-sponsored discrimination and what the United Nations has deemed to be crimes against humanity. Roughly 700,000 of them have fled across the border to Bangladesh amidst waves of violence after insurgent attacks sparked a vicious security crackdown last year.

Suu Kyi, who lived for 15 years under house arrest for challenging the military dictatorship then ruling Myanmar, was just the second person the Holocaust museum had honored with its award. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, for whom the award is named, was the first.

Suu Kyi’s opposition to that earlier era of military rule helped foster her image as a human rights advocate. But on the Rohingya crisis, she has been conspicuously quiet.

“We had hoped that you — as someone we and many others have celebrated for your commitment to human dignity and universal human rights — would have done something to condemn and stop the military’s brutal campaign and to express solidarity with the targeted Rohingya population,” the museum wrote in a March 6 letter to the Myanmar leader.

Suu Kyi’s political party “has instead refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, promulgated hateful rhetoric against the Rohingya community, and denied access to and cracked down on journalists trying to uncover the scope of the crimes in Rakhine State,” the letter continued.

Although Myanmar is home to over a million Rohingyas, the Buddhist-majority country doesn’t recognize their rights. Myanmar classifies them as illegal immigrants, not citizens.

In recent years, the violence against the Rohingya carried out by state officials and Buddhist extremists has included rape, arson, shootings, beatings and torture. These acts amount to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, according to international rights organizations. Some human rights groups argue the violence looks increasingly like genocide.“It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants,” Judge Justin Barron said in announcing the convictions of Fransen and Golding. He said their actions “demonstrated hostility” toward Muslims.

The two have been previously convicted of similar charges. In 2016, Fransen was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment for approaching a woman wearing a hijab and telling her that she kept her hair covered so that she wouldn’t get raped.paul mansfield photography via Getty Images

The town of Starkville, Mississippi, will host its first gay pride parade this month after its officials reversed a decision to reject a permit.

The Starkville Board of Alderman on Tuesday voted again whether to approve the event, and tied 3-3. The mayor, Lynn Spruill, then cast the deciding vote in favor of the parade, now scheduled for March 24.

The board came under fire in February after it denied the event’s organizers a permit to hold the town’s first gay pride rally, even after a majority of people spoke out in its favor at the original hearing, and there were no concerns with cost. But the aldermen voted 4-3 to reject it, provoking widespread outrage that put the town of 25,000 in the national spotlight.

The sponsors of the event, a group called Starkville Pride, filed a federal lawsuit after the initial decision, saying officials had discriminated against LGBTQ residents and violated free speech rights.

Tuesday’s vote came after Alderwoman Sandra Sistrunk asked the board to reconsider the permit, calling the hubbub “a bit of a growing pain for the city.”

“I think we’re in a position where we can make a more measured and reasoned vote tonight,” Sistrunk said, according to The Associated Press.

Roberta Kaplan, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Starkville Pride, said that her law firm was “so incredibly proud” to represent the group, and that she couldn’t wait for the parade. A judge has not yet ruled on the lawsuit, and it’s unclear if it will proceed now that the parade has been approved.

We at @KaplanAndCo are so incredibly proud to represent @b_mcdaniel__ & @starkvillepride. We all became lawyers to be able to bring and win cases like this. Can’t wait until Pride Parade on March 24! https://t.co/TROykSXenz — Robbie Kaplan (@kaplanrobbie) March 7, 2018

“What happened at tonight’s meeting was a victory not only for our clients and for their equal dignity under the law, but also for the core principle that in this country, we do not restrict a person’s ability to speak based on whether or not we agree with what they have to say,” Kaplan said in a statement provided to the Starkville Daily News.

The approval also was hailed by the Human Rights Campaign, which said local outrage pushed the city to “do the right thing.”

The group “has been proud to work alongside Starkville Pride and community leaders to make this parade a reality, and we look forward to a successful Pride celebration in a few short weeks,” Rob Hill, the group’s Mississippi director, said in a statement.

The Daily News reported that some had voiced concerns that the parade would feature explicit content ― fears that Sistrunk was quick to dispel.

“They’re going to have a parade, it’s going to be a celebration and I don’t expect anything to fall into lewd or illegal behavior,” Sistrunk said.Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School weren’t pleased with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ visit to the Parkland, Florida, school on Wednesday. They told HuffPost that DeVos met with few students and gave “BS answers” to their questions about what she plans to do to address gun violence.

The brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members there. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.

Student journalists at the school, who said they were among the only students that DeVos met, described feeling “disappointed” by DeVos’ visit and called it “intrusive” and “not helpful.”

“Personally, I didn’t understand what the point was for her to come,” senior Kyra Parrow, editor-in-chief of the school yearbook, told HuffPost. “She didn’t answer my questions properly. It wasn’t informative. It wasn’t helpful at all. She just kind of gave me a BS answer.”

A number of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn’t meet with many students and “barely” responded to their questions.

Do something unexpected: answer our questions. You came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here. How about you actually do your job? #neveragain #DoYourJob https://t.co/4Ts0INq0gR — Aly Sheehy🦅 (@Aly_Sheehy) March 7, 2018

Carly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, The Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that “no one followed her.”

One student from each publication (tv prod./newspaper/yearbook) was able to see her and take pictures of her, no one followed her. We are part of a school publication and it's our job to report on a public figure visiting the school. https://t.co/zE48UAFZky — carly (@car_nove) March 7, 2018

Student Ryan Deitsch told HuffPost that they were not allowed to record DeVos’ visit. However, Parrow said she was not told anything was off-limits in her coverage, but she wished DeVos had met with more students.

“I was lucky enough to be able to follow her around, but no other students were invited,” she said. “My peers have every right to have a voice just as much as I do. I was lucky enough to ask her a question, but you know what? My other peers deserve to ask a question.”

Anna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos’ visit, confirmed the students’ accounts, telling HuffPost that “they didn’t see the purpose of her being there” and that DeVos “was very vague in her answers” to students’ questions about what she plans to do on gun violence.

DeVos ― who has generated fierce opposition from education activists and who, during her Senate confirmation hearing, famously suggested protecting schools from bear attacks ― did not discuss specific gun policy proposals with reporters on Wednesday, deferring to local and state officials.

When asked about proposals to train and arm certain teachers, for which President Donald Trump has expressed approval, DeVos said the idea has been “mischaracterized,” arguing that it should be “a model” but not “mandated or required for every community.”

Asked about students’ reactions to possibly arming teachers, she claimed that “we didn’t have a conversation about that.”

In addition to the limited group of student journalists, DeVos briefly met with students with therapy dogs and was introduced to school officials, teachers and counselors, Fusco said.

“That was literally it,” she said, adding that she wished DeVos “would have asked to hear from the majority and not a few.”

“If anything, her visit was intrusive,” Deitsch said. “She was clearly there for a photo op. This was nothing more.”

He added that DeVos interrupted a group of students in a therapy session, a detail that Fusco and Parrow confirmed.

“I saw their faces, like, ‘What the hell is this?’” Fusco said of the students.

Parrow recalled witnessing it from afar, saying that she “backed away from it because I felt uncomfortable.”

Later the same day, Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade made a surprise visit to the school, meeting with students and staff, and telling them that he was “inspired by all of you.”

Parrow said she appreciated DeVos visiting Stoneman Douglas but wished the education secretary could have offered more than “thoughts and prayers.”

“She has the power to do something,” Parrow said. “She has the power to make change, and she has those connections. I felt almost disrespected that she came to my school and spoke to my face and said nothing that was helpful, like, ‘Why did you come anyway? We don’t need thoughts and prayers — we’re done with that. We need action. That’s what we want from people like you.’”

This story has been updated with more details about DeVos’ visit and students’ reactions.Controversial county clerk Kim Davis gets some eyebrow-raising praise in a video released in conjunction with her new memoir, Under God’s Authority: The Kim Davis Story.

The Liberty Counsel, a “nationwide public interest religious civil liberties law firm” that has represented Davis, is publishing and distributing Under God’s Authority and posted images of the cover to its Facebook and Twitter accounts Feb. 26. The memoir recounts the Kentucky county clerk’s 2015 legal battle after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples following the Supreme Court’s marriage equality ruling that June.

On Monday, the group released a bizarre promotional video for the book on YouTube. The clip, which clocks in at just over seven minutes and can be viewed above, features testimony from Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R), who praises Davis for her “boldness, conviction” and her “knowing that she was right.”

“I think Kim Davis is, without question, an inspiration, not only to leaders like myself ... but to my children, to the children of America,” the Republican, who publicly supported Davis during his gubernatorial campaign in 2015, explains. “People, even if they disagree with her, have got to respect the fact that here is a woman who was willing to put it all on the line out of conviction for what she believed and knew to be her right as an American citizen.”

He continues, “If that’s not admirable ― if that’s not something that we would want all Americans to emulate, I don’t know what is.”

The interview with Bevin is intercut with footage of a teary-eyed Davis.

“When I think about marriage in my life, before I knew Christ, I was a miserable flop at it ― just terrible,” says the clerk, an Apostolic Christian who has been married four times. “But I still knew that it was between one man and one woman.”

The video seems to be timed to Davis’s re-election campaign. The clerk, who changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican in 2015, will seek another term in November.Idaho’s transgender community won a huge legal victory this week after a federal judge in Boise stuck down the state’s policy banning people from changing the assigned gender on their birth certificates.

Idaho now has until April 6 to begin considering applications for people who wish to change their birth certificates to accurately reflect their gender identity.

Federal court hands transgender people a huge win in Idaho birth certificate case https://t.co/R39OKSvdxv — Eliel Cruz (@elielcruz) March 6, 2018

The ruling, issued Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Dale, was in response to a lawsuit that two transgender women filed last year after the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) rejected their applications to change the gender on their birth certificates. Both women said that being identified as a male on their birth certificates has led to discrimination.

One of the woman, identified only by her initials F.V., said that a social security office employee called her a “tranny” after seeing her birth certificate. The other plaintiff, Dani Martin, said she had a similarly distressing experience at a local DMV.

According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, almost one in three transgender individuals who showed an ID with a name or gender that did not match their gender presentation were “verbally harassed, denied benefits or service, asked to leave, or assaulted.”

In her ruling, Dale agreed that such discrepancies “can create risks to the health and safety of transgender people,” who the judge noted already face disproportionately high levels of discrimination. As such, barring transgender individuals from changing their birth certificates to reflect their preferred gender is “unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Dale wrote.

Though applications aren’t guaranteed to be approved, Dale said that “such applications must be reviewed and considered through a constitutionally-sound approval process.”

If an application is approved, the reissued birth certificate cannot have a record of any name changes or amendments to the assigned gender. This is to protect transgender individuals from possible discrimination.

Niki Forbing-Orr, a spokeswoman for IDHW, told the Idaho Statesman on Tuesday that the agency was reviewing the court order and “determining our next steps.”

As the Statesman noted, officials at the department had previously acknowledged that their current rules about birth certificate changes were “unfair” but that they would need a court order to change the policy.

Transgender folks: We see you. You are exactly who you say you are. And with this decision, the state of Idaho affirms that too. 💙💖♡💖💙https://t.co/kD5PCqc4XV pic.twitter.com/hpTx1JbSFv — Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) March 6, 2018

Lambda Legal, the law firm that represented the two plaintiffs in the case, celebrated the legal victory this week.

“The Court understood that the state’s ban against transgender people correcting their birth certificates was archaic, unjust, and discriminatory,” Peter Renn, a senior attorney at the firm, said in a statement. “It only makes sense. Essential identity documents should accurately reflect who you are, and the court recognized that the government cannot rob transgender people of this basic tool to navigate through life.”

“With this change, transgender Idahoans will no longer be forced to represent that they are someone they are not and jeopardize their privacy and safety,” Renn added.

F.V., one of the plaintiffs, said she was “thrilled” by the court decision.

“I am thrilled and proud that my own state will be updating their policies, even though it required a court order to do so,” she said. “I’m excited to be among the first to update their birth certificates.”

Idaho had been one of only four remaining states where transgender individuals are prohibited from changing the assigned gender in their birth certificates. Kansas, Ohio, and Tennessee are the other three.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, became, all but officially, the lead proponent of single-payer health care in the House on Wednesday.

Ellison’s House colleagues gave their unanimous consent for him to replace Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) as chief sponsor of H.R. 676, the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act. (Conyers is retiring at the end of his term under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations.)

The move makes Ellison the most prominent House spokesman for once-marginal legislation that has become a rallying point for progressives across the country. The bill, which Conyers introduced for decades with little support, now enjoys the backing of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus. A companion bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has the backing of more than one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus, including virtually every rumored 2020 presidential candidate.

Ellison, a longtime backer of H.R. 676, attributed the uptick in congressional support to lawmakers hearing from constituents desperate for a more effective health care system.

“My motivation is just being in meetings, talking to people about their health care nightmare, and studying the array of options and coming up with this one as being the best one,” Ellison told HuffPost.

Ellison brings the imprimatur of a Democratic Party leader to legislation that has only recently edged its way into the mainstream. But he emphasized that he is pushing the bill in his capacity as a member of Congress. The DNC, he said, has not endorsed the idea of a single-payer health care system in which the federal government would be the sole insurer.

Ellison also said that his advocacy of “Medicare for all,” as single-payer proponents describe it, does not contradict his support for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. When Sanders debuted his version of the bill in September, some centrist Democrats critical of single-payer argued that the push jeopardized efforts to protect the ACA.

“I am grateful to the Affordable Care Act. It has gotten us this far. It has improved the lives of millions of people,” Ellison said. “This is an advance of the progress that we’ve made, not a replacement of the progress that we’ve made.”

However, the shortcomings of the ACA ― which brought insurance to 20 million more Americans but still left 28 million people uninsured ― have helped fuel progressives’ enthusiasm for Medicare for all.

Single-payer advocates argue that the flaws in the ACA were the result of trying to accommodate the private insurance industry rather than build on the success of Medicare and Medicaid. As evidence, these activists and policy experts point to the relative success and political durability of the law’s Medicaid expansion, compared to the more troubled individual insurance marketplaces.

Public support for single-payer has steadily crept up over the years. Fifty-seven percent of Americans now back Medicare for all, according to a July 2017 poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

But implementing Medicare for all would require moving tens of millions of Americans from their employer-provided coverage to a vastly expanded Medicare program. It is unclear how public support for the idea would fare under that kind of pressure.

Ensuring a smooth transition is one of many concerns that single-payer advocates must address, according to Ellison. Another is the resulting job losses in the insurance industry.

But he said, “I urge people not to get stuck on the details ― because you lose the forest for the trees in this debate all the time. You end up in a situation where because you can’t have everything, you can’t have anything.”

In the meantime, Ellison plans to be busy recruiting new members of Congress to support H.R. 676 and promoting its merits to the public.

Asked whether that included efforts to bring Republican colleagues along, Ellison replied, “We always hope.Tom Williams via Getty Images

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.), the lawmaker who came under fire recently for her dubious claim that Democrats are more prone to be mass shooters, says the federal government has better things to spend money on than research about gun violence.

“We have so many outside groups and independent groups that do that already. You know, should we be spending taxpayer money on something like that? I’m not sure that’s the best use of taxpayer money,” Tenney said in a local radio interview on Wednesday.

Having access to more information about an issue like gun violence might allow members of Congress to be able to make more accurate statements to the public regarding shootings. Collecting such data is difficult in the United States, however, thanks to a 1996 law that restricts federal funding for research on gun violence. The so-called Dickey Amendment, named after former Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.), effectively ended federal research on gun violence by barring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from spending funds on gun control advocacy.

Democrats and gun control advocates are again trying to lift the prohibition after last month’s shooting in Parkland, Florida, where a teen gunman opened fire at a high school, killing 17 people and wounding dozens of others.

“Two weeks since Congresswoman Tenney’s appalling conspiracy theory sparked a national outrage, she still refuses to face facts and apologize to the people who are counting on her for leadership,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for Democratic super-PAC American Bridge, which flagged the comments. “Now she says she doesn’t believe researching the effects of gun violence in America should even be a priority. Every day Tenney disqualifies herself from serving in any elected office at all, let alone representing New Yorkers in Congress.”

Tenney said Wednesday that she would rather see the government fund programs that would help needy communities, like social service organizations and food banks, than research about gun violence.

“There are ways we can spend our money other than doing studies that are, look like they may be, and I could be wrong, they may be duplicitous [sic],” Tenney said in the interview.

The first-term congresswoman appeared to have less concern for government spending in supporting two recent bills that are projected to add boatloads to the debt. In December, she voted for the GOP’s $1.5 trillion tax overhaul bill. And in February, she voted for a massive bipartisan budget deal that reopened the government while increasing spending by hundreds of billions of dollars. The ultimate cost of the deal could increase to about $2 trillion by 2027, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Tenney walked away from a testy television interview on Monday after she was asked about her controversial remarks that people who commit mass shootings are often Democrats.

“It is fake news!” Tenney told a reporter who asked about her claim. “I answered your question every which way, it is fake news.”Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― The most conservative Republicans in Congress say they won’t vote for food stamp cuts they support unless party leadership gives them what they want on immigration, potentially holding up the farm bill this week.

“We don’t have an agreement,” House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Thursday after coming out of a meeting with his conservative group.

Since Democrats seem almost unanimously against the farm bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) needs most Republicans to support it. And with roughly a dozen moderates already stating their opposition to the farm bill, the opposition of another dozen to two-dozen conservatives in the Freedom Caucus would almost certainly sink the farm bill.

With such significant opposition, House GOP leaders may decide to postpone a vote and send members home for the week, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday the House would move forward with a Friday vote.

Meadows wants Ryan’s assurance of a vote on an immigration bill by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) that would strictly limit legal immigration and ramp up deportations. The Freedom Caucus is also now working with moderates on a sort of compromise bill that would stick to President Donald Trump’s “four pillars” on an immigration bill: a wall, scaling back family migration, ending the visa lottery program and a fix for immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

“We think it’s important we have a vote on Goodlatte and at this point, we were not able to convince any of our members to go from ‘no’ to ‘yes’ on the farm bill,” Meadows said.

Moderate Republicans and Democrats are trying to force a vote on a separate immigration bill through a parliamentary maneuver known as a “discharge petition,” which can bring legislation to the floor of the House against the wishes of party leaders. Moderates want protected legal status for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.

Meadows said he believed Republicans could quickly reach a consensus on immigration that may even attract Democrats, but he and other conservatives in the Freedom Caucus want to use their leverage on the farm bill to make sure leaders work toward an immigration agreement before a discharge petition addressing DACA ripens by the end of June.

With farm subsidy programs expiring at the end of September, the Freedom Caucus believes the farm bill is the only must-pass piece of legislation they can use to extract concessions on immigration, which they believe is a related issue to the farm bill anyway. (Most of the spending in the farm bill goes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, which serves 40 million Americans. Those benefits would not stop being issued even if authorization expires, though some farm programs would be affected.)

Meadows declined to name a specific number of Freedom Caucus members who remain opposed to the bill, but another Freedom Caucus member told HuffPost they had at least 18 members willing to hold up the farm bill.

Republicans had planned to vote on the farm bill Friday, but if it clearly lacks support that vote could be in doubt. Meadows said he’s not in a hurry.

“We don’t have an impending deadline for the farm bill,” he said. “It doesn’t expire until September.”

Whatever the House passes would have to be merged with a separate farm bill from the Senate, which has not yet been released.

Former Agriculture Committee chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who saw his own farm bill hijacked on the House floor in 2013, said he thought linking the bill to immigration wouldn’t be a good way to pass the legislation.Sam Smith fulfilled a lifelong dream Monday, performing before none other than the original Mary Poppins herself, Dame Julie Andrews.

Smith joined a bevy of stars, including Keith Urban and the Who’s Roger Daltrey, in honoring Andrews at the Raise Your Voice Gala in New York.

He gushed about the experience on Twitter and Instagram a day later, joking that he used to dress up as Andrews’ iconic character Mary Poppins when he was 3 years old.

“Gay from birth,” he quipped.

Words cannot describe last night. Such an honour to sing in support of The Voice Health Institute. Steven Zeitels & his incredible team saved my voice. Forever grateful & so passionate about the work you do. I'll also never ever forget the night I met Dame @JulieAndrews... pic.twitter.com/EAYhjJc43W — Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) March 6, 2018

When I was three years old I used to dress up as Mary Poppins and my dad would fly me around the house (gay from birth) - Last night was a dream come true ❤ — Sam Smith (@samsmithworld) March 6, 2018

The idea of Andrews, Smith, Daltrey and Urban sharing a stage may seem surprising. The four stars, however, have one thing in common: All have sought treatment from Dr. Steven Zeitels of the Voice Health Institute at some point in their careers, as did many of the other celebrities and notables in attendance.

Andrews, who was the evening’s honoree, first sought the Boston-based Zeitels’ care in 2000, shortly after undergoing a botched vocal cord surgery that damaged her singing voice.

True to form, the “Sound of Music” icon was gracious as ever while praising the Voice Health Institute’s staff as “superstars and heroes” and speaking out about the “unbelievable” importance of vocal health during Monday’s gala.

“I started singing at about age 7 and I had one of those four-octave ranges. I could hit high notes and dogs would howl for miles around,” she told the crowd. “I used to think, foolishly, that one is supposed to just forge on. I was a little ashamed to have to go to a throat specialist. ... I hope that all the young performers today will do just that. It’s essential.”TONIGHT: “It’s fine, I’m fine” says a White House that is definitely NOT in chaos after top economic advisor Gary Cohn resigned. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/2YOoxJf3oq — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) March 7, 2018

The news of Gary Cohn’s resignation as President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser came as Stephen Colbert taped Tuesday night’s “Late Show” episode.

“Damn!” exclaimed Colbert. “I had Jared (Kushner) in my Trump resignation fantasy league.”

So why did Cohn quit? Colbert has some theories.KANSAS CITY, Kan. ― Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) said on Tuesday that a White House proposal for identifying U.S. voter fraud wouldn’t actually be a reliable way to identify noncitizens on the rolls.

From May 2017 until January, Kobach led the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a probe convened by the White House to investigate voter fraud. The commission asked election officials in all 50 states to provide it with voter roll data, and White House officials said they wanted to compare that information against federal databases to identify noncitizens and duplicate voters. One of those databases was a Department of Homeland Security directory of noncitizens. Officials communicated with DHS while the panel was operational, and when the probe was disbanded in January, Kobach said DHS could run voter information against federal databases of noncitizens to try and identify noncitizens getting on the voter rolls.

But on Tuesday, during his opening statement in a federal lawsuit challenging a restrictive voting law, Kobach said the federal databases could not adequately identify noncitizens on the voting rolls. He said that a DHS database called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements was intended to assess eligibility for government benefits ― not to verify citizenship.

To use the system effectively, Kobach said, Kansas would have to provide DHS with an alien registration number ― a number assigned to many immigrants for government purposes ― for every voter it wanted to check. But an election official would not ask someone for their alien registration number if they were registering that person to vote, and many immigrants are not assigned such a number in the first place. Experts had warned this would be an unreliable way to assess voter fraud.

Kobach made the comments as part of his argument that nothing short of Kansas’ controversial proof-of-citizenship law can prevent noncitizens from registering to vote. A federal judge stepped in to block the law in 2016, a decision that affected 18,000 people who tried to register to vote when they went to the Department of Motor Vehicles. The decision was upheld by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said Kobach had to show there was substantial evidence of noncitizens getting on the rolls in Kansas and that a proof-of-citizenship law was the only way to stop it.

Kobach has identified 129 noncitizens who attempted to register or voted in elections since 2000. He claims there’s evidence that as many as 18,000 noncitizens could be on the rolls. There are more than 1.8 million registered voters in Kansas.

BEFORE YOU GOFlorida students, including many survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, march to the state Capitol on Feb. 21. Mickey Adair via Getty Images

Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have earned admiration from people across the country as they’ve stepped up to advocate for gun policy reform in the wake of the deadly mass shooting at their school ― but at least one Florida lawmaker isn’t inspired by their passionate pleas for change.

State Rep. Elizabeth Porter (R) on Tuesday criticized her colleagues who support the young activists.

“We’ve been told that we need to listen to the children and do what the children ask,” she said during a state House debate. “Are there any children on this floor? Are there any children making laws?”

“Do we allow the children to tell us that we should pass a law that says ’no homework’? Or you finish high school at the age of 12 just because they want it so? No,” she added. “The adults make the laws because we have the age, we has [sic] the wisdom, and we have the experience.”

Meanwhile, college students participated in a “die-in” anti-gun protest at the state’s Capitol Rotunda. Some held signs that said, “No armed teachers.”

The Florida state Senate passed a bill on Monday that would allow school staff, excluding most teachers, to carry firearms. It would also establish a mental health program for schools, raise the legal age for firearm purchases to 21 and introduce a three-day waiting period for such sales.

The Florida state House spent around five hours Tuesday on its version of the bill, debating three dozen amendments that would introduce more restrictions, including one to eliminate the concealed carry program for school employees. All of the proposals were defeated.

A vote is expected to take place this week, but Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has still not said whether he would sign the bill passed by the Senate. Scott has previously spoken out against the idea of permitting teachers to carry guns in schools.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks at The National Museum of American History.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Wednesday honored Women’s History Month by donating to the Smithsonian Institution the gavel she received upon becoming the first woman to serve as the chamber’s speaker in 2007.

“As a young girl, I was drawn to the Smithsonian as a source of creativity, discovery and innovation,” Pelosi, a native of Baltimore, said in a tweet. “Little did I know that I would be returning here to share moments from my time as Speaker of the House of Representatives.”

In addition the gavel, Pelosi gave the Smithsonian the dress suit she wore during her swearing-in ceremony, the vote tally of the speaker’s election, her copy of the first speech she gave in the job, and a copy of the Congressional Record from that day.

“This is a wonderful donation for Women’s History Month, one that will be both part of the National Museum of American History’s longstanding effort to document the history of women in America and the first in our expanded curatorial effort to document women in American politics,” Lisa Kathleen Graddy, a curator of political history at the museum, said in a statement.

Pelosi, 77, served four years as speaker, relinquishing the post after Republicans captured the House majority in the 2010 elections. She remains the only woman to have held the job.

At her swearing-in as speaker, Pelosi celebrated the occasion as a win for women’s rights.

“For our daughters and our granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling,” she said at the time. “For our daughters and our granddaughters, now the sky is the limit. Anything is possible for them.”

Pelosi echoed those sentiments in at The National Museum of American History on Wednesday, flanked by both the objects she was donating and an array of other artifacts celebrating female trailblazers.

“We need the voices of all women,” she said in her remarks. “We need their courage and their strength because when women succeed, America succeeds.”

Pelosi initially won her San Francisco-based House seat in a 1987 special election, and her career has been full of firsts. In 2001, she became the first woman elected to be House minority whip. A year later, she was elected the House minority leader and thus became the highest-ranking woman in congressional history. As speaker, Pelosi was second in the presidential line of succession, making her the highest-ranking woman politician in U.S. history.

More than 1 million Democrats in Texas turned out to vote Tuesday, the strongest turnout for the state party in a midterm primary since 2002.

The results of this year’s first primaries, while falling short of the blue tsunami some in the party had anticipated, track that pattern, reflecting a Democratic base galvanized into above-average turnout by their discontent with the Trump administration.

Democrats “are mobilizing in a powerful way,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) warned in a television interview after the polls in his state closed Tuesday. “At the end of the day, the good news is that there are a lot more conservatives in Texas than there are liberals.”

There’s reason to pay some attention to turnout trends as the midterm season continues. ”[P]rimary performance can be cautiously interpreted as a harbinger of the general election,” The New York Times’ Nate Cohn wrote Tuesday, after reviewing national vote history data since 2004.

Primaries, along with special elections, offer the first tangible outcomes of the election cycle. But the results are an imperfect lens through which to view the parties’ general election prospects. Turnout in primary elections may reflect enthusiasm, but it also hinges on external factors like the competitiveness of the races in each party. Other gauges, such as polls testing voters’ congressional preferences, hold more well-tested predictive power.

And, of course, there’s still plenty of time for things to shift between now and November.

“Every two years the Democrats find some sort of factoid to fixate on and convince themselves that this is the year where they make Texas competitive ― and every two years it falls flat,” Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster whose clients have included Cruz, told Reuters prior to the election, dismissing Democrats’ enthusiasm about their early voting numbers.

In Texas, the increased turnout among Democrats comes from “a pretty bare bones baseline,” said Jim Henson, the director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas and co-director of the University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll.

“I don’t know that that has so much to do with Texas being the leading edge of a national surge as it does with conditions being such that the Democrats are getting up off the mat a little bit,” Henson said. “I think what we’re looking at is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a Democratic revival in Texas.”

Beyond Texas, rising turnout is likely to encourage Democrats in other states, where more special elections and primaries are coming up.Gracepoint central receiving center in Tampa, Florida, is a secure facility where police can take people in crisis because of a mental health condition or drugs and alcohol. In many parts of the country, first responders have few options when it comes to finding follow-up care for people who have been rescued from a drug overdose.

By Christine Vestal

TAMPA, Fla. — In an opioid epidemic that is killing more than a hundred Americans every day, many families of overdose victims feel helpless when it comes to convincing their loved ones to seek treatment.

Police and other first responders — who often rescue the same people again and again — are similarly frustrated about their lack of authority to detain users long enough for their heads to clear so they can consider treatment.

But here in Tampa, police, health care professionals and families have a powerful legal tool not available in many other places: the 1993 Marchman Act. Families and health care professionals can use the state law to “marchman,” or involuntarily commit people into substance abuse treatment when they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

Although the statute applies to all jurisdictions in the state, court records show that it has been employed in Tampa and surrounding Hillsborough County far more than anywhere else. Hillsborough County accounts for less than 7 percent of the state’s population and more than 40 percent of its Marchman commitments.

Police use the Marchman Act to pick up people without a court order and take them to a designated stabilization and assessment center. Addiction professionals use the law when a patient fails to show up for treatment. And parents and friends use it when they fear a loved one’s life is at risk.

Across the country, state lawmakers are grappling with how to give first responders and medical professionals the same kind of legal leeway — without violating drug users’ civil liberties.

“It’s been one of the most hotly debated opioid issues of the past year,” said Sherry Green, a consultant and former legal analyst with the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws.

Tampa’s success with the Marchman Act could be a model.

Treatment Coercion

More than 400 people in Tampa and surrounding Hillsborough County were involuntarily committed into addiction assessment and treatment last year, according to circuit court records. More than two-thirds completed their court-ordered programs.

That’s a success rate that substantially exceeds the 50 percent threshold most researchers use in determining whether an addiction treatment is effective, said David Gastfriend, senior research scientist at the Public Health Management Corporation in Philadelphia.

Nearly 12 million Americans have an addiction to opioid painkillers and heroin, according to the most recent survey from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Only 1 in 5 are receiving treatment.

A shortage of treatment capacity is part of the problem, addiction experts say, but denial and refusal to seek treatment is the primary reason. The vast majority of Americans with a drug addiction do not receive treatment because they say they do not need it.

Research also shows that people who are coerced into treatment either through criminal courts or employer or family intervention are just as successful at beating their addictions as those who voluntarily enter treatment.

That’s why governors and lawmakers want to find legal methods to push people into treatment in the vulnerable moments after they’ve been rescued from an overdose and are in contact with police and medical professionals who can help.

At least 33 states have laws that technically allow loved ones and others to involuntarily commit people who put their lives at risk by using drugs, according to the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws. But since they can only be implemented with a judge’s approval, typically during business hours, commitment laws have been largely ineffective at preventing people who are rescued from an overdose from walking away, using drugs again and overdosing.

Florida has the oldest law authorizing emergency detention for drug and alcohol users without court involvement. Colorado and Minnesota have similar emergency commitment statutes, and a handful of other states have emergency provisions on the books that are seldom used, according to Green.

Detention Orders

“There’s a great deal of frustration among first responders who revive or resuscitate individuals and then watch them get up and walk away,” said Kentucky state Rep. Kimberly Moser, a Republican.

Under a bill Moser proposed last month along with four other Republican House members, first responders would have the authority to sign a 72-hour noncriminal “detention order,” requiring an overdose victim to be transported to a hospital or treatment facility to be held until an addiction assessment is completed and a treatment plan developed.

Moser’s bill would complement, but not amend, an existing civil commitment law in Kentucky. Casey’s Law has been used successfully by hundreds of families for more than a decade to coerce loved ones with dangerous drug addictions into treatment. That law requires a court proceeding, which can take days or weeks.

In Massachusetts, a similar emergency commitment bill, which Republican Gov. Charlie Baker first proposed in 2015, would allow medical professionals and first responders to detain patients who have been revived from a drug overdose and transport them to a specialized addiction facility for emergency assessment and treatment.

Baker’s proposal would amend the state’s existing court-involved civil commitment law (known as Section 35), and give designated receiving facilities up to 72 hours to engage patients in treatment.

Opposed by major medical groups as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Massachusetts bill is part of the governor’s comprehensive plan to stem the state’s raging opioid epidemic.

Last year, Indiana enacted a law calling for limited use of emergency commitment in three counties for people who are revived from a drug overdose. The program, still in the development phase, requires counties to keep records on how many patients are committed, what type of treatment they receive, and how many are completing treatment.

Critics in Indiana, Kentucky and Massachusetts argue that a shortage of treatment slots would make it difficult to find a facility capable of emergency care.

“One of the frustrations is that people who voluntarily seek treatment often can’t access care when they need it,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, who heads addiction services at Massachusetts General Hospital. “I wouldn’t suggest that involuntary treatment is the way to go.”

Nowhere to Go

Florida has long had a disproportionate share of the nation’s rehabilitation centers and residential addiction treatment facilities, but as the opioid epidemic worsens, the state’s treatment capacity has been stretched thin.

Still, the state has designated a handful of treatment facilities to accept Marchman Act patients in Hillsborough County. Professionals at those places say they rarely have to turn away a patient because of a lack of capacity.

“We may not be able to give them the level of service they need, particularly if they need a bed,” said Mary Lynn Ulrey, CEO of DACCO, a community-based treatment service provider here in Tampa. “But we immediately engage them in an appropriate level of service and move them into a more intensive level of service within a few days.”

Tampa is one of only four places in Florida with a locked central receiving facility where police can take adults and children with mental illness and addiction and have them evaluated for treatment.

Elsewhere in Florida and in much of the country, hospital emergency departments, crisis centers and addiction treatment centers serve as the first stop for police who rescue opioid users from an overdose. Many of those places are unlocked and ill-equipped to perform an emergency addiction assessment on an unwilling drug user.

In Kentucky, Moser said the state plans to use federal and state grants to create secure triage centers in rural areas where there are no hospitals or addiction treatment centers within 50 miles.

And in Massachusetts, at legislative hearings on Baker’s emergency commitment proposal, physician groups and hospitals argued that in many parts of the state there would not be enough room at local hospitals and treatment facilities.

Why Tampa?

Here in Tampa there’s little mystery why the Marchman Act is more widely used than anywhere else in Florida. A circuit judge here, infamous among some drug users who weren’t quite ready to quit, has dedicated his career to helping people with addictions find treatment and turn their lives around, whether they want to or not.

When he’s not hearing Marchman cases, Judge Jack Espinosa Jr. is presiding over drug courts, family courts and juvenile cases. And he does everything in his power, addiction professionals say, to ensure that people who are ordered into treatment stay there.

Marchman Act orders are civil proceedings. Police don’t arrest the people they pick up under the law’s emergency powers. Instead, they bring them to health care professionals who stabilize and assess them to determine the nature and severity of their addiction.

Once a health care professional has recommended a treatment plan — which can range from six months of outpatient counseling with medication to three days of detox and 30 days of residential treatment at an average cost of $5,500 to $7,000 — Espinosa is then asked to order the person to complete it.

If a patient doesn’t show up for treatment on any given day, a sheriff’s deputy is sent to pick the person up. “I use the common law powers of contempt of court to enforce the order,” Espinosa explained.
