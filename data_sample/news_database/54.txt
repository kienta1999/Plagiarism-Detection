April 19 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday said the U.S. Justice Department cannot deny public safety grants to so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court injunction in a case brought by the city of Chicago.

The appeals court agreed the injunction should apply nationally while the lawsuit proceeds in federal court.

The case is one of a number of battles between Republican President Donald Trump’s administration and Democratic state and local leaders over immigration, health care, the environment and other issues.

Chicago sued last year after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would cut offcities from certain Justice Department grants unless they allowed federal immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and provided 48 hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations.

The lawsuit contended that Sessions exceeded his authority by imposing new conditions beyond those Congress prescribed when it established the grant program.

In its ruling on Thursday, a three-judge Seventh Circuit panel said its role was not to decide national immigration policy, but rather to protect the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government.

“The Attorney General in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement,” the court wrote. “But the power of the purse rests with Congress”

Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said the agency believes it exercised authority given by Congress to promote cooperation with immigration authorities.

“We will continue to fight to carry out the Department’s commitment to the rule of law, protecting public safety, and keeping criminal aliens off the streets to further perpetrate crimes,” O’Malley said.

President Donald Trump made tougher immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign and presidency, along with a pledge to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border.

All three judges on the Seventh Circuit panel were nominated by Republican presidents.

Police agencies in so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, like Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, have generally barred their officers from routinely checking individuals’ immigration status, and from keeping anyone locked up longer than otherwise warranted at the request of immigration agents.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Thursday that the city would stand its ground when it comes to immigrants.

“We’re not going to allow the Trump Justice Department to bully our values,” he said.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) was found in contempt of court on Wednesday for not following a court order to fully inform thousands of Kansans that they were eligible to vote.

U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, rebuked Kobach ― who is running for Kansas governor and was in charge of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission ― in her finding and demanded he pay attorneys fees associated with the motion to hold him in contempt. The finding also underscores how Kobach wrought confusion in the state and neglected to make sure that thousands of eligible voters knew they were allowed to cast a ballot.

This confusion affected people like Tad Stricker, who wanted to make sure his Kansas voter registration was valid ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He had registered in the state two years earlier but was humiliated when he went to vote in the 2014 elections and was told he needed to cast a provisional ballot because he wasn’t on the voter rolls. Kansas law in 2014 required people to bring proof of citizenship when they registered to vote, and state officials said Stricker failed to do so when he registered at the Department of Motor Vehicles that year.

Robinson blocked that law in 2016. She ordered Kobach to make sure that the approximately 18,000 people whose registration status was uncertain were fully registered and allowed to vote. Robinson also told Kobach that affected voters should be sent postcards confirming their eligibility to vote and telling them their polling places.

But Kobach also didn’t update the state’s election manual to reflect that people didn’t have to prove their citizenship to register to vote, leaving state election officials without clear guidance to inform confused constituents.

Stricker says he called his local election office in Sedgwick County before the 2016 election and asked to confirm that he was fully registered, but that the person on the other end of the phone told him his status was unclear. Stricker says he was told there were a lot of legal issues up in the air.

Stricker and his fellow plaintiffs, who are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, say the Kansas law that was put on hold in 2016 violates the National Voter Registration Act. The law says state motor vehicle agencies must offer people a chance to register to vote and can only ask them for the minimum amount of information necessary to do so.

At a trial held about the issue in March, Kobach argued the law was necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting. He presented 129 cases of noncitizens trying to vote since 2000 but has said there could be thousands of them on the rolls. Several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem.

Plaintiffs argued that Kobach could have assuaged confusion after the 2016 order by updating the state elections manual to reflect that people did not need to prove their citizenship when they went to register at the DMV. Instead, he took down the document altogether, saying that Robinson’s order did not amount to final law and that the manual was continuously informally updated. Bryan Caskey, the state’s election director and a Kobach staffer, also testified that he was “too busy” to update the document.

Robinson fired back at that rationale, noting that Kobach had amended the document in 2012 to reflect the proof of citizenship law.

“This publication is the policy and training Bible for the 105 county election officials,” she wrote. “Given that the Court’s preliminary injunction was issued almost two years ago in May 2016, four years after the last revision, the Court does not find credible Defendant’s rationale for not amending the document.”

Local Kansas election officials are responsible for sending out the postcards to registered voters, and different counties have different practices for how they send them out. But Kobach is responsible for making sure that all the officials are complying with the law.

Kansans rely on these postcards to confirm they’re registered to vote and to tell them where they’re registered.

“The postcard is considered by traditional in Kansas to be the way you know you’re fully registered to vote,” Margaret Ahrens, the former president of the Kansas League of Women Voters, testified during the trial. “It’s because it’s traditional. ... That is the way we think about being fully registered in Kansas. The postcard is significant.”

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) failed to ensure that voters affected by a 2016 court ruling received postcards like this one confirming their eligibility to vote. The former head of the Kansas League of Women Voters testified that the postcard "is the way we think about being fully registered in Kansas." ACLU

Kansas had previously sent letters to anyone who failed to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, informing them that their registration was incomplete. But after the order, Kobach was required to send affected voters a new notice to let them know they could disregard any previous notices telling them they weren’t fully registered and that they could look up their polling place online.

This meant that thousands of voters who thought they had registered in the state received two official letters telling them completely contradictory information. The postcards could have helped get rid of confusion by telling Kansans once again that they were registered to vote.

Kobach and his lawyers initially said in court documents that they were only obligated to send affected voters the court notice, not the postcards. But when Robinson reminded Kobach in court last month that he had previously assured her in court that he would send the postcards, Kobach changed course, saying his office had orally instructed county officials to send the postcards and could not force them to do so.

Robinson said she did not find it credible that Kobach’s office had orally instructed officials to send out the postcards. Kobach’s office said after the trial that it had given written orders to the county officials to send the postcards, but Robinson said on Wednesday that was “too little, too late.”

Robinson appeared to be similarly unimpressed by Kobach’s claim that the court’s order on postcards was unclear.

“The term ‘register’ is not ambiguous, nor should there have been any question that these voters were to be treated just like any other registered voter prior to the 2016 election,” she wrote.The tale of a teen outcast turned murderous prom queen: With all that’s gone down on the second season of “Riverdale” — a hunt for a hooded serial killer, the football team moonlighting as a local militia, Archie and the gang getting high on a drug called jingle-jangle — that hardly ranks as a compelling B-plot on any given episode.

Singing and dancing about the horrors of high school, however, make for a very special installment of the hit CW series.

Wednesday’s episode, the series’ first official foray into the depths of the musical-on-TV genre, revolves around a teen production of “Carrie: The Musical.” Adapted from the classic 1974 Stephen King novel, the musical has been called the “most expensive quick flop in Broadway history.” Nevertheless, it’s found a home in “Riverdale,” a massively popular TV show that deals with similar themes ― the good-girl-versus-mean-girl binary, raging teenage hormones and bloodshed.

But since buckets of pig’s blood lack a certain visual panache in 2018, the cast of “Riverdale” lends the story a horrific new ending. (Spoiler alert!) Instead of simply acting out King’s familiar finale, the teens witness an actual murder when a student is stabbed multiple times on stage unbeknownst to the audience. Leave it to “Riverdale” to turn up the camp and the crazy for a musical episode unlike any we’ve seen before.

The episode came to life thanks to series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the man who once staged an unauthorized production of the gold-standard “Buffy” musical episode as a Yale drama student. Aguirre-Sacasa actually envisioned “Riverdale” as a musical series in the beginning stages of development. He’s been angling to do a full-blown production ever since.

“Originally, we always thought that there would be a stronger musical element and the kids would do school musicals, but as the show developed, it became more of a crime and noir show,” he told HuffPost. “But, by this point, even the superhero shows had done musical episodes, so I think the network was, like, if we’re letting these shows do it, we better let the show about high school kids do musicals, too.”

Musical episodes on television, much like the high school musicals of real life, have indeed become something of a rite of passage. What was once a set-your-DVR-or-regret-it event is now an increasingly regular milestone for shows including “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Scrubs” and “The Flash.” (Not to mention “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” which gifts the world with a mini-musical every week.) As a result, it’s never been harder to stand out.

Of course, “Riverdale” slips easily into its new skin as Archie (K.J. Apa), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes) and Cheryl (Madelaine Pestch) get in touch with their inner theater kids. The town’s resident fire-starter, Cheryl, takes on the role of Carrie White, a socially ostracized, telekinetic girl repressed by her religious fanatic mother. Betty, naturally, plays good girl Sue Snell, who initially bullies Carrie but succumbs to remorse. Veronica embodies the titular teen’s tormenter, Chris Hargensen. Finally, Archie fits nicely into the boy-next-door slot as Tommy Ross, Carrie’s ill-fated prom date.

Dressed in peak ’70s garb, the musically inclined actors belt their way through 11 songs from the musical, gathering for an especially impressive opening group number, “In,” that requires each of the cast members to show off their singing chops and some serious choreography. Meanwhile, Jughead, not exactly the song-and-dance type, films a behind-the-scenes documentary after actor Cole Sprouse took a hard pass on any musical moments.

“He’s a Broadway Scrooge,” Casey Cott, who plays the musical’s director, Kevin Keller, joked. “I’ve seen him do karaoke, and I’ve seen him dancing on the dance floor. That kid can move.”

Back in 1988, when “Carrie: The Musical” first opened more than a decade after the Brian De Palma film hit theaters, the production closed after a handful of performances due to scathing reviews. ”‘Carrie’ expires with fireworks like the Hindenberg,” a New York Times theater critic wrote in a particularly savage takedown at the time. The show, however, found its audience years later, amassing a cult following that flocked to see revivals in London and Los Angeles.

That audience included Aguirre-Sacasa, a self-professed mega-fan of the “Carrie” story who wrote the screenplay for a tepidly received 2013 movie remake starring Chloë Grace Moretz, which he described as a “very fraught” ordeal.

“It was not the most artistically satisfying or pleasant experience in my career,” he said. “I’ll save you the gory details. It sort of soured me to ‘Carrie.’ I really feel like this musical has allowed me to take it back as something I love and feel good about after years of not feeling good about it.”

Before landing on “Carrie,” Aguirre-Sacasa’s team considered staging other productions, like “Little Shop of Horrors” and “Sweeney Todd.” He even contemplated using songs from an original musical based on Archie Comics characters that he wrote before he was brought on as the company’s chief creative officer in 2014.

“It never got produced, but it has really good songs. I briefly thought if we can’t get the rights to ‘Carrie’ we’ll do ‘Archie: The Musical,’” he said.

But the disastrous prom saga seemed almost tailor-made for the series, which is why Aguirre-Sacasa stuck primarily to script, save for the addition of a few distinctively “Riverdale” flourishes ― mainly that twist ending that revives the mystery of the Black Hood, the town’s believed-to-be-dead serial killer.

The musical is “literally about a girl who goes crazy and kills everybody with blood all down her face,” Cott said. “Cheryl does that, and no one is surprised.”

Overall, the musical feels expertly suited to highlight the series’ biggest draw: the core four characters. In a season paced at break-neck speed, the lion’s share of the “Riverdale” plot has been dedicated to a whirlwind of murder mysteries, mayoral races, long-lost siblings and corruption scandals. This episode gives the series a much-needed chance to breathe by finding crucial moments to revisit some of the relationships that made the show a success in the first place.

In one of the episode’s most inspired plot diversions, Betty sings “You Shine,” a love song featured in the original musical, to Veronica instead of her onstage paramour as a peace offering after a particularly nasty fight.

“Even though there’s this big shocking ending, the musical allows us to focus more exclusively on the friendships, which we don’t always get to do because we are so frantically telling other stories,” Aguirre-Sacasa said.

As “Riverdale” rockets off toward the season finale, perhaps that’s the lesson it should take to heart ahead of Season 3. (Netflix recently picked up two seasons of a “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” spinoff, too.) Sure, the show thrives on crazy plot twists (remember: the town was founded on maple syrup blood money, after all), but how it builds upon the iconic characters of comic book lore in new and interesting ways will always be its lifeblood.

And should the musical experiment prove to be a success, the powers that be have every intention of making this a tradition for the show that has no incentive to stick to form.

“Every week ‘Riverdale’ is something different,” Aguirre-Sacasa said. “One week, it’s a serial killer show or ‘The Godfather’ in a small town and the next it’s a political thriller or a homage to ‘The Wrestler.’”

“The show is naturalistic, but it also exists in this weird area where the musical episode comes in and makes total sense,” Cott added. “It’s not all ‘Glee’ or flashy. It’s actually really weird and such a ‘Riverdale’ story.”CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Florida on Wednesday on SpaceX’s first high-priority science mission for NASA, a planet-hunting orbital telescope designed to detect worlds beyond our solar system that might be capable of harboring life.

The Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, lifted off on schedule from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:51 p.m. EDT, following a two-day postponement forced by a technical glitch found on Monday in the rocket’s guidance-control system.

Within minutes of the launch, the main-stage booster separated from the upper part of the rocket and flew itself back to Earth for a successful touchdown on an unmanned landing vessel floating in the Atlantic.

NASA’s latest astrophysics satellite, meanwhile, soared on toward orbit, starting the clock on a two-year, $337 million quest to expand astronomers’ known catalog of so-called exoplanets, worlds circling distant stars.

Wednesday’s blastoff was a milestone of sorts for Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, the private launch service owned by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.

The California-based company has launched cargo missions and other payloads for NASA before. But TESS marks the first under a special certification SpaceX has obtained to carry one of NASA’s highest-priority science instruments.

TESS is designed to build on the work of its predecessor, the Kepler space telescope, which discovered the bulk of some 3,700 exoplanets documented during the past 20 years and is running out of fuel.

NASA expects to pinpoint thousands more previously unknown worlds, perhaps hundreds of them Earth-sized or “super-Earth” sized - no larger than twice as big as our home planet.

Those are believed the most likely to feature rocky surfaces or oceans and are thus considered the best candidates for life to evolve. Scientists said they hope TESS will ultimately help catalog at least 100 more rocky exoplanets for further study in what has become one of astronomy’s newest fields of exploration.

“TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,” TESS principal investigator George Ricker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told reporters in a pre-launch briefing on Sunday.

Roughly the size of a refrigerator with solar-panel wings and four special cameras, TESS will take about 60 days to reach a highly elliptical orbit between Earth and the moon to begin its observations.

Like Kepler, TESS will use a detection method called transit photometry, which looks for periodic, repetitive dips in the visible light of stars caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of them.

TESS will focus on 200,000 pre-selected stars that are relatively nearby and among the brightest as seen from Earth, making them better-suited for sensitive follow-up analysis.Prince ingested an "exceedingly high" amount of fentanyl, an opioid many times stronger than heroin.

No one will be charged in the accidental overdose of musical artist Prince, a Minnesota county prosecutor announced at a Thursday press conference held almost exactly two years after the singer’s untimely death at age 57.

Prince died by ingesting an “exceedingly high” amount of fentanyl, an opioid many times stronger than morphine or heroin. Carver County Attorney Mark Metz said the drug was contained within counterfeit Vicodin pills found around the singer’s Paisley Park compound outside Minneapolis.

Authorities could not determine who provided Prince with the deadly pills.

“In all likelihood, Prince had no idea he was taking a counterfeit pill that could kill him,” Metz said. No suspect emerged, he said, during the “painstaking and thorough” investigation by the Carver County Sheriff’s Office, which was coordinated with “several federal, state and local agencies.”

Prince had been addicted to pain medication for years and was dealing with it privately, according to Metz. The county attorney stated that Prince’s doctor, Michael Schulenberg, had prescribed him the painkiller Percocet, but that medication does not contain fentanyl, the substance that ultimately killed the singer.

Schulenberg’s lawyer has challenged the claim that he ever prescribed opioids ― a classification that includes Percocet ― to Prince or “to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince.”

Authorities found a “significant number” of pain pills hidden all over Paisley Park in bottles other than their original pharmacy containers, Metz confirmed.

“Prince’s death is a tragic example that prescription opioid addictions and deaths do not discriminate,” he said.

On April 21, 2016, the singer was found unresponsive in an elevator at Paisley Park, where he maintained an elaborate recording studio. Emergency responders attempted to revive him at the scene but were unable to do so.

The week before, Schulenberg reportedly prescribed Percocet meant for Prince to his friend Kirk Johnson, which the doctor allegedly said was done to protect the singer’s privacy. Shortly afterward, while on a plane, the singer passed out and was reportedly given Narcan, an emergency treatment for suspected opioid overdoses.

AdvertisementA federal judge ruled Wednesday that President Donald Trump may not block people on Twitter over the political views they share on social media ― a tactic his administration has employed against at least dozens of people.

Siding with the Knight First Amendment Institute in a lawsuit against Trump and his communications team, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in New York concluded that blocking people on Twitter violated their First Amendment rights. Trump was engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by blocking critics in a “public forum,” the court ruled.

“We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account ― the ‘interactive space’ where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President’s tweets ― are properly analyzed under the ‘public forum’ doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court,” Buchwald said in her ruling.

Twitter is often the first communication channel Trump turns to when making major announcements. Last July, for example, he used the social media outlet to reveal his plans to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. armed forces.

The ruling notes that “the @realDonaldTrump account has been used in the course of the appointment of officers (including cabinet secretaries), the removal of officers, and the conduct of foreign policy.”

In addition to the president, defendants named in the lawsuit include former White House communications director Hope Hicks, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and social media director Dan Scavino ― the man thought to be behind much of Trump’s unusual social media behavior. However, Buchwald excused Hicks and Sanders as defendants.

Wednesday’s ruling also addresses a suggestion made by a judge last summer that Trump instead “mute” his Twitter critics ― an option on Twitter that would allow the president to hide them from his feed but remain visible in theirs.

“Muting equally vindicates the President’s right to ignore certain speakers and to selectively amplify the voices of certain others but ― unlike blocking ― does so without restricting the right of the ignored to speak,” she wrote.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of seven Twitter users whom Trump blocked on the platform. Other well-known people blocked from his account include author Stephen King, actor Rosie O’Donnell and model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen.

Buchwald ruled that unblocking the plaintiffs would be a “minimal” intrusion on executive prerogative, although she stopped short of ordering it outright.

“We must assume that the President and Scavino will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional,” she wrote.

Several plaintiffs in the case celebrated the ruling on Twitter.

The 37-year-old singer-actress said she called out of Tuesday’s performance of the smash Disney musical because of a “massive anxiety attack.”

“It had been building up for a while, and while the past month has been incredible, all of the ups and downs and stress and excitement really takes a toll on my mental health,” she wrote Wednesday. “I’ve learned that these situations aren’t something to ‘deal with’ or ‘push through.’ Anxiety and depression are real diseases that affect so many of us.”

Murin, known for her roles in “Chicago Med” and in Broadway’s “Lysistrata Jones,” said that her employers had been “nothing but supportive of me as I navigate my life and work.”

“Just remember that you’re not alone, your feelings are real, and this is not your fault,” she added. “Even Disney princesses are terrified sometimes.”

Murin has been frank about her struggles with anxiety in the past. In March, she recalled having had a “severe” panic attack before an out-of-town performance of “Frozen” in Denver.

It turned out to be a case of art imitating life, as Murin’s “Frozen” co-star, Caissie Levy, came to her aid.As part of Time magazine’s annual tradition of influential people lauding other influential people, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lavished President Donald Trump with praise, despite all of Trump’s attacks against him and his family during their bruising primary battle two years ago.

In a short profile published Thursday for Time’s list of the 100 most influential people, Cruz wrote in glowing, lyrical terms about Trump’s presidency, calling the president “a flash-bang grenade thrown into Washington by the forgotten men and women of America.”

It’s quite the contrast from the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, when Trump branded Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” and launched a series of attacks against him and his family.

The then-GOP presidential candidate promoted the unfounded conspiracy theory that Cruz’s dad, Rafael, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He also denigrated Cruz’s wife Heidi’s appearance and threatened to “spill the beans on [her.]”

Cruz hit back, calling him “a sniveling coward” and warning him to “leave Heidi the hell alone.” Later, he also criticized Trump as a “narcissist,” “a bully,” “a serial philanderer” and “a pathological liar.”

The feud between the two men continued at the Republican National Convention that summer, when Cruz famously did not endorse Trump as the nominee or mention him in his speech. Instead, he told the crowd to “vote your conscience,” which was met with boos.

He later explained that he did not want to be “a servile puppy dog for maligning my wife and maligning my father.”

Two months later, Cruz endorsed Trump.Dear cast of “Crazy Rich Asians,”

Shut up and take our money.

The teaser for the upcoming film, which is set to premiere in August, came out Thursday, and it’s practically dripping with glamor.

From extravagant mansions to chic costumes, the teaser definitely embodies the spirit of luxury described in the Kevin Kwan book that the film is based on. Plus, Constance Wu, who plays main character Rachel Chu, and Henry Golding, who plays her boyfriend, Nick Young, look completely fab.

The upcoming film centers on Chu, a Chinese-American economics professor who takes a trip with Young to his hometown of Singapore. Issues arise after Chu finds out that Young, a fellow professor, is actually the heir to a giant fortune.

With all the single women of the upper crust pining after the “most eligible bachelor in Asia,” Chu attempts to navigate around the drama while others try to bring her down.

Though the movie is months away from release, it’s already drawn a huge following. It’s proving particularly significant for Asian-Americans, as it’s the first film that isn’t a period piece to feature an Asian-majority cast on Hollywood’s big screen in more than two decades.

“Silicon Valley” star Jimmy O. Yang, who’s also in the movie, previously told HuffPost that as an Asian actor, making a film with an all-Asian cast spoke volumes to him.

“The camaraderie we built shooting this movie ― it made me so proud to be Asian even just making this movie,” he said. “We have all the most beautiful, the most talented and funny Asians coming from all over the world for this movie.”

Yang added: “With ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ we formed our own clique and we hang out all the time ... that’s our family now. If people can just feel an ounce of that. I hope it’s going to be a box office hit, but I think either way, when people watch it, especially Asian people, they’re going to feel some kind of bond.”A British doctor questioned a 23-year-old man’s claims that prescription medication turned him gay, but encouraged others to support his coming out.

Scott Purdy made headlines in a number of British tabloids this week, claiming that he began developing an attraction to other men just days after he began taking pregabalin ― better known by its Pfizer brand name, Lyrica ― in February after experiencing negative side effects from other medications he’d been taking since breaking his foot in 2012.

“I noticed my libido for women had gone and I was wanting male attention,” Purdy, who had a girlfriend at the time, told the Daily Mirror on Monday. “I stopped taking it for a few weeks and that desire for men just left. But I’m on it now; I’m very happy. I want to keep on taking it because it makes me feel happy about my sexuality. It’s made me feel very open. It’s liberating.”

When Purdy repeated his claim Wednesday on “This Morning,” a British news program, saying the drug had changed his sexuality, the show’s resident doctor Dr. Ranj Singh wasn’t having it.

Singh, who identifies as gay, acknowledged that drugs like Lyrica could prompt some “alteration in sexual function,” specifically lowering one’s sex drive, as a side effect. Still, he said it was medically impossible for the painkiller to impact a person’s sexuality like Purdy claimed.

“First and foremost, I think it’s great that you’re happy, and whatever it takes for you to be happy is good for you,” he told Purdy. “What it probably does is allow you to be able to express what was already there.”

He reiterated that stance in a series of Wednesday tweets.

That actually happened to actor Will Smith, who memorably impersonates the King of Pop during their odd encounter in a video he posted to YouTube on Wednesday.

Then he got shoved into the closet and the rest is history ― a really weird and funny history with Suge Knight playing a pivotal role.After years of failing to do anything to help new mothers in this country, the U.S. Senate finally got it together to help one woman on Wednesday ― a fellow senator.

Legislators voted unanimously to allow infants on the Senate floor during votes. The measure was crafted for Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who recently had a baby, becoming the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth isn’t officially taking a maternity leave, she said, because that would mean she’d be prohibited from voting during her time off. She wanted to figure out a way to be present for important work and still breastfeed. Her colleagues made it happen. There were some ridiculous grumblings, but many lawmakers appear quite proud of the new rule.

“Being a parent is a difficult job, and the Senate rules shouldn’t make it any harder,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Rules Committee.

It was a rare female-friendly move from a deliberative body dominated by men ― and it was hard not to delight in the sight of Duckworth bringing her newborn to the Senate floor on Thursday. After all, it wasn’t long ago that the women of the Senate didn’t even have a place to pee.

Still, forgive me for not wildly cheering.

While these senators snapped into action to solve a work-family issue for one of their peers, they’ve left millions of American families twisting in the wind for years. The United States is the only developed country that does not offer paid maternity leave to new mothers; we’re one of only a handful of nations on the planet that offers new moms essentially bupkis.

It’s cool that the Senate made something happen in this instance. Duckworth herself spoke of “leading by example.” But the nation’s women are still waiting for their turn.

“Great that the Senate has unanimously agreed to stop banning babies from the floor,” said Ellen Bravo, the director of Family Values @ Work, a nonprofit coalition of groups pushing for paid parental and sick leave in the U.S. “Surely now a majority can agree to paid family and medical leave insurance for all working families, so no one has to face financial disaster for being a good caregiver.”

Many high-income women can access paid leave through their jobs, but women at the lower end of the pay scale are less lucky. And the lack of leave is brutally punishing.

Far too many women must return to work quickly after giving birth, and the consequences are devastating. Women who go back to work too soon are more likely to experience depression, and less likely to breastfeed. Their babies can also suffer. Researchers have even found an inverse correlation between the amount of leave a woman takes and infant mortality rates.

Almost no one, of course, is letting women bring their infants to work with them. That’s just not going to fly. Imagine your Starbucks barista snuggling an infant while she makes a latte. Not feasible.

Many of these new mothers are stuck running out to the car with a breast pump on their breaks, or giving up on breastfeeding altogether, running on far too little sleep and fumes of empathy from their equally overworked colleagues.

Some women can’t go back to work quickly, since giving birth often comes with complications. And some lose their jobs simply because they’ve had a baby. Many workers do get job protection through the federal Family and Medical Leave Act ― the law that Congress begrudgingly passed 25 years ago that offers unpaid time off to new parents and caregivers. But the law doesn’t cover all workers. This means many women, out of work, are forced onto public benefits simply because they’ve had a child.

Lack of leave doesn’t just hurt individuals. The whole economy suffers because women are forced out of the labor market. It’s no coincidence that the percentage of women who participate in the U.S. labor market is among the lowest of all democratic countries. Motherhood also helps drive the wage gap between men and women in this country.

It’s not like the Senate lacks for ideas on how to fix this. There are a couple of bills floating around, from legislators on both sides of the aisle, that address the issue.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is looking at a proposal that would basically have new parents tap into Social Security money to float leave. It’s a bad idea that would weaken the social safety net, according to a report released Wednesday from the Urban Institute. However, it is a flashing sign that even conservatives who deplore government spending want to do something. Even President Donald Trump ― hardly known for his feminist agenda ― has mentioned the need for paid leave twice in major speeches.

On the Democratic side, most legislators are into the FAMILY Act, which Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) first proposed in 2013, and which would fund leave for new parents, as well as those who need to care for a sick relative or handle their own illness, through a small payroll tax.

Paid leave is not controversial. Most Americans want this. According to a Pew study from last year, 82 percent of Americans say mothers should receive paid time off after the birth or adoption of a child. Sixty-nine percent want leave for fathers, too.

Increasingly, states and cities are taking the lead on leave. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island have laws that look a lot like Gillibrand’s FAMILY Act. My home state, New York, just started offering paid time off to new parents. And twice a month, the state takes a small amount out of our paychecks to make that happen ― about $1 a week, on average. The amount deducted depends on your income.Art teacher Michael Hill said threatening, anti-LGBTQ letters prompted him to quit his job and relocate to California. Courtesy of Michael Hill

A Kansas art teacher said a series of threatening, homophobic letters prompted him to resign from his job and relocate to another state.

Michael Hill, who taught visual arts at Nemaha Central High School in Seneca, Kansas, said he began receiving the messages shortly after he came out as gay to his students last year on Oct. 11, which is National Coming Out Day. Hill posted images of the three letters, all of which were sent anonymously, to his Facebook page on Tuesday.

“Homosexuals should not be teaching our kids, in fact I don’t believe they should be teachers at all they are perverts and predators. ... You need to be fired and you can take your gay ideas with you,” one letter reads.

Another says, “Queers will burn and so will you. Don’t think my friends and I still ain’t after you.”

Hill, who is a Kansas native and father of two, announced his resignation and move to Palm Springs, California, in the same Facebook post, which had received more than 2,700 shares as of Thursday afternoon.

Hill, who had taught in the school district since 2009, told HuffPost that he took the first letter to the administration “immediately” after receiving it. “Initially I felt supported,” he said. “But that support waned as time wore on.”

The teacher said the second and third letters ― both of which mentioned his work as a teacher ― were sent to his home address, after which he contacted local law enforcement. Although Hill called their response “a bit lackluster,” he acknowledged, “I understand that there was not much to go on due to the anonymity of the letters with no return address. It was more of an incident report.”

A culprit or culprits in the alleged incidents have not been identified, according to The Topeka Capital-Journal.

In January, after he said he’d received the second letter, Hill began seven weeks of unpaid medical leave, which he said was “related to the threats and stress created by the situation.”

When the third letter arrived while he was on leave, he said, “I knew it was time to go. I couldn’t continue to stay in a situation that was causing me so much stress and anxiety.”

Darrel Kohlman, superintendent of the Nemaha Central Unified School District 115, told HuffPost that Hill’s resignation was “a loss” for the school. Still, he stressed there was “no indication” that the letters came from a student, a staff member or anyone else with direct ties to Nemaha Central High.

“Michael was, and is, a very good art teacher. This, by no means, was something that we wanted to happen,” Kohlman said.

“Any incidents that we thought had any connection to the school, we did address, and would’ve continued to had Michael come back and completed the year,” the superintendent continued. Noting that Nemaha Central aims to “teach our students about tolerance,” he added, “We felt like we were supporting him in doing what we could do.”

Hill, however, disputes this. “I think there were options put forth to the administration and school board that would have been agreeable and not costly to the district, but they chose not to go that route,” he said. Weighing what he could do ― “return to the school knowing full well that the perpetrator had not been identified, be terminated for failing to complete my contract, or resign” ― he said he decided to leave.

LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Kansas shared Hill’s Facebook post to its page on Thursday. The group said his case served to emphasize the fact that Kansas has no anti-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation and gender identity.

“This is why we fight,” Equality Kansas wrote. “This is the environment created by lawmakers and others who see us as second-class citizens ― or less.”

Now happily in California, Hill said he hopes his story will make people “think about the way they treat other people.”President Donald Trump boasted Wednesday about taking a tough stance on Russia despite backing off on issuing new sanctions over its support of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

“There’s been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump,” he said. “With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough, because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there’s been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.”Each trailer for “Deadpool 2” is equal parts joy and despair. Joy that we’re getting more clips of the “Merc with a Mouth” and despair that we still have to wait a month to see the movie.

We’re almost there though, and this final trailer released Thursday by 20th Century Fox should hopefully tide you over until “Deadpool 2” hits theaters on May 19.

The Department of Justice has shared copies of the so-called Comey memos with congressional leaders.

In a letter addressed to House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) on Thursday, the agency said it was releasing both redacted and unredacted versions of the documents to lawmakers.

The unredacted documents are “classified,” wrote Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, and would be available for viewing in the House Security office by members of the three congressional committees starting Friday.

BREAKING: DOJ has sent the Comey memos to Congress. https://t.co/xwlwqvOBdi pic.twitter.com/T55TdSgxoK — Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) April 19, 2018

News of the release comes just a day after Goodlatte suggested he’d subpoena the DOJ to obtain the seven memos, in which former FBI chief James Comey detailed his interactions with President Donald Trump.

Goodlatte, Nunes and Gowdy have been putting pressure on the agency to release the memos. Last Friday, they demanded that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein provide access to unredacted copies of the documents.

The three Republican leaders have also sought the release of other sensitive documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling and the FBI investigation into former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s email server.

In a Monday letter, Rosenstein had asked for more time to “evaluate the consequences” of providing such access, noting that “one or more of the memos may relate to an ongoing investigation, may contain classified information, and may report confidential Presidential communications.”

In his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee last year, Comey said the memos contained his personal recollections of his conversations with Trump. He admitted at the time to having leaked details from the documents, including an encounter during which the president allegedly urged him to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The memos’ content, however, is mostly unknown — and may contain useful evidence for Mueller’s Russia probe, particularly in relation to whether Trump obstructed justice. Questions have thus been raised as to whether releasing the memos to Congress could interfere with the investigation.

Democrats have suggested that GOP demands for the memos are a ploy to undermine Rosenstein and Mueller.

“The Deputy Attorney General should be aware that no matter what he gives to these members of Congress, it will never be enough,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent on Wednesday. “The point is to create a conflict with the Justice Department that would give the president grounds to get rid of Mueller or Rosenstein. They don’t care what damage they do to our institutions to protect the president.”

In his letter to lawmakers on Thursday, Boyd said recent “unusual events” had prompted a discussion about releasing the memos, but stressed that the DOJ had “consulted the relevant parties and concluded that the release of the memoranda to Congress at this time would not adversely impact any ongoing investigation.”

The battle over the Comey memos comes as the fired FBI chief’s tell-all memoir hit shelves. In the book, Comey accuses Trump of being “unethical” and “untethered to truth and institutional values.”

Trump lashed out at Comey following the memoir’s release, calling him “the worst FBI Director in history.”

My book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others. 3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint. I hope folks read the whole thing and find it useful. — James Comey (@Comey) April 15, 2018An Easter celebration in Baghdad last year.

WASHINGTON ― A mostly non-Christian militia linked to a brutal Iranian-backed paramilitary group secured two of the five seats in Iraq’s parliament reserved for Christians, according to official election results announced Saturday.

The militia, known as the Babylon Brigade, doesn’t represent Christians at all, local leaders and international advocates for Iraqi Christians warn. They say the militia’s candidates, though Christian, won only because of help from Shiite Muslims. And Iraqi Christians are calling on President Donald Trump to live up to his statements of concern for Middle East Christians by pressuring Iraqi authorities to invalidate the results. But so far, the Trump administration has said nothing on the issue.

Rayan al-Kildani, a Christian associated with various militias, founded the Babylon Brigade in 2014 when ISIS swept through Iraq and began hunting down religious minorities. Al-Kildani brought together 1,000 fighters and soon became the most prominent Christian in the popular mobilization, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias that fought ISIS with U.S. help. Along the way, he forged close ties with the Badr Organization, a historically brutal armed group that receives support from the Shiite leadership of Iran.

Most of Al-Kildani’s fighters aren’t Christians, national security experts say, but members of the non-Christian Shabak ethnic minority or Iraq’s Shiite Muslim majority. Al-Kildani’s chief value to the mostly Shiite leaders of the popular mobilization forces was in propaganda. “He’s used like a quisling character to put a Christian face onto these militias,” said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on Middle East policy.

Al-Kildani has “nothing to do with the morality of Christ ... [and] does not represent Christians in any way,” the church of Louis Sako, a top Iraqi priest who’s now a cardinal-designate, said in a statement last year.

Al-Kildani didn’t win the parliamentary seats because of support from the Christian community but because of his ties to groups like Badr, his opponents fear. His candidates received thousands of votes from heavily Shiite cities that have no known Christian communities, said Asaad Kalasho, the U.S. representative for the Christian town of Tel Keppe.

“He did get votes from Christians … [but] there’s no way that he won based solely on those Christian votes,” said Yousif Kalian, a program assistant at the United States Institute for Peace who has written on Al-Kildani’s militia. “Many [Christians] feel he doesn’t represent their interests largely because of connections to Badr and to Iran.”

One Christian party whose representatives had a post-election meeting at the State Department is formally challenging the seat allocation. And Sako said the results show Christians need to “learn a lesson” about securing political power.

Activists believe that rather than advocate for the Christian minority, the Babylon Brigade’s representatives in parliament will be most concerned with tipping the scales in favor of the Badr Organization, which secured the second-largest seat total in parliament. Kalasho said he sees the situation as evidence that the entire election was flawed — echoing complaints of irregularities elsewhere that the U.S. has said should be investigated.

Strong representation, the advocates argue, is crucial to help Iraq’s already struggling Christian community survive. Before the U.S. invasion unleashed waves of violence, Iraq had nearly 1.5 million Christians among its population of 38 million. Now only about 200,000 are left in the country, most of them in northern villages, the Kurdish region in the northeast and the capital, Baghdad.

“We’ve been marginalized by both Kurds and the central Iraqi government over the years. Now it’s Iran,” said Steve Oshana, the executive director of the nonprofit group A Demand for Action, throwing in a reference to Trump’s favorite geopolitical bogeyman. “Our land has been stolen, our rights diminished, and if we lose legitimate representation in parliament, there’s no coming back for us ... We’ve been bamboozled, and it will take leadership from the administration to make sure it doesn’t lead to our complete marginalization in our ancestral homeland.”

Activists said a strong response by the U.S. government is the only way to ensure that Christians still have their interests represented and prove that Washington will not tolerate attempts to suppress them. The White House and State Department met with Iraqi Christians worried about al-Kildani at least twice last year, Oshana said.

Many in the Trump administration, particularly evangelical Christian darling Vice President Mike Pence, have said they want to help Iraq’s Christians.

“Across the wider Middle East, we can now see a future in many areas without a Christian faith. But tonight, I came to tell you, help is on the way,” Pence proclaimed in October.

But the president has repeatedly told aides he wants to wash his hands of the Middle East and avoid pulling the U.S. into its communities’ disputes.State Attorney General Josh Hawley (left) and Gov. Eric Greitens flank U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at a Trump rally in St. Charles, Missouri, on Nov. 29, 2017. Whitney Curtis via Getty Images

Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) is seeking a temporary restraining order against state Attorney General Josh Hawley, a fellow Republican, to block him from investigating the increasingly embattled governor.

The request for a restraining order was filed on Monday, according to Missouri court records, the day before Hawley announced that his office had uncovered evidence of a possible felony committed by the governor. In an apparently unrelated case, Hawley has called for Greitens to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct.

On Tuesday, the attorney general said that his office had uncovered “evidence of potential criminal acts of wrongdoing” stemming from Greitens’ acquisition of an electronic donor list. Hawley suggested there was reason to think Greitens had unlawfully used that list, which he obtained from a Missouri nonprofit called The Mission Continues, to raise funds for his own political purposes.

“[Greitens] did all of this without permission of The Mission Continues,” Hawley said at a Tuesday morning press conference. “This is known as computer tampering. Given the value of the list in question, it is a felony.”

As for the restraining order request, Hawley press secretary Mary Compton told HuffPost on Wednesday that the attorney general’s office will “look forward to arguing this matter in court.” She also referenced Greitens’ attempt to get Hawley to recuse himself from the donor list investigation, calling that idea “frivolous.”

“The Attorney General called for the Governor’s resignation because the House Investigative Committee reported substantial evidence of sexual, violent misconduct by the Governor,” Compton said. “The investigation into The Mission Continues addresses an entirely separate matter. The fact that the Governor has been credibly accused of sexual misconduct does not mean he is exempt from investigation into other wrongdoing.”

Greitens’ office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, several top Republicans from Missouri’s state House and Senate also called on Greitens to resign. The governor has said that he is innocent and that he will not step down.

“I will not be resigning the Governor’s office,” Greitens tweeted on Tuesday. “In three weeks, this matter will go to a court of law — where it belongs and where the facts will prove my innocence.”

Last week, a woman with whom Greitens previously admitted to having an extramarital affair in March 2015 testified before a Missouri House special investigative committee that their sexual encounters weren’t always consensual and were sometimes violent. She alleged that Greitens blindfolded her and took nude photos without her permission and then used the photos in an attempt to blackmail her into silence.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and her newborn daughter Maile Pearl Bowlsbey made history Thursday after the lawmaker voted on the Senate floor with her baby in tow.

The Senate voted unanimously Wednesday to change its longstanding rules and allow senators to bring their children under 1 year old onto the chamber floor during votes. Duckworth introduced the resolution earlier in the week after becoming the first sitting senator to give birth while in office.

Video of the moment shows Duckworth arriving on the floor to applause from her colleagues. The senator ensured baby Maile adhered to Senate floor dress code policy, wearing a jacket since blazers are required. She also wore a duck-print onesie.

“I’m not sure what the policy is on duckling onesies, but I think we’re ready,” Duckworth tweeted before the vote.

I may have to vote today, so Maile’s outfit is prepped. I made sure she has a jacket so she doesn’t violate the Senate floor dress code (which requires blazers).

She then cast her vote opposing President Donald Trump’s pick to lead NASA. (The Senate nonetheless confirmed Jim Bridenstine as the agency’s new administrator.)

Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, welcomed her first child, Abigail, in 2014 while she served in the U.S. House of Representatives. On Wednesday, Duckworth thanked her Senate colleagues for swiftly passing her resolution so she could uphold her constitutional duty.

“By ensuring that no Senator will be prevented from performing their constitutional responsibilities simply because they have a young child, the Senate is leading by example and sending the important message that working parents everywhere deserve family-friendly workplace policies,” she said in a statement when the resolution passed.

As she was leaving the Senate floor Thursday, Duckworth told reporters it felt “amazing” to be able to cast her vote and bring her newborn. “And it’s about time,” she said.

Spanish actor Javier Bardem says he has “doubts” about the sexual misconduct allegations against Woody Allen and defended the director in a recent interview about his film “Escobar.”

In discussion with French publication Paris Match, Bardem said he is “absolutely not” ashamed to have worked with Allen when asked if he was. Bardem and his wife, actress Penelope Cruz, both starred in Allen’s 2008 film “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.”

“I am very shocked by this sudden treatment,” said Bardem referring to the recent scrutiny on Allen in light of the Me Too movement. “Judgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent. The legal situation today is the same as in 2007. If there was evidence that Woody Allen was guilty, then yes, I would have stopped working with him, but I have doubts.”

In another question, Bardem addressed the growing Me Too movement. He said he was uneasy with the idea that women and men are pitted against one another:

“I’m fortunate to have been raised by a very strong mother who taught me to respect women. Today, we have the impression there are men on one side and women on the other, which sends a very bad message to the younger generation,” the actor said.

“The goal is not to be against each other but to be with others,” he added.PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that negotiations were under way for the release of three Americans held as prisoners in North Korea.

Speaking at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump said: “We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there’s a good chance of doing it. We’re having very good dialogue.”

A senior administration official said CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who visited Pyongyang secretly in recent weeks, brought up the case of the three prisoners in his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and the United States was hopeful for their release.

Trump also said he hoped a planned meeting with Kim to discuss denuclearization would be successful but that he would walk out if it was not.

“If we don’t think it’s going to be successful ... we won’t have it,” Trump said, adding: “If the meeting, when I’m there is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.”

Trump, who was hosting Abe and his wife at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said a campaign of maximum pressure on North Korea would continue until Pyongyang agreed to give up its nuclear weapons.
