Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, oversaw the hiring of two senior aides with salaries topping $230,000 ― a major boost from their previous government jobs ― as he criticized the agency for overspending, The New York Times reported.

Kirsten Sutton, the CFPB chief of staff as of January, makes $259,500 per year, documents obtained by the newspaper show. Her predecessor earned $212,324. Sutton’s new salary is a raise of more than 50 percent from her previous job working for Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas).

Brian Johnson, hired as a CFPB senior adviser, makes $239,595. He was sent an offer letter on Dec. 1 with a starting salary of $220,000, but his pay was increased by more than $19,000 by the end of the month.

The high pay scale isn’t unusual for the CFPB. Financial regulators offer higher salaries than other Washington agencies ― but both Mulvaney hires are making more than their predecessors and most of their colleagues, the Times said.

Disclosure of the fat paychecks comes after President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly advocated reshaping the agency, arguing it has imposed too many regulations on the financial industry, and have tried to cut the amount it pays employees. The latest White House budget proposal recommended a $150 million funding cut.

Trump installed Mulvaney, the White House budget director, to temporarily lead the CFPB in November. Mulvaney submitted a report to Congress on Monday encouraging lawmakers to curb the agency’s powers.

“The bureau is far too powerful, and with precious little oversight of its activities,” he said in the report.

He requested a CFPB budget for the quarter of $0 and said he would fund operations with reserves.We’re going to have to agree to disagree on this one.

Trump is currently threatening China and other countries with tariffs, and China has retaliated with tariffs of its own.

In Chattanooga, Tennessee, in November 2016, a school bus carrying Hamilton County Schools elementary students flipped over and crashed into a tree, killing six children. All the children were between the ages of 6 and 10.

The driver, Johnthony Walker, was found guilty on numerous criminal charges for his role in the crash. But a local activist group is also pointing fingers at another party ― the private company that contracted with schools to operate the buses.

On Friday, the group, called the Stand Up for School Bus Safety Coalition, sent a letter and report to more than 250 school districts around the country warning them about the company’s track record. The company, Durham School Services, is owned by National Express Group. NEG is the second largest bus contractor in the country, according to the safety coalition, operating in 32 states.

With school safety under intense scrutiny following the February mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, advocates say this is a simple way to take a step in the right direction.

“This is part of the local and national conscience right now,” said Eric Adkins, a Chattanooga community member who is involved with the coalition.

The group says Durham School Services has not made the proper changes to improve safety in the wake of the tragedy, and that its negligence helped contribute to the crash. Indeed, prior to the crash, DSS had received multiple complaints about Walker’s behavior. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also criticized the company in a post-crash investigation for its negligence.

Still, DSS continues to provide service for Hamilton County Schools, the school district confirmed, along with hundreds of others around the country. A spokesperson for the district said it is working to facilitate a face-to-face meeting between the company and the coalition in coming weeks.

Included in the group’s letter to districts is a new report written by a Wayne State University professor, which crunches data showing that National Express Group has a worse track record for safety than other major school bus companies.

“You have a fairly strong result and that result is just certain companies perform better,” Professor Michael Belzer told HuffPost.

The trend of school districts outsourcing transportation to private companies, as opposed to district-run transportation, is worthy of scrutiny, Belzer said.

A spokeswoman for DSS told HuffPost the company has made several changes since the crash to improve school safety, and that the presentation of data in the report is misleading. She says the company has already acted to address the recommendations the report provides.

“Durham Schools Services is safe, National Express is safe, we are a safe company,” spokeswoman Kate Walden said.

The company disagrees sharply with the activist group’s characterization of it.

“The data is flawed, so they’ll be sharing school districts with flawed data,” Walden said.

But coalition members say they hope school districts will heed their warning and demand accountability from DSS.The 17-year-old who killed 10 people last week at his high school in Santa Fe, Texas, was too young to buy a gun, but he didn’t have to look far to find one.

On Friday morning, he took his father’s pump-action shotgun and .38 revolver, concealed them under a trench coat and walked into an art class before opening fire on students, teachers and a responding school resource officer.

Authorities haven’t released further details about how the gunman was able to access the weapons, but in the aftermath of the massacre, people from across the political spectrum have stressed the importance of securing firearms to keep minors and others from getting ahold of them without permission.

“If you’re a parent and you own guns, lock your guns safely away,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a staunch pro-gun Republican, said at a press conference on Friday. “It’s a serious issue and one big step we can take.”

Ed Scruggs, a board member of Texas Gun Sense, a nonprofit focused on gun violence prevention, offered similar advice.

“If you have minors in the house, the guns should be secured, because anything just laying out is a risk,” Scruggs told HuffPost.

Advocates on both sides of the gun debate appear to have found some elusive common ground in promoting safe and responsible firearm ownership, an issue that nationwide studies suggest is a worthy cause.

A survey published earlier this year found that most gun owners don’t safely store all of their firearms in a locked container, such as a safe or gun case, or with a trigger lock device. Among households with children under 18, 55 percent of gun owners said they did.

Although Texans may agree on the need to confront the issue of unsecured guns, they don’t agree on the best way to do it.

Texas is one of 27 states, as well as Washington, D.C., that attempts to compel gun owners to store their firearms properly with a child access prevention law, which allows prosecutors to charge adults with misdemeanor criminal negligence when a child under 17 obtains a “readily dischargeable” firearm from their property. Because the suspect in the Santa Fe shooting is 17, the law may not apply in this case. The Galveston County District Attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would pursue charges against the gunman’s father.

Recent reports have called the effectiveness of the 1995 law into question. There were only 61 convictions statewide under the statute in its first 20 years, according to 2015 review by the Austin-American Statesman. Gun control experts say prosecutors may be hesitant to bring charges against individuals who may already be coping with a tragedy after a child’s shooting. They’ve also criticized the law because it doesn’t explicitly mandate safe storage practices and is typically only used after a tragedy has happened.

To Scruggs, that’s proof the state should strengthen the law and clarify the circumstances in which it would be applied.

“Right now, the state really does very little, if anything, to encourage the safe and secure storage of firearms at all,” Scruggs said. “It’s not really a gun rights issue, it’s just a gun issue and we shouldn’t be afraid to discuss it.”

Last legislative session, Texas Gun Sense and other gun violence prevention groups also worked to launch a statewide education and public awareness campaign around gun safety, which would’ve used funds from the state’s handgun licensing fees.

Gun rights groups opposed the measure, and it failed to make it out of committee.

Alice Tripp, legislative director of the NRA-affiliated Texas State Rifle Association, said the push for a new gun safety program was a “noble goal,” but that the legislature shouldn’t be responsible for paying for it.

“They can do what the rest of us do: Work your tail off, make money and give it to create it,” she told HuffPost. “You don’t do it through law and legislature and through tax funding.”

Under federal law, every handgun sold by a licensed dealer must be accompanied with a trigger lock or other safety or storage device. Those rules don’t apply to private sales between individuals. Firearm manufacturers also include basic safety information in the owner’s manuals that come with their products.

But Massachusetts is the only state that actually requires all firearms to be stored with a locking device in place when not in use.

In an interview on Sunday, Patrick wouldn’t commit to supporting a stronger law on gun storage, insisting that Texas already “holds you responsible if you’re a gun owner.”

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick on gun safety: “A gun ownership ... that comes with responsibility of gun control in your home” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/HcWwFsu65x — CNN (@CNN) May 20, 2018

Tripp said she opposes a more stringent safe storage law in Texas, and questioned whether police would even be able to enforce such a measure. She pointed to existing safety programs provided by groups like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s lobbying association, and said that a large part of gun safety ultimately comes down to “parental logic.”

“You don’t leave out poison or medications,” she said. “Nobody has to tell me not to store my car keys in my ignition, but there are people that do that.”

But Tripp said she supported Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s plans to convene a roundtable discussion on gun violence and school safety following the Santa Fe shooting, an announcement that some saw as a surprise coming from a Republican who has long opposed any talk of gun control. She said she hoped to see them cover a number of proposals, including potential changes to the state’s child access prevention law.

“If it needs to be a stronger penalty, then that needs to be discussed. But if it’s not being used at all, then how come?” she said. “Nothing can be off the table.”

In the meantime, Scruggs said gun owners can take it upon themselves to begin an honest conversation around safe storage and keeping firearms out of the hands of their children.You should send these to Puerto Rico, where they are FREE from running water and electricity.

Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) is resigning from Congress, he announced Friday in a statement and accompanying video.

Farenthold declared in December that he would not seek re-election in 2018 after reports emerged that he’d used taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment claims. A few of his GOP colleagues urged him to resign over the accusations, which Farenthold has repeatedly denied.

“While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it’s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,” he said in the statement.

In his video, flanked by an American flag and a Texas state flag, he added: “You know, I look forward to staying in touch with everyone. It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve. Thank you so much. Please, stay in touch. I love y’all. God bless you, God bless Texas, God bless America.”

Farenthold’s resignation took effect Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern time. He promptly deleted his Twitter and Facebook profiles.

Farenthold used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit his former communications director, Lauren Greene, had filed in 2014, Politico reported in December. Greene accused Farenthold of telling her he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about her, and then claimed she was fired after complaining to Farenthold.

“I had no idea how to run a congressional office,” the four-term congressman said in December. “As a result, I allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional.”

Farenthold said after the reports broke that he would repay the $84,000 to the Treasury Department, but has not made good on that promise. A representative for his office told HuffPost in February that the congressman was waiting to see what changes lawmakers will add to the Congressional Accountability Act.

“He is waiting on the advice of counsel to see what final bill is enacted,” Bob Haueter, Farenthold’s chief of staff, told HuffPost at the time. “Once the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds.”

In his resignation statement, Farenthold reflected on his time spent working to “make government more efficient and responsive, cut government spending, repeal Obamacare, protect life and reduce the debt.”It was just like a movie.

“We were engaged within 10 months, but I think we probably knew before that,” Blunt said.

Daniel Akaka, the first Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.S. Senate, has died due to organ failure, multiple outlets reported Friday. He was 93.

“We are so fortunate to have him as long as we did. We were very lucky,” Akaka’s family said in a statement to Hawaii News Now.

The former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee was known for his attention to the concerns of former service members and push for increased rights for Native Hawaiians.

“Senator Akaka lived a life of love, kindness & aloha. I never heard him utter an unkind comment about a single person. He represented the best of Hawai’i and set the highest standard for all us to achieve in terms of human decency,” Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said in a statement on Twitter.

Hawaii’s current members of Congress recalled the former senator fondly.

Akaka “embodied the aloha spirit & selflessly dedicated his life to serving others,” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D) tweeted.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D) called the former lawmaker, “A pure heart, a determined warrior for native Hawaiians, and a true public servant.”

Akaka began his career as a school administrator. He also worked for the state’s Department of Health, Education and Welfare before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976 to represent Hawaii’s 2nd District. He was subsequently re-elected six times before being appointed to fill a vacancy in the Senate, where he served from 1990 until his retirement in 2013.

In the upper chamber, Akaka repeatedly sponsored versions of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, known as the “Akaka Bill,” to grant political sovereignty to Native Hawaiians. Opponents criticized the bill as discriminatory against Hawaiians not of native descent.

Akaka saw the bill’s failure as a sore spot in his career, remarking when he retired that there seemed to be “always one objection” preventing it from getting to the Senate floor.

“It is long past time for the Native Hawaiian people to have the same rights, the same privileges, and the same opportunities as every other federally recognized native people,” Akaka told Hawaii News Now in 2012.

Veterans issues were also close to Akaka’s heart, and he was able to focus on them while serving as chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee from 2007 to 2010.

Akaka was just 17 years old when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and he would go on to join the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and serve in World War II.

He later acknowledged that he experienced post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of fighting in the war. In interviews with Hawaii News Now in 2012, he credited the GI Bill with helping him cope with the disorder and pursue a college degree.

Many considered Akaka’s Senate record to be unremarkable, and Time magazine in 2006 labeled him a “master of the minor” ― “an affectionate and earnest man” who seemed to have little to show for his decades in office.

But to his friends, Akaka was a courageous man ― evidenced by his fierce opposition to the war in Iraq ― who rarely sought the spotlight.

“He’s been courageous in speaking out against this misguided war in Iraq from the beginning,” Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Honolulu Advertiser in 2006. “He’s a great personal friend and true man of his word. The U.S. Senate needs Danny’s judgment and his unyielding commitment to making America live up to its highest ideals in the years ahead.”

Akaka’s retirement in 2013 marked the end of an era, coming shortly after the death of Sen. Daniel Inouye, another stalwart of Democratic politics from Hawaii. Not only was the Senate losing two long-serving Democrats, but for years Akaka’s name had also been the first one read during Senate roll call votes.Rep. Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) said this week that his state shouldn’t legalize recreational marijuana because it would hinder the economic fortunes of poor people. Wealthier states can better afford to handle the substance, he added.

“I do not see how in combating poverty you can put one more obstacle in front of people who are struggling to get out of poverty,” Pearce said Thursday, “so I don’t see where I would support recreational marijuana.”

A wealthier state, the congressman added, could more easily absorb the allegedly deleterious effects of legal marijuana.

“People [point to] other states and say, ‘Well, Colorado is doing it just fine,’” Pearce continued. “Colorado has a much deeper economic base to rely on. Colorado has much deeper pockets to rely on.”

As for New Mexico, he said, “We’re at the bottom of everything ― and to say that we want to make one more [obstacle] for people who are just trying to get themselves on their feet and get back in the workforce and work their way out, I just don’t see how it fits. I don’t see how it fits that we’re going to deal with addiction and yet we’re going to people, ‘This one is OK.’”

A Pearce spokesperson said that the congressman was not making a distinction between the use of marijuana by rich and poor individuals and that to claim he did would be a “deliberate distortion.”

“Colorado has deeper pockets to pay for more drug addiction, more jails and more law enforcement,” said Keeley Christiensen, Pearce’s Washington press secretary. “They have their right to spend their tax money mitigating the destructive effects of drug addiction how they choose. The congressman believes New Mexico would be wiser spending its money on creating jobs, hope and opportunity for everyone.”

Among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, New Mexico has the second-highest poverty rate (after Mississippi), according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Colorado, which became the first state to implement a law allowing the purchase and sale of recreational marijuana in 2014, has the 13th-lowest poverty rate.

Pearce, who is running unopposed in New Mexico’s Republican gubernatorial primary, made his comments in response to a question about marijuana legalization during a candidate forum alongside the three remaining Democratic candidates. Video of his remarks was provided to HuffPost by the liberal super PAC American Bridge.

After his easy primary race, Pearce likely faces a stiff challenge in the general election for governor. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, is a well-known figure in the state, hailing from an established political family that includes her cousin, Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Although New Mexico’s outgoing governor, Susana Martinez, is a Republican, the state has leaned Democratic in recent statewide elections.

Pearce has a history of inflammatory comments about hot-button issues. In 2008, he claimed that legalizing same-sex marriage would lead to LGBTQ people marrying “everyone in California with AIDS” to give the latter individuals health benefits. In his 2014 memoir, “Just Fly the Plane, Stupid!” he wrote that wives must “voluntarily submit” to their husbands.It’s Super Biebs!

Justin Bieber adds a heroically funny touch to Rudy Mancuso’s latest “Racist Superman” video.

As Hispanic Superman (Mancuso), Black Superman and others trade insults and argue over who is the true Man of Steel, in comes Bieber as Canadian Superman.

Of course, Canadian Superman is super polite and ready to play hockey. “Hummus is delicious,” he tells Mediterranean Superman. “I loved Pokemon growing up,” he gushes to Asian Superman.

OK, so he’s a kiss-ass, too.

But bravo to the Biebs, who hails from north of the border, for helping the clip collect millions of views on YouTube since it was posted Wednesday.

Mancuso and Bieber do have a connection, incidentally. Mancuso opened for Bieber on his 2017 “Purpose” tour in Brazil, People noted.

Said Rogen: “I just kept smoking it in Steven Spielberg’s face as I saw, like, the look on his face where he’s just like, ’I’m never working with this motherfucker ... ever.’”

A relative of a gay man found badly injured near train tracks in California says his family is angry authorities are looking at the possibility of attempted suicide. The circumstances, he said, point to foul play.

“They keep trying to push the narrative that he jumped from the train, but we believe he was attacked and this might’ve been a hate crime,” Austin Sailas told HuffPost on Tuesday.

His cousin, 22-year-old Aaron Salazar, is hospitalized in Reno, Nevada, where he’s in a coma.

“He has brain injuries, a broken pelvis and a mysterious burn on his crotch,” Sailas said. “It all depends on him now. He’s young, he’s strong and he’s been fighting to wake up, so there’s hope.”

Salazar, an economics major at Portland State University, was on an Amtrak train on May 15, traveling from Colorado to Portland. His last known communication, according to his cousin, was a text message to his great-grandmother at about 11 a.m.

“He told her, ‘I have another layover in Sacramento, but right now I’m going to go get some food and explore with this friend I met on the train,’” Sailas said. “That was the last anyone heard from him.”

Aaron Salazar's cousin said investigators are too focused on a theory of attempted suicide. GoFundMe

Less than an hour later, railroad workers found an incapacitated Salazar lying beside the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Truckee, California. His injuries were so severe that responding paramedics had him airlifted to Renown Regional Medical & Trauma Center in Nevada.

Sailas said doctors at the hospital told the family his cousin’s injuries are consistent with a beating.

“We believe that he was attacked by this person that he’d met on the train,” Sailas said.

Because Salazar was found on property belonging to Amtrak, the investigation is being spearheaded by the Amtrak Police Department. Calls for comment to the investigative agency were not returned on Tuesday. However, a spokesperson for the department sent an email to HuffPost indicating that they are in touch with the family and that investigators have found “nothing to suggest criminal intent.”

Sailas said investigators haven’t been forthcoming with information and have yet to examine Salazar’s cellphone or laptop for potential clues.

“They’ve been shady about the whole investigative process,” Sailas said. “They won’t even tell us where he was found, other than it is private property. They’re just saying that they’re looking into the idea that he jumped from a moving train.”

The family, Sailas said, believes there’s no way his cousin could’ve jumped from a moving train without alerting the operator.

“We called Amtrak that day and they told us if he had opened any windows or doors there would have been notifications triggered,” he explained. “They also told us no incidents were reported on that train about any open windows or anything.”

Salazar’s family is asking people to use the hashtag #JusticeForAaron when sharing information on social media about the case. They’ve also started a GoFundMe campaign to help raise money for growing hospital expenses. As of Tuesday evening, more than $8,000 was raised.

“We need prayers for Aaron,” Sailas said. “We, without a doubt, know he did not jump. We want answers.”

Anyone with information in this case is asked to contact the Amtrak Police Department at 800-331-0008.Lorde is really regretting the song lyrics she wrote in the caption of an Instagram gone wrong.

The “Green Light” singer faced backlash on Thursday night after she posted a picture of her filling bathtub and added Whitney Houston lyrics as the caption.

“And iiii will always love you,” she wrote, referencing the late singer’s famous cover song.

Houston died at age 48 in 2012, accidentally drowning in a bathtub with additional complications of heart disease and cocaine use. Three years later, Houston’s daughter, Bobbi Kristina, 22, was found unresponsive in a bathtub, and died six months later.

Social media users called out Lorde for her post, demanding that she take it down immediately. The hashtag #LordeIsOverParty quickly gained traction.

“Lorde has ended her career via Instagram,” one Twitter user wrote. Others added, “This is disgusting,” and “lorde is cancelled thank u thats all.”

Some people defended Lorde, saying her post was likely an oversight not meant as an intentional offense:

AdvertisementMaryland became the latest state to adopt a small but powerful change in the way it registers voters, a move that advocates hope could add hundreds of thousands of people to the rolls in that state alone.

Under a new law, the state will automatically register people to vote when they use other services at a motor vehicle or state social service agency or buy health insurance through the state’s public exchange. The bill also instructs state officials to come up with a way to offer people who file their Maryland income tax returns online the opportunity to register to vote.

While several state agencies are already required by federal law to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, advocates believe that tweaking the process so the default option is to register will lead to more people on the voting rolls. Even though any individual can still choose to opt out, research has shown that making something the default option increases the likelihood that people will choose it.

The bill overwhelmingly passed both houses of the Maryland Legislature and was sent to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) last week. Hogan had six days to sign or veto the bill; he did neither and the legislation became law on Thursday. It will take effect in July 2019.

Hogan’s office did not respond to a request for comment on why he chose not to sign the bill.

In 2016, the think tank Demos projected that automatic voter registration could add 404,000 people to the rolls in Maryland.

Damon Effingham, acting director of Common Cause Maryland, said the bill would not only add voters but also improve election security by requiring state agencies to transmit updated information to election officials.

Automatic voter registration “will become law in Maryland, modernizing and expanding access to the franchise while improving election security at virtually no cost to the taxpayer,” he said in an email. “It’s a rare win-win-win.”Women serving in the House of Representatives made up only 19.6 percent of lawmakers in 2017, but that number could change after the 2018 midterm elections.

A record-setting 309 women have filed to run for U.S. House seats this year, The Associated Press reported on Thursday. That number is expected to grow. Half the states still have open filing periods, and The Cut’s Rebecca Traister reported in January that an estimated 390 women are planning to run for House seats this year.

While it’s admittedly a long path from filing to run for a seat to actually getting elected, Thursday’s record shows an energized wave of women calling for change since Hillary Clinton’s presidential loss, President Donald Trump’s win and the 2017 Women’s March. The past several months have also inspired women to speak out as anti-harassment movements like Time’s Up and Me Too dominate headlines.

Last year, EMILY’s List announced that an “unprecedented” number of women were inspired to run for office after Trump’s election. At the time, EMILY’s List President Stephanie Schriock told The Washington Post that the organization had heard from more than 11,000 women in all 50 states — with a few dozen seriously considering House races. The group says it’s helped elect more than 100 Democratic women to the House since its founding 30 years ago.

Lauren Baer, who served as a senior policy adviser to Clinton and John Kerry in the State Department, is one of two Democratic candidates hoping to get elected.

She filed this year to challenge Republican incumbent Rep. Briant Mast in Florida’s 18th District, where Trump beat Clinton by 9 points. Democrat Pam Keith, who ran for Florida’s open Senate seat in 2016 and lost, is also challenging Kast.

“I have a daughter who was born two weeks before Donald Trump was elected president, and I think just about every day about her future and my responsibility for creating the kind of world I want her to live in,” Baer said on MSNBC on Thursday.The bad news keeps coming for Fox News host Laura Ingraham even while she’s on vacation: Another sponsor has reportedly dropped her show.

Ace Hardware will no longer advertise on “The Ingraham Angle,” TheWrap reported on Thursday.

“I can confirm that we do not have any plans to nationally advertise on Ingraham’s show in the future,” an unnamed spokeswoman for the company told the website.

TheWrap said Ace had two ads on the show in March, including one on March 28, the day she launched her ill-fated slam against David Hogg, a teen survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Ingraham mocked Hogg, who has become an outspoken advocate for gun control, for not getting accepted into some of the colleges he had applied to.

In response, Hogg called for a boycott of her show, and Ingraham apologized as sponsors began to drop her show.

Hogg did not accept her apology.

“She only apologized after we went after her advertisers,” he told The New York Times. “It kind of speaks for itself.”

Nutrish, TripAdvisor, Wayfair, Expedia, Nestlé, Johnson & Johnson, Stitch Fix, Jenny Craig, Hulu, JoS. A. Bank and more have dropped her show. TheWrap said Ace Hardware is the 19th company to ditch Ingraham.

My Pillow said it would continue to advertise on Ingraham’s show.

Ingraham announced a vacation as the sponsors fled, and Fox has insisted it would stick with her.Jim Carrey is not letting up.

The actor/comedian/artist unveiled a new painting, and this one takes on Scott Pruitt, the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that the agency had approved a pipeline project while Pruitt was renting a room from the wife of a lobbyist representing the pipeline’s owner.

In Carrey’s painting, a pipeline features very prominently:

I looked on Trivago. The cheapest room in Washington is a youth hostel with bunkbeds at $81 a night. The $50 room Scott Pruitt got was a bribe from an energy lobbyist. Need your pipeline approved? Do it through Pruitt! pic.twitter.com/DaSdgvFPmv — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) April 5, 2018

The painting is part of an ongoing series Carrey has been sharing on social media. Earlier this week, he depicted right-wing media figures Sean Hannity and Alex Jones as pro wrestlers:

If u believe wrestling is real u may even believe Fox news, Info Wars and the robotic drones on Sinclair Broadcasting. But wrestling doesn’t harm viewers.

Will We Ever Stop Screaming?' pic.twitter.com/LrCmlXXpv7 — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 29, 2018Twitter announced Thursday that it has suspended more than 1.2 million accounts since August 2015 to the end of 2017 for “terrorist content.”

In the latest six-month reporting period, ending Dec. 31, Twitter permanently suspended 274,460 accounts for “violations related to the promotion of terrorism,” the company revealed in a blog post detailing highlights from its 12th biannual Twitter Transparency Report.

Twitter began major suspensions of terrorist-related accounts in early 2014 in the wake of criticism that it wasn’t doing enough.

Last year, relatives of victims of the 2015 San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack that killed 14 people filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Google and Facebook, accusing the tech giants of supporting Islamic State. The suit claims the companies allowed Islamic State to build an outsized online presence to draw recruits.

Twitter’s latest suspension count was down 8.4 percent from 299,649 suspensions in the previous six-month reporting period and down 27 percent from the last half of 2016. Of the blocked accounts in the latest period, 93 percent were spotted by internal company tracking tools and 74 percent were cut before the first tweet appeared, Twitter reported.

Twitter credits better in-house tech tools for those declines in suspensions. “We continue to see the positive, significant impact of years of hard work making our site an undesirable place for those seeking to promote terrorism, resulting in this type of activity increasingly shifting away from Twitter,” the company said.

Government reports of violations related to terrorism represented less than 0.2 percent — 597 accounts — of all suspensions in the most recent reporting period, according to Twitter. A far larger number of Twitter accounts were reported by government agencies (including police departments) for “abusive” behavior — including hate speech, racism, sexism and other types of trolling, which Twitter has been harshly criticized for failing to police. Government agencies reported 6,254 Twitter accounts in the last half of 2017 for abusive behavior, but the company took action against only a quarter of those accounts.

Abusive content continues to be a particular problem for Twitter overseas, where laws more sharply restrict hate speech and trolling. A new European Commission regulation last month called on social media platforms to remove illegal content within an hour of it being reported.The attorney for Stormy Daniels, the porn star who allegedly had a 2006 affair with Donald Trump, is celebrating the latest comments from the president with a very early holiday wish.

“First of all, Ari, let me say Merry Christmas to you,” Michael Avenatti said to MSNBC’s Ari Melber on Thursday. “Because it’s a very, very Merry Christmas this evening here over in our camp.”

The money was reportedly part of a nondisclosure agreement forbidding her from speaking about her relationship with Trump. She is now suing to get out of that agreement.

Avenatti said Trump’s claim that he wasn’t aware of the payment both simplifies and strengthens her case.

“This is what happens when you have an undisciplined client,” he said. “We waited patiently, and lo and behold, Christmas has arrived.”

He added:

“If the president didn’t know anything about the payment, then he didn’t know anything about the agreement. And in that case, you can’t have an agreement.”

Later on the network, Avenatti said he would continue to attempt to depose both Trump and Cohen.

“In the event that we get a two-hour deposition of Michael Cohen and a two-hour deposition of this president, I am highly confident that their statements are not going to hold up under cross-examination by me,” he said. “Period.”Hundreds of people rallied in New York City on Thursday evening to call for justice for Saheed Vassell, an unarmed black man who was shot by police the day before.

Activists gathered in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where New York City police shot at the 34-year-old father 10 times and killed him on Wednesday.

Police were responding to reports of a man wielding a gun, but later determined that the object Vassell had allegedly pointed at them was “a pipe with some sort of knob on the end of it.”

Standing on the corner where her son, who had bipolar disorder, had been killed the day before, Vassell’s mother, Lorna, gave an emotional address to the crowd.

“He did not deserve [for] a piece of iron in his hand for a cop to kill him,” she said, adding that her son came from a good family and was well loved by all who knew him. “It’s unjustified, and I want justice. They murdered my son, and I want justice for him.”

At the rally for Vassell, Women’s March leader and activist Linda Sarsour, who is from Brooklyn, called for the officers who shot Vassell to go to jail.

Another unidentified speaker at the rally demanded an investigation into the killing.

“They’re shooting us like birds, and it needs to stop,” he said. “People have to be held responsible for this. We need to check these police officers and lock them up.”

On Thursday, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said it was opening an investigation into Vassell’s death.

Mourners at the rally in Brooklyn chanted the now-familiar slogans against the repeated police killings of black people.

“No justice, no peace,” activists cried out. “Say his name!”

“Saheed!” the crowd yelled back.“I had to change my dress last minute and it looked like my nipples were hard,” she wrote in the post.

“I had full blown laryngitis and had to sing, and a bunch of corny haters were getting lots of attention from the media for being haters beauty know what? It was still the best.”Congratulations are in order for Kate Hudson!

The 38-year-old actress is expecting her third child ― a girl ― with boyfriend Danny Fujikawa. She announced the news on Instagram Friday.

“SURPRISE!!! If you’ve wondered why I’ve been so absent on my social channels it’s because I have never been more sick! It’s was the most sick first trimester of all my children,” Hudson wrote on Friday. “If you’ve seen me out and about smiling and pretending like everything is amazing ... I was lying!”

The actress added that she is feeling better and explained why she’s kept her pregnancy a secret until now.

“We have been trying to keep this pregnancy under the radar for as long as possible but I’m a poppin now!” the actress said in the Instagram caption. “And it’s too darn challenging to hide, and frankly hiding is more exhausting then just coming out with it! My kids, Danny, myself and the entire family are crazy excited! A little girl on the way.”

Hudson posted a cute video revealing the sex of her third child. After she, Fujikawa and her two sons — Ryder, 14, and Bingham, 6 — pop balloons that reveal pink confetti, Hudson beings jumping up and down with joy.

Hudson and Fujikawa, a musician, were first linked together in March 2017 and later made their official red carpet debut in May of that year.

The actress said in an Instagram post celebrating their anniversary that the two have known each other for about 15 years.

Ortega via Getty ImagesWhile polling has shown that views on the football players’ effort are deeply polarized, most Americans surveyed last fall said they believed the athletes were protesting police violence, not the American flag.

“I’m proud to be in a league that understands patriotism in America is about free speech,” Kerr said. “It’s about peacefully protesting. I think our leaders in the NBA understand that when an NFL player is kneeling, they were kneeling to protest police brutality, to protest racial inequality. They weren’t disrespecting the flag or the military, but our president decided to make it about that and the NFL followed suit and pandered to their fan base by creating this hysteria.”

Of course, the NBA is not without fault. As Deadspin points out, the NBA has long had a similar rule requiring players to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner.” In 1996, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, a guard for the Denver Nuggets, refused to stand for the national anthem before games, citing his Muslim faith. For his actions, the league suspended him indefinitely.

As Deadspin also points out, if the NBA were truly a “league that understands patriotism,” perhaps they would not have sent a memo to teams at the start of the season asking players not to protest during the national anthem.“I think it’s good that I’m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,” Caitlyn Jenner said of her conservative politics. Danny Moloshok/Reuters

Caitlyn Jenner may have been an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump since the early days of the 2016 election, but that doesn’t mean she’s thrilled with the way things have been going since then.

In a Broadly profile published Tuesday, the transgender icon and former Olympian discussed her conservative politics and said Trump “has been, for all LGBT issues, the worst president we have ever had.” She also suggested she may not support his 2020 re-election campaign.

“I want him to know politically I am disappointed, obviously,” Jenner said, pointing specifically to Trump’s rolling back of trans rights. “I don’t want our community to go backwards. Just leave us alone, that’s all we want.”

Jenner’s Republican views have, of course, put her at odds with other LGBTQ people for some time. She’s met with U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and says she believes the LGBTQ community stands to benefit from her decision to maintain a strong relationship with members of Trump’s Cabinet.

“I think it’s good that I’m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,” Jenner said.

“The Republicans need the most work when it comes to our issues, I get that,” she added. “I would rather work from the inside. I’m not the type of person who is going to stand on a street corner with a sign and jump up and down. No, I’m going to go have dinner with these people.”

Jenner said she’s also had “a great conversation” with Vice President Mike Pence, who has an established history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation.

“He’s kinda like, from our standpoint, the real enemy. But that’s OK, I can handle that,” Jenner said. The vice president told her he “would love” to have a lengthier discussion down the line, she said.

In the nearly year and a half since Trump’s inauguration, Jenner has appeared critical of the administration’s policies in interviews and on social media.

She told Newsweek in March that she’d “built some very nice and good relationships with the Republican Party” but had not spoken with Trump himself.The ladies of Twitter never fail to brighten our days with their brilliant ― but succinct ― wisdom.

A woman who accused a former Mormon leader of rape filed a civil lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Wednesday, claiming the church did not properly respond when she reported the abuse decades ago.

McKenna Denson, 55, says she was raped in 1984 by Joseph L. Bishop, the former president of a Mormon missionary training center (MTC) in Provo, Utah. Denson said she told local Mormon leaders about the assault numerous times over the years, but that the church failed to take action against the leader.

Instead, she says, Bishop was allowed to continue holding leadership positions that placed him in charge of hundreds of Mormon youth.

Denson said that after trying to seek justice through the church for three decades, she’s “absolutely prepared” to fight it in court.

“I’m ready for this,” Denson said Thursday during a press conference in Salt Lake City. “I’ve been ready. I think what makes me feel even more confident [is], I’m right. It happened. I was raped at the MTC. The church covered it up, and they still promoted him to higher and higher positions of the church.”

Bishop, who is now 85 years old, denies the rape allegations. In an interview with police last year, he admitted that he had taken Denson to a small “preparation room” at the center and “asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.”

Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told HuffPost in an email that the church is confident that the legal system will ensure a just result in this case.

“Our hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the Church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found,” Hawkins wrote. “As this is now an active legal matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.”

In a previous statement, the church claimed that it did not impose formal discipline on Bishop because it was unable to verify the allegations against him. The church said it is investigating the alleged rape again and would take action against Bishop if it found the claims to be true.

Denson’s lawsuit names Bishop and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as defendants, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Denson’s lawyer, Craig Vernon, said his client is seeking to hold Bishop accountable and that he hopes the lawsuit will also reveal systematic problems the church’s handling of abuse allegations.

On March 26, the church updated its guidelines on abuse prevention. The guidelines instruct church leaders to call a church helpline when they learn of possible abuse cases. The helpline reportedly connects the leaders to “legal and clinical professionals” who provide instructions on how to assist victims and comply with local requirements about reporting abuse. Vernon said he wants the church to consider telling its leaders to take complaints directly to local authorities. “We want the church to consider whether it makes sense to instruct [leaders], if you find out about one of these crimes ... don’t call the helpline, call the police,” he said during Thursday’s press conference.

Denson also brought up the church’s longheld practice of allowing local leaders, known as bishops, to conduct one-on-one “worthiness” interviews with young children. Some parents have complained that bishops are able to ask children invasive questions about their sexuality during these interviews.

The interviews have recently become a controversial subject in the Mormon church. Last week, about 1,000 people marched to the church’s headquarters to demand an end to the practice and make it a requirement for a parent or guardian to sit in on the interviews. The church’s updated abuse guidelines make this an option, not a requirement.

In response to a petition from concerned Mormon parents, Hawkins, the church spokesman, issued a statement last December defending bishops’ interviews as an important part of the church’s ministry.

Denson said Bishop was able to groom her for abuse because she had already gotten used to the idea that it was OK to be alone in a room with an older man who asked her sexually explicit questions. She said the movement to change the church’s policies on bishop’s interviews was “absolutely vital” to her.Fighter Conor McGregor didn’t need to be in the octagon to go on a rampage in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday.

The UFC star was charged with assault and criminal mischief after he threw a hand dolly through the window of a bus transporting other fighters, police told HuffPost.

The incident was caught on video:

Two competitors, Michael Chiesa and Ray Borg, suffered facial or eye injuries that will keep them out of Saturday’s pay-per-view event at Barclays Center in the New York City borough, the UFC said.

The organization said it withdrew another competitor from the schedule, McGregor teammate Artem Lobov, because of his alleged participation in the mayhem, forcing the cancelation of the event’s third bout.

Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway were supposed to fight for McGregor’s title on Saturday but that bout was canceled as well after doctors declared Holloway “unfit to fight.”

McGregor and his entourage reportedly set upon the bus with Nurmagomedov inside.

“Conor went bananas and put a beating on the van that we were in looking for Khabib,” Rick Little, a coach of one of the injured fighters, told MMA Junkie. “A million security guards had to restrain him.”

AdvertisementFormer Mexican President Vicente Fox has warned American farmers that they will be the ones to suffer if a trade war breaks out between the U.S. and Mexico.

On Friday’s “Morning Joe,” Fox explained how U.S. agriculture would be hurt if President Donald Trump follows through on his repeated threats to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

“Watch out,” said Fox, addressing the camera directly. “Mexico buys from you every year over $40 billion worth of corn, and now we went down south to buy that corn from Argentina, from Brazil.”

“You better speak up, because this guy is taking you to nowhere,” Fox added. “And you consumers, this trade war, you’re going to pay the price for it. You U.S. American citizen-consumers, you are going to pay the price.”President Donald Trump has doubled down on his support for Scott Pruitt, resisting mounting pressure week to fire the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency.

In a series of tweets over two days, he signaled strong support for Pruitt, whom he said was “under siege.” On Friday, the president blamed the reporters who this week broke a series of stories detailing Pruitt’s living arrangements, spending and management of the agency, intensifying accusations of corruption and government waste.

Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 6, 2018

On Saturday, the president defended Pruitt’s seven-figure spending on security, insisting ― as Fox News reported ― that the administrator faced death threats, and saying, incorrectly, that Pruitt’s $50-a-night room in a luxury Capitol Hill condo was “about market rate.”

While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018

The second tweet came a day after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times published reports detailing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s efforts over the past two weeks to convince Trump to fire Pruitt over the ongoing scandals. But, at a White House briefing that afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted that “no one other than the president has the authority to hire and fire members of his Cabinet.”

“Right now I don’t have any personnel announcement,” she added.

At least three Republican House members joined Democrats and environmental groups this week to demand Pruitt’s ouster amid a firestorm over his sweetheart deal to rent a room in a luxury townhouse linked to a lobbyist whose clients had business before the EPA. The EPA ethics office retroactively approved the arrangement, but struggled to defend the administrator as new details rapidly emerged.

Criticism of Pruitt intensified after reports published Thursday accused the administrator of trying to abuse his vehicle’s emergency sirens to cut through traffic and of reassigning, demoting or forcing out EPA officials who challenged his “unusually large spending.” Other reports this week accused Pruitt of using a loophole in the Safe Drinking Water Act to give two political appointees raises after the White House rejected his original request. Pruitt denied the reports in a blistering Fox News interview.

The latest scandals follow months of scrutiny into the cost of Pruitt’s first-class travel. He routinely spent more than $2,000 on flights to his home state of Oklahoma, and to interviews and events in New York City.

But Pruitt’s conservative allies mounted a vigorous defense. On Wednesday, Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at the right-wing Federalist, called Pruitt “Trump’s biggest asset” in a column, and warned the president that “ousting him would be a huge victory” for his opponents. On Thursday, FreedomWorks, the libertarian campaign group founded by fossil fuel billionaires Charles and David Koch, launched a dial-in effort, urging supporters to call the White House and champion Pruitt against a “smear campaign” by “the radical left.” On Friday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board advised the president to “show some loyalty to his leading reformer,” calling his decision on the administrator’s future “Trump’s Pruitt Test.”

It helps that, on Monday, Pruitt outlined plans to rollback a landmark Obama-era regulation to limit carbon dioxide emission from vehicle tailpipes. The announcement burnished Pruitt’s reputation as the speartip of Trump’s deregulatory agenda. But, as The New Republic’s Emily Atkin laid out, Pruitt’s effectiveness is overstated. At least 10 of the roughly 30 regulatory rollbacks Pruitt has proposed are on hold due to lawsuits, and several have been overturned in federal court.

Still, his efforts to scale back the United States’ climate change efforts ― he helped convince Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord ― and disqualify huge bodies of research to favor industry-backed studies in crafting regulations have bolstered his favor with Trump. That may be why the president is averse to forcing Pruitt out.

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last September just one week into a scandal over his costly use of chartered flights. But Price lost Trump’s favor months earlier, with the failure of his campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Pruitt also benefits from Republican control of both houses of Congress. Anne Gorsuch Burford, the last EPA administrator to resign in disgrace, faced fierce criticism during her time as President Ronald Reagan’s first head of the agency. Like Pruitt, she contracted the agency’s budget to historic lows and drastically eliminated environmental regulations with an ideological fervor. But she only stepped down in 1983 because the Democratically controlled House cited her for contempt of Congress for refusing to turn Superfund records over to a subcommittee.

To Liz Purchia, who served as the EPA’s communications director under President Barack Obama, the White House’s doubling down of support for Pruitt echoes Trump’s repeated endorsement of former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. The president continued to back the former judge’s campaign last year for the Heart of Dixie’s open Senate seat amid a deluge of reports detailing Moore’s history of sexual predation of teenage girls. Trump’s support for Moore divided Republicans, though the president quickly distanced himself after Democrat Doug Jones eked out a victory in the special election.

“Like with Roy Moore, despite the overwhelming calls for Trump to disown and condemn Pruitt’s actions, he’s doubling down,” Purchia told HuffPost. “Ethics or moral scandals aren’t an issue for Trump. He’ll only act if the constant drip of negative headlines continue for Pruitt like we saw with Roy Moore.”
