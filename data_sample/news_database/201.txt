Warning! “Avengers: Infinity War” spoilers!

There was one “Infinity War” death so shocking a Marvel executive tried to stop it, but if we’re talking about the demise that was nothing but feels, that goes to our friendly neighborhood hella dead Spider-Man.

At the end of the new “Avengers” film, Thanos (Josh Brolin) snaps his Infinity Gauntlet–clad finger and causes many of the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters to crumble to dust instantaneously. Spider-Man, however, receives an extended final moment, allowing Tom Holland to deliver a tear-jerking and mostly improvised death scene.

“I don’t feel so good. I don’t know what’s happening,” he says after Thanos’ snap. “I don’t want to go. I don’t want to go, Mr. Stark, please,” he mumbles, embracing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) as he melts away to nothing.

So why did Spidey get so much time to deliver a heartbreaking monologue, while his compatriots died on the spot?

In an interview with HuffPost, directors Joe and Anthony Russo confirmed the reason: It was due to his Spidey sense, his ability to perceive danger before it hits.

“That’s correct,” Joe Russo said after I asked if Peter Parker’s Spidey sense was behind the early warning. “He was aware of something.”

Though it’s a mainstay power of the character in the Marvel comics, Spidey sense wasn’t established in the previous Spider-Man solo film “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” In fact, it was big news among fans when “Infinity War” showed Peter had Spidey sense in his repertoire in the trailers for the film.

Now we know why.

It all led to Holland’s delivering the most emotional scene of the movie, inspiring memes everywhere:

But the Spidey sense inquiry was far from the only question I had in the wake of watching and rewatching “Infinity War.” Since I had the Russo brothers on the phone, I posed a few more questions for the directors to clear up:

Why is Gamora?

A post shared by Peter Parker 🔴🕷🔵 (@spidey.marvel) on May 19, 2018 at 6:05pm PDT

It’s the question on everyone’s minds.

In “Infinity War,” the Guardians of the Galaxy crew initially assumes that the Avengers are working with Thanos and thus have custody of Star-Lord’s boo, Gamora (Zoe Saldana).

So when Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) meets the Avengers, he asks Iron Man, “Where is Gamora?” Iron Man responds, “I’ll do you one better: Who is Gamora?” Drax (Dave Bautista) follows that up with the nonsensical but earnest, “I’ll do you one better: Why is Gamora?”

Really, though: Why is Gamora?

When I asked Joe Russo about the line and whether he has pondered an answer to it, he got a little philosophical. “Why do you think is Gamora?” he asked me, inscrutably. “I don’t know if there is an answer in Drax’s twisted brain.”

Anthony Russo said, “No, sometimes [you] just wonder, has he made a connection there?”

“Remember, this is a man who thinks he can stand so incredibly still that he’s invisible,” Joe Russo said.

What was the secret behind Captain America’s phone number?

A gag in “Infinity War” is that Tony Stark has the number for Captain America (Chris Evans) on a flip phone if he’s needed. The movie prominently shows Cap’s number (678-136-7092) on screen.

The Marvel movies are known for Easter eggs, and this had all the markings of one. But if you were one of the many people who called the number after seeing the film, you know the number doesn’t work and appears to be random. So what’s the point?

“We actually had intended to create a fake voicemail from Steve Rogers,” Joe Russo said. “For the people that left the theater and called that number, they would get a voicemail from Steve Rogers.”

“And that number was the actual number that we were going to use. We were sort of given that number,” said Anthony Russo.

Sadly, the movie’s affiliated legal department got in the way.

“We had it all ready to go, but legal took that away from us,” he added.

Can Groot regenerate from the handle of Stormbreaker?

The end of the first “Guardians of the Galaxy” gave us a new Groot (Vin Diesel), showing us that the treelike creature can regenerate after pretty severe injuries. So given that Groot spared some of his body to create the handle of Thor’s new Stormbreaker weapon, some people have been wondering: Can that handle eventually turn into a new Groot?

Joe Russo left it up in the air.

“I don’t know if every piece of him that detaches ... can grow a future version of him, but who’s to say? That’s an interesting question.”

Was “dad” really Groot’s last word in the script?

Before Groot disappears at the snap of Thanos’ finger, he lets out one last “Groot” to Rocket (Bradley Cooper). “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn said the last word translates to “dad.” Was that word actually in the script?

“It was, and it was ‘dad,’” said Anthony Russo.

Why did everyone’s clothes disappear too?

When peeps start disappearing in “Infinity War,” so do their clothes. But clothes don’t die. Clothes are forever, until you shrink them in the laundry. That’s how it works for me. So what’s going on here?

Joe Russo explained that the clothes disappear because they are “part of their identity.”

“Whatever was elemental to somebody’s presence went with them,” Anthony Russo said.

Should people blame Star-Lord?

The Avengers devise a plan to get the Infinity Gauntlet off Thanos’ hand by slipping it off after Mantis (Pom Klementieff) incapacitates him with her empathy/mind-controlling capabilities. It almost works, but Star-Lord ruins everything by punching Thanos in the face after he learns Gamora is dead.

Thanos gets out of Mantis’ grasp, and the destruction of half the life in the universe ensues.

Star-Lord has been getting a lot of hate since the movie was released. Does he deserve it?

The directors said no.

“His mother was dying of cancer when he was kidnapped by pirates at the age of 10. He was raised by pirates. He had to murder his father to avenge the death of his mother. His girlfriend, who he was in love with, was murdered by another corrupt paternal figure ... He made a very emotional choice,” said Joe Russo.

Anthony Russo reiterated that the shock of Gamora’s death just lets Star-Lord’s emotions get the better of him, adding that Thor also makes this mistake.

“Thor also let his emotions get the better of him. Thor could’ve killed Thanos more quickly than he tried to with the ax. He showed up, and he took a moment — because of his anger, because of his motivation — to tell Thanos that he told him he would die ... and finish him off in a very deliberate way. Thor sort of got lost in his emotions in a similar way as Star-Lord and could also have been responsible for Thanos.”

According to Joe Russo, the mistakes the characters make are all about relatability.

“They make very human choices. I think if we learn anything from narrative is to put yourself inside the POV of someone — or the character itself — you should be able to empathize with that character, understand the choices that they make,” he said.

Was the movie inspired by “The Leftovers”?

It doesn’t take a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist to see the connections between HBO’s “The Leftovers” and “Infinity War.”

Not only do the projects both involve a bunch of people vanishing to some unknown fate, but they both also star actress Carrie Coon, who plays Nora in “The Leftovers” and Proxima Midnight in “Infinity War.”

Is there any inspiration?

Joe Russo said Coon was in the project just because “she’s one of the best actresses working today.” It had nothing to do with a “Leftovers” connection.

He also said he believes “The Leftovers” might have been inspired by the Marvel comic writer Jim Starlin’s ‘Infinity Gauntlet’ story (a source for “Infinity War”) “in the first place.”

“It’s just a cyclical loop there. But we’re just drawing from the original source material,” said Joe Russo.

Did Drax really disappear, or is he just standing still?

Drax disappeared along with half the other heroes at the end of the movie, but as the directors mentioned, he believes he possesses the ability to stand so still, he becomes invisible.

Did he really disappear? Or was he just standing reallllly still?

“That’s a spoiler,” joked Joe Russo.

“That’s to be decided,” Anthony Russo said, laughing. “All we know is what we can gather from the film. Anything more than that can potentially be addressed down the line.”

It seems there’s a chance we may see Drax again, after all. You know, if he ever moves.Serena Williams’ father texted her about an hour before her wedding and told her he couldn’t walk her down the aisle, the tennis star revealed in Wednesday’s episode of the HBO docuseries “Being Serena.”

“He was in New Orleans, he had a suit, and I know he was really excited,” Williams said in the third episode of the series, per Vogue. “But then he wrote me and said, ‘Serena, I don’t want you to be mad at me, but I just can’t walk you down the aisle. I’m not myself anymore. I’m just too nervous.’”

A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Nov 17, 2017 at 5:27pm PST

Williams said she knew the pressure of the crowd would be a lot for her father, Richard Williams, to handle.

“‘Daddy, it’s OK, if you don’t want to come to the wedding at all, that’s OK, too. I’m not going to be upset with you about it, so I don’t want you to be upset about it,’” Williams recalled telling him.

She said she didn’t get stressed about the last-minute change of plans because she understood her father in a way others don’t.

“Maybe a lot of daughters wouldn’t react the same way, but I know the struggles he’s had these last few years,” she said. “His health is better now, but I know he still doesn’t feel like himself, doesn’t feel like he’s perfect.”

“Look, when we first came on the scene, there were a lot of people who didn’t get him,” she added. “I don’t think a lot of them wanted to get him. I don’t think a lot of him could have anyway. Our family knows what we have. We just want each other to be happy. That’s what matters. I don’t think anything could ever change that.”

The episode about Williams’ conversation with her dad aired during a very public debate over whether Meghan Markle’s estranged father would attend her wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday. After much back-and-forth, Kensington Palace released a statement Thursday saying he wouldn’t be there.

“Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,” Markle said in the statement. “I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.”

AdvertisementGOP lawmakers have retaliated against Delta Air Lines for recently ending its discount for National Rifle Association members, but it turns out not many people even used the deal in the first place.

Only 13 tickets were sold under the deal, which provided a discount for NRA members traveling to the group’s annual convention in May, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday. A representative for the airline confirmed to HuffPost that the number was accurate, and said the deal was “a one-time group discount for this year’s convention.”

Delta announced it was ending the discount last month, after a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people and injured dozens more. Amid a wave of outcry led by student survivors of the shooting, Delta was one of several companies that cut ties with the NRA, which advocates against increased gun control.

This week, Georgia lawmakers punished Delta for dropping the deal. On Thursday, the state’s House and Senate passed a tax bill amended to remove a sales tax exemption for jet fuel. Since Delta is based in Atlanta, it would have benefited from the exemption.

Days before the vote, Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle (R) had accused the airline of “attacking conservatives,” tweeting that he would “kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA.”

I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back. — Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018

In a statement sent to Delta employees and obtained by HuffPost, CEO Ed Bastian said the company’s intent in ending the discount was to “remain neutral” in the debate over gun access and public safety. Bastian said the discount could have been seen as Delta endorsing the NRA, and the goal was to end that perception.

So for Friday’s broadcast of “The Late Show,” the comedian visited Washington, D.C., to see if he could tease any new information out of congressmen.

With a fake memo of his own in hand, Colbert attempted to persuade Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) to leak new developments to him regarding the Trump-Russia probe.

“Just say anything. Give me a hint, anything,” Colbert at one point pleaded with Warner.

As France’s presidential election campaign drew to a close in the spring of last year, the country faced a shocking new political reality. Established parties on the right and left had collapsed, independent centrist Emmanuel Macron beat far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the race for the presidency and more than 10 million people had voted for Le Pen’s formerly taboo anti-Islam, anti-immigrant views.

Nine months later, however, Le Pen and her National Front party are weathering a turbulent period of reckoning. Le Pen came under fire for a disastrous campaign performance. The party failed to take advantage of the new glut of voters willing to back radical parties. It underperformed in parliamentary elections, and prominent members quit. The months of fighting prevented it from taking a lead role in opposing Macron’s policies, even though a pro-European Union former banker from an elite intellectual background is practically its ideal target.

Now the National Front is trying to start fresh. It will hold a “refoundation congress” on March 10 and 11 where Le Pen is expected to present a new name for the party and a vision for its future. But while the party prepares a new veneer, it’s also grappling with its past demons and a persistent inability to get its house in order.

A Refoundation, Not A Revolution

The refoundation congress won’t produce a bold new direction or a dramatic mea culpa for the party’s past, according to Cécile Alduy, an expert on French politics at Stanford University. Instead, Alduy says that the congress will be a mix of cosmetic changes to the party with a reaffirmation of its belief system.

“We are not renouncing anything. We are starting a new chapter in our history,” Le Pen told a French broadcaster in February.

The intent will be to show unity and to spin that the National Front has its best years ahead, but the party requires deeper soul-searching than a name change if it wants to become more than an opposition party.

Family Drama

Perhaps the most embarrassing threat to Le Pen’s efforts to present a clean new image comes from her father, the National Front’s 89-year-old founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen.

The elder Le Pen is a source of both national fascination and disgrace. French courts repeatedly fined him for dismissing the Holocaust, and in his bestselling memoir released last month he defends the leader of the country’s Nazi-collaborating Vichy government.

Marine Le Pen has spent years trying to fully remove her father from the party, but Jean-Marie Le Pen took legal action to cling to his title of “honorary president.”

He recently denounced his daughter’s plans to rename the party as “suicidal” and vowed to crash the congress despite being barred from attending.

Adding to the Le Pen drama is Marine’s 27-year-old niece, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen. A popular figure for the party’s support base in the South of France, she seemed poised to take a leading role in the party but instead abruptly quit following the election.

Maréchal-Le Pen is now trying to grow her fame outside of the party. In February, she gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C., declaring that France is shifting “from the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church to the little niece of Islam.”

The Party’s No. 2 Quits

Le Pen’s former top strategist Florian Philippot, a mainstay of French media, will also be absent at the congress.

Philippot helped successfully cultivate the National Front’s youth wing, which is central to the party’s strategy to bring in fresh, more educated voices to replenish its membership. As an openly gay man in his mid-30s from an elite education background, he represented a different image for the party and sought to attract a wider range of voters.

But Philippot was also the face of the party’s extreme anti-EU stance, vowing to return France to its own currency. His hard-line position didn’t play well with voters and led to heated party infighting.

Philippot left the National Front last September after Le Pen effectively demoted him to “vice president in charge of nothing,” he told French media. After resigning, he accused the front of backsliding toward the ways of its past. In February, Philippot launched his own party, The Patriots.

The long-term effects of his departure remain to be seen. It’s possible Philippot’s departure will result in young or more liberal-minded supporters shifting their allegiance from the party, according to Dorit Geva, an expert on the National Front at Central European University.

The Front is betting that a watered-down anti-EU stance will help return the party to its core values ― its ethno-nationalist appeals and opposition to immigration ― and dominate the political conversation by forcing other parties to respond to its radical views. It also allows the party to avoid tricky debates over how France could leave the eurozone without causing economic disaster, a plan it failed to assure voters of during the election campaign.

Ideology Over Experience

“The main challenge is that the party should become far more professional,” said Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst and author on the European far-right.

The National Front is 45 years old and receives sizable funding from European parliament, it also has hundreds of representatives in regional councils and runs several towns. But despite its entrenched role in French politics and decades of experience, Camus says the party still runs ramshackle campaigns and lacks trustworthy leaders.

In recent years, the party generally selected ideological outsider candidates for local elections who could present an anti-establishment image, Geva says.

As their lack of experience and political knowledge caught up with their grandiose promises, these candidates tended to perform poorly if elected. Other times Front officials barely got a taste of the spotlight before being forced to resign over misconduct.

A Wider Fracturing In France

Not everything in the National Front’s future is firmly within its control. The rise of populist parties such as the Front is in part a symptom of once-powerful parties across the political spectrum losing their traditional support base, most notably the traditional left that was popular with the working class.

“Populists are the most spectacular and perhaps the most obviously dangerous manifestation of contemporary political instability, but they’re really just one part of it,” said Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College in New York City.

If established parties can’t convincingly promise to fix economic inequalities, guarantee growth and provide some vision of national identity without contaminating it with racism and xenophobia, Berman says, populist parties will rush in to fill that void.

The Le Pen Problem

Even if the National Front manages to reposition itself as the primary opposition to Macron, experts say that one of the remaining barriers to transforming into a truly mainstream party is the presence of Marine Le Pen herself.

Le Pen has molded the National Front around her leadership, making her identity synonymous with the party. And while she has been relatively successful in “de-demonizing” the party and presenting a more palatable public persona than her father, the reality is that she remains extremely unpopular with the majority of French voters.

In key moments of the election campaign, such as a televised head-to-head debate with Macron, Le Pen appeared notoriously unpresidential and lacked the ability to articulate the details of her platform.

“The National Front will never be able to fully rebrand themselves until they lose the party name, but also the name of the person leading them,” said Duncan McDonnell, an expert on populism and a professor at Griffith University in Australia.A former producer at E! has filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying she was unfairly terminated because she allowed a clip of a celebrity being critical of the network to air during its Golden Globes red-carpet show in January.

The producer, Aileen Gram-Moreno, told The New York Times that the network asked her to flag celebrity interviews during the event, keeping an eye out specifically for celebrities who mentioned former E! host Catt Sadler.

After Gram-Moreno mistakenly let an interview with Eva Longoria slip through in which Longoria did exactly that, she said, she was fired and was replaced by a man.

“They said, if there’s any mention of [Sadler] in the pre-show, make sure you flag it,” she told the Times, recalling her instructions. “You’re censoring celebrities; it’s just not a good idea in my humble opinion. But it wasn’t my decision.”

Sadler very publicly split with the network in December after she said she learned her male co-host “made close to double my salary for the past several years,” yet she had been denied a pay raise.

Here’s the interview with Longoria that Gram-Moreno says led to her termination:

A source with knowledge of the network’s workflow questioned Gram-Moreno’s account Friday, telling HuffPost that people in her position are typically asked to flag all of the content of celebrity interviews as they come in so the network can prioritize what to air, screen for profanities and the like.

As evidence that the network was likely not explicitly screening mentions of Sadler, the source, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, noted numerous other celebrities also mentioned Sadler on air, including Debra Messing:

An E! spokesperson told HuffPost that Gram-Moreno worked as a freelancer for less than a month each year and was fired for poor job performance.

“For the past decade Aileen Gram Moreno was a freelancer who worked an average of 20 days per year solely for our red carpet coverage,” the spokesperson said. “After the Golden Globes she was asked not to return due to job performance issues. Following an attempt to force E! to pay for her silence Ms. Moreno is now spreading misleading and inaccurate information.”

However, Gram-Moreno’s attorney, Katherine Atkinson, said E! never questioned her work.

“In the 12 years Aileen has been working on red carpet shows for E! they never once raised a performance issue,” Atkinson said in a statement. “That is a convenient excuse for covering up attempts to silence women speaking out. Employers often attack women speaking out about discrimination ― so I am disappointed in E! but not surprised.

“E! can’t have it both ways. They support their position that they were not censoring references to Catt Sadler by pointing to the Eva Longoria interview. But they fired my client for failing to censor that very interview. If you attempt to censor, and then fire the person for not catching the speech you intended to censor for letting it go through, you can’t then claim that you aren’t so bad after all because you ‘let’ it air. Their argument defies logic.”

The EEOC complaint comes against a backdrop of sexual harassment and abuse allegations against TV personality Ryan Seacrest, who will be working the red carpet for E! before the Oscars on Sunday.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that the interview with Debra Messing was the one that led to Gram-Moreno’s dismissal. The interview she cited in her complaint was the one with Eva Longoria.Mike Huckabee resigned Thursday from the board of the Country Music Association Foundation after artists, fans and a number of industry honchos spoke out against the former Republican presidential hopeful’s appointment.

“If the industry doesn’t want people of faith or who hold conservative and traditional political views to buy tickets and music, they should be forthcoming and say it,” Huckabee wrote in his resignation letter, which came just one day after he was announced as the CMA Foundation’s newest member. “Until recently, the arts was the one place America could set aside political, geographical, racial, religious, and economic barriers and come together ... At the end of the day, I’m not worth the fight, but the kids are.” The letter was published in Nashville’s The Tennessean.

Although CMA Foundation Chairman Joe Galante had touted Huckabee’s “policy experience with education reform” when announcing the former Arkansas governor’s appointment to the board Wednesday, the news immediately set off a firestorm of criticism. A number of music industry officials, including Jason Owen of Monument Records and Sandbox Management, pointed to Huckabee’s opposition to LGBTQ rights when expressing their dissent.

“Huckabee speaks of the sort of things that would suggest my family is morally beneath his and uses language that has a profoundly negative impact upon young people all across this country,” wrote the openly gay executive, whose Sandbox roster includes Faith Hill and Little Big Town. “What a shameful choice.”

Another industry veteran, who asked not to be identified, felt similarly. “I couldn’t help but see him standing with his arms locked in the air with that Kim Davis woman in Kentucky,” the source told Variety, referring to the county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2015. “That is not a favorable memory in my mind.”

Huckabee appeared to address those criticisms in his Thursday letter.

“All of us have deep passions about our beliefs. I do about mine,” he wrote. “But I hate no one.”

Among those to respond favorably to Huckabee’s resignation was Chely Wright, who came out as a lesbian in 2010. On Friday, the singer-songwriter posted an open letter to Huckabee to her Facebook and Twitter accounts, telling him to “stop using students and country music fans as pawns to validate your bigotry toward LGBTQ people and our incredible straight allies.”

“Pitting people of faith against the equality movement is a fool’s errand,” Wright wrote. She went on to note that she was “heartened by the changes that are happening in Nashville and in our country music community at large when it comes to people speaking out in support of the LGBTQ community.”

Los Angeles-based country artist Brandon Stansell, who has never shied away from exploring queer themes in his music and performances, echoed those sentiments on Twitter this week.

Oh deer.

A judge running for the Texas House of Representatives has a lot of support from deer breeders, who are donating animal semen to the cause.

Ana Lisa Garza, a Democratic district court judge in Starr County, is challenging Democratic incumbent Ryan Guillen for the District 31 seat. She’s received about $87,500 in donations since the campaign began.

But only $36,500 of those donations were monetary. The other $51,000 came in the form of deer semen straws from the state’s deer breeders, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Each straw contains an estimated $1,000 worth of deer semen and is named after its donor, according to the Houston Chronicle. The sperm donors who gave to Garza include Mabo Thicket, Tack Hammer and Strike Force.

Fred Gonzalez, the treasurer of the Texas Deer Association, told the Dallas Morning News that breeders often donate semen straws rather than money.

“Semen is a very common way for us to donate,” he said. “One collection on a buck could lead to 60 straws sometimes. If you have a desirable animal, it’s a way to bring value without breaking the bank.”

The straws will be sold at auction with the money going to Garza’s campaign.The Colorado House expelled one of its members over sexual harassment accusations on Friday in a vote so fraught that two representatives said they wore bulletproof vests.

It was the first time in over a century that the state’s House of Representatives has expelled a member.

Former Democratic state Rep. Steve Lebsock, who switched to the Republican Party an hour before the decision, was expelled in a 52-9 vote, The Denver Post reported. Three women, including a member of the state House, have accused Lebsock of sexual harassment and filed formal complaints against him, but he also faces anonymous allegations.

Before the vote, two state lawmakers revealed that they were wearing bulletproof vests to protect themselves from Lebsock.

Lebsock “threatened to ‘take me down,’” said state Rep. Alec Garnett (D), assistant state House majority leader.

“I fear for retaliation. I am in the chamber of the House of Representatives, and I’m wearing a bulletproof vest because I fear retaliation for telling the truth and standing up for victims of sexual harassment,” Garnett added. “I’ve been wearing it for three weeks.”

State Rep. Matt Gray (D) also said he was wearing a bulletproof vest.

State Rep. Faith Winter (D), one of the women accusing Lebsock of harassment, first contacted Garnett for help in 2016, he said. She accused Lebsock of using explicit and suggestive language in a sexual proposition, and said he became angry when she turned him down, according to The Denver Post.

An emotional Lebsock pleaded not to be expelled before the vote. He also said he would have protected members, not harmed them.

“I am an honorably discharged Marine Corps veteran,” he said tearfully. “And if someone walked in here — members, you would have had me here to protect you. Even the ones that don’t like me. I’m just hoping you know that.”

State House Speaker Crisanta Duran (D) had informed the Colorado State Patrol, which provides security for the House, that there could be trouble, The Denver Post reported.(Reuters) - They made up a corps of bomb-sniffing dogs that accompanied brigade combat teams on potentially lethal missions, sniffing out roadside bombs in Afghanistan and saving human lives.

In return for their combat service, the U.S. Army mistreated these canine heroes when they were discharged from the military, the Defense Department’s Inspector General’s Office said in a report issued on March 1.

An investigation was started after soldiers who had handled the dogs complained about the fate of their four-legged saviors.

Army personnel who handled them said that once the dogs returned to the United States, some were left in kennels for up to 11 months, mistreated through lack of care and attention, and others may have been put down, according to the report. No screening was done of people who wanted to adopt the dogs.

Several soldiers searched for and rescued their dogs from Army kennels, the report said.

Army spokesmen did not respond to multiple telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Reuters was unable to reach former soldiers who had issued complaints containing accusations of mistreatment of dogs with which they had worked.

The dogs served in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2014. The report faulted the Army for ignoring multiple Pentagon rules concerning the handling of dogs serving in the military.

“The Army did not use the DOD Working Dog Management system, as required by the Joint Military Working Dog Instruction and Army Regulation 190-12,” the Inspector General said in its report.Three leading progressive organizations launched a petition campaign Friday demanding that the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee “stop attacking progressives.”

The petition, which is directed at DCCC Chairman Rep. Ben Ray Luján (N.M.), is a joint initiative of Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs left-leaning primary candidates; Credo, a liberal, issue-based, online organizing outfit; and Our Revolution, the legacy group for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential run.

“We call on Chairman of the DCCC Ben Ray Luján to stop attacking progressives,” a version of the petition circulated by Justice Democrats states. “Democrats should fight for progressive values and offer a clear contrast to [President Donald] Trump and the Republican Party.”

The groups’ decision to mobilize their formidable email lists to pressure the DCCC, which helps elect Democrats to the House, reflects a frustration that has come to a head in the past two weeks and could jeopardize party unity ahead of midterm elections where Democrats hope to make big gains.

Progressive activists believe the DCCC’s intervention in contentious primaries ― which has largely consisted of promoting moderate candidates and cautious campaign rhetoric ― reflects misguided political strategy and contempt for the Democratic base.

The most notable flashpoint between the DCCC and the liberal grassroots was the DCCC’s Feb. 23 publication of an opposition research dossier against Laura Moser, an anti-Trump activist-turned-progressive candidate running in Texas’ 7th Congressional District. The campaign arm’s memo featured a selectively edited quote from Moser and described her as a “Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress.”

A series of revelations this week, however, served as the more immediate catalyst for the petition effort. HuffPost reported that the DCCC advised candidates to avoid “politicizing” the Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida, shootings in the immediate aftermath of those massacres. The Intercept also broke news that the party body used a questionably worded survey to counsel candidates against embracing single-payer health care, or even proactively volunteering health policy ideas.

Justice Democrats, Credo and Our Revolution, which drafted similar but not identical petitions, all referenced the HuffPost and Intercept stories in their appeals.

“The goal is to call attention to the DCCC and the Democratic Party leadership shooting itself in the foot and missing opportunities of where the party should really be investing in, which is progressive leaders, leaders of color who are gonna help them get back the majority,” said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, which, like Our Revolution, has endorsed Moser’s primary bid. (Credo does not endorse candidates.)

Justice Democrats hope to receive an apology from Luján and a promise not to intervene in Democratic primaries going forward, according to Shahid.

That response does not appear forthcoming. When asked about progressive discontent with the DCCC, communications director Meredith Kelly said the DCCC “has long recognized and appreciated the unprecedented influence that the grassroots have in these races.”

Kelly nonetheless maintained that the campaign arm “is keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there’s a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November.”

The dispute between the DCCC and left-wing groups with millions of active members reflects a broader disagreement between the so-called Democratic “establishment” ― comprising mainstream elected officials, party leaders and donors ― and the restive, progressive base.

With its focus on the best-funded, most moderate and most cautious candidates, the DCCC apparently sees a path to retaking the House through the mostly affluent, moderate Republicans displeased with Trump.

The DCCC arguably deployed this strategy successfully in the 2006 midterms, the last time Democrats flipped the House.

But Shahid and his allies say the 2016 elections proved this tactic is no longer viable. Hillary Clinton’s campaign was predicated on the notion that she could pick up enough moderate Republicans to offset Trump’s gains among blue-collar Democrats.

In the end, the combination of blue-collar white voters’ swing to Trump, and dampened turnout among young people and people of color in key industrial states, cost Clinton the election.UPDATE: May 22, 8:45 a.m. ET — Last week, “Solo: A Star Wars” story writer Jonathan Kasdan confirmed to HuffPost that Donald Glover’s character, Lando Calrissian, is pansexual. Now, Glover is weighing in with an equally pressing question: “How can you not be pansexual in space?”

Although Glover’s co-stars Emilia Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich and Paul Bettany seemed surprised when Entertainment Weekly confronted them with Lando’s pansexuality in a recently taped interview, the Lando actor was all for it, saying:

There’s so many things to have sex with. I mean, serious. I didn’t think that was that weird. Yeah, he’s coming on to everybody. I mean, yeah, whatever. He’s like having like a ’70s swing — yeah. It just didn’t seem that weird to me ’cause I feel like if you’re in space it’s kind of like, the door is open! It’s like, no only guys or girls. No, it’s anything. This thing is literally a blob. Are you a man or a woman? Like, who cares? Have good time out here.

The full interview is set to air on SiriusXM on Thursday.

PREVIOUSLY:

Since the beginning of the “Star Wars” saga, we’ve wondered whether LGBTQ characters exist in George Lucas’ galaxy far, far away.

Up until 2018, there had been little to no queer representation in his decades-old franchise. And then “Solo: A Star Wars Story” happened.

The film centers on a young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich ) and his associates Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). “Solo” gives fans the Millennium Falcon backstory they had been pining for, with plum new defining character details. One of the more notable ones: Lando appears to be pansexual.

Lando’s sexual preferences ― possibly including men, women and droids ― are the subject of more than a few lines of dialogue in “Solo.” For example, the banter between Lando and Han Solo has been interpreted as flirting by some critics who have seen the film before its May 25 release (and many others who’ve watched only the trailers). Even Lando’s droid L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) makes a joke about Calrissian’s teasing dynamic with Han in the film.

Lando to Han: "You might want to buckle up, baby"

Me: *indiscernible homosexual screeching* pic.twitter.com/PyW4CRzlby — MJ Franklin (@heyitsfranklin2) April 9, 2018

Lando might have romantic feelings for his droid too. For the record, L3 would not reciprocate those hypothetical feelings, but as she tells Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke), “it” would “work,” physically speaking.

Of course, these fanatic interpretations are based on subtext. Lando (Billy Dee Williams in Episodes V and VI) has been loaded with sex appeal ever since he brazenly told Leia (Carrie Fisher) she looked “absolutely beautiful” in “The Empire Strikes Back,” but there’s never been an explicit classification of his sexuality in the movies.

So, given the opportunity to speak with father-and-son “Solo” co-writers Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan, I asked them about Lando’s possible sexual fluidity. Is he pansexual?

“I would say yes,” Jonathan Kasdan emphatically said.

“There’s a fluidity to Donald and Billy Dee’s [portrayal of Lando’s] sexuality,” Kasdan continued. “I mean, I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it’s time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity ― sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of.”

“He doesn’t make any hard and fast rules. I think it’s fun,” Kasdan said. “I don’t know where it will go.”

His father was more cryptic about the intentions. When I mentioned the moment in the movie when L3 jokes about Lando’s flirty attitude toward Han, Lawrence Kasdan said, “That is her personality. Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn’t.”

Lawrence Kasdan’s ambiguity is more reflective of the broader “Star Wars” universe, a realm filled with every type of alien being imaginable, yet the rarest of all its life-forms seems to be LGBTQ characters. For the most part, these characters’ storylines have happened only off screen.

Take Vice Adm. Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” who was revealed to be queer in the tie-in novel Leia: Princess of Alderaan. During a conversation between Amilyn and Leia, Amilyn describes a particular turn-on as follows:

“A pair of pretty dark eyes.” Then Amilyn thought about that for a moment. “Or more than a pair, if you’re into Grans. Or Aqualish, or Talz. Or even —” “That’s all right!” Leia said through laughter. “It’s just humanoid males for me.” “Really? That feels so limiting.” “Thank goodness it’s a big galaxy.”

But there are no overt references to Amilyn’s romantic life in the film.

Some fans are rooting for a relationship between Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) — a “Force Awakens” and “Last Jedi” ship lovingly dubbed FinnPoe — but that pairing looks less likely after the most recent movie.

In March, Boyega told HuffPost that his character’s kiss with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) in “The Last Jedi” was essentially the kiss of death for FinnPoe.

“I don’t know if that’s going to happen,” he said, referring to a Finn-Poe romance. “I think we already established a love between Finn and Rey, and now a sneaky kiss from Rose ... There’s too many options, man. But I don’t know,” he said, adding that it’s ultimately up to Episode IX director J.J. Abrams.

Overall, the “Solo” writers said they were conscious of representation when shaping the movie. Jonathan Kasdan pointed out a moment early on in the film, in which they deliberately chose to make the audience question the norms of attraction in our world.

“There’s a line that [Jon Favreau’s character, Rio] has where he’s asking Han about the girl that he left behind, and he says, ‘Does she have big teeth?’” implying that such a feature would be appealing.

“It’s a joke in the movie, but we did want to hit on this idea that people’s ideas of what they’re attracted to all over the galaxy are very, very different and not exactly as set as ours are,” he said.

With so many new “Star Wars” projects on the way in the coming years, there’s hope for a more obvious LGBTQ character in the future. Until then, at least we have Lando.Gabriela Landazuri/HuffPost; Photos: Getty Images

Year after year, the Oscars, aka the Academy Awards, aka the prom of award season, captures the attention of seasoned entertainment junkies. Some tune in to dutifully see who’ll nab the coveted statues for Best Picture and Lead Actress. Others watch simply because there are a bunch of extremely well-dressed, most-likely-hungry, nervous celebrities packed into one theater. Really, anything could happen.

Most of the 2018 winners seem pretty predictable (Hey, Frances McDormand! Congrats, Guillermo del Toro!), so it’s fair to wonder what else will pique viewers’ excitement this year. My best guess: Gaffes, unexpected displays of friendship, appropriate feminist shade and ’shipping fantasies.

In the spirit of predictions, below are a few things to look out for at the 90th Oscars that have absolutely nothing to do with those li’l golden men. Some expected moments are earnest and pure, some are less so. Enjoy.

Sandra Bullock Is Back

For the first time in four years, “Ocean’s 8” star Sandy is making her big return to the Oscar stage as a presenter. Also in attendance will be fellow presenter, and Sandy’s ex from the ’90s, Matthew McConaughey. All right, all right, all right.

Sir Daniel’s Last Time?

Although he’s not predicted to win Lead Actor for “Phantom Thread,” now-retired actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis will most likely sit in the audience with a big smile on his face, sporting an ever-darling earring or two, while clapping for the eventual winner, Gary Oldman. But don’t leave us, Daniel!

HARRY

Unless you’re one of his many adoring fans, you might’ve forgotten that Harry Styles is in an Oscar-nominated film. This means the pop star turned screen legend could be in attendance at the award show, since “Dunkirk” is nominated in multiple categories, including Best Picture. Directioners, ready yourselves.

Margot Robbie And Saoirse Ronan’s Friendship

They may be cutthroat competitors in the Lead Actress category, but they’re also relatively good pals. “I have a major actress crush on her already,” Robbie told HuffPost of Ronan last year. “I think she’s a genius actress and she’s a wicked person, as well.” Keep an eye out for obnoxiously cute BFF moments.

Gary Oldman and Lesley Manville’s Past

Believe it or not, these two Oscar nominees (Oldman’s up for Lead Actor for “Darkest Hour,” Manville is in the Supporting Actress category for “Phantom Thread) are exes. They married in 1987 and had a son together before Oldman, who is facing the resurfacing of a 2001 allegation of spousal abuse, left her and married Uma Thurman in 1990. No word yet on whether or not Thurman will also be in attendance.

Happy Wife, Happy Life

Chelsea Peretti is so excited for her husband, Jordan Peele, that we can’t wait to see her take over for Chrissy Teigen and send out the best-wife live tweets of the evening. Peele’s movie “Get Out” is up for Best Picture, Lead Actor (Daniel Kaluuya), Directing (Peele) and Original Screenplay (Peele). Let’s go!

Tiffany Haddish. Full Stop.

Some say the academy snubbed Haddish by not recognizing her hilariously over-the-top role as Dina in “Girls Trip.” Thankfully, Haddish will be at the Oscars anyway ― to present. Mild suggestion: Get the grapefruit and peach onstage together.

What A Merry Poppin’ Time

Ahead of the release of “Mary Poppins Returns,” stars Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda will both be presenters Sunday night. Will there be a song-and-dance routine? Please?

Wakanda Forever

Both Lupita Nyong’o and Chadwick Boseman will present at the Oscars, but the only thing on “Black Panther” fans’ minds is whether Michael B. Jordan will show up, do some pushups for Lupita and escort her to the ball. ’Shipping at its finest.

Who Will Fill In?

One of the biggest questions going into the award show is: Who will step in for Casey Affleck? The reigning lead actor is skipping the Oscars, most likely in light of the sexual harassment allegations against him and the rising prominence of the Time’s Up movement in Hollywood. But protocol dictates that the Lead Actor winner from the previous year always presents the award for Lead Actress. So, who will the academy choose to fill his shoes?

Sufjan Stevens At Hollywood’s Biggest Night

The indie musician is up for an Oscar for Original Song for “Mystery of Love” from “Call Me By Your Name.” Thing is, he’s pretty anti-attention and rarely gives interviews. He did, however, let Vanity Fair in on a “dirty secret”: “I’ve never watched the Oscars.” He also told The Hollywood Reporter, “I am trying to figure out what to wear to the Oscars. I should go, right? I have to go. How am I 42 and I’ve never worn a tuxedo? I guess I’ll give it a try. If I can meet Mary J. Blige, I will go for that alone.”

Speaking Of Performances...

A big story this award season is the rise of Broadway star Keala Settle and her memorable role as The Bearded Lady in “The Greatest Showman.” The Pasek and Paul song she performs in the movie-musical, “This Is Me,” is up for an Oscar and has become somewhat of an anthem for Time’s Up-era Hollywood. Don’t tune out during her performance.

The Real-Life “Big Sick”

Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, the masterful and married collaborators behind the acclaimed rom-com “The Big Sick,” are up for an Oscar for Original Screenplay. We’ll be eagerly watching as they lovingly embrace, win or lose, but we’re still mad about all those snubs.

Kimmel Roasting Damon?

Considering the particularly bad press Matt Damon’s endured of late (to his own fault), there’s a sure chance his known frenemy and Oscar host Jimmy Kimmel will poke fun at the “Downsizing” actor, who will reportedly not be in the audience this year. In 2017, Kimmel’s whole plan was to insult Damon at the end of the ceremony, but the Warren Beatty-Faye Dunaway Best Picture blunder prevented that from happening.

Speaking Of Bonnie & Clyde...

The academy greenlit a sequel! Beatty and Dunaway will reportedly be back to make up for that messy, now infamous debacle in which they announced “La La Land” as the winner instead of “Moonlight.” According to multiple reports, the pair were spotted rehearsing and are expected to, hopefully, present the correct winner for Best Picture on Sunday night.

Will Ryan Seacrest Get Booted From The Red Carpet?

After allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against him this week, Seacrest and his network E! are under a microscope. Should he still be hosting red carpet coverage? Will celebrities even stop to talk to him? Is this the end of the pre-show as we know it? These questions will likely be answered between 6 and 8 p.m. ET on Sunday.

Tommy Wiseau And Tonya Harding Appearances

I know I said we wouldn’t talk about awards, but hold on: There are a few biopics up for big honors, including “The Disaster Artist” for Adapted Screenplay, “I, Tonya” for Supporting Actress and Lead Actress, and “Darkest Hour” for Best Picture. Tommy Wiseau might show up in support of “The Disaster Artist,” as James Franco most definitely won’t. And Tonya Harding could be Margot Robbie’s date. No chance of a Winston Churchill appearance, though.

Who’s Got An Eye On Those PwC Accountants?

Last year, a startled celebrity audience and millions of couch-bound viewers at home sat in shock as presenters Dunaway and Beatty announced the wrong Best Picture winner after an envelope handoff snafu. During the 2018 ceremony, all eyes will and should be on the PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants who will be giving presenters their envelopes. Don’t mess this up!

A Tie?

If we don’t get a “La La Land” vs. “Moonlight” showdown, then maybe we’ll get a fumbled tie presentation instead? Please, Oscar gods, deliver upon us this small gift.

Weinstein’s Absence

For nearly 30 years, Harvey Weinstein was a known presence at the Oscars. He’d sit up front, laugh, applaud and be thanked by countless actors and filmmakers. According to the Los Angeles Times, one analysis of nearly 1,400 Oscar speeches determined that the man behind films such as “Pulp Fiction” and “Lion” was thanked more often than God himself. This year will surely be much different.

Time Is Up

Given the tenor of the Golden Globes, we can expect more than a few Me Too moments at the Oscars, particularly during acceptance speeches. Stay tuned for award presenters Ashley Judd, Jane Fonda, Jodie Foster and Nicole Kidman, who could use the platform to spread awareness about the systemic sexism in their industry. Or, you know, someone could just give Natalie Portman the mic.Roy Moore's legal fees keep piling up. JIM WATSON via Getty Images

Former Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has asked supporters for financial assistance to defend against a defamation lawsuit brought by an Alabama woman who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was 14 years old.

In a Facebook post this week, Moore said his “resources have been depleted” and he has “struggled to make ends meet” due to legal fees and expenses. He thanked his supporters and encouraged them to make donations to his defense fund.

“I now face another vicious attack from lawyers in Washington D. C. and San Francisco who have hired one of the biggest firms in Birmingham Alabama to bring another legal action against me and ensure that I never fight again,” he wrote in the lengthy screed. He took the time to excoriate “gays, lesbians, and transgenders,” “the ultra-liberal media” and “the Washington establishment.”

During Moore’s campaign last year, an Alabama woman named Leigh Corfman told The Washington Post that he had touched her sexually when she was a teen and he was 32. Her story prompted other women to come forward with their own allegations about encounters with Moore that ranged in severity from sexual harassment to attempted rape. Some of them were also under 18 at the time of the incidents.

Corfman filed a defamation suit against Moore in January after he repeatedly denied her account.

“[Moore] and his campaign called me a liar and immoral when I publicly disclosed his misconduct,” she said in a statement. “By this lawsuit, I seek to do what I could not do as a 14-year-old — hold Mr. Moore and those who enable him accountable.”

A donation site for Moore has raised $32,200 out of a $250,000 goal as of Saturday. He has been asking for money since at least January, when he sent an email to supporters requesting contributions.Bill Maher broke down the string of setbacks that President Donald Trump’s administration has suffered in the past week on Friday’s “Real Time.”

“So much crazy shit happened, I’m just gonna have to go through it chronologically,” the comedian said.

From White House communications director Hope Hicks’ resignation to Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s security clearance downgrade and the president’s apparent flip on gun control, “all this chaos makes it very difficult for the NRA to run the country,” Maher quipped.Sometimes a picture is worth way more than a thousand words.

Like this photograph of a 2-year-old girl called Parker gazing awestruck at artist Amy Sherald’s portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama.

Ben Hines, 37, from North Carolina, captured the inspiring moment while visiting the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. He shared the image of the girl, who he didn’t know, to Facebook. It’s now going viral.

“It was so touching and uplifting for me to see this beautiful child looking at a beautiful portrait of a powerful woman,” Hines told BuzzFeed. “I was so delighted to have been in the right place at the right time.”

Parker’s mother, Jessica Curry, said her daughter “just wanted to stare at” the painting. “She was fascinated.”

Hines’ photograph ended up attracting Sherald’s attention. The Baltimore-based artist said on Instagram that the snap had her “feeling all the feels.”

Sherald recalled how seeing a Bo Bartlett painting of a black man during an elementary school trip made her realize she could become an artist.

A post shared by Amy Sherald (@asherald) on Mar 2, 2018 at 8:01am PST

Sherald’s portrait of Michelle Obama was unveiled alongside Kehinde Wiley’s depiction of former President Barack Obama at the gallery last month.

During the ceremony, Michelle Obama said she was “thinking about all of the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and they will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall.”

Hines’ photo was well-received on Twitter, where people hailed it for demonstrating exactly why representation matters.

Students David Hogg and Cameron Kasky joined Bill Maher on Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time” to talk about the upcoming “March For Our Lives” and their campaign for gun control.

During the wide-ranging interview, Hogg described how the White House had called him the day before the president held a “listening session” on the issue, to invite him to attend.

Hogg declined the invitation, which he called “very offensive, considering the fact that there were funerals the next day, there was mourning we still had to do.”

“I ended on this message with them. I said, ‘We don’t need to listen to President Trump. President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams of this nation,’” Hogg said.

Kasky also delivered a strong response to members of the National Rifle Association and lawmakers who claim the student activists “don’t know what they’re talking about.”

“We’ve been locked in a classroom. We have seen our friends text their parents goodbye. We are the experts,” he said. “We know exactly what we’re talking about. How dare you tell us we don’t know?”
