White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah later responded in a statement, saying, “Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people.”

The following day, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”

Needless to say, Trump’s words ― the latest in a long list of racist remarks the president has made since he was elected ― caused outrage among many groups, with several members of Congress swiftly condemning them.Taraji P. Henson is a 47-year-old black woman starring in an action film.

Before Friday, you were more likely to glimpse a unicorn than a black leading lady kicking ass and taking names on screen. But with the release of Babak Najafi’s “Proud Mary,” Henson is seeking to change that.

“We can sit here and rattle off men for days, and whatever age they are, they get roles like this,” Henson told HuffPost ahead of the film’s release. “And all of my friends in the industry look amazing. Tiptop shape. They work out. And so why don’t we see more of us in roles like this?”

The actress didn’t have much time to prepare for the physically challenging role, but that didn’t stop her from shining as Mary, an assassin working for an organized crime family in Boston.

“I had to think about the fight scenes as dance choreography,” she said. “Instead of a plie or a pirouette, it’s a punch or a kick or uppercut. I had to throw a 200-pound man over my shoulder. You know, it was just a lot of fun. It was dangerous, though. A couple times I could’ve gotten really hurt.”

In addition to her dance training, Henson had to channel one of the only black women to star in an action role before her ― Pam Grier. As far as leading ladies go, Henson said, the 1970s icon was all she had to lean on.

Now, Henson’s desire is that Hollywood brings more black women into the action-film spotlight ― and not just as sidekicks ― for young girls to “reference for their power.”

“Hopefully, this is the beginning of... something that we’ll see for the rest of our lives, women in these roles,” Henson said. “Cause I think it’s important. And, you know, with the narrative that we’re trying to change right now, the more young girls see women in power like this, the more they say, ‘I don’t have to be a victim.’”Julia Louis-Dreyfus got an extra special surprise on her last day of chemotherapy.

The actress, who is battling breast cancer, shared a video that her two sons, Charlie and Henry Hall, made for her. The video starts off with a message from the two saying, “Mom’s Last Chemo Day!!! BEAT IT!!!” before the boys begin lip-synching the lyrics to Michael Jackson’s song, “Beat It.”

Louis-Dreyfus loved the video and posted it on Instagram Thursday with the caption, “My beauty boys @henryhallmusic @charlie_hall made this for me today, my last day of chemotherapy. Pretty swell, right? Ain’t they sweet?”

Louis-Dreyfus announced in September 2017 that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. “1 in 8 women get breast cancer,” she said in a note to her social media followers at the time. “Today, I’m the one.”

Just a few days after announcing the news, her sons posted sweet messages thanking fans for their outpouring of support.

Trump faced widespread ridicule Friday for his explanation for the canceled visit to London ― because he was “not a big fan of the Obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy” in the city.

Many people, however, put the cancelation down to Trump’s fear of facing protests ― which the Harry Potter author summed up expertly with this tweet:

Yes. Rowling shared an emoji of a chicken, suggesting Trump was afraid.

Rowling’s fans, naturally, crowed with delight:

🤣🤣🤣I knew we could count on you @jk_rowling — Yaretzi Sayuri (@LapitaperezosaH) January 12, 2018Adam Rippon may be headed to the Olympics, but there’s one aspect of the gig he won’t be participating in.

The 28-year-old figure skater, who on Jan. 7 became the first openly gay man to qualify for the Winter Games, has no plans to visit the White House, as Team USA members have traditionally done after the Olympics.

“I won’t go because I don’t think somebody like me would be welcome there,” Rippon, a native of Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, told the BBC. “I know what it’s like to go into a room and feel like you’re not wanted there.”

As an Olympic athlete, Rippon sees it as his “duty” to be a role model. Accepting an invitation from President Donald Trump, who ran on an anti-LGBTQ platform, would be disingenuous, he said.

“I think it’s really important that we stand up for what we believe in, and we speak out against things that we think are wrong and unjust,” he said.

He added, “If I talked to people the way that President Trump talks to people, my mom would kick my ass.”

Rippon isn’t the only U.S. athlete who has vowed to decline a post-Olympics invitation to the White House. Freeskier Gus Kenworthy, who will find out later this month if he’s made the U.S. ski team, told Time magazine that he would also opt out, noting that he has “no interest in faking support” for the president.

Lindsey Vonn, who is also hoping to qualify for the U.S. ski team, similarly said she would not go if invited to the White House.President Donald Trump’s reported denigration of Haiti as a “shithole” country came only one day before Friday’s eight-year anniversary of the earthquake that ravaged the island nation.

The Haitian government “vehemently” condemned the president’s remarks and formally summoned an American official to explain them, Haiti’s ambassador to the U.S., Paul Altidor, told NBC News contributor Yamiche Alcindor.

“Haitians fought along U.S. soldiers in the Revolutionary War and we continue to be great contributors to American society,” Altidor added.

On Friday, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”

Trump’s reported affront on Thursday during a White House meeting with lawmakers adds to his history of badmouthing Haiti, which was struck by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on Jan. 12, 2010. He once said that Haitians “all have AIDS,” The New York Times reported in December. The White House denied that remark.

In November, Trump ended temporary protected status that had been granted to Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. following the earthquake. His move gave 59,000 people in the U.S. 18 months to either return to Haiti or face deportation. Trump also plans to revoke temporary protected status for Nicaraguans and Salvadorans, thrusting hundreds of thousands more into limbo.

Trump officials said the decision to revoke the special status for Haitians was a result of improved conditions on the island. Yet Haiti remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and devastation from two recent hurricanes has made for a continuing struggle. As of October, almost 12,000 people were suffering from cholera, and more than 1.3 million people were facing acute food insecurity, according to the United Nations.

At this time last year, the U.N. estimated that 2.5 million Haitians were desperate for humanitarian aid.

“There is no other word one can use but ‘racist’,” U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said Friday of Trump’s slur. “You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as ‘shitholes,’ whose entire populations, who are not white, are therefore not welcome.”Getty Images/Twitter

Who’s ready to chuck their phone into the sea and never read another media alert again?

However, as nice as avoiding the news until the end of time sounds, it’s also incredibly unrealistic. It’s smart to stay in touch with what’s happening. Plus, people are personally living out news stories in their daily lives as they face sexism, racism, terrorism, health care issues and weather-related disasters.

So, how can you keep in touch with current events while still protecting your mental health? Below are some expert-backed suggestions for staying informed while keeping stress at bay:

Get strategic about your alerts

It’s a good idea to read different news sources to get a well-rounded picture of the world. However, that could mean multiple news alerts on your phone. The barrage of notifications not only can get overwhelming, it’s essentially setting you up for on-demand stress.

“When it comes to stress, it’s important to determine what is in your personal control and what is not within your control, and what action needs to be taken and what the appropriate action is,” said Dr. Renee Binder, past president of the American Psychiatric Association and a psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine.

In some cases, taking action might mean limiting what you expose yourself to on a regular basis. Consider doing a cleanup of your notifications by enabling only what you feel is necessary. Binder told HuffPost that turning to other resources ― like enabling local county alerts rather than national news alerts ― may also be a good workaround.

“For example, there’s been a lot of weather problems in California and on the East Coast, so it is important to get information in whichever way you can get it,” Binder explained. You don’t want to avoid negative news reports that are tied to your immediate safety, such as updates on wildfires, hurricanes and mudslides.

Practice some simple breathing exercises

It might sound new age-y or cheesy, but it works in the moment. Even experts swear by this technique when they’re feeling overwhelmed listening to negative media reports.

“I put my feet flat on the floor, relax my shoulders, close my eyes, smile and take a long, slow deep breath,” Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford, previously told HuffPost. “You can do this just about anywhere, and it always feels good.”

Volunteer in your community or speak out about a cause

Taking action to relieve anxiety, as Binder recommended, can also take the form of giving back. Volunteering for an organization you care about or speaking up for a meaningful cause on social media may help alleviate some of that stress. Bonus: Research shows altruism can improve your mood.

Use other stress-relief techniques

Managing anxiety actively takes work; it’s important to engage in other stress-relief methods regardless of whether you’re checking your news apps. Working out, mindfulness and hanging out with loved ones are all known to reduce anxiety, Binder said. Looking for more? Try one of these stress-busting techniques.

Participate in the political process

Elections matter. If political current affairs ― and the news surrounding them ― are causing you stress, make a conscious effort to vote and get active in your own political party, Binder suggested.

“When it comes to political stress, people feel much better when they feel like they can do something about it,” Binder said.

Talk to a professional about how you’re feeling

Therapy isn’t just a tool for serious mental health conditions. Talking to an expert about issues that cause you excessive stress can be incredibly beneficial ― especially if it’s interfering with your everyday life, Binder explained.

“When you find that you’re not just upset about what’s happening, but you’re all of a sudden losing weight or losing sleep ... this can signal something a little bit more serious and it might be worthwhile to talk to someone about it and get professional help,” she said.

Therapy can be pretty pricey, which often deters people from trying it in the first place. Here are some options for making it a little more affordable.

If all else fails, take a small break

“We have never experienced a time like this in human history, a time where there is no respite from distressing stories and terrifying world events,” Kathryn Stamoulis, a licensed mental health counselor who specializes in women’s issues, previously told HuffPost. “We must self-protect, and the only way to do so is to disconnect from time to time.”Kids may say the darndest things, but parents tweet about them in the funniest ways.

The following day, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”

Cooper spoke of learning math from a Haitian immigrant and then visiting the country as a journalist to cover the devastating 2010 earthquake.

“Haitians slap your hand hard when they shake it, they look you in the eye. They don’t blink,” Cooper said, adding:

“They stand tall and they have dignity. It’s a dignity that many in this White House could learn from. It’s a dignity the president, with all his money and all his power, could learn from as well.”

Check out the commentary above.

Earlier in the show, Cooper also addressed the president’s reported remark, calling it “a racist sentiment”:

It’s been a year and a half since Alton Sterling was killed by two white police officers, and Louisiana’s attorney general has yet to release four unseen videos of the deadly shooting. At least one of the videos shows an officer putting a gun to Sterling’s head while saying, “I’ll kill you, bitch,” according to court documents.

“We still don’t have closure,” Michael Adams, one of the attorneys representing the family, told Baton Rouge’s WBRZ-TV. “The city is still sitting and waiting to see what happened or what is going to happen. It’s unfair that this entire community is still talking about this almost two years later and have not gotten any further down the road.”

Tired of asking and waiting, the Sterling family attorneys this week filed subpoenas in a Baton Rouge state court to force state Attorney General Jeff Landry to turn over not only the videos, but other unreleased evidence.

Sterling, 37, was confronted by East Baton Rouge Parish police officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II outside the Triple S Food Mart on July 5, 2016. The officers, police said, were responding to a call about a man with a gun.

According to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Sterling’s family last year, Sterling cooperated when approached by Officer Lake and it was Salamoni who displayed aggressive behavior.

The court documents allege that Salamoni “pulled out his gun from his holster, pointed his service weapon to Mr. Sterling’s head and yelled aggressively, with intent, ‘Bitch, I will f**king kill you … I am going to shoot you in your mother f**king head.’″

After deploying a stun gun and tackling Sterling to the ground, Salamoni, who claims Sterling reached for a gun, shot him a total of six times, according to the court documents.

In the days following the shooting, store owner Abdul Muflahi told HuffPost that he witnessed the shooting and did not see Sterling with a gun, but did see officers remove one from Sterling’s pocket. A witness caught the shooting on camera.

The killing set off demonstrations, with people decrying police terror against black lives. The department was criticized for its handling of those protests, which included displays of military-style equipment and the use of ear-splitting sirens called LRADs. Officers were also accused of haphazardly pointing assault rifles at protesters and journalists.

While two videos showing the shooting have been released, authorities have yet to release recordings from two body cameras, a dashboard camera and a store surveillance camera.

The attorneys for Sterling’s family said they need the materials for the wrongful death lawsuit. The suit names East Baton Rouge Parish, the police department, the police chief and the two officers involved as defendants.

The legal action was taken after the Justice Department announced in May it would not file charges against Salamoni or Lake. Landry’s office has yet to determine whether state criminal charges should be filed. Both officers remain on paid administrative leave.

According to The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, in addition to the videos, the subpoenas seek several evidentiary items, including audio recordings, reports, notes and eyewitness statements.

The subpoenas give Landry until Jan. 29 to respond.

Landry’s office has reportedly declined to comment on the request, citing the ongoing investigation.Celebrities showed up to the 2018 Critics’ Choice Awards in a dazzling array of colors, patterns and textures (we see you in that velvet suit jacket, Armie Hammer).

The styles came just days after the majority of actresses and actors attending the Golden Globes Awards wore all black in a symbolic response to the recent tidal wave of sexual abuse and harassment allegations that has rocked Hollywood.

But on Thursday night’s award ceremony, our favorite entertainers donned a cascade of vibrant arrangements.

Angelina Jolie looked captivating in a custom, asymmetrical gown with a fitted, frilly bodice from Ralph & Russo. Niecy Nash, Allison Williams, Yara Shahidi and Chrissy Metz proved that playful patterns make every red carpet more fun. Actresses Kiernan Shipka and Mary Elizabeth Winstead ― whose outfits stayed within the same pastel color palette ― made us anxious for spring.

The men who walked the red carpet didn’t let us down either, and stars like Sterling K. Brown, Nick Jonas and Aziz Ansari showed up in dapper suits.

Check out all the wide variety of looks below:After President Donald Trump reportedly referred to African countries that benefit from the U.S. visa lottery program as “shitholes,” House Speaker Paul Ryan lightly rebuked the president on Friday, calling the comments “very unfortunate” and “unhelpful.”

Ryan was asked about the comments ― in a roundabout way, with a moderator at a University of Wisconsion-Milwaukee event refusing to use the word “shithole” ― and while he did ding Trump for those remarks, Ryan avoided any pointed criticism and said Republicans were still focused on a deal to legislatively codify the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program.

When the moderator pressed Ryan on how lawmakers could find a deal when Trump was making those sorts of comments, Ryan said, “We just have to get it done.”

Ryan didn’t issue a statement on Trump’s comments, and when he was asked about what Trump said Thursday, Ryan joked that Trump “said a lot of things yesterday, which one are you talking about?”

When the moderator clarified that he was referring to “a word I can’t mention” about African countries, Ryan said he was focused on other issues on Thursday and read those comments later at night.

Ryan’s response to Trump’s comments was telling because it was mostly about him. The remark was “unhelpful” to him. And Ryan said he immediately thought about oppression his family had faced.

“First thing that came to my mind was, very unfortunate, unhelpful,” Ryan said. “But you know what I thought of right away? I thought of my own family.”

Ryan said his family came from Ireland to the United States, worked manual labor jobs, and faced discrimination.

“The Irish were really looked down upon back in those days. I hear all these stories from my relatives about ‘Irish need not apply,’” he said.

He then said their story of overcoming that oppression was “a beautiful story of America.”Taylor Swift goes global in her latest music video.

But for Queen Elizabeth II, wearing the crown comes with far more practical concerns.

“You can’t look down ... Because if you did, your neck would break — it would fall off,” the queen said in “The Coronation,” a new documentary coming to The Smithsonian Channel.

“So there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they’re quite important things,” Elizabeth added.

In a rare on-air interview, the queen recounts her 1953 coronation with remarkable candor. When asked about her miles-long ride around London in the Gold State Coach, the queen recalled it was “not very comfortable.”

“Horrible,” she said. “It’s not meant for traveling in at all.”

The queen also remembers grappling with her unwieldy coronation gown.

“I remember one moment when I was going against the pile of the carpet and I couldn’t move at all,” she said.

Despite the physical discomfort her coronation caused, the queen recognizes the event’s significance.

“It’s the sort of, I suppose, the beginning of one’s life, really, as a sovereign,” she said.It has been astounding and disturbing to observe the silence of Republican leaders on the dastardly statement the president of this nation made regarding what he called “shithole” countries. It is especially astounding as many lawmakers say they are deeply religious, members of the Religious Right. Their God is a god I do not know.

Many have been waiting for GOP lead lawmakers Sen. Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan to make unequivocal statements denouncing the president’s unabashed racist comments. But there has been nothing.

There also has been no outcry from the evangelical Christian community, that wing of Christianity which has historically purported to be the true voice of truth and right relationship with God. Pastor Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, has actually defended the president’s remarks.

Racism for many is sanctioned by God, a fact which has kept many caught in racist and hate-filled beliefs, buoyed by a deep belief that racism is all right with God. While some Christians, notably those who are said to be on “the Left,” have decried racism, many on “the Right” seem just as confident that God approves of their beliefs.

The penchant of “godly men” to support racism and the goal of keeping America white is not new. Benjamin Franklin, in his Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, wrote, in 1751, “…the number of purely white people in America proportionately very small. All Africa is black or tawny; Asia chiefly tawny …why should we, in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its people by planting them in America where we have so fair an opportunity of excluding all Blacks and Tawneys…(and) of increasing the lovely White and Red?”

Benjamin Franklin was a “godly” man, “good people,” as this president would say, and saw no disconnect between his innate racism and the presence and will of God.

But the message of “God’s goodness” has, for some, always clashed against the notion of a God who placates, supports and endorses racism.

The late Rabbi Abraham Heschel said “racism is worse than idolatry. Racism is Satanism, unmitigated evil.” He said, as has the Rev. C.T. Vivian has said, “You cannot worship God and at the same time look at man as if he were a horse.” (Abraham Heschel; Essential Writings, p. 66)

In that work, Heschel quotes the late Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, “Race prejudice, a universal human ailment, is the most recalcitrant aspect of the evil of man. “Racism,” says Niebuhr, “is a “treacherous denial of the existence of God.”

If, as Heschel says, racism is “man’s greatest threat to man, the maximum hatred for a minimum of reason,” then we are living in an era of high threat. The negative energy which is racism is swirling, working itself into a Tsunami which will damage more people than we might care to think about.

In listening to some “conservative” religious voices support the president’s racism, it is hard to reconcile their words with a perception of God as being entirely different. This divide between the “God of the Left” and the “God of the Right,” which is really an artificial division created by culture, causes consternation in those who are seeking to make sense out of a situation which makes no sense at all. The divide shows that we practice a “cultural Christianity,” as opposed to a “Biblical Christianity.”

God, it seems, lets the privileged have their way. There is no divine punishment for racism or for racists; the God of the Right is fairly lenient. The Religious Right is quick to condemn people for actions they consider “sin,” most notably abortion and homosexuality. Members of the Religious Right are quick to ascribe natural disasters to a God angry about sin.

Racism never makes the list. It apparently is not punishable.

But if, as Heschel says, “racism is worse than idolatry,” if it is “Satanism,” then what’s up with the inaction of God? Heschel says that “in dishonoring the Negro’s name, people “profane” God’s name. These white people who live in racist thought continue to plough over the hearts, minds, spirits and rights of people of color, and the God of the Right never says a word.

With this president, it seems that we may have come to a fork in the road, to a place where we must decide which “side” we’re on – the side of a compassionate God who loves all, or on the side of a god who is sexist, racist and who sanctions and allows hatred and the dehumanization of people supposedly created by God.It’s been quite the roller-coaster ride for President Donald Trump’s administration.

That turmoil is set against the backdrop of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing probe into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

So, on Friday, Twitter users decided to explore the ways in which they could possibly fix Trump. Here’s a sampling of some of the best #FixTrumpIn5Words posts:

Take away his social media — Laura (@droopiesmom) January 12, 2018A groundbreaking YouTube educational resource when it comes to themes of gender, sexuality and LGBTQ experience is back for a third season.

“Queer Kid Stuff” is a web series that breaks down LGBTQ themes, experiences and ideas in ways that are educational, accessible and ― most importantly ― fun for kids. Created and starring New York-based artist Lindsay Amer and her sidekick Teddy, the series has carved out a space in the YouTube world for queerness and children’s educational videos to intersect.

This video focused on gender expression marks the first episode in the third season of the program.

“I think gender expression is something that’s really accessible for kids and something they should be encouraged to explore,” Amer told HuffPost. “It’s surprisingly difficult to describe exactly what it means to present as masculine, feminine, or androgynous so I enlisted a few friends of mine to help me show a diverse range of how different people with different identities might interpret those expressions.”You may not know it, but the national parks are in the midst of a crisis.

President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes about a 12 percent cut to the Interior Department, with nearly $400 million potentially coming out of the parks budget. As a result, entry fees will likely become substantially higher in many national parks.

Trump’s administration is reportedly naming P. Daniel Smith as the acting director of the National Park Service. Smith is perhaps best known for cutting down trees in a national park in 2004 so Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder could have a better view of the Potomac River from his Maryland mansion.

Yet preserving national beauty shouldn’t be a partisan issue. To his credit, Trump donated $78,333 of his roughly $400,000 presidential salary to preserve battlefields shortly after taking office. Other presidents such as John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover also donated portions of their salaries to charity.

While the idea of making up a $400 million deficit may seem overwhelming, even small donations of money and time can make a difference to the parks, Will Shafroth, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation ― a charity wing of the National Park Service ― told HuffPost.

Chloe Bordewich/The Washington Post via Getty Images Fort Jefferson stands in Dry Tortugas, Florida.

“I’ve been around this system for a while,” Shafroth said. “That existential threat [of shrinking budgets] has been there for a long time.”

Shafroth is in a unique position, as his department focuses on providing funds for projects rather than park maintenance. This means that money coming his way won’t just disappear into filling the gaps of a massive budget cut.

“We don’t really play on people’s fears to solicit funds,” Shafroth said. “We play on people’s hopes and dreams and aspirations for what they actually want to do.”

For example, the NPF’s Open Outdoors for Kids program, which affects hundreds of thousands of children nationally, is set up such that just $10 provides one child with a trip to a national park.

The parks also rely on a huge contingent of volunteers, regardless of the budget.

Of course, with Trump slashing the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monuments in December ― the largest rollback of federal land protection in U.S. history ― it’s hard not to be discouraged. Shafroth certainly understands this. His great-grandfather John was the author of the Antiquities Act that protected those monuments.

“My great-grandfather was very actively involved,” Shafroth said. “He believed it was important for there to be an ability for the president to take action to protect those kinds of places.”

But he says it’s important to maintain hope that supporting these parks will make a difference. Donations surged over the holidays and overall donations increased from last year, Shafroth said.

There’s another way to give to our national parks, too: Show up.

As The New York Times reported in September, the most high-profile parks have been swarmed with too many visitors, even as the National Park Service has an $11 billion maintenance backlog.

So with suggestions from the National Park Foundation, HuffPost has compiled a list of lesser-known places run by the National Park Service. You may want to consider visiting these spots instead of marquee names like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.

If you’re looking for somewhere to travel in 2018, do consider these bastions of American beauty.

(One note: Not all of these are officially considered “parks” ― the government has classified some of them as smaller entities. Still, they’re all well worth checking out.)

Police arrested 31-year-old Jacqueline Ades on May 8 and charged her with threatening, stalking, harassment and failure to appear in court, according to The Washington Post.

Ades discussed the allegations on Thursday during a jailhouse interview with local CBS affiliate KPHO-TV.

“I felt like I met my soul mate and I thought we would just do what everybody else did and we would get married and everything would be fine,” Ades said, adding that she met the man on Luxy, an online dating site for verified millionaires.

Ades said she sent her date so many texts because “loving him selflessly brought me his information.”

According to police, many of the text messages Ades “selflessly” sent included anti-Semitic insults and threats like, “Don’t ever try to leave me ... I’ll kill you ... I don’t wanna be a murderer!”

Authorities say she texted the following:

“I hope you die ... you rotten filthy Jew.”

“I’m like the new Hitler ... man was a genius.”

“Oh, what I would do w/your blood ... I’d wanna bathe in it.”

Authorities said Ades has been sending as many as 500 messages a day since last year, but her efforts to connect with her former date became more extreme last month.

That’s when she allegedly broke into the man’s home and took a bath in his tub. Police say she also showed up at his work pretending to be his wife.

Ades is due in court May 15 and will be represented by a public defender. She is being held without bond.

Although Ades acknowledged that sending 65,000 text messages seemed like a lot, she told KPHO she thought she’d sent more.Sources that spoke to The Washington Post quoted Trump as saying: “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”

The president also reportedly suggested the U.S. should welcome more immigrants from countries like Norway. The controversial remarks were confirmed by NBC News, BuzzFeed and CNN.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who was at the White House meeting, also confirmed the comments to HuffPost on Friday. Durbin, who was the first to go on record over the reports, added Trump also said the U.S. should “take ... out” Haitians currently living in the U.S.

Donald Trump and his White House, reeling from depictions in Michael Wolff’s instant bestseller Fire and Fury, were desperate this week to show that the president is in command and mentally fit, following up on Trump’s tweet in response to the book last weekend claiming he is a “stable genius.”

Near the weeks’s end, however, Trump undid whatever little bit of rehabilitation he had achieved, when, according to people in the room, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the president railed against immigrants from “shithole countries” and said that he preferred immigrants from places “like Norway.” (The White House didn’t deny the report, first published in The Washington Post Thursday afternoon, though over 18 hours later Trump suggested it wasn’t true in a tweet.) The blow up occurred at a bipartisan private meeting of lawmakers on Thursday in which Trump clearly couldn’t control his contempt for people of color. He proved himself to be every bit like the depictions of him in Fire and Fury.

“The debate about Trump’s emotional stability ended a long time ago.”

Too many people, including many in the media and even Trump himself, have confused mental impairment and emotional stability.

People can of course be mentally ill and yet quite stable. And there are many people who aren’t in any way mentally impaired, but are highly emotionally unstable ― prone to outbursts, impulsiveness, temper tantrums and other erratic behavior that often displays their anger, resentment and animus toward groups or individuals.

In Fire And Fury, Wolff quoted people in the White House calling Trump an “idiot” and a “moron.” He wrote that people around Trump describe him as as being “like a child” and that “100 percent” of them believe he is not “fit” for office. And he documented Trump’s odd repetition of phrases and anecdotes while speaking, saying it was becoming more pronounced. On the “Today” show, while describing this behavior, Wollff quoted Steve Bannon saying, “He’s lost it.”

That last description clearly depicts Trump as mentally impaired and perhaps getting worse. But that is something none of us could know. Only a trained mental health professional examining Trump in a face-to-face psychiatric or psychological evaluation could determine that.

But Trump’s emotional stability doesn’t rest on his being mentally impaired. The televised immigration meeting, as was plain for all to see, was all about feeding a fragile, deeply insecure man who was starved for validation, something that was made clear by his comments the next day.

“Actually it was [the meeting] reported as incredibly good. And my performance ― some of it called it a performance, I consider it work. But it got great reviews by everybody other than two networks who were phenomenal for about two hours,” Trump said. “I’m sure their ratings were fantastic.”

He even claimed that news anchors sent letters to the White House praising his performance.

Trump’s unhinged tweets throughout the week suggest that he was motivated by increased fears about the Russia investigation (targeting “sneaky Dianne Feinstein” for releasing a revealing transcript from Senate Judiciary Committee testimony), his seething anger at the Wolff book, and much else that had him lashing out impulsively.

On Thursday morning, Trump threw Congress into chaos as it was set to vote on reauthorizing the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping program when he tweeted against the program and his administration’s own position on it, all because of his anxiety and fear that it had been used to surveil his election campaign and kick off the FBI’s probe into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia.

With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018

It reportedly took a phone call from House Speaker Paul Ryan to convince Trump that the program was focused on foreign surveillance (though it can wiretap American citizens communicating with those outside the country), leading the president to flip an hour later and tweet support for the program ― again, a program that his own White House already supported, a fact about which he seemed to be completely out of touch.

In a televised cabinet meeting on Thursday, meant to lay out the administration’s and the GOP’s priorities for 2018, Trump suddenly announced that his administration would take “a strong look” at tightening libel laws ― though there actually are no federal libel laws ― something that no Republican in Congress is likely to have any interest in addressing at a time when they’d like to talk up having passed their tax bill and focus on other priorities. Revealing he was likely still fuming about Fire and Fury, Trump’s announcement once again diverted media attention from the GOP agenda to Trump’s authoritarian impulses and support for media censorship.

And let’s not forget Trump’s reckless tweet just before the first excerpt of Fire and Fury went public last week, in which he taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un about his bigger “nuclear button.”

The debate about Trump’s emotional stability ended a long time ago, though this week, because of the Wolff book and the responses to it, Trump’s stability seemed to get conflated with other things that became easier for the administration to challenge, with the help of some gullible or access-driven journalists. We shouldn’t get bogged down in whether or not Trump is mentally impaired.

No matter his mental health, in a week in which Trump and the White House were intent on pushing back against Fire and Fury and presenting the president as stable and mentally fit, he displayed, in spectacular fashion, his uncontrolled and bigoted rage, his impulsiveness and his instability.

Whatever the underlying causes, this week proved, once again, that Donald Trump is dangerous and unfit for the presidency.Protesters gather in Denver in July to pressure Colorado's governor to turn down a bill that would limit Medicaid. Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images

The Trump administration opened the doors Thursday for states to set work requirements for people who get Medicaid, a move that is likely to be a catastrophe for some of the most vulnerable Americans, particularly those struggling with opioid addiction.

The new Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services guidance, which allows states to seek federal permission to establish restrictions, could threaten the Medicaid coverage of the many adults with disabilities, children and the elderly who cannot work.

And, since the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, its benefits have been a key component in addressing the rise of substance abuse. From 2011 to 2016, Medicaid spending on prescription treatments for opioid use disorder rose from $394.2 million to $929.9 million, according to a report from the Urban Institute, a left-leaning Washington, D.C., think tank.

The guidance letter does acknowledge the severity of the opioid crisis. It says states must “take certain steps” to provide coverage for people in need of substance abuse treatment, potentially by counting time a person spends in treatment toward work requirements or by exempting those participating in “intensive medical treatment.”

But Sara Rosenbaum, a law professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, said the letter doesn’t actually bar states from kicking people with substance abuse problems off their insurance.

“There’s absolutely nothing that requires the exemption of people with addiction,” Rosenbaum said. “They just said there are considerations…. It does not say you can’t do anything that would impair access to treatment.”

Even if people in treatment, or with other circumstances that prevent them from working, are legally entitled to an exemption under state rules, another big issue is how many hoops they’ll have to jump through to keep getting medical care. Under state work requirements, people have to verify their work status or their qualification for an exemption, according to MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director of Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicaid & the Uninsured. In some cases, they may have to file paperwork as often as every month to verify that they’re still exempt.

“There is a real risk of eligible people losing coverage due to their inability to navigate this process or miscommunication or other breakdown in the administrative process,” she said in an email to HuffPost.

For people in exceptionally vulnerable positions — say, someone who just lost his job after failing a drug test and can’t find an available space at a substance abuse program in his area — adding another bureaucratic hurdle could make it even more difficult to get back on track.

The red tape associated with work requirements also adds a new burden on the agencies that administer Medicaid benefits, Musumeci noted. Because of the added administrative costs, the waivers that states have filed to create work requirements generally don’t anticipate saving much money, even as they reduce the number of people in the program.

In fact, similar work requirements for the federal nutrition program SNAP have proved so burdensome that states often prefer not to implement them just to avoid the hassle, according to a 2016 report from the Agriculture Department’s Office of the Inspector General. The report notes that implementing the work requirements “can be error prone,” resulting in some people being denied benefits they should get and others receiving benefits they’re not really eligible for.

Ironically, the first waiver request the Trump administration is likely to approve is from Kentucky, a state that has benefited enormously from Medicaid coverage for people facing opioid addiction. The state has one of the highest rates of overdose deaths in the country, and its Medicaid spending on prescriptions for opioid use disorders jumped 326 percent from 2011 to 2016, to $64 million.

Kentucky also anticipates the most drastic drop in Medicaid enrollment out of the 10 states with pending work requirement waivers, according to an analysis by the Commonwealth Fund. The state predicts that a full 15 percent of its Medicaid beneficiaries will lose their coverage within five years of the waiver’s implementation.

Beyond the opioid crisis, the new policy also threatens a range of low-income people. About 60 percent of the Medicaid recipients whom the federal government considers to be able-bodied adults are already working, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But many are in the kind of unstable, low-wage jobs in which hours vary from week to week and sporadic layoffs are common. That leaves plenty of chances to fall through the cracks of a work requirement.

Meanwhile, many of those who don’t work are going to school or caring for children or other family members, and many others are ill or disabled but haven’t been able to officially qualify for federal disability insurance. The new policy allows states to make exceptions to the work rules for caregivers and students, but it doesn’t require that they do so. It also states explicitly that states can’t get federal Medicaid money for services like childcare and transportation that people might need to get back to work.

The stated purpose of the new guidance is to encourage work, which the Trump administration argues is ultimately good for people’s health. But Rosenbaum notes the absurdity of arguing that keeping people from health care will make them more likely to be able to work.WASHINGTON — Late last month, the Interior Department published a “comprehensive list of accomplishments” in its first year under Secretary Ryan Zinke’s leadership, including several actions it felt demonstrated “a conservation stewardship legacy, second only to Teddy Roosevelt.”

In a summary of those accomplishments, Interior noted that it opened public access to the 16,000-acre Sabinoso Wilderness in New Mexico — even though that agreement was first announced in 2016, and made possible thanks to a sizable private donation. The agency also noted that it expanded hunting and fishing opportunities on 10 national wildlife refuges — an announcement that closely mirrored ones from the Obama administration in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

But the most perplexing accomplishment listed on the summary was that DOI had “successfully defended a mineral withdrawal near the Grand Canyon.”

Zinke’s first year was largely marked by efforts to boost mining and fossil fuel production, prioritizing energy development over conservation. There is also no evidence to support the claim that his agency did anything to protect the Grand Canyon area specifically, and a more detailed list linked to in the agency’s Dec. 28 press release curiously makes no mention of this issue.

Instead, Zinke is taking credit for the government’s victory in a yearslong lawsuit over mining near the Grand Canyon, a legal fight that had already been argued in federal court a month before the Trump administration took office.

In 2012, the Obama administration instituted a 20-year ban on new uranium and other hardrock mining on more than a million acres around Grand Canyon National Park. At the time, Obama’s Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that “a withdrawal is the right approach for this priceless American landscape.”

The National Mining Association and several other groups promptly sued, kicking off four years of litigation.

The proceedings were completed in December 2016, and last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the Obama-era ban, concluding that temporarily freezing mining leases “will permit more careful, longer-term study of the uncertain effects of uranium mining in the area and better-informed decision making in the future.”

That same three-judge panel separately ruled that uranium mining company Energy Fuels Resources Inc. could open its mine in Kaibab National Forest, roughly six miles from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Energy Fuels is the same company that lobbied Trump to carve up Utah’s Bears Ears National Monument so that it could access the area’s uranium deposits, as The Washington Post first reported. Downey Magallanes, a top Zinke aide and the daughter of a coal executive, met with Energy Fuels’ vice president of operations in July.

Zinke was still a member of Congress back when the government finished the legal work on the mining ban case. The government filed no additional arguments or motions during Trump’s tenure, the docket shows.

The only action Zinke’s Interior appears to have taken was not walking away from the lawsuit.

Roger Clark, a program director at Grand Canyon Trust, an Arizona-based advocacy group and one of several defendants in the case, called Zinke’s claim that it had defended the mineral withdrawal baffling. It’s the latest from an administration that, he said, “continues to put out ludicrous assertions as facts.”

“It’s kind of like Trump taking credit for the economy or what the interest rates are doing,” Clark said, adding that the current administration inherited success from its predecessor.

Further muddying where the administration stands on the issue is an October report in which the U.S. Forest Service recommends that the White House consider lifting the mining ban on the million acres of federal land near Grand Canyon. Doing so, it said, “could re-open lands to mineral entry pursuant to the United States mining laws facilitating exploration for, and possibly development of, uranium resources.”

The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries seeking clarification on its position.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, sees the two agencies’ contradictory positions as par for the course.

“Arizona has a painful history of irresponsible and dangerous uranium mining, and maintaining the current withdrawal around the Grand Canyon is clearly the right policy,” he wrote in an email to HuffPost. “If the Trump administration agrees with Arizonans on that I’ll applaud them for it, but we don’t have a solid idea of where the White House stands from minute to minute. Reauthorizing FISA is bad, and then it’s good. A clean DACA bill is workable, and then it’s impossible. We’re drilling off the Florida coast, and then we aren’t.”

“I hope this administration protects the Grand Canyon and the health and safety of our communities, but I’m not sure I know where they stand or how long that will last,” Grijalva added.

Ted Zukoski, an attorney with Earthjustice who represented Grand Canyon Trust and other groups in the case, told HuffPost that regardless of whether the Trump administration deserves credit for the court ruling, “It’s good to see Secretary Zinke support the mineral withdrawal, which protects not only the wildlife and scenery of the Grand Canyon region but the communities and people who have lived there for millennia, including the Havasupai Tribe.”

Taking credit for the withdrawal contradicts much of Zinke’s first 10 months on the job. While environmentalists initially saw him as less of a threat than other Trump Cabinet picks, he has emerged as yet another industry ally, working to pave a better future for coal, oil and gas. “Our nation can’t run on pixie dust and hope,” he said at a March signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order rolling back Obama-era policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

Zinke talks often about his fondness for former President Theodore Roosevelt, describing himself as an “unapologetic admirer and disciple.” But his actions — in particular his recommendation that Trump shrink or otherwise weaken several national monuments designated under the Antiquities Act, which Roosevelt signed into law in 1906 and used to establish and protect 18 national monuments — have left many in the conservation and outdoor sporting communities fuming.

Kate Kelly, public lands director at Center for American Progress and a former Interior official during the Obama administration, said Zinke is “scraping the bottom of the barrel” to come up with conservation wins.American Family Life Assurance Co., or Aflac, has come under fire for Paula Lobo via Getty Images

Insurance giant American Family Life Assurance Co., known as Aflac, has been accused of workplace fraud, including claims that it exploited its employees with a high-pressure contractor scheme, according to a report Thursday on The Intercept news site.

The report details complaints brought by current and former employees along with allegations raised in three previously unreported lawsuits.

In a statement to HuffPost, company spokesman Jon Sullivan said, “These allegations are baseless and we will be filing to have them dismissed.”

Among the lawsuits’ claims are that the Fortune 500 company misleads new hires, exploits workers by classifying them as independent contractors and pressures associates with sales goals that lead them to sell policies without customer consent.

The Intercept article published Thursday is reportedly the first installment in a series that will detail the lawsuits and the employees’ claims. Thursday’s report zeroes in on claims of worker exploitation, painting a picture of a contractor workforce desperate for avenues to income.

The company has a practice of recruiting sales associates for contractor positions with promises of unrealistic earnings that only a tiny fraction of new hires manage to make, according to allegations outlined in the report. The company then reportedly pushes sales associates to sell policies to friends and relatives, as well as to target them for recruiting ― which is among the ways contractors make money.

Associates are allegedly responsible for paying for their own office space and materials, as well as covering travel expenses for mandatory trainings.

“On a daily basis, hundreds of people are receiving phone calls and emails that make you think it’s a job,” Martin Conroy, a nine-year Aflac veteran and lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits, told The Intercept. “Those who figure out the scam get out of it. Some people go into financial ruin.”

The contractor economy has come under scrutiny in recent months as workers increasingly find themselves strapped in freelance and commission-based roles that don’t offer benefits or retirement funds. Uber, whose drivers are all considered contractors, paid two multimillion-dollar settlements in 2017 over complaints that it exploited workers.

Aflac has previously come under fire for selling policies without of the consent of customers. In 2012, the company agreed to pay a combined penalty of $1.6 million for their operations in Idaho, Minnesota and Missouri, and to submit compliance reports for three years. The settlement came after regulators found Aflac agents were selling duplicate health coverage and other policies consumers didn’t authorize.

Aflac has roughly 10,000 salaried employees and earns over $20 billion in annual revenue.
