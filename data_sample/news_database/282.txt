Ohio lawmakers reached a bipartisan agreement this week that gives the minority party in the legislature more influence over the congressional redistricting process and that could rein in the drawing of maps that give one party excessive political advantage.

The proposal sets an example of how lawmakers themselves can develop a way to limit partisan gerrymandering. Reform advocates have increasingly been bypassing the political process, turning to the courts and ballot initiatives to fix a problem that they say lawmakers have too many incentives to ignore.

The measure, which passed unanimously in the Ohio Senate and overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives, gives officials four chances to get a congressional map in place.

Lawmakers will still take the first stab at drawing a new map, but they’ll need a 60 percent supermajority to pass it. That majority must include 50 percent of the votes of the minority party.

If lawmakers fail to reach an agreement, a seven-person bipartisan commission gets the second chance. At least two of the commission’s minority party appointees have to vote yes on the map for it to pass.

If the commission can’t reach an agreement, the legislature gets another shot. They still need a 60 percent majority to pass a map, but they can do it with only one-third of the minority party’s votes.

And if that doesn’t work, lawmakers can approve a congressional map with a simple majority, but such a map may not “unduly” favor or disfavor one political party. That map will also be in place for just four years ― two congressional elections ― instead of 10 years.

The procedural plan that passed the Ohio legislature on Tuesday will have to be approved by voters in May. If approved, it will go into effect for the next round of redistricting in 2021.

Republicans controlled Ohio’s redistricting process following the 2010 Census and drew a map under which their party consistently took 12 of the state’s 16 congressional seats, despite winning only about 50 percent of the statewide vote in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The Brennan Center for Justice estimates the state’s congressional map accounts for two to three additional GOP seats in Congress.

Needless to say, Ohio currently puts few restrictions on congressional redistricting. So the procedural proposal would be an improvement, according to Michael McDonald, political science professor at the University of Florida who has served as an expert witness in several redistricting lawsuits.

“This puts some constraints on it. The constraints will help with minimizing gerrymandering local boundary lines and compactness,” he said.

McDonald also praised a portion of the proposal that would require lawmakers to provide a rationale for new borders if they get to their second chance to draw a map. If the map were challenged in court, those justifications could be useful tools for judges attempting to evaluate the map, he said.

The agreement came as activists in Ohio were pushing for a ballot initiative to take redistricting out of the hands of lawmakers altogether and give it to a bipartisan commission. But the coalition of groups arguing for a ballot initiative also worked with lawmakers to develop the legislative proposal and praised it when it passed.

One of the principal techniques used in partisan gerrymandering is “cracking,” where communities of Democrats or Republicans are divided up among multiple districts in order to dilute their votes. The proposal would try to limit that by requiring that at least 65 of the state’s 88 counties each be contained within a single congressional district. No more than 18 counties could be split once, and no more than five counties could be split twice.

Richard Gunther, a professor emeritus at The Ohio State University who helped draft the ballot initiative, expressed concern that even under those limitations, lawmakers could “crack” the state’s large urban areas.

“There’s no legitimate reason why you have to have more than one split in any county,” he told HuffPost. “Allowing one split in 18 counties and two splits in the other five gives me pause. You wonder why provide for so many splits if it’s not for carving up large urban areas and engaging in cracking strategies.”

While Gunther plans to vote for the lawmakers’ proposal, he said it was not as robust as the one the ballot initiative would have required. He noted that the proposal wouldn’t prevent a “bipartisan gerrymander,” in which Democratic and Republican lawmakers work together to create roughly an equal number of safe districts for their respective parties. That’s still bad for the voters, Gunther said. The ballot initiative, by contrast, includes more explicit provisions barring lawmakers from drawing a map that gives either party an unfair advantage in any district.

Should Ohio voters reject the lawmakers’ proposal in May, Gunther said activists would keep working to get their proposal on the ballot in November.

In 2015, Ohio voters approved a proposal from lawmakers to create a bipartisan board to draw state legislative districts. Facing pressure from then-U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Republican state lawmakers chose not to apply the same process to congressional redistricting.

Gunther, who was involved in negotiating the 2015 proposal, said Boehner’s retirement from Congress may have made it easier for local Republicans to embrace congressional redistricting reforms. He also said the fact that grassroots groups have their own initiative with over 200,000 signatures pressured lawmakers to act.

Michael Li, who tracks redistricting issues around the country as senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice’s Democracy Program, said the Ohio lawmakers’ proposal is “overall very strong” and could be a model for other states where a ballot initiative isn’t an option.

“An independent commission along the lines of California’s would have been stronger,” Li said. He described Ohio’s plan as “a bit of a tradeoff.”UPDATE: Sept. 4 ― The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity issued a statement Wednesday that its “independent, third-party investigator” had found no evidence that the contest described in the news report below had taken place. A summary of Cornell University’s Interfraternity Council’s findings, posted to the school’s website, now reads that “the Review Board did not have evidence and therefore did not find that any individual associated with the chapter had in fact acted on such encouragement or that the contest had actually occurred,” noting that the summary had previously “mischaracterized the findings of the Review Board, including the role of the chapter.”

Previously:

A Cornell University fraternity conducted a game in which new members competed to have sex with the most women ― and additional points were granted in the event of a tie to the contestant who had intercourse with a woman weighing the most, a school investigation revealed recently.

The university’s Fraternity and Sorority Review Board placed Zeta Beta Tau, which called its contest a “pig roast,” on probation for two years because of its misconduct last spring. The ruling also mandated that it hire a “live-in advisor” and receive ongoing education on sexual violence. Most of the chapter will also have to attend two events during Cornell’s Sexual Assault Awareness Week in April.

Ryan Lombardi, vice president for student and campus life, said in a statement the school emailed to HuffPost on Wednesday that ZBT’s actions were “abhorrent to me and antithetical to our values as a community.”

“Behavior that degrades and dehumanizes women contributes to a climate and culture of tolerance for sexual violence,” he said. “While sanctions have been levied against this fraternity by the Fraternity and Sorority Review Board, the campus community will be watching to see whether the members of ZBT ― as individuals and as a group ― live up to their public pledge to demonstrate ‘through our actions that this inexcusable behavior will not be tolerated.’”

ZBT’s Cornell chapter said on Facebook Saturday that the activities “were neither chapter sanctioned activities, nor ones that brothers were aware of. We, too, are in disbelief and even more so that these alleged actions may have been taken by those whom we called brothers.”

The post says the chapter will review its membership and expel anyone not meeting its standards.The truth about “The X-Files” is out there.

Well, with its star David Duchovny (aka Fox Mulder) at least.

In a clip “The Late Late Show with James Corden” posted to YouTube on Monday, the actor addressed some of the more bizarre fan theories that have circulated since the sci-fi drama first hit TV screens back in 1993.

Such as whether Dana Scully (played by Gillian Anderson) was actually immortal, or if aliens influenced the lead actors’ fashion choices.Being Latino doesn’t always mean you can speak Spanish fluently ― just ask BuzzFeed video producer Maya Murillo.

The fourth-generation Mexican-American knew Spanish as a teen but lost it over the years, and recently took on the challenge of relearning it in 60 days.

In a BuzzFeed video published Monday, Murillo first asked her parents why it wasn’t a priority for them to teach her the language when she was young.

Murillo’s mother, Kathy, explained why her own parents never really taught her Spanish.

“They moved us to a predominantly non-Latino area,” she said. ”[As] a middle-class Mexican-American family, they wanted their kids to have equal opportunity with all of the other kids that were in school. So they didn’t want us to have accents. They didn’t want us to carry what they thought might be excess baggage that they had growing up.”

Murillo’s father, Patrick, added that he felt discouraged to speak Spanish at home because he was made fun of when he tried.

Murillo then described her “emotional journey” toward learning Spanish with the help of a tutor and co-workers, giving honest commentary about her moments of self-doubt and her fear of looking dumb.

Murillo’s case is hardly unique among Latinos. The Pew Research Center analyzed Census Bureau data of the top 25 U.S. metro areas and found that the share of Latinos who speak Spanish declined from 78 percent in 2006 to 73 percent in 2015. Still, the number of Spanish speakers in the United States was at an all-time high as of 2015 thanks to the Latino population’s growth.Safe injection sites already exist in Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.

San Francisco is planning to open two safe injection sites this summer, which city health officials say could help get drug users off the streets into enclosed, supervised centers.

Similar facilities already exist in Canada, Australia and several European countries. And Philadelphia officials in January announced their support for a safe injection sites program. But the San Francisco sites, poised to open as soon as July, would become the first of their kind in the United States.

A task force comprised of public health officials, doctors and advocates has been working since last year to make the sites a reality. Now, city officials say they are just months away from opening the first two safe injection sites of what may some day be a city-wide phenomenon.

Barbara Garcia, director of San Francisco’s Department of Public Health, said two nonprofits already operating needle exchange programs will be selected to open the safe injection sites at their facilities, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday. Garcia said the sites would likely open close to July 1, the start of the city’s fiscal year, and would be privately funded to avoid liability on the city’s part.

Intravenous drug use is illegal under state and federal law.

The streets of San Francisco, particularly in parts of the Tenderloin, South of Market, and Mission neighborhoods, are often littered with discarded needles. It’s common to see people openly shooting up on sidewalks, in public parks and at public transit system locations.

In just one month last year, city officials collected more than 13,000 discarded syringes in the streets, according to The Associated Press. That was up from roughly 2,900 in the same month of the previous year.

It’s unclear what led to the spike in discarded syringes, though heroin use has been on the rise in San Francisco and throughout the U.S. in recent years.

Health officials have warned that the syringes could create a public health crisis, putting passersby at risk of contracting blood-borne diseases like hepatitis and HIV. Other efforts ― including a longstanding needle exchange program and several large kiosks installed by public health officials for needle drops ― have aimed to reduce the waste. But officials say the safe injection sites are the next step in curbing the problem.

“The intent is not to promote or encourage drug use,” London Breed, president of the Board of Supervisors and a vocal supporter of the safe injection site plan, told the Chronicle last year. “The intent is to provide a site that’s not out on the streets, where people more than likely will just throw their needles on the ground.”

Officials say they believe 85 percent of the city’s roughly 22,000 intravenous drug users would use the sites, according to the Chronicle.

A majority of San Francisco residents are in favor of the project. A poll conducted for the Chamber of Commerce in January found that 67 percent of voters in the city support the plan to open safe injection sites.

Still, the sites could face legal obstacles, and legislation to protect the facilities and those associated with them from prosecution has stalled in the state Senate. But Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener said the plan should move forward regardless.Anyone who studies The Wealth Of Nations hoping to glean insights on the mysteries and mechanics of the stock market will be disappointed. Adam Smith didn’t discuss stock exchanges anywhere in the 1,100-plus pages of his foundational capitalist treatise. Nor did Karl Marx feel compelled to include the stock market among the damning contradictions and irrationalities of the capitalist system documented in Das Kapital.

The bestselling economics textbook ever written ― Paul Samuelson’s adventurously titled Economics ― devotes just five of its 608 pages to the stock market, drawing the unhelpful conclusion: “Anyone who can accurately predict the future course of business will prosper, but there is no such person.”

Yet nothing captivates Americans like the stock market. We gape at the great fortunes won and lost on the exchanges, and broadcast the Dow Jones’ minor movements on the nightly news. This week’s wild swings in the market have alternately thrilled and alarmed us.

The stock market is a good story ― one of the best. But it doesn’t mean what most people think it does. The stock market is not an important measure of national well-being, productive capacity or material wealth. It isn’t even a reliable gauge for the health of specific companies, and is only tangentially related to helping them raise capital. The most iconic contemporary capitalist institution is, in truth, inessential to the operation of capitalism itself. The stock market, in the words of the late British economist John Maynard Keynes, is merely “the outcome of the mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals.”

The basics: A stock exchange is where people go to buy and sell shares of corporations. Buying stock gives you an ownership stake in a company, but this stake itself has no inherent value. It doesn’t entitle you to proceeds from the firm’s earnings, or provide you with a stream of revenue. The stock is worth whatever you can get somebody else to pay for it.

Companies issue stock to raise money for personnel, equipment, research and everything else that goes into providing goods and services. But after the stock is issued, its price is no longer directly involved in corporate finance. A company doesn’t see any additional revenue when its stock price increases, or lose cash when it falls. Stock prices are determined by bidders in the stock market ― whatever a willing buyer and seller agree on ― and the profits and losses on stock accrue to those speculators.

We like to think that stock prices are closely connected to events in the real world, and that the values the market assigns are the concrete, reliable assessments of experts. As the market has rocketed this way and that this week, the commentariat has scrambled into action to explain the deeper meaning. Money magazine attributed Monday’s sell-off to new inflation data. MarketWatch told its readers to keep their eye on the yield curve of Treasury bonds. The Guardian, with a bit more precision, explained that investors expect higher interest rates from the Fed.

But none of this is really true. When Keynes bemoaned the ignorance of stock traders more than 80 years ago, he wasn’t insulting their education. He was pointing out that any precise value judgments about a company’s future prospects require knowledge of the future ― something nobody possesses.

A fall in oil prices might signal a profit boost for a shipping company, but not if political instability disrupts its trade route. The meaning and value of each new piece of data that traders evaluate is dependent on a flood of unknowable future data.

The point is that stock traders don’t respond to new information, they respond to each other. When they bid on stock prices, traders aren’t stating their beliefs about the “true” value of a company, but making inferences about how to play the reactions of other traders, who, in turn, are doing the same thing. When corporate earnings come in unexpectedly high, traders expect the stock to go up and bid accordingly. It has very little to do with a company’s long-term or even near-term prospects. It’s just what people do.

This means that the value of a company’s stock, while based on an enormous amount of information, is inherently unstable and essentially arbitrary.

At the moment, a lot of people believe that the stock market is “overvalued” ― although this idea itself wrongly assumes there is some “real” stock market value that the market has pulled away from. Years of low interest rates from the Federal Reserve have discouraged people from buying interest-bearing bonds and spurred purchases of stock instead. When the GOP cut corporate taxes, it created the prospect of companies paying out dividends to shareholders or buying back stock to drive up the price. The Fed is now steadily raising interest rates, and plenty of stock experts think traders have gotten a little carried away with tax-cut enthusiasm. And so, while the economic data is pretty good, there is a consensus in some quarters that the market is due for dip.

This doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the real world, so more cautious economic analysts like Neil Irwin at The New York Times urge their readers to focus not on stock price swings, but on economic “fundamentals” ― things like employment, wages and interest rates ― in assessing the country’s economic prospects. And if the stock market were, in fact, nothing more than a lightly regulated casino, this would be the end of the story.

But over the past half-century, we have instead imbued the stock market with an almost cosmic significance. We use stock prices to evaluate the performance of corporate executives. Business schools teach aspiring young men and women that “shareholder value” is the only appropriate pursuit for corporate leaders.

Because the business world believes stock prices reflect deep metaphysical truths about the state of commerce, big movements in the stock market do, in fact, affect real-world decisions about trade. Even if its revenues are strong, a company might pull back on major investments in the face of a declining stock market, worried about pessimism over corporate prospects in general. Bankers looking at a stock slump might decide to withhold loans from perfectly responsible businesses. Even if it’s an ideal time to upgrade its equipment or expand its operations, a company might decide to be tight-fisted about expenses to prove its fiscal discipline to shareholders when the stock price is low.

Most alarming, we have made the financial security of the elderly almost completely dependent on stock market values by making 401k plans and mutual funds the flagship operations of our retirement system. The value of your nest egg is dependent not on your thrift or prudence, but on when you happen to invest, and when you need to cash out.

But even with that, only about half of all Americans own stock, either directly or indirectly through retirement accounts. And the vast majority of stocks ― over 86 percent, according to People’s Policy Project President Matt Bruenig ― are owned by the richest 10 percent of households. To the extent that the strange casino of the stock market does, in fact, create wealth, it almost exclusively circulates it among the rich.The reviews are in, and it looks as if “Black Panther” is being hailed as one of the best Marvel films yet.

We’d be the bad liar if we said 2017 wasn’t a rough year for Selena Gomez.

The singer and actress returned to the public eye after an extended career break, disappeared again to undergo a kidney transplant and then split from her boyfriend The Weeknd, only to get back together with her ex Justin Bieber shortly after.

The freshly blonde former Disney star covered the March issue of Harper’s Bazaar and got candid about her tumultuous personal life and hopes for the new year in a conversation with “13 Reasons Why” star Katherine Langford.

“I’ve had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety, and I’ve been very vocal about it, but it’s not something I feel I’ll ever overcome,” she said. “There won’t be a day when I’m like, ‘Here I am in a pretty dress — I won!’ I think it’s a battle I’m gonna have to face for the rest of my life, and I’m okay with that because I know that I’m choosing myself over anything else. I’m starting my year off with that thought. I want to make sure I’m healthy. If that’s good, everything else will fall into place.”

Harpers Bazaar

Gomez, who’s become one of the most outspoken mental health advocates of her generation, reportedly completed a two-week treatment program for depression and anxiety in New York City recently.

Since 2014, Gomez has sought treatment on at least four occasions for related “emotional issues” stemming from her lupus diagnosis, with her longest stint lasting 90 days at a center in Tennessee in 2016.

That’s how the “Wolves” singer knows that her mental health is a marathon, not a sprint, even if that means fans will have to wait a little longer for her third studio album.

“I don’t really set goals ’cause I don’t want to be disappointed if I don’t reach them, but I do want to work on my music too,” she explained. “My next album has been forever in the making. When people ask me why, I’m honest about it: It’s because I haven’t been ready. I mean, point-blank, I don’t feel confident enough in where my music is yet. If that takes 10 years, then it takes 10 years. I don’t care. Right now I just want to be super intentional with all of the things I’m doing.”

In 2017, Gomez dropped a trio of well-received singles, “Bad Liar,” “Fetish” and “Wolves,” without doing much promotion or signaling when we can expect more music.

Harpers Bazaar

Until Gomez has to step into the public eye to promote an album or a new movie, she says she’s more than content to spend her Saturday nights at home with sister Gracie or even at the neighborhood Chili’s.

She revealed: “If I want to hang out with my friends, I don’t really go to a lot of trendy places, so people know they shouldn’t really invite me to those places ’cause I’m not gonna go.Will Smith indulged in some good-natured trolling to celebrate his musician son Jaden Smith hitting 100 million Spotify streams.

The new mom to Stormi Webster (yes, you didn’t hallucinate that name reveal) now has the most-liked photo on Instagram ever after racking up more than 14 million likes just a day after posting the first look at her baby girl.

Jenner shared the post on Tuesday with the much-discussed name of the family’s latest addition in the caption. Stormi grabs hold of her mom’s thumb in the photo, looking ever so adorable in the background.

The beauty mogul also racked up over 60 million views on a clip from her 11-minute pregnancy confirmation video she posted on the social media app days before.

Beyoncé previously set the record with 11.2 million likes in 2017 when she announced on Instagram she was expecting twins. After much speculation about her pregnancy, the “Lemonade” singer shared an instantly iconic photo of herself seated under a veil with her hands on her stomach and an intricate floral display in the background.

“We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over,” she wrote in the caption. “We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.”

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST

However, Jenner wasn’t the first to beat the mother of three in social media popularity. In fact, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo topped Bey’s post with an impressive 11.3 million likes on an Instagram of himself in November to announce the birth of his fourth child.

A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) on Nov 12, 2017 at 12:19pm PST

“More and more, we’re seeing the world’s most influential public figures turn to Instagram to share their most intimate and personal moments, and in turn, bring Instagram’s global community in on the joy and celebration,” an Instagram representative told HuffPost in a statement about Jenner’s post.

Now, all we can do is pray this makes Bey drop another photo of her twins, Rumi and Sir, right away.Ignore your Insta, sign out of Facebook and turn on your out-of-office, because it’s time for a real vacation, sans cell phone.

HACIENDA ALTAGRACIA, AN AUBERGE RESORT

1. Hacienda AltaGracia (Pérez Zeledón, Costa Rica)

Hacienda AltaGracia — a lush boutique hotel in the Pérez Zeledón southern region of Costa Rica — first opened in 2011 as a remote family retreat and coffee farm. The property, featuring 50 hacienda-style casitas, may have gotten a luxe makeover when Auberge took it over in 2015, but it hasn’t lost its authentic, off-the-beaten-path vibe. With a top-notch spa, an on-site equestrian program and wildlife refuge excursions, guests won’t mind the spotty cell service. Three cheers for upping your nature game, and giving HQ Trivia a rest for a week (…but there is free Wi-Fi…shhh).

HOMEAWAY

5. The Fox Den Cabin (Seward, Alaska)

This one-bedroom, one-bath cabin is so tucked away that guests can arrive only by — wait for it — helicopter or boat (mic drop). Fifteen miles outside Seward on Resurrection Bay, the Fox Den is a secluded respite from everyday life. Leave your phone behind and enjoy the sublime views of the 49th state’s wildlife. If you’re lucky, you might even spot some whales swimming in the bay from the cedar sundeck.

BLACKBIRD CAYE RESORT

6. Blackbird Caye Resort (Turneffe Atoll, Belize)

In an area known for diving, this idyllic resort is said to have some of the best. Guests can also snorkel, kayak, fish or just relax in one of the many screened-in balconies or hammocks facing the Caribbean Sea. Thatched-roof cottages and private oceanfront cabanas are the norm at this all-inclusive resort, which offers excellent service and plenty of privacy. That said, what Blackbird Caye doesn’t have is cell service… or reliable Wi-Fi. And maybe that’s a good thing.

A California judge has overturned the state’s right-to-die law, which allows terminally ill people to take their own lives with the aid of a physician.

Judge Daniel A. Ottolia of the Riverside County Superior Court ruled Tuesday that the End of Life Option Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed into law in 2015, was passed improperly and was therefore invalid. The plaintiffs argued that the legislature had violated the state constitution by passing the law during a special session called specifically to handle matters of health care funding ― and not end-of-life issues.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) has five days to challenge the decision before it goes into effect.

“We strongly disagree with this ruling and the State is seeking expedited review in the Court of Appeal,” Becerra said in a statement Tuesday.

Advocates for the law said they are optimistic that an appeals court will overturn Ottolia’s ruling.

“We respectfully believe the Court misinterpreted the application of the state constitution to this law because medical aid in dying is a recognized health care option,” said John C. Kappos, an attorney representing Compassion & Choices, a leading advocacy group for the “death with dignity” movement. Kappos added that “the strong majority of Californians support” the law.

Opponents of the law were pleased with Tuesday’s results. The Life Legal Defense Foundation, one of the advocacy groups that challenged the law in court, said the judge’s ruling “reinstates critical legal protections for vulnerable patients.”

“The court made it very clear that assisted suicide has nothing to do with increasing access to health care and that hijacking the special session to advance an unrelated agenda is impermissible,” Alexandra Snyder, the group’s executive director, said in a statement.

The California law, which went into effect in 2016, allows terminally ill patients who have been given a prognosis of six months or less to live to obtain a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. It’s still up to individual doctors and hospitals to decide whether they will offer this option to patients.

While some opponents have voiced concerns over potential abuse, the law has several built-in safeguards. Two doctors have to sign off on the patient’s prognosis, and the patient must make the request for lethal medication once in writing and twice verbally, with at least 15 days between the requests. The patient must also be considered mentally stable and capable of making decisions about their own health.

The legislation was inspired by California resident Brittany Maynard, who made national news in 2014 by moving to Oregon to end her own life after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer at age 29.

“I am heartbroken that I had to leave behind my home, my community and my friends in California. But I am dying and I refuse to lose my dignity. I refuse to subject myself and my family to purposeless, prolonged pain and suffering at the hands of an incurable disease,” Maynard told lawmakers in a video message she recorded before her death in late 2014.

According to a state report, 111 terminally ill Californians exercised their right to die in the first six months after the law went into effect. The state has not released data on how many people have opted for lethal medication under the law since then.A screengrab from Squawker about the fake leak story. Squawker

Over the past 24 hours, the right-wing internet detectives who gave us such hits as “globalist pedophiles chose to headquarter their child sex ring in the middle of a crowded pizza parlor” and “George Soros paid Nazis to march in Charlottesville” have been giddy over a new item supposedly bolstering their cause.

According to fringe sites, countless right-wing Twitter personalities, newfound Trump family friends Diamond and Silk, and r/TheDonald, someone just leaked all of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner’s contacts with the promise of more to come. The most popular theory is that the leak was perpetrated by a rogue FBI agent.

You can see the appeal of such a narrative to the modern conspiracist mindset: some lone G-man, defying the Trotskyist takeover of the bureau and owning the libs by revealing some phone numbers.

Unfortunately for them, it’s bullshit. The contacts that were released are actually from the original Guccifer hack of longtime Clinton family confidant Sidney Blumenthal in 2013. This specific list has been online since at least August 2016.

The list features phone numbers and email addresses for names like George Soros, John Podesta and Hillary Clinton, some of our right-wing keyboard warriors’ favorite recurring characters. The tweet below appears to be the first claim that these contacts originated with Weiner:

1St of 12 drops of the Weiner Files. More to come.



RT. https://t.co/9CvL2eOCWY — ((ReleaseTheTexts)) (@CJohns555) February 6, 2018

People quickly jumped on it as a sign of ... something. The website Squawker.com seemed particularly confident that this list came from Weiner, though it gave no indication of why, writing:

It’s important to note that we are not trying to “witch hunt” anyone, and this information is not meant for you to do the same. We are not interested in doxxing these individuals, rather we are interested in reporting on the doxxing list that was released, potentially by a rogue FBI agent. This laptop is under FBI surveillance and the reason we know this is because they found emails sent between him and Hillary Clinton back when the email scandal was all anyone ever talked about. Who else but someone in the FBI would have released this? We aren’t saying that it’s definitely a member of the FBI, but who else could possibly be responsible?

Twitter, of course, ran with it.

He might have lied to FBI.

But FBI knew that by 2nd FISA.

And come ON, who are we kidding? They knew it all.



I wonder if Weiner laptop contacts are a little hint that FBI needs to step it up and confess or someone will out them? I'd hope so.

Reddit, too, was gleeful over this supposed triumph.

Some of the users pointed to the fact that the contact list had already been discussed on 4chan. While 4chan did revel in the supposed Weiner leak Tuesday night, the site was equally delighted in 2016, when the exact same contact list popped up in a thread.

That discussion was archived in full by automated 4chan crawler Holla Forums, but we’ve included a few choice bits below.

(For those blissfully unaware, the users in the middle are expressing their delight with the leak.)

Not everyone was immediately swayed. In both the Reddit and 4chan discussions, people point to the fact that the list seems identical to the one released by Guccifer in 2016. But those few glimmers of reason are vastly outnumbered by the celebrations of yet another supposed triumph over the left.Tom Brady looked completely deflated after the New England Patriots lost the Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.

Brady, the Patriots’ longtime quarterback, has won five previous Super Bowls with the team.

And although Brady’s wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, kept things classy by congratulating Eagles players after the game, many of the team’s fans were ecstatic that the Patriots — and Brady — had lost.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON — SpaceX made history Tuesday afternoon when it successfully launched its new Falcon Heavy rocket carrying an electric car bound for deep space and returned two of three 15-story boosters back to Earth for perfect vertical landings.

The initial test launch of what is now the world’s most powerful operational rocket marks the latest milestone in billionaire Elon Musk’s quest to send humans to Mars and eventually colonize the red planet.

The Falcon Heavy consists of three Falcon 9 rockets, which SpaceX has been using for years to deploy satellites and run resupply missions to the International Space Station. With 27 engines, Falcon Heavy gives off more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff — equivalent to 18 Boeing 747 aircraft — and is capable lifting 140,000 pounds into orbit. That’s equivalent to a fully loaded 737 aircraft.

That Tuesday’s launch at 3:45 p.m. from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida went off without a hitch is remarkable.

“This is a test mission,” Musk told The New York Times ahead of liftoff. “There is so much that can go wrong.”

In an interview with CNN, Musk warned that spectators could expect either “a great rocket launch or the best fireworks display they’ve ever seen.”

The payload on the inaugural test flight was, rather appropriately, a product of Musk’s other brainchild, Tesla. The electric car, a red convertible Roadster, is slated to be deployed six hours after liftoff. If all goes well, it and a dummy driver named “Starman” will be sent into orbit around the sun. They will reach a speed of 7 miles per second and travel approximately 250 million miles from Earth, eventually passing close by the red planet.

The car could remain in orbit for a billion years. And there’s an “extremely tiny” chance that it could crash into Mars, Musk told The New York Times.

“That was awesome,” a SpaceX commentator said roughly five minutes into the launch. “That’s all I can really say.”

A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Feb 4, 2018 at 9:50pm PST

Along with a successful maiden launch, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, managed to recover two of its boosters. Both were used during previous flights in 2016 and landed simultaneously on land at Cape Canaveral.

A third booster was expected to land on a floating platform in the Atlantic. But instead of capturing a successful landing, the onboard camera appeared to show smoke before cutting out entirely. More than 45 minutes after the launch, SpaceX had not provided an update on the fate of the center booster.

In late 2015, the company sent shockwaves through the space community when it landed a booster back on Earth — the first ever successful attempt to recover a rocket from an orbital flight. At the time a SpaceX commentator compared the feat to “launching a pencil over the Empire State Building, having it reverse, come back down, and land on a shoebox on the ground during a windstorm.”

Less than a year later, after four failed attempts to land a Falcon 9 on floating platforms in the Atlantic, SpaceX nailed a seemingly impossible at-sea landing aboard a drone ship named “Of Course I Still Love You.”

SpaceX is developing rockets that can be reused in an effort to make space flight cheaper and easier. While it costs between $200,000 to $300,000 to refill the rocket, the rocket itself costs $60 million, Musk has said.

The effort has come with many setbacks. In September 2016, for example, a Falcon 9 burst into flames on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Musk called it “the most difficult and complex failure” the company has had in its 14-year history.

In 2016, Musk unveiled plans to make humans a “multi-planet species.” He hopes to eventually build a self-sustainable Martian colony of 1 million people by building a massive “Interplanetary Transport System.” Like something out of a science fiction film, giant spaceships would shuttle upward of 100 people ― perhaps many more in the future ― plus luggage and other cargo to and from the red planet.

To help pay for it, the billionaire business magnate and tech entrepreneur has proposed launching a network of 4,425 satellites ― each the size of a car ― to provide the entire globe with high-speed internet.WASHINGTON ― White House chief of staff John Kelly said Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s offer to save undocumented young people ― though only if he can build a border wall and slash legal immigration ― is generous because it would help immigrants who may have previously been “too lazy” to seek protections.

Trump has said he would support a path to citizenship for the 690,000 people protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, as well as for anyone who is eligible for the program but didn’t sign up. The White House estimates that’s 1.8 million people total, leading Kelly to call the president’s proposal “stunning.”

“The difference between 690 [thousand] and 1.8 million were the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn’t sign up,” Kelly said, according to The Washington Post. “So the president, shockingly, said OK, 1.8 million, and then probably the biggest shock was in a path to citizenship. That’s beyond what anyone could have imagined.”

He doubled down on his comments later in the day, telling reporters that people “just should have probably gotten off the couch and signed up.”

Kelly was at the Capitol talking to lawmakers about the president’s immigration framework, which includes a path to citizenship for some so-called Dreamers, or undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children. Trump also wants more border security, an end to the diversity visa lottery and to phase out types of so-called “chain migration,” which allows Americans and legal permanent residents to sponsor certain family members for green cards.

Trump and administration officials have insisted this is a reasonable compromise, but Democrats don’t see it that way, given the massive cuts to legal immigration pathways. Even some Republicans view the president’s proposal as unworkable. Meanwhile, the White House has shot down bipartisan bills that don’t include the same cuts to legal immigration.

Kelly said he “can’t imagine” anyone voting against Trump’s framework.

“I would offer that if before the champions of DACA were members on one side of the aisle, I would say right now the champion of all people that are DACA is Donald Trump,” he said. “But you would never write that.”

“It’s likely that people will lose protections in large numbers in March if Congress does nothing, in addition to the estimated 122 people who have lost protections daily since September.”

Dreamers are in this situation because Trump rescinded DACA in September and told Congress it had six months ― until March 5 ― to find a solution. The administration is currently accepting DACA renewal applications under a court order, but it can take months for those reviews to be completed. Trump is also fighting that ruling.

It’s likely that people will lose protections in large numbers in March if Congress does nothing, in addition to the estimated 122 people who have lost protections daily since Trump ended the program.

It’s expensive to apply for DACA ― the application fee is nearly $500 every two years, and that doesn’t count potential lawyer fees. That can make it difficult for some people to apply, especially if they are in school, working under the table or helping to support their families. Others, as Kelly mentioned, did not apply because they’re afraid of the government having their information.

Some lawmakers have argued that perhaps Trump could just extend DACA. However, officials have said that isn’t possible because the president has called the program unconstitutional, and Kelly said he doesn’t think Trump has that authority. He also said Trump would not ask Congress for some sort of extension.

But Kelly insisted that DACA recipients, should they lose their protections, would not be a priority for detention or deportation.TOKYO (Reuters) - A rout in global equities deepened in Asia on Tuesday as inflation worries gripped financial markets, sending U.S. stock futures sinking further into the red after Wall Street suffered its biggest decline since 2011.

S&P mini futures fell as much as 3.0 percent to four-month lows, extending their losses from the record peak hit just over a week ago to 12 percent, abruptly ending their smooth bull run of recent years. They last stood down 1.1 percent.

The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 slumped 4.1 percent and the Dow 4.6 percent on Monday, suffering their biggest percentage drops since August 2011.

Before Monday’s fall, the index had not seen a pullback of more than 5 percent for more than 400 sessions, which analysts said was the longest such streak in history.

“Since last autumn, investors had been betting on the Goldilocks economy - solid economic expansion, improving corporate earnings and stable inflation. But the tide seems to have changed,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

The gloom is seen enveloping European shares, with spread-betters expecting Germany’s Dax to sink 6.6 percent to five-month lows, France’s Cac 6.1 percent to possibly 11-month lows and Britain’s FTSE 4.8 percent to 14-month lows.

In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 3.4 percent. Taiwan shares lost 5.0 percent, its biggest since in 2011 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 4.2 percent.

Japan’s Nikkei dived 4.7 percent, its worst fall since November 2016, to four-month lows.

The trigger for the sell-off was a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields following Friday’s data that showed U.S. wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009, raising the alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

That could be painful for markets that have been propped up by central banks’ stimulus for many years.

Some analysts also say markets tend to get edgy when the U.S. Federal Reserve has a new leadership.

The new Fed chief Jerome Powell, who succeeded Janet Yellen this month, is expected to continue Yellen’s stance of gradual tightening. Still, some investors regard a change in the Fed leadership as a source of policy uncertainty.

The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 2.885 percent on Monday, its highest in four years and 47 basis points above the 2.411 percent seen at the end of 2017.

But a massive fall in share prices prompted an about-turn, and in Asian trade on Tuesday, it fell back to as low as 2.662 percent.

Fed fund futures are now pricing in only two rate hikes this year, a sea change from only a few days ago when they priced in about 80 percent chance of three increases with the market even rife with talk of four hikes.

The CBOE Volatility index, the closely followed “fear-index” measure of expected near-term stock market volatility jumped 20 points to 30.71, its highest since August 2015.

That left some popular exchange-traded products that investors use to benefit from calm market conditions facing potential liquidation.

“There is weakness across various equity sectors, but none so large the market is likely to fall through them. My money remains on equities - but rotating (and buying on weakness) into ‘value’ areas of the market that have lagged in the recent momentum-driven rally,” said James Bateman, chief investment officer for multi-asset at Fidelity International.

“I’d also be avoiding stocks where dividend yields aren’t backed up by strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet,” he added.

But Yoshinori Shigemi, market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the specter of inflation will gradually undermine the attraction of equities even though the markets could rebound in the short term.

“In the end, the Fed will have to hike rates. And if it doesn’t, long-dated bonds will be sold off on worries about inflation. Either way, that is going to slow down the economy. Rising wages also mean corporate profit margins will be squeezed gradually down the road,” he said.

Keen to avoid further risk, investors are closing their positions in other assets, including the currency market where a popular strategy has been to sell the dollar against the euro and other currencies seen as benefiting from higher interest rates in the future.

The euro eased to $1.2371, not far from last week’s low of $1.2335, a break of which could usher in a further correction after its rally to a 3-year high of $1.2538 late last month.

Against the yen, which is often used as a safe-haven currency because of Japan’s solid current account surplus, the dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 108.86 yen, after having lost one percent on Monday.

Bitcoin was not spared from the selling either, falling more than 10 percent to a 12-week low of $6,116. That represented a 69 percent fall from its record high of $19,666, touched on Dec. 17.

Investors also dumped junk bonds, with the yield of Merrill Lynch U.S. high yield index rising to 6.017 percent from 5.964 percent at the end of last week.

Still, it was far below its 2016 peak just above 10 percent, when low oil prices hurt energy firms.

Oil prices also dropped, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low. It last stood at $66.97 per barrel, down 1.0 percent on the day.Getty

“Black Panther” is proving that the most formidable superpower in the Marvel Universe may be representation.

There’s still more than a week left before director Ryan Coogler debuts the hero’s first stand-alone film on Feb. 16, but fans couldn’t wait to express the importance of seeing black excellence in film.

Kayla Marie Sutton, curator of the “Black Girl Nerds” podcast’s social media accounts, started the hashtag #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe on Twitter Tuesday morning. The Afro-Latina says she tweeted the hashtag after asking her son what the Wakandan prince meant to him.

Sharing this experience with my son, who jumps and shakes with excitement every time he sees his favorite comic character's trailer on tv. He gets representation and its about damn time. #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe https://t.co/OczeBN3GEE — Kayla Marie (@Maria_Giesela) February 6, 2018

“This was inspired by a question that I asked my son yesterday,” Sutton told HuffPost in a direct message. “He has been reading the comics (like me) and as a young black male with autism I wanted to know what this movie meant to him. It got me thinking about the impact this movie is going to have on so many.”

“This film is so unapologetically black and growing up on the outside of the nerd community as an ‘other,’ to have a film filled with people that look like me and my family is the most amazing gift,” she added.

Sutton wasn’t alone in her sentiment, as #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe quickly began to trend on Twitter. People highlighted several reasons why they felt represented by the film, including the positive portrayal of an African nation and the important role of black scientists in Wakanda.

Like many Black Panther fans, Sutton has yet to see the film but already has plans to see an early screening and then attend a “sensory-friendly screening” with her son on opening weekend.

The social media influencer says she’s been touched by people’s responses to the hashtag and “can’t wait to see the reactions post-opening weekend.”
