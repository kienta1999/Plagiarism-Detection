White House trade adviser Peter Navarro escalated President Donald Trump’s attacks on the news media Sunday morning, characterizing The Washington Post as “fake news most of the time.”

Speaking with host Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Navarro brushed off a Washington Post story from Saturday that described turmoil in the White House. He specifically denied the newspaper’s report that White House chief of staff John Kelly is threatening to resign.

“Every day of his adult life,” Navarro said, “John Kelly’s gotten up in the morning to serve America. He’s a great man, a courageous man –– he serves the president, he has the president’s ear, he runs the West Wing well. That’s all I know, that’s all I see.”

He added, “When you read stuff in The Washington Post, frankly, that’s fake news most of the time.”

Todd pushed back, calling Navarro’s comment a “cheap shot.”

“I think that expression is a pretty unfair thing to say about a major news organization,” Todd said.

“Mr. Todd, that is not a cheap shot,” Navarro replied. “Because if you look at the newspapers that I read every day across the spectrum, The Washington Post, in my judgment, tends to attack the president more than any other newspaper in its news stories. You can do anything you want in your editorials, sir, but you cannot do that in your news stories.”

Todd interrupted him: “The term ‘fake news’ is not exactly a way to hold up the First Amendment, especially when the Russian government, just this morning, is using that phrase.”

While Trump claims to have coined the term “fake news,” Vox reports that the strategy of using fake news to disorient and manipulate voters was pioneered by the Russian government in the 1990s and 2000s.

A federal grand jury in February indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities, charging that they interfered in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s candidacy by posing as Americans and creating fake social media accounts to spread propaganda.

Trump has frequently invoked “fake news” to attack mainstream media coverage he doesn’t like. He tweeted Sunday morning that The Washington Post is “garbage” and “more fiction than fact.”

The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. Story on John Kelly isn’t true, just another hit job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018

New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended the Washington Post on CNN Sunday morning, noting that every deeply reported story about turmoil in the White House by the paper or the Times so far has been “verified.”

“If [Trump] creates a culture where ‘Fox and Friends’ and Jesse Watters are regarded as ‘serious journalism,’ and the New York Times and Washington Post are not, he will have done longstanding, harmful effect on the country,” Baquet said.Professional hockey teams across North America came together to pay tribute to the victims of Friday’s deadly bus crash in Canada that killed 15 people, including 10 junior hockey players of Saskatchewan’s Humboldt Broncos.

At Saturday night’s match between the Winnipeg Jets and the Chicago Blackhawks in Winnipeg, players wore jerseys with the same team name, “Broncos,” printed on their back as their nameplates.

“In place of individual names, ‘Broncos’ is meant to symbolize the unity and support of our hockey communities coming together as one for the Humboldt Broncos’ family,” the National Hockey League said in a press release.

“Tonight, we’re all Broncos,” the NHL tweeted while sharing a video of the teams’ touching pre-game tribute that included a photo of the young players, aged 16 to 21, on the arena’s jumbotron.

“Hockey is family,” the Arizona Coyotes organization tweeted following a moment of silence during the team’s match against the Anaheim Ducks.

A GoFundMe account created for the Broncos’ players and family members had received more than $3 million in donations as of Sunday.

The Los Angeles Kings also announced that they will donate the proceeds from their Saturday night raffle to those affected by the crash. Other teams have vowed similar donations.

The Broncos’ team captain, as well as nine other players, two coaches, a radio play-by-play announcer and a statistician from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey team, were all killed in the bus crash while heading to a semifinal playoff game.

One of the players killed, 21-year-old Logan Boulet, had been on life support up until Saturday night. His family later shared that his organs would be donated to help at least six different people.

“Logan made it clear previously that he signed his donor card as soon as he turned 21. Even in his eventual passing, he will be a selfless hero,” his family said in a statement obtained by Canada’s Global News.“I feel an incredible sense of relief,” said Gavin Grimm. The Washington Post via Getty Images

A Virginia federal court on Tuesday denied a motion to dismiss the case of transgender teen Gavin Grimm, whose fight to use the school bathroom that aligned with his gender identity became a focal point in the trans rights movement.

The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied the Gloucester County School Board’s motion to dismiss Grimm’s case and maintained that transgender students are protected under Title IX and the Constitution from exclusionary bathroom policies based on their gender identity.

“I feel an incredible sense of relief,” Grimm, 19, said in a statement. “After fighting this policy since I was 15 years old, I finally have a court decision saying that what the Gloucester County School Board did to me was wrong and it was against the law. I was determined not to give up because I didn’t want any other student to have to suffer the same experience that I had to go through.”

Grimm’s fight began in 2014 when, as a sophomore at Gloucester High School, he was prohibited from using the boys’ bathroom and instructed to only use a unisex restroom.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a civil rights lawsuit against the school district on behalf of Grimm, thrusting the formerly shy teen into the spotlight as the new face of trans activism. On Tuesday, the court affirmed the teen’s fight by denying the school board’s motion to dismiss the case. It also directed the parties to schedule a settlement conference within 30 days.

U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen wrote that the board’s policy fails to acknowledge there are individuals who possess both male and female characteristics. “As Mr. Grimm contends, attempting to draw lines based on physiological and anatomical characteristics proves unmanageable: how would the Board’s policy apply to individuals who have had genital surgery, individuals whose genitals were injured in an accident, or those with intersex traits who have genital characteristics that are neither typically male nor female?”

Wright Allen is a former prosecutor and federal public defender who previously overturned Virginia’s same-sex marriage ban and was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama.

Wright Allen wrote that there was “no doubt” that transgender individuals had historically been subjected to discrimination, noting the high rates of violence and discrimination against members of the transgender community. She said that the board’s policy was a sex-based classification because it relied on sex-based stereotypes. “The Policy classified Mr. Grimm differently on the basis of his transgender status and, accordingly, subjected him to sex stereotyping.”

HuffPost spoke with Grimm in the hours following the decision. At the time the court ruling was announced, Grimm was in bed with his cat. He received a text from someone on his legal team about the ruling.

Grimm said he had “no expectations” of a favorable ruling, only “hope.”

“It’s something we’ve all known for a very long time, that this is illegal and unacceptable, but to finally have the court make that in plain language is really fantastic,” said Grimm.

Now that he’s graduated from high school, the ruling no longer directly impacts Grimm’s daily experience. But he does have a friend who still attends his alma mater who will be affected by the court decision.

“I’m really over the moon,” said Grimm, who will be going out to dinner with friends Tuesday night to celebrate.

Joshua Block, an ACLU senior staff attorney, said the district court’s ruling “vindicates” Grimm and other transgender students who have felt stigmatized by their schools’ bathroom policies.

“These sorts of discriminatory policies do nothing to protect privacy and only serve to harm and humiliate transgender students,” Block said in a statement.

This has been updated with comment from Grimm. Rebecca Klein contributed reporting.LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Bob Dylan, Kesha and Valerie June are among the musicians and singers reimagining classic love songs as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender anthems in a new album released on Thursday.

The six-song “Universal Love” album is meant to give the community songs that reflect their own gender identity by flipping pronouns or having male and female singers reverse traditional roles.

Dylan, the Nobel Prize-winning composer and performer, covers “He’s Funny That Way,” a standard sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Diana Ross that has also been part of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby’s songbooks as “She’s Funny That Way.”

Guitarist and singer St. Vincent, who has said publicly she identifies as neither gay nor straight, performs “And Then She Kissed Me,” a version of girl group The Crystals’ 1963 hit “Then He Kissed Me.”

“The great thing about music is that it transcends all the barriers and boundaries, and goes right to peoples’ hearts,” St. Vincent said. “And everyone has a heart.”

Other songs on the album include pop star Kesha’s “I Need a Woman to Love Me,” a version of Janis Joplin’s “I Need a Man to Love” and blues-folk singer Valerie June’s “Mad About the Girl,” a cover of Dinah Washington’s “Mad About the Boy.”

Singers Ben Gibbard of indie rock groups Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service, and Keke Okereke of British rock group Bloc Party also contributed to the album.

The album is backed by MGM Resorts International, Interpublic Group of Companies’ ad agency McCann and Legacy Recordings, a division of Sony Music.“Saturday Night Live” viewers initially figured they’d have to wait to find out for sure about Card B’s baby bump after watching her first performance. She donned a wild feather dress with a giant poof over her belly while performing a medley of “Bodak Yellow” and “Bartier Cardi” from her debut album “Invasion of Privacy,” which dropped Friday. So no luck there.

But she switched it up big time during her second performance. The Bronx-born rapper performed her hit song “Be Careful” in a body-hugging white floor-length gown, which undoubtedly revealed a ... substantial bump as the camera pulled back.

Cardi, 25, is rumored to already be seven months pregnant with her first child with Migos rapper fiancé Offset. TMZ, which first reported the news, said that the artist is due the first week of July. She’s been wearing full dresses and baggy pants to leave everyone guessing — until Saturday night.

Offset also confirmed, saying in a tweet that he and Cardi are “looking forward to our next chapter together.”

SICK!”

....to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018

Trump, often reluctant to criticize Putin, suggested there would be a “big price to pay,” though it’s unclear if he was referring to the Russian and Iranian governments for backing the oppressive Syrian leader or the Syrian government for allegedly carrying out the attack.

A chemical attack in the rebel-held Syrian town of eastern Ghouta on Saturday left at least 49 people dead, including over a dozen children, according to the Syrian American Medical Society, a medical relief organization. Aid groups blamed Assad’s government for the attack, though the Russian-backed regime denied it was behind it.

Trump ordered a military strike against the Assad regime in April 2017 in response to a brutal chemical attack that killed over 70 civilians in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. Trump has recently said that he would like U.S. military forces to pull out of Syria.

The State Department said Sunday it was working to confirm if the Syrian government was behind the suspected chemical attack.

“These reports, if confirmed, are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.

Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama on Sunday for failing to end the bloody conflict in Syria “long ago.” He tweeted that Obama should have followed through on his 2012 pledge to intervene militarily if the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its people.

If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018

The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Monday to address the suspected chemical attack in Syria, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley announced Sunday.

In a statement Sunday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called on Trump to respond “decisively” to the attack.

“President Trump was quick to call out Assad today, along with the Russian and Iranian governments, on Twitter,” McCain said. “The question now is whether he will do anything about it. The president responded decisively when Assad used chemical weapons last year. He should do so again, and demonstrate that Assad will pay a price for his war crimes.”Chelsea Handler and Jimmy Kimmel have both come under fire for "bottom" jokes. Getty Images

Chelsea Handler and Jimmy Kimmel are feeling the heat on social media this weekend after separately cracking jokes that many have deemed homophobic.

On Friday, Handler joked that Attorney General Jeff Sessions preferred to be on the receiving end of gay sex.

Jeff Sessions is definitely a bottom. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) April 6, 2018

The tweet had drawn over 4,000 replies as of Sunday afternoon, with many arguing that Handler had missed the mark with her joke.

pls stop — Calvin (@calvinstowell) April 6, 2018

Handler, who incensed members of the LGBTQ community earlier this year with a gay sex-referencing tweet aimed at Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), responded to the outcry later on Friday.

Retweeting one critic of her original tweet, she quipped that she, too, was “proud” to identify as a “bottom.”

I’m a bottom, and I’m proud of it. https://t.co/wPs7c7ZBb8 — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) April 6, 2018

Kimmel, meanwhile, also came under fire from many LGBTQ rights advocates Friday when he used similar allusions to gay sex in tweets directed at Fox News host Sean Hannity.

When your clown makeup rubs off on Trump’s ass, does it make his butt look like a Creamsicle? https://t.co/DEhmfOh0Hn — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) April 6, 2018

The two media personalities had been involved in a war of words for much of the previous week, after Hannity blasted Kimmel as an “assclown” and a “despicable disgrace” for mocking first lady Melania Trump’s accent in a segment that aired Wednesday.

But, once again, many weren’t laughing at Kimmel’s retorts.

If you're a straight comic denigrating Trump cronies with gay sex jokes, remember: Gay sex is better than their whole lives and maybe yours too. — Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) April 7, 2018

In front of audiences at comedy clubs, gay comics have to teach straight people about queer things, do extra set up and tone down the gay because “too gay” doesn’t work. Yet, all a straight person has to do is say “haha gay sex, am I right?” and it KILLS. — Phillip Henry (@MajorPhilebrity) April 6, 2018

New addition to the ever-expanding gay agenda: reminding straight comics that gay sex isn't demeaning or shameful or worth making an unfunny joke about. Please update your records — Benjamin Lee (@benfraserlee) April 7, 2018

Both Handler and Kimmel have expressed support for LGBTQ causes throughout their careers, which is perhaps the biggest reason their bottom-referencing jokes have landed with such a thud.

Acknowledging that many straight comedians opted to “employ bottom-shaming jokes to show that they ‘get’ gay culture,” The Daily Beast’s Ira Madison III nonetheless said Handler and Kimmel should re-examine the tone of their language if they wanted to be truly seen as queer rights supporters.

“If they actually cared about gay people,” Madison wrote, “they wouldn’t resort to clichéd jokes that imply being on the receiving end during anal sex is somehow a shameful, cringeworthy act.”Chadwick Boseman hosted “Saturday Night Live” this weekend and not only did he play Black Jeopardy, he did so as T’Challa, the Black Panther himself.

Black Jeopardy is one of the better regular “SNL” sketches, helmed brilliantly by show veteran Keenan Thompson. It usually features two black cast members as contestants, and then a third who is usually the host. This time, Boseman blessed us with an appearance as the Wakandan king who is not quite familiar with life in America.

The highlight comes when T’Challa finally starts getting the hang of the game and tells some woman named Karen to “keep her bland-ass potato salad to yourself!” Check out the sketch above for some deep belly laughs.Joshua Roberts / Reuters

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) lambasted embattled Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt over his “juvenile” behavior and numerous ethical scandals.

“Stop acting like a chucklehead, stop the unforced errors, stop leading with your chin,” Kennedy said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” while addressing the multiple controversies currently surrounding Pruitt. “If you don’t need to fly first class, don’t. Don’t turn on the siren on your SUV just to watch people move over. You represent the president of the United States.”

He added, “All of this behavior is juvenile, it’s distracting from the business that we’re trying to do for the American people.”

At least 23 ethical issues are dogging Pruitt, including a $50-a-night sweetheart deal to rent a room in a luxury Capitol Hill townhouse linked to a fossil fuel industry lobbying firm, unapproved raises for his top staff, first-class airfare worth thousands of dollars, and costly, round-the-clock security. Two reports last week also alleged that Pruitt tried to use his vehicle’s emergency sirens to cut through traffic and that five EPA officials who challenged Pruitt’s “unusually large spending” were either reassigned, demoted or forced out.

“Why do you want ― in his position ― why do you want to rent an apartment from a lobbyist for God’s sake?“ Kennedy added. “Stop leading with your chin. Now, these are unforced errors. They are stupid. There are a lot of problems we can’t solve. But you can behave.”

Kennedy did not say, however, whether he thinks Pruitt should be ousted.

“That’s really up to the president,” he said. “I know what I would do if I were Mr. Pruitt, I would call a press conference tomorrow and I would say, ‘Okay let’s talk about your criticisms of me.’”

Only three GOP lawmakers have called on Pruitt to step down: Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), Illeana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.).

Most conservatives enthusiastically support Pruitt and view him as one of President Donald Trump’s most effective cabinet members, citing his success at rolling back a number of Barack Obama’s environmental regulations.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), for example, said Sunday in a separate interview that Pruitt should retain his position because “he’s following through with the policies that the president said he wanted to implement.” Pruitt’s effectiveness at cutting regulations, he argued, outweighed any ethical lapses.A private trip to Dubai by President Donald Trump’s sons has so far cost U.S. taxpayers at least $73,000, CBS News reports.

The money covered expenses incurred by members of a Secret Service detail for hotel rooms and car service during the trip from March 26 to April 8, according to purchase orders viewed by CBS.

The trip had nothing to do with government business. Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric met with “the team at Trump International Golf Club, Dubai,” a representative told CBS in a statement.

The brothers also spent time with Trump Organization business partner Hussain Sajwani and his family — and attended the wedding of Sajwani’s daughter, Amira, according to a tweet from the father of the bride. He called the Trumps “dear friends and business partners.” Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan, the deputy ruler of Dubai, also attended the wedding.

Eric Trump’s wife, Lara Trump, also posted a picture of herself at the wedding on her Instagram account.

The Secret Service confirmed to CBS that it was conducting a ”protective operation” in the United Arab Emirates, but would offer no other details.

President Trump has retained his ownership of the Trump Organization but announced after being elected president that he would hand over day-to-day operations to his two sons. He also said his company would not be involved in any new overseas developments while he was president. A second Trump-branded golf course in Dubai is now being developed on Damac property. The Trump Organization also last year announced the development of luxury villas near Trump’s current golf club in Dubai.Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump struggled to read, battled to remember the names of three Baltic nations and fought to stay awake after daydreaming about Roseanne Barr at a staged press conference on “Saturday Night Live.”

Finally, he admitted to reporters, with a little sashay: “Here’s the thing: I don’t care about America, okay? This whole presidency is a four-year cash grab — and admitting that will probably get me four more years. I do not care about any of you.”

The SNL cold open featured Balwin’s Trump with the leaders of Lithuania (Kate McKinnon), Latvia (Alex Moffat) and Estonia (Heidi Gardner) on a spoof version of the Fox News program “Outnumbered,” with Leslie Jones playing Harris Faulkner. Baldwin variously referred to the countries and leaders as “hufflepuff,” “freak shows” and “Stankonia.”

He stumbled through a statement to “prove I can read,” then jumped to “freestyle.” He went to add a “big congratulations to Vladimir Putin, who won a great, great very transparent election ... even though no one’s been tougher on Russia than I am, including Hitler.”

As McKinnon’s character began speaking, Baldwin’s Trump thought to himself: “Oh God, I’m already so bored. I wish I was watching ‘Roseanne’ ... Roseanne loves me, she’s like a good Rosie O’Donnell.”

He blew off a question from the press about Stormy Daniels, then veered into a riff about “caravans full of immigrants ... barreling across the desert” that sounded exactly like a scene from “Mad Max, Fury Road.” He then started snoring.

To top it all off, an eye-glass wearing giant bunny suddenly appeared at the side of Baldwin’s Trump. He’s convinced it’s a “Donnie Darko situation.”

If charges against Italian Monsignor Carlo Alberto Capella go to trial, it would be the first time a Vatican City courtroom has addressed a child pornography case.

The arrest came amid investigations in both the United States and Canada, in addition to the Vatican. A 2013 Vatican law penalizes anyone who “distributes, disseminates, transmits, imports, exports, offers or sells child pornography.” If convicted, Capella could face up to 12 years in prison, according to Reuters.

Capella was being held in a cell in the gendarmerie barracks in the Vatican on Saturday, according to a statement from the Holy See press office.

Capella had worked as a diplomat since 2004 in India, Hong Kong and the United States, according to the BBC. The Vatican announced last August that it was recalling a diplomat from the United States. Officials did not identify him at the time, but the Italian news agency ANSA did.

The recall followed a notification from the U.S. State Department about Capella’s “possible violation of laws relating to child pornography images.” American officials asked that Capella’s diplomatic immunity be waived then so he could be prosecuted in the United States. The Vatican refused, The Washington Post reported at the time, but launched an investigation of its own.

Soon after, police in Ontario announced they had issued an arrest warrant for Capella for allegedly uploading child abuse images from a social network platform during a visit to a “place of worship” in Canada in late 2016.

The last child pornography case in the Vatican involved Polish Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who faced charges of paying boys for sexual acts and downloading child pornography while he was the Vatican’s ambassador in the Dominican Republic. He was recalled to the Vatican and arrested, but he died in 2015 at age 67 before his trial began.Chance Yeh via Getty Images

Tony Robbins has apologized after comments he made about the Me Too movement last month recently sparked outrage on social media.

During one of his self-help lectures last month in San Jose, California, Robbins suggested that proponents of the movement to end sexual harassment and assault were failing to take responsibility for their own actions. Tarana Burke, who created the #MeToo hashtag, slammed Robbins in a series of tweets Saturday.

“This moment is so damaging especially with how influential @TonyRobbins is,” Burke tweeted. “His misogyny runs deep.”

In case you’re interested. Here’s the longer 11 min video of Tony Robbins talking about the @MeTooMVMT: 😐https://t.co/69MnzK7lHh — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) April 7, 2018

Robbins, a wildly popular motivational speaker, attempted to clarify his comments in a statement Sunday, calling the Me Too movement a “beautiful force for good.”

“My comments failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has achieved,” Robbins said in the statement. “I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.”

“It is clear that I still have much to learn,” he added.

A video of Robbins controversial remarks went viral after Burke weighed in on them Saturday. In the video, a woman identified as Nanine McCool is seen confronting Robbins over his stance on the Me Too movement.

“I think you misunderstand the Me Too movement. I think ―” McCool says before Robbins cuts her off.

“I’m not mocking the Me Too movement. I’m mocking victimhood,” Robins said. “Look at these people and see what is empowerment. Anger is not empowerment.”A former adviser to President Donald Trump on Monday fired back at the president’s allegations that the Obama administration had an FBI informant infiltrate his 2016 campaign.

“This is embarrassing,” A.J. Delgado tweeted, along with a Fox Business interview with former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka. Gorka said it would be a serious issue to place an asset in another party’s campaign for political purposes ― if the accusations turned out to be true.

Delgado then defended her position, saying she didn’t feel the need to subscribe to conspiracy theories.

The president tweeted Sunday to demand an official probe into whether President Barack Obama sent an FBI informant to the Trump campaign. The Justice Department said it would look into the claims as part of its existing investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.

An FBI informant was sent to speak with several Trump campaign advisers who were found to have suspicious ties to Russia, The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported.Oklahoma teachers rallied at the state Capitol to demand more school funding. Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost

OKLAHOMA CITY and FRANKFORT, Ky. ― Kenny Bridges spent five years as a school superintendent in Kansas, a state famous for the anti-tax, austerity agenda of its former Republican governor, Sam Brownback. Tax cuts had left the schools in such dire shape that Bridges ― the son of two teachers, husband to another and father to two more ― had trouble attracting talent. He found there was just one state from which he could reliably recruit educators, thanks to its rock-bottom teacher pay: his native Oklahoma.

Bridges returned to Oklahoma last year to become superintendent of Jay Public Schools in Delaware County. More than 40 percent of residents there are Native American, and nearly 4 out of 5 students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. The job brought him closer to his grandchildren, but Bridges quickly second-guessed the move. What he saw in Oklahoma was even worse than what he’d seen in Kansas.

The elementary school was dirty and dilapidated. Many of the textbooks were 15 years old. First through third grades lacked a contemporary reading series, and the classrooms didn’t have whiteboards for the teachers to write on. Bridges had to cut a slow-pitch softball program to free up a few thousand dollars for such basic necessities.

“It was appalling,” said Bridges, 59. “The conditions of the facilities were almost disgusting.”

Oklahoma teachers are now in the midst of a walkout over school funding that is likely to spill into its second week. The shutdown follows a historic one just weeks ago in West Virginia, where a nine-day teacher strike led to a 5 percent pay raise for teachers and state workers. Kentucky educators have held their own walkouts this month and flooded the state Capitol to protest proposed cuts to pension plans and education budgets. Teachers in Arizona say they, too, will go on strike and close schools if the state doesn’t grant significant raises and restore public school funding to 2008 levels.

There’s a short explanation for why these low-tax, GOP-controlled states are now facing rebellion: They have slashed public school funding significantly since the Great Recession, while also pursuing many tax cuts that have benefited businesses and the wealthy. The budget shortfalls that austerity has created have left no money to pump into schools or salaries, leading to teacher shortages, overcrowded classrooms and even four-day school weeks in Oklahoma. Teachers forced to take on second or third jobs have finally decided they’ve had enough.

But the longer explanation stretches back a full generation, to when teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky last walked off the job. Kentucky teachers shut down half the districts in the state in 1988 to demand more school funding. Teachers in West Virginia and Oklahoma both went on strike in 1990 for the same purpose. These were seminal revolts that today’s striking teachers still remember, either as students or young educators early in their careers.

The work stoppages led to meaningful raises and investment at the time. But the promise they held eventually lost out to the anti-tax ideology of both legislators and voters.

The teacher walkout in Oklahoma is expected to spill into its second week with teachers refusing to work until their demands are met. Joseph Rushmore for HuffPost

When Tish McDonald graduated from college in 1990, it was a time of great optimism in Oklahoma education. She started her career in public schools buoyed by the landmark legislation just passed in the statehouse to quell the walkout. What was known as House Bill 1017 dramatically reduced class sizes and set minimum teacher salaries, while also pouring money into early childhood programs and statewide testing. It did so by raising taxes, over the fierce objection of businesses.

“It’s how we got our jobs,” recalled McDonald, a counselor in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. “Everyone was so excited. It was like a new day.”

The decline that followed was so gradual that it was hard to see at first. Just two years after House Bill 1017 was enacted, voters approved a momentous ballot initiative known as state question 640. It required a supermajority of 75 percent in both chambers of the legislature for lawmakers to raise taxes again, making future hikes extraordinarily difficult. Meanwhile, many felt the full promise of the education overhaul never came to fruition.

“They said if there’s a time where there’s a crisis, we can increase class sizes,” explained John Croisant, a sixth-grade geography teacher and girls soccer coach in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “The penalties for going over weren’t enough to warrant hiring new teachers. The schools basically just had to stop following the rules, and that was 10 or 15 years ago.”

Kentucky followed a remarkably similar path. Two years after the 1988 protests, the state Supreme Court ruled that Kentucky’s education system had unconstitutionally failed to uphold its duty to provide adequate and equitable schools. The state legislature responded by passing a sweeping 1990 education reform law that raised taxes to better fund its public education system. In all, the changes generated $1.3 billion in new revenue between 1990 and 1992.

Most of it went to Kentucky’s public school system: Teachers received a 15 percent raise over the next two years, former Kentucky Education Association director David Allen said, and in the ensuing decade, the funding gap between the state’s wealthiest and poorest districts began to shrink. The Kentucky Education Reform Act drew national attention both for its increased funding and the academic programs it implemented in an effort to improve the school system.

But over the past decade, those funding increases have been slowly and steadily eroded due to round after round of spending and tax cuts. Since 2008, revenue shortfalls and a woefully underfunded pension system have combined to cause 20 separate rounds of budget cuts in Kentucky.

In inflation-adjusted terms, Kentucky’s K-12 education budget is down 16 percent since 2008, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. Its higher education budget is down 35 percent. Because school districts are increasingly relying on local funding to make up for losses from the state, the funding gaps between rich and poor counties have returned and are once again growing.

Teachers are increasingly forced to pay for their own school supplies. In some districts, educators said that schools have provided set amounts of paper at the beginning of the year and warned teachers not to run out. In most districts, there’s rarely money for new textbooks or educational materials.

“I’m using the same resources that came out in the 1970s,” said Andrew Bailey, who teaches business at Fairdale High School in Louisville, Kentucky, and is now running for a seat in the state Senate. “I haven’t had a new textbook in my classroom since 2008.”

Cutting taxes has proved much easier for legislators than raising them. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a series of bills starting in 2004 that reduced the state’s top income tax rate, while increasing the standard deduction and exempting capital gains from Oklahoma property sales. The state also cut the effective rate of its gross production tax on oil and gas firms, an extremely powerful lobby in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Kentucky has handed out corporate tax breaks and created new loopholes ― for horses, for film production, for coal and alcoholic beverages ― that amount to $13 billion in annual giveaways.

It was the same philosophy that led to huge budget gaps in states like Kansas: Cut taxes and reduce government, and the economy will prosper. Instead, the states are dealing with huge budget gaps.

“In Oklahoma, we thought cutting both personal income tax and corporate taxes would bring prosperity,” said Croisant, who previously ran for an Oklahoma House seat as a Republican but recently switched his party affiliation to Democrat over the school funding issue. “We have sacrificed our schools and our kids’ futures on economic policies that do not work.”

The states are now facing the reality that they need to raise taxes to adequately fund their schools, though some of the solutions they’re looking at are regressive ones.

On Monday, Kentucky Republicans passed sweeping reforms to the state tax code that they said would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenues. They used the money to help avoid the most drastic of Gov. Matt Bevin’s (R) proposed education budget cuts. But the plan reduces income taxes for the top 5 percent of Kentucky taxpayers, while relying heavily on cigarette tax increases and new sales taxes on various goods and services.

Taxes will increase for everyone else, according to an analysis from the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. The modest education funding that was preserved in the state budget is coming first and foremost out of the pockets of poor and middle-class Kentuckians, many of whom are teachers. The Kentucky GOP’s budget still zeros out funding for new textbooks, cuts funds for preschool and afterschool programs, and leaves K-12 education with less money on a per-pupil, inflation-adjusted basis than it received in 2008.

Late last week, Oklahoma lawmakers passed two revenue-raising measures for education ― one that would require Amazon’s third-party vendors to collect sales tax and another that would expand gambling in tribal casinos. Earlier, lawmakers approved a tax on hotel and motel stays but quickly voted to repeal it. The state’s teachers union says either the governor must veto that repeal or the legislature must reinstitute the tax.

So far the teachers have not wavered on their demands, and most of the state’s superintendents, including Bridges, have stood behind them. His district has burned through its remaining snow days and will remain closed as long as necessary to boost school funding, he said. But he worries that even if Oklahoma can patch together enough taxes to reopen schools, they will find themselves in the same position in a few years, with funding that lags behind other states and a deep-seated aversion to any new taxes.President Donald Trump has railed against Amazon, falsely claiming the company fails to pay state and local sales taxes on online shipments. But it turns out the Trump Organization retail website collects sales taxes only on goods shipped to two states — while Amazon collects sales taxes in 45 states.

The TrumpStore.com website sells Trump-labeled glassware, baseball caps, luggage tags, spa slippers and key chains, among several other items. It collects sales tax only on orders shipped to buyers in Florida and Louisiana, according to the company’s own website, The Wall Street Journal pointed out on Friday.

TrumpStore.com, which touts itself as the “official retail website of the The Trump Organization,” doesn’t even pay sales taxes on its online shipments in New York, according to the information on its site. Its physical store and headquarters are located in the Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Trump, who maintains his ownership of the Trump Organization even while president, has been slamming Amazon on Twitter for dodging sales taxes. He has called it a “no-tax” company and has blasted Amazon for paying “little or no taxes to state & local governments.”

I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2018

According to regulatory filings, Amazon paid a combined total of $412 million in federal, state, local and foreign taxes last year. In 2015, it paid $273 million. Amazon currently charges consumers sales taxes in all 45 states where such taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. All states except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon collect sales tax.

Amazon doesn’t have to pay all those taxes. A 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively restricts states from forcing online retailers to pay state and local sales taxes if the company has no physical presence or employees in the state.

Amazon reportedly also supports legislation that would require all online retail operations — such as TrumpStore.com — to pay local taxes so companies operate on a level competitive playing field.

It’s impossible to know what state and local taxes the TrumpStore has paid because it’s a private company and Trump has not released any tax information.

“Trumpstore.com has always, and will continue to collect, report, and remit sales taxes in jurisdictions where it has an obligation to do so,” a spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal.

A “terms and conditions” section of Trump’s online store informs consumers that they’re responsible for paying any applicable tax on merchandise they purchase.

AdvertisementKiller Mike’s attempt to shame MSNBC host Joy Reid on Instagram failed miserably Sunday.

It all started when Reid shared a photo featuring herself and two women “who rocked the H&M,” according to the caption.

The rapper, whom Reid condemned last month for appearing in a National Rifle Association ad, called her out in the comments of her post for promoting H&M, a clothing company that came under fire in January for posing a black child model in a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, “Coolest Monkey In The Jungle.”

“So Me doing an interview about black Gun Ownership with the NRA is ‘bad’ but u promoting a company that tagged a Black Child a Monkey is ‘good, cool, acceptable,’” Killer Mike wrote.

There’s just one problem: Reid’s use of “H&M” wasn’t a reference to the clothing company at all.

Lol: Killer Mike tried to shame Joy Ann Reid for wearing H&M but didnt understand she was not referring to the clothing store but actually "hair & makeup." pic.twitter.com/WhG3ibu6h9 — Astead (@AsteadWesley) April 8, 2018

″‘H&M’ stands for ‘hair and makeup,’” Reid responded on Instagram. “The two women beside me in this pic did my hair (H) and makeup (M) for a shoot. ... And here I was thinking you were an intellectual, and not just the guy who hangs out in the sunken place talking guns with the NRA’s ‘official black guy.’”

Reid didn’t let it go there.

“Also ... who starts a feud in Instagram comments? Is your Twitter account locked?” she added.

Killer Mike owned up to his mistake on Twitter, noting that he had “egg on my face” after the exchange and hinting that he would appear on Reid’s show at a later date to discuss black gun ownership.

Yup I got educated and I appreciated. I’m making sure I’m staying with the people tho no more outta line with me 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/Rgap2PoJGU — Killer Mike (@KillerMike) April 8, 2018

So egg on my face 🤷🏾‍♂️😌and all I’m happy that the convo on #BlackGunOwnerShip will happen. Thank u @JoyAnnReid for “getting me together” on H&M and making sure this important convo can be had on an acceptable platform. ❤️✊🏾 — Killer Mike (@KillerMike) April 8, 2018

My favorite part is that Killer Mike has been sitting around waiting to "get Joy back" for weeks now and he blew it. LMAO — M’BlockU (@rodimusprime) April 8, 2018In the premiere episode of the revived “Trading Spaces,” homeowner Michele and her husband, clad in matching red button-down shirts, stare blankly at designer Hildi Santo-Tomas as she explains the art concept for the guest room of Michele’s sister and next-door neighbor, Melissa.

The design will be penguin-inspired, Santo-Tomas declares, so she wants her team to hand paint a “deconstructed penguin” mural on the room’s walls and ceiling. One wall, however, will be covered in mirrors, creating a kaleidoscope effect ― abstract penguin parts everywhere.

Michele’s eyes light up, unfortunately out of fear and not excitement.

If you’re a former fan of TLC’s “Trading Spaces,” this scenario is tantalizingly familiar. Santo-Tomas was one of the more ornery designers featured on the original home improvement reality series, which returns this weekend after a decade off the air. In an era of television dominated by reboots, TLC decided to resurrect the beloved “Trading Spaces.” Its simple premise remains intact: a pair of neighbors fix up one room in each other’s homes with the help of a designer, carpenter and returning host Paige Davis. They have two days and $2,000 (twice the budget of the original show) to pull it off without tears.

Or in the case of Santo-Tomas, who once glued straw onto the walls of someone’s living room, with many, many tears.

Drama tends to weave its way into “Trading Spaces,” separating the series from other, tamer home improvement reality shows. Take, for example, “Fixer Upper,” a show that pretty much guaranteed each happy new homeowner would walk away from the show with a Joanna Gaines-certified farmhouse design.

“We promise a happy ending,” general manager of HGTV programming Allison Page told HuffPost. “You know if you’re coming to HGTV they’re going to find a house, make it beautiful.”

TLC’s “Trading Spaces” gives its participants no guarantee. Although the channel is owned by the same network as HGTV (Discovery), the show departs in several ways from the usual renovation fare. Instead of providing a top-to-bottom rework like most other shows, “Trading Spaces” stakes claim to only one room, often of utmost importance to its owners. And instead of allowing the actual homeowners to wince and “wow!” at pre-approved designs, the various designers go forth and renovate on theme without their explicit permission. (Sure, neighbors can advocate against truly heinous decisions, but does that ever really stop Hildi Santo-Tomas?) The show simply hopes everyone will be satisfied with their respective finished products. It hopes that the interventions won’t amount to a breakdown of next-door relations.

Needless to say, the show’s hopes are not always well-founded.

One of the most infamous “they hated it” moments came in Season 2, Episode 21, after designer Doug Wilson opted to cover up a brick fireplace that a homeowner explicitly requested be left untouched in her contract. Rather than taking a beat to realize the structure Wilson had erected could be removed, the woman slowly left the room upon reveal and began to cry.

“She’s not happy,” her disappointed husband told host Davis, as his wife’s audible sobs could be heard on her live mic. “She’s really not happy.”

“Is there anything that you can see in the room to fix certain elements of it to make it better for the two of you?” Davis asks. “I don’t even know where to start. I mean, I see one piece of furniture that looks remotely like the way I left it, and the rest of it is just so not us,” the husband responds.

Wilson, for his part, explained the dilemma on the Build Series this week.

“If you break the room down, the facade that I put around it was tongue and groove. I put in wainscot that matched the wainscot in her house,” he said.

“What I’ll say in her defense is, homeowners are allowed when they come on ‘Trading Spaces’ to protect certain items in their home... she wanted to protect that brick [fireplace],” Davis explained in the same Build interview. “So when she opened her eyes and saw to her eyes that that brick was gone, [but it was] completely safe underneath, she was so angry that she actually thought we had broken the contract. That’s why she says, ‘You guys will be fixing that in a little bit.’ But we actually didn’t break the contract, and we didn’t fix it.”

Fellow designer Genevieve Gorder chimed in to add “control issues are real ... they really have to let go to have a good time.”

In actuality, the show does not remedy any disliked renovation. Once the room is done, it’s the homeowners who are left to either embrace their sometimes wacky space or immediately redo it. And remember: these are people’s actual homes and living spaces ― not some house they bought to flip and sell a few months down the road. They’re stuck with the results of the design, even if there’s sand on the floor, flowers on the bathroom wall or furniture on the ceiling.

“It’s very real, that risk,” Davis said. “If we told them, ‘Oh, don’t worry, if you don’t like it we’ll put it back or fix it,’ well there’d be absolutely no jeopardy whatsoever.”

That risk is half the fun of “Trading Spaces.” Viewers know there’s a real possibility that couples won’t like their new room and that each episode could end in heartbreak, unlike the perpetual happy endings of “Fixer Upper” or “House Hunters.”

Hildi Santo-Tomas covered a living room floor with sand for a beach getaway theme. TLC

Drama is surely built into “Trading Spaces,” thanks to the designers’ stick-to-their-guns method. “I always approach this show half-design, half-entertainment and try to find a blend to make that work,” Wilson said. “We take it on ourselves to spice things up a bit and push the envelope so people can experience something new.”

But Davis insists there’s “no agenda or planned-out thing.” Any tension apparent during a reveal is organic. Gorder, for her part, understands the upset of certain homeowners.

“It’s people’s most intimate space,” Gorder said. “And just a slight tweak off what they thought they wanted can send someone into a mad spiral. If there’s a little bit of a mental off-ness, it gets even more wild and wonderful! We don’t make that [up]. ”

When Michele’s sister, in her opposing blue garb, returned home to a penguin-themed room in the premiere episode on Saturday, she looked bewildered. “Oh my God,” she says, gasping. “This is insane.”

After taking in the room a bit more, Melissa ― and her equally shocked husband ― uneasily react. “The paint is going to grow on me, but I love that they...” Melissa says through tears. “It’s shocking, but at the same time I love how much went into it.”In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, screenwriters Bryan Woods and Scott Beck say that actor John Krasinski insisted that the deaf daughter character in their new film, “A Quiet Place,” be cast with a deaf actress.

Krasinski, who also directed the film, specifically pushed for actress Millicent Simmonds to be hired. Simmonds had a breakout performance in last year’s critically acclaimed “Wonderstruck.”

The 14-year-old Simmonds lost her hearing while she was a baby and has since become a champion for the deaf community. “I want to see more deaf people have the opportunity to become actors,” she told People in October. “And I want [hearing people] to know that it’s okay to learn [American Sign Language].”

“We always had a deaf character in the script, but John really pushed for them to hire Millicent,” Beck said. “She came to set and taught everyone sign language. It was really amazing and brought an extra depth to the film.”

In the world of “A Quiet Place,” blind, sound-hunting monsters force the Abbott family to live in total silence. The parents, played by real-life couple Krasinski and Emily Blunt, try to keep their son and daughter safe from these monsters while planning for the birth of another child ― which they must also figure out how to do in silence!

“A Quiet Place” is currently number one at the theaters, having made an estimated $46 million in its debut, according to Box Office Mojo.

AdvertisementRepublicans could not repeal the Affordable Care Act last year, and they seem unlikely to try again anytime soon. But they are finding places where, through a combination of new state laws and new federal regulations, they can transform Obamacare’s health insurance markets into something more to their liking ― namely, markets full of cheaper, less generous plans available to people in good health.

This week, Iowa became one of those places. Kim Reynolds, the state’s Republican governor, signed a law Monday allowing the Iowa Farm Bureau to sell health plans that, in most respects, look and operate like any other insurance policies. Wellmark, the state’s affiliate of Blue Cross Blue Shield, will administer the new policies.

But the legislation declares that the new plans “shall not be deemed to be insurance,” and there’s a reason for that. Iowa’s lawmakers want to make sure the policies aren’t subject to the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations, including those that protect people with pre-existing conditions.

Unless a court challenge gets in the way, nothing will stop the Farm Bureau and Wellmark from jacking up premiums on people with conditions such as cancer and diabetes ― or denying those people coverage altogether. Nor will anything keep the plan sponsors from limiting or excluding benefits the Affordable Care Act considers “essential,” a list that includes treatment for mental illness, maternity care and prescription drugs.

And if the Farm Bureau and Wellmark want to impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, they can do that, too. People who receive organ transplants or have rare genetic disorders, such as hemophilia, frequently run up bills that exceed those limits.

So far, officials from the Farm Bureau and Wellmark have not specified exactly how much of this leeway they plan to use. But they have said that the policies will look like the ones that were available before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Those plans had substantially lower premiums precisely because they [were] not available or terribly useful to people with serious medical problems. “We do know that this may not be a solution for all,” a Farm Bureau spokesperson conceded to the Des Moines Register.

How Obamacare Unfolded In Iowa

Although the legislation’s supporters don’t typically advertise that downside, the more candid ones acknowledge it. They argue it’s a necessary trade-off because premiums for Iowans who buy coverage on their own, rather than through employers, have increased to the point that many simply cannot afford it today.

That’s true. People with incomes below four times the poverty line, or roughly $49,000 for an individual, qualify for the Affordable Care Act’s tax credits. These people represent the majority of people buying on their own, and, for them, coverage tends to be within reach and sometimes even free, no matter how high premiums get. But the tax credits get smaller at higher incomes, and those who are above the subsidy threshold must pay full price. This is particularly rough on people in their 50s and 60s because, even under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can charge older customers up to three times more than they charge younger ones.

Iowa is a state where the differential is particularly striking. A 55-year-old single man in Des Moines with an annual income of $35,000 can get coverage through HealthCare.gov and pay less than $700 in annual premiums for it, thanks to the tax credits. A 55-year-old with an income of $55,000 has to pay full price, which works out to more than $11,000 a year.

In public appearances and interviews with media outlets, including HuffPost, GOP leaders have repeatedly blamed this situation on the design of Affordable Care Act, with Reynolds calling it “unaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.”

It’s not just that the law’s requirements have made insurance more expensive, Reynolds and her fellow Republicans say; it’s that the high prices have driven healthy people out of the market, saddling insurers with big losses. The carriers have responded by raising premiums even higher or simply fleeing, which is why this year just one carrier, Minnesota-based Medica, offers policies through HealthCare.gov.

That is, more or less, how the market in Iowa has evolved. But the problems have at least as much to do with decisions by the state’s political and business leaders as they do with the health care law’s design.

Republican Terry Branstad, Reynolds’ predecessor as governor, was another outspoken critic of Obamacare. His administration did virtually nothing to promote enrollment, even though, given the state’s small size, adding just a few thousand people to the rolls could have made the market more stable. As of 2016, just 20 percent of Iowans eligible to get plans through HealthCare.gov had signed up, according to figures compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. That was the lowest of any state, well below the national average of 40 percent.

Those numbers aren’t simply a byproduct of poor outreach. An unusually large number of Iowans are holding on to “grandfathered” or “transitional” plans ― policies that existed before the Affordable Care Act took effect and that remain cheap, mainly because they originally enrolled people who were in relatively good health. As of last year, these holdover policies accounted for more than half the total market, according to estimates by Charles Gaba, the Michigan-based policy analyst and proprietor of the website ACAsignups.net.

The Obama administration is partly responsible for this: It gave state officials discretion over whether to allow the transitional plans and for how long. But Iowa is among the states where officials have made maximum use of that discretion. One reason may be the political power of Wellmark, the state’s dominant insurer, which happens to operate the old plans.

Enrollment in those old noncompliant plans was bound to dwindle eventually, as people found different sources of coverage, either through new jobs or, perhaps, reaching the age to qualify for Medicare. Now that isn’t going to happen. Instead, a new class of cheap, noncompliant plans will be open to new enrollees. The policies will likely draw people in good health away from the policies available on HealthCare.gov, driving premiums there even higher. (It may or may not be sheer coincidence that Wellmark will operate the new plans, too.)

Iowans whose incomes qualify for the law’s tax credits may not notice the difference. They’ll still be able to get comprehensive, regulated policies through HealthCare.gov, usually at low prices. And Iowans with higher incomes, the ones who didn’t get the tax credits, will discover they have a much cheaper alternative. Many will feel genuine relief, even if the plans don’t provide as much coverage.

But some Iowans have pre-existing conditions, which means they won’t be able to buy the new plans. Others will sign up for a Farm Bureau-Wellmark policy, get sick and then require care that’s beyond what the plans cover. They will be in trouble.

And it doesn’t have to be that way.

How Iowa Officials Could Have Reacted ― But Didn’t

In Alaska and Minnesota, state officials faced remarkably similar situations, with premiums that put insurance out of reach for consumers who got little or no financial aid. They responded very differently than their counterparts in Des Moines. They created “reinsurance” pools that reimburse carriers for their most expensive-to-cover beneficiaries. Premiums fell in both states, and just this past week officials in Wisconsin said they were going to try the same thing.

Iowa’s GOP leaders could have tried some version of that. They also could have launched, finally, a serious outreach effort to boost enrollment.

“These are places where there are opportunities to grow and consolidate the risk pool,” Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank, told HuffPost. Lueck, who happens to be an Iowa native, has studied the state closely and calls the outreach failure “a huge missed opportunity.”

There were more ambitious options, too, like opening up Medicaid to individual buyers or creating state tax credits to supplement the existing federal ones. These ideas, which have come up for discussion in other states, would have entailed their own trade-offs ― including, most likely, additional government spending. That’s true of reinsurance, as well. But the sums would be relatively modest, depending on the option, and all would leave in place those protections for pre-existing conditions.

But preserving those protections is not a priority for most Republicans, at either the state or the federal level. They would prefer to reduce health insurance premiums by letting insurers cover fewer services and exclude people with serious medical problems. And they are trying their best to realize that vision ― by, for example, encouraging enrollment in short-duration insurance plans that aren’t subject to the Affordable Care Act’s requirements.

As long as the Affordable Care Act remains on the books, millions of low- and middle-income individuals will continue to get comprehensive, subsidized insurance they wouldn’t have otherwise ― and, most likely, have better access to care as a result. That’s especially true in states where leaders are more enthusiastic about making the program work.
