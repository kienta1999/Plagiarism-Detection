Sarah Palin never said “I can see Russia from my house” and George W. Bush didn’t wave at Stevie Wonder. But political myths like these have ways of sticking in the public memory and distorting history.

When it comes to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, rumors have circulated since the early months of the conflict that Washington’s original name for the war was “Operation Iraqi Liberation.” After the war’s architects realized that name produced the embarrassing acronym “OIL,” they quickly changed the official title to “Operation Iraqi Freedom.”

In reality, however, there is no public record of Operation Iraqi Liberation as the official U.S. label, and no evidence that it was ever seriously considered.

So, how did this story start?

The OIL Myth

The story of “Operation Iraqi Liberation” is mild enough to be believable. It also neatly fits two prominent antiwar narratives: that the invasion was primarily aimed at capturing Iraq’s oil reserves, and that George W. Bush’s administration was full of morons.

Perhaps because it sounds plausible, the “OIL” story doesn’t just live in YouTube conspiracy videos and on internet message boards. It has appeared in articles in major newspapers and books on the Iraq war, and over the years has popped up in letters to the editor columns. But the story is always unsourced or attributed to anonymous military historians. It has a friend-of-a-friend-told-me quality any time it’s mentioned.

The anecdote appeared as early as August 2003, just months after the start of the conflict. An Aug. 13 Washington Post article covering a series of U.S. military raids in Iraq called “Operation Ivy Lightning” notes that mission’s regrettable “OIL” acronym, and mentions rumors that military officials earlier that year avoided naming the war Operation Iraqi Liberation.

The Likeliest Explanation

On the afternoon of March 24, just days after the U.S launched a barrage of missiles at Baghdad to kick off the war, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer held a briefing with the media.

Fleischer gave a report on the president’s day and his phone calls with foreign leaders. But a few sentences into his briefing, he stumbled on the name of the war, and said “Operation Iraqi, uh, Liberation.”

Which brings us to Jay Leno.

One day after Fleischer botched the war’s name, Leno taped the 51st episode of his 11th season as host of “The Tonight Show,” the top-rated program on late-night television that year. His guests that night included Hillary Swank, Chris Rock and musician Sean Paul.

Like every late-night host at the time, Leno’s opening monologues were a deluge of Iraq war jokes. Many of these from the March 25 show involved cringeworthy puns ― “You think right about now, Saddam Hussein is suffering from Iraq-tile dysfunction?” ― and topical references ― “Not only do we have the Iraqis on the run, but late today, two of the Dixie Chicks surrendered.”

Then there was this:

“In more serious news, the war continues in Iraq. They’re calling it ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom.’ They were going to call it ‘Operation Iraqi Liberation,’ then they realized, uh-oh, that spells ‘OIL.’”

Given the show’s references to daily events in Iraq, it’s likely Leno’s writers were watching Fleischer’s briefings, or at least seeing news reports about them. A Leno joke from April 3 even mentions Fleischer by name, according to a database of late-night jokes about the Iraq war compiled by Michel M. Haigh and Aaron Heresco for a study published in Mass Communication and Society Journal.

The “OIL” joke was popular, or obvious enough that it was soon repeated outside of late-night television. When New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof held a contest in November 2003 to find a better name for Operation Iraqi Freedom, a number of the 4,000 entries he received included the suggestion of Operation Iraqi Liberation.

A representative for Fleischer did not respond to multiple HuffPost requests for clarification on why the former press secretary might have used the name, which he repeated during a briefing on April 1, 2003. Jay Leno’s publicist did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The Case Against The OIL Story

It’s impossible to definitively say if Leno and Fleischer are the source of the “OIL” story, but what is certain is that the war was never officially named Operation Iraqi Liberation. There’s also no apparent documentation that suggests “OIL” was ever a real contender in the naming process, if it was brought up at all.

Naming a military operation is a convoluted process. United States Central Command officials propose possible titles, in accordance with restrictions laid out in the manual for the military’s “Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff then selects a name, which is sent to the secretary of defense for approval.

The George W. Bush administration announced the Iraq war’s official title, “Operation Iraqi Freedom” on March 20, 2003, according to a Scripps Howard News Service article published the same day. The operation had no individual title before that, but fell under the umbrella of the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan ― “Operation Enduring Freedom.”

The U.S. Army War College has no record of the name “Operation Iraqi Liberation” in any of its literature, including an upcoming U.S. Army Operation Iraqi Freedom study group history of the war, according to an official there.

“I would not be surprised if that Liberation name got thrown around when the operational name was being discussed in D.C., but I cannot find any reference it was ever seriously considered,” said Conrad Crane, chief of historical services for the Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

The Joint Chiefs issued an even stronger denial.

“There is no record on the Joint Staff of any other name used or considered for ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom,’” said Richard R. Osial, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs.The Trump administration plans Friday to announce a new rule that would cut federal funds from any health clinics that provide abortions or referrals to other abortion providers, The New York Times reported. The change would mean that funds would be lost for essential health screenings for women.

The rule, which CBS News reported would ban federally funded clinics from discussing abortion with women, would be a massive blow to health care providers like Planned Parenthood, which offer abortions and receive some federal funds for non-abortion health services.

Laws already prevent federal funds from being used for abortions. But clinics like Planned Parenthood use federal money for things like breast cancer screenings and other health tests. The new rules would force Planned Parenthood to either give up those funds — or stop providing abortions on the premises.

The Title X program connects 4 million people with birth control, STI testing, and breast and cervical exams.

The new rule reportedly would also ban any family planning clinics receiving federal funds from sharing space or facilities with abortion providers.

Clinics could continue to provide abortions only if they did so as a separate entity at a different location and with an entirely different staff, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous administration source.

Details were unclear on how the rule would affect discussions with patients. A ban on discussing abortion or providing information on where to get one, blasted as a gag rule by abortion rights supporters and medical groups, would violate the doctor-patient relationship and is likely to trigger lawsuits, CBS News said. NBC reported that the Trump rule would stop short of banning clinic staff from discussing abortion with pregnant women.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion organization the Susan B. Anthony List, thanked Trump and hailed his “decisive leadership.”

Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the change “outrageous,” saying it’s “designed to make it impossible for millions of patients to get birth control or preventive care from reproductive health care providers.”

The proposed change — to be delivered from the Health and Human Services Department to the Office of Management and Budget Friday — will drop a requirement that Title X grant recipients provide abortion counseling to patients.

Some $290 million of Title X money was spent last year on family planning services in the nation. Medicaid money, which is the bulk of the federal funds Planned Parenthood receives, would not be affected by the new proposal, according to Bloomberg.

The crackdown is expected to take the harshest toll on low-income families. About two-thirds of people who visit family planning clinics are below the federal poverty level, reports NBC.

The Trump rule revives a Reagan-era policy that was held up in court and finally rescinded in 1994.

Trump, heavily backed by evangelicals, has already reinstated a ban on taxpayer funding for foreign aid organizations that provide abortions.Rep. Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, has to figure out whether to write a bipartisan food stamp bill or one that gets only Republican support. Bloomberg via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― A Republican plan to shrink food stamp enrollment is in some serious trouble.

Earlier this week House Agriculture Committee chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas), the Republican in charge of writing new food stamp legislation, postponed releasing his bill in order to win Democratic support first. But on Thursday Democrats abandoned the negotiation.

“The Democratic members have made clear that they unanimously oppose [Conaway’s proposal] as it has been described to them and reported in the press,” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Thursday evening.

Conaway has to figure out whether he wants to write a bipartisan bill or one that would pass the House with just Republicans. But since Republicans don’t have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, it’s hard to see how a Republican-only strategy could succeed.

Nevertheless, an influential group of hardline House conservatives has been telling Conaway and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that if they’re not ready to severely shrink enrollment with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, then they should wait until after midterm elections in November.

“I’m focused on real welfare reform, including food stamp reform, and if that’s not in the legislation then I’ve said before I think it should be a short-term extension,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost on Thursday.

Roughly 42 million Americans receive food benefits from the program, which is one of the federal government’s most important safety nets and one that experts have credited for eliminating starvation in the U.S. Monthly benefits average $125 per person.

Republicans say having extra money for food discourages people from working, though recent research shows most adults who receive SNAP benefits participate in the labor force.

The Trump administration has made a lot of noise about food stamps this year, saying it favored replacing benefits with boxes of canned goods. The administration is closely allied with the Freedom Caucus leaders, who have been badmouthing an investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign.

Peterson said in a radio interview last week that Conaway’s plan would deny benefits to 8 million people. A Conaway spokeswoman said the number was not accurate but declined to provide details. Enrollment in the program has been declining for years, and budget forecasters already expect improved economic conditions to result in 8 million fewer people receiving monthly benefits a decade from now.

Jordan said he hadn’t seen Conaway’s bill, but that if it kicked an extra 8 million people off food stamps, “that certainly sounds like it’s moving in the right direction.”

The Agriculture Committee traditionally produces a farm bill every five years reauthorizing agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance. The previous farm bill bogged down in 2013 under similar circumstances, with hardline conservatives balking at a bipartisan measure that didn’t cut benefits as much as they would have liked. So the House passed a more conservative bill that ultimately got smothered in a House-Senate conference committee.

Citing his own conversations with Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Peterson said last week that “the Senate’s not going to do any of this stuff, so this has been an exercise in futility.”

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that delaying the farm bill would be good because “anything trying to happen before the midterms is difficult.”

The idea that Republicans could get a better deal if they wait until after November doesn’t make much sense to Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who chaired the Agriculture Committee when hardliners blew up his farm bill five years ago. After all, if Democrats win enough seats to retake the House, they’ll be in charge of the farm bill.Liz Cheney was also criticized after she appeared to explain the benefits of “enhanced” interrogation tactics to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). McCain’s daughter, Meghan, snapped back on Thursday: “My father doesn’t need torture explained to him.” McCain was imprisoned in Hanoi during the Vietnam War for more than five years.

After Trump named Haspel as his pick for the CIA, John McCain said that the CIA torture of al Qaeda suspects in the wake of 9/11 was one of the “darkest chapters in American history.”RuPaul visited Ellen DeGeneres on Friday, and the two hosts decided to merge their worlds by combining popular segments from their respective shows: “Lip Sync For Your Life,” from “Drag Race,” and “You Bet Your Wife,” from “Ellen’s Game of Games.”

The end result was “Lip Sync For Your Wife,” a competition in which two wives are blindfolded and suspended in harnesses over a stage while their husbands work it in a lip sync battle.

At the end of each song, one man is named the winner ― but the losing husband doesn’t get to just sashay away. Oh no; there’s a serious repercussion for his lack of fierceness.

Watch the video above to see what it is, and why it made Ru respond like this:Stormy Daniels, the porn star who alleges President Donald Trump’s personal attorney paid her to keep silent about an affair with Trump, has been physically threatened, her lawyer said Friday.

Lawyer Michael Avenatti was asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, faced threats of “physical harm.” He responded, “Yes.”

Avenatti, who said earlier this month that his client has been legally threatened by Trump’s lawyer, declined to elaborate. He said he would “not confirm or deny” if the physical threats came from Trump himself.

Avenatti also declined to say whether the threats were related to Daniels’ non-disclosure agreement she reportedly reached with Trump in 2016 to keep quiet about the affair.

“I’m not at liberty to discuss it. You can ask it 17 different ways. I’ll give you the same answer,” Avenatti said.

Avenatti, who has been on a publicity campaign for Daniels in recent weeks, repeatedly told “Morning Joe” viewers to watch Daniels’ forthcoming interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” which The Washington Post reported would air on March 25.

Adding to the suspense, Avenatti suggested the broadcast was still uncertain, but said “we hope” the interview will air.

“I don’t know that we’re out of the woods yet,” Avenatti said, referring to speculation that Trump’s lawyers are trying to prevent CBS from airing the interview. The network has declined to comment on the matter.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s tone-deaf “konnichiwa” comment to Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii) certainly won’t gain him many supporters within the Asian-American community.

Multiple legislators and Asian-American civil rights groups have criticized his ill-timed greeting, which he offered at a Thursday congressional hearing after Hanabusa said that her grandfathers were among those imprisoned by the U.S. government during World War II.

Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), among others, swiftly condemned Zinke for his inappropriate remark.

My colleague asked Sec. Zinke a serious question about gov't funding and received the response "Konnichiwa". This blatantly insensitive remark by @secretaryzinke is uncalled for and is not behavior that a cabinet secretary should exhibit🤦🏽‍♀️https://t.co/4dz9gSgKdR pic.twitter.com/MwPCT0CJdO — Grace Meng (@RepGraceMeng) March 15, 2018

No better example of why we need continued support for historical sites where the rights of Japanese Americans were violated b/c of race. Zinke's comment betrayed a prejudice that being Asian makes you a perpetual foreigner. Intentional or not, it's offensive. He should apologize https://t.co/oxO7N4qLrx — Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) March 16, 2018

Nope. Racism is not ok. https://t.co/wWopw5Vctu — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) March 16, 2018

Asian-American civil rights groups were also vocal in their criticism of Zinke. The Japanese American Citizens League released a statement shortly after the incident, pointing out that he was not only disrespectful of the congresswoman but that his comment reflected the “perpetual foreigner” stereotype ― the idea that Asian-Americans can never be “American enough.”

“The injustice of the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans was due to the very racist sentiments unintentionally exhibited in Secretary Zinke’s flippant comment, that Japanese Americans were and are perpetually foreign,” the league said. “Although not as brazen as General DeWitt’s statement in 1942 that ‘A Jap’s a Jap. It makes no difference whether the Jap is a citizen or not,’ the sentiment is not so dissimilar.”

The Go for Broke National Education Center, a nonprofit that preserves and shares the stories of Japanese-American veterans of World War II, echoed those sentiments in its own statement. Mitchell Maki, president and chief executive officer of the organization, said that Zinke’s remarks suggest an “inability to distinguish an American of Japanese ancestry from a citizen of Japan.”

Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an affiliation of five civil rights organizations, is now calling for the interior secretary to publicly apologize to Hanabusa. The group said he should have acknowledged Hanabusa’s family story and underscored that the “history of the incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans is a shameful, dark moment in U.S. history that should be remembered as such by this administration.”

Zinke’s remarks reveal that he has yet to understand the gravity of the incarceration of Japanese-Americans, according to Aarti Kohli, executive director of the affiliated group Advancing Justice - Asian Law Caucus.

“Secretary Zinke clearly does not understand his history. People have lost homes and jobs, and their lives have been shattered because of lies told to the Supreme Court that Japanese Americans were national security risks,” Kohli told HuffPost in an email. “We must ensure that we don’t make the same mistakes today, especially with this current Administration’s iterations of the Muslim Ban. We cannot make all encompassing statements about entire religions, cultures, and ethnicity.”

At Thursday’s hearing, just before Zinke made his comment, Hanabusa had been speaking about the future of the Japanese American Confinement Sites Grant Program, which Congress established to preserve the sites of the prison camps where Japanese-Americans were incarcerated. The congresswoman had mentioned that President Donald Trump’s 2019 budget proposal, unveiled in February, would eliminate funding for the program.

After seeing Zinke’s flippancy over what was done to thousands to Americans during a dark time in U.S. history, civil rights groups agree that it’s all the more necessary to support the grant program.Kathie Lee Gifford is apparently still friendly with Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein, despite the dozens of allegations of sexual assault, abuse and harassment between them.

The “Today” show host opened up about her relationship with the men ― and her own struggles as a victim of sexual misconduct ― on Wednesday during an interview with Andy Cohen on his “Radio Andy” show.

“I personally, since I got into this business as a teenage girl, I have been sexually harassed, I have been sexually abused and I have been date raped — and don’t tell me they’re all the same, because they are not,” Gifford said. “They are not the same. Unless you’ve been through it and you can say it’s the same, then fine. If it was the same to you, OK — not the same to me.”

“I don’t want to throw everyone on the same manure pile,” she added. “Being a jerk is not the same as being a rapist — it just isn’t.”

Cohen then asked Gifford if she had reached out to Cosby after she heard about the allegations against him. She said she had, and that she and the comedian had been friends for years.

Gifford said she also called and left a message for Weinstein, another friend of 30 years, after allegations against him surfaced.

“I just want people to know I don’t judge them,” Gifford said. “I don’t like what they do, but God knows their hearts and there’s hope for them. And you can’t call yourself a friend when the first minute where there’s trouble, you run. That’s called a fair-weather friend, and that’s not a friend at all.”

Over 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct. He is set to go to trial April 2 on charges that he drugged and assaulted former Temple University women’s basketball director Andrea Constand. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of harassment and assault.

“I hope people are not misunderstanding this,” Gifford told Cohen. “I am not saying that that kind of behavior is in any way acceptable. It isn’t, and it’s horrible. As a woman who’s experienced it, it’s awful.”

“But, can we at least look at each individual case and see it for what it is, and be merciful to people that are sorry for what they’ve done?” she asked. “If we stop having mercy as a part of our vocabulary, Andy, our world will completely die.”

When allegations first surfaced against Cosby in 2014, Gifford admitted she had a hard time coming to terms with the news.

“He is kind, he is capable of great kindness, he’s capable of great generosity,” she said on the “Today” show at the time. “I, along with so many Americans and people worldwide, don’t want these stories to be true.”

She then recalled being on tour with the comedian in the 1970s; she said he tried to hit on her but that she turned him down.

“But I’m not saying that the women are liars,” she said. “From my own personal experience, it didn’t happen. A lot of married men come on to single women, but once I said, ‘No, absolutely not,’ he respected it.”

Just a few months ago, Gifford faced widespread criticism for her response to NBC firing her former co-host, Matt Lauer, amid sexual misconduct allegations.by Kevin O’Keeffe

It took writing out my feelings about recent “RuPaul’s Drag Race” controversies, a long, relaxing weekend in Palm Springs, and a very good finale episode, but I’m ending this season of “All Stars” mostly on a high note. Sure, I ultimately didn’t love the season, and I have some quibbles with the winner. But it was a satisfying finish, just twisty enough to keep us on our toes, with a terrific challenge attached. At this point, that’s about all I can hope for.

The actual challenge is an interesting twist: Instead of just performing as a girl group on the main stage, as the final fours of season 9 and “All Stars” season 2 did, the All Stars season 3 girls will be performing a remix of RuPaul’s “Kitty Girl” all around the studio. But the biggest gag of all: It’ll all be in one take. The news makes Trixie Mattel and Shangela practically gag with glee, while Bebe Zahara Benet, who struggles mightily with choreography this week, seems less thrilled.

For someone who ruled during the competition, and had fans convinced she was part of a bigger conspiracy, Bebe goes out with a whimper in this finale. She is easily the worst in “Kitty Girl,” both lyrically and with the choreography. On the runway, her best drag look is exactly as wild as you’d expect — but that’s not quite a good thing. If your best drag is going to be something expected, it has to be flawless. And this wasn’t.

Bebe fails hardest, however, during a new segment introduced for this finale. Ru herself does not choose who will be the last two standing of the final four; she has the six eliminated queens serve as a jury. Each of them votes on which two queens they want as the finalists. Arbitrary? Kinda. Tacked-on? Sure feels like it. Drama? Absolutely, girl.

Before they vote, they have a chance to question the queens, and Bebe’s performance is nothing short of a disaster. The eliminated queens want to know who she would have brought back and eliminated had she won the “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here” lip sync two weeks ago. I said last weekBebe was smart not to reveal her choices of who to return and eliminate. In the moment, that was true; she had absolutely nothing to gain by revealing them, as she would have certainly angered whoever she chose to eliminate. But to not reveal her choices when asked by the jury? When they’re insisting that they want to know and might not vote for you because you wouldn’t say? Bad gameplay, girl.

Whereas Bebe is overly defensive with the jury, Kennedy Davenport is a dream. She leads with her heart in her interview, leading queens like Thorgy Thor to praise her for being “real.” She emphasizes how much it would mean to her, and generally slays — as you’d expect a pageant queen experienced in interview portions would be. Somehow, the Dancing Diva of Texas gives her best performance when sitting down.

Shangela and Trixie both acquit themselves well in the challenge and on the runway (each wearing their best-ever looks on the main stage). With the jury, each does OK, and strikes a similar note of “I’m already an All Star.” Which is true! They are two of the most popular, most successful queens to ever come from Drag Race. Some might say that’s the reason why they should win.

But in listening to Kennedy talk, combined with her thoughts last week on wanting to be the Ru Girl that fans are lining up to see, I felt a real pang of love for Kennedy. She’s right: The crown would mean more to her than it would to the others. She is a legend, she has given us major moments across two seasons (her “Roar” lip sync! The Bitchelor!), and she does deserve the platform that “Drag Race” offers.

In truth, I think Shangela and Trixie are better at what is required of a “Drag Race winner.” But damn if I wasn’t swayed by Kennedy’s candor, emotion and narrative.

We don’t get full vote totals — which is deeply bullshit, to be frank — but we see a few highlights: Thorgy votes for Shangela and Trixie. DeLa votes for Kennedy. We’re meant to assume Chi Chi votes for Kennedy. The end result is that Kennedy and Trixie earn enough votes over Shangela and Bebe to make it into the top two.

After an emotional lip sync to “Wrecking Ball” by Miley Cyrus, Trixie Mattel takes it. She’s not the best winner in franchise history, not by a long shot, but she’s certainly one of the best drag queens to ever compete on RuPaul’s Drag Race. This was about minting someone who was already a winner in the real world, and that’s a pretty damn good reason for a win.

How the fanbase takes this win is to be determined, but frankly, I’m tired of sticking my finger in the air to see how the wind blows. There’s been a lot of noise this season that drowned out more constructive conversation about the show. Was this season a disappointment? Arguably, yes. It certainly was for me personally. But “Drag Race” on a bad day is still more entertaining than most shows. We expect a ton of it, and are quick to criticize heavily when it fails us. Sometimes, the criticism is fair; often, it’s whining about rigging when our faves don’t make it far.

The world is better for having “Drag Race” on the air. And I’m thrilled we’re moving on to another season with new girls and, hopefully, a new vibe. But Trixie can raise her head high. She’s the winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars,” and nothing can take that away from her.

It’s all over but the shouting — and the final thoughts, of course:

“All Stars” season 3 sits in the bottom three or four seasons for me, only besting All Stars season one, and the flagship series’ seasons 1 and 7 on a quality level. But even original recipe seasons 1 and 7 are important to the show’s legacy and growth — hell, I think season 7 is maybe the most important season of “Drag Race.” But that’s a subject for another time. For now, I’ll just say that “All Stars” season 3 wasn’t in any real way important to the show’s growth, and I hope season 10 improves on that point.

I hope All Stars season 3 improves “Drag Race” season 9’s legacy in retrospect. That one isn’t a perfect season, but it does sit in the top half or so of “Drag Race” seasons, and got a deeply unfair reputation when it aired. A much worse season directly following it should give it a bit more shine in the rear-view mirror.

Shangela’s final look was a goddamn dream. Trixie and Kennedy’s were both impressive, for their respective surprise factor and glow-up factor. Bebe flopped this whole episode, and her look was no exception. It was disappointing to see a queen who gave us some major moments this season (Jungle Kitty, “The Boss”) underwhelm at the finish line.

Speaking of, Bebe’s “The Boss” reigns as my favorite individual lip sync performance of the season. DeLa’s “Anaconda” and Shangela’s “Freaky Money” come close.

Aja and Thorgy killed the jury segment, asking smart questions and looking great. DeLa was practically invisible, which felt odd to me.

Though I appreciated the idea of casting nothing bu queens who didn’t finish in the top three (excepting Bebe, of course), the resulting season was too high on drama and not strong enough creatively. So for “All Stars” season 4 — which shouldn’t air until summer 2020 at the absolute earliest — I’d recommend a mix. Give us Stacy Layne Matthews, Jessica Wild, Valentina, Ongina, but also give us Shea Coulee, Trinity Taylor, Courtney Act, etc. And please, please, for the love of Ru, change the format. Lip Sync for Your Legacy was a gag once, but it is fully tired.

This season turned sour in a flash, but the response we got from these recaps was worth the more unpleasant moments. Thank you all so much for reading. Here’s to better seasons in the future, and drag on our TV screens in all sorts of formats forever.Ava DuVernay is taking on the world of superheroes: She has just signed to direct a new film in the DC Extended Universe.

The movie will be called “New Gods” and is based on the DC Comics series of the same name that first came out in 1971.

The eponymous New Gods are “natives of the twin planets of New Genesis and Apokolips,” according to Variety. The magazine describes New Genesis as “an idyllic planet ruled by the Highfather” and Apokolips as “a dystopia filled with machinery and fire pits ruled by the tyrant Darkseid.”

DuVernay most recently directed the fantasy film “A Wrinkle in Time,” starring Oprah, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and others. Her work on that movie made her the first woman of color in Hollywood to direct a live-action film with a production budget of at least $100 million. She was also director of the historical drama “Selma” and the Oscar-nominated documentary “13th.”

Last year’s blockbuster success “Wonder Woman” marked the first time a woman ― in that case, Patty Jenkins ― had helmed a superhero film in the DC Universe. So it only makes sense that DC would hire a powerhouse like DuVernay to follow suit.

Jenkins even tweeted at DuVernay to thank her for “A Wrinkle in Time,” and the two exchanged kind words. DuVernay said she looked forward to seeing Jenkins “around the block.”

As for DuVernay’s possible comic book prowess, she’s already proven she’s a fan ― particularly of New Gods. She tweeted last year that Big Barda, a New God, was her favorite superhero character:

All hail Queen Ava.The government agency tasked with guiding relief and recovery efforts after catastrophic natural disasters has decided not to take climate change into account as it plans ahead for the future.

On Thursday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency released its 2018-2022 “Strategic Plan,” a document it describes as setting FEMA’s “overall vision” with the aim of readying the nation for catastrophic disasters.

While it concedes disasters will become more devastating and more costly in the next five years, FEMA has stripped all mention of climate change from the 38-page document, despite it being a significant cause of exactly the type of damaging storms they’re preparing for.

Instead of acknowledging the risks posed by climate change, FEMA said “rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience” are primarily to blame.

Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. $306 billion in 2017, making it the costliest, most damaging year on record. That figure ― and the damage behind it ― will increase as the temperature rises.

“Natural disasters have caused a record-setting amount of damage in the U.S.,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in response to the 2017 figures when they were released in January. “There’s no denying that climate change will cost the U.S. trillions more in the next decade and that we have a financial and national security reason to act.”

FEMA Public Affairs director William Booher defended the puzzling exclusion in an email to NPR, emphasizing the agency focuses less on causes and more on mitigating their effects.

“It is evident that this strategic plan fully incorporates future risks from all hazards regardless of cause,” Booher wrote. “Building upon the foundation established by FEMA’s previous two Strategic Plans, this plan commits the agency, and the nation, to taking proactive steps to increasing pre-disaster investments in preparedness and mitigation.”

In contrast, FEMA’s 2014-2018 Strategic Plan named climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk ― and it urged we take action.There are Second Amendment supporters, and there are Second Amendment supporters.

And then, on an even higher rung, is Ohio state Rep. Niraj Antani (R), who believes students at least 18 years old should be able to carry long guns inside public high schools.

The Republican legislator insists he isn’t advocating arming students, but told the Dayton Daily News that teens who meet the legal requirement of gun ownership should have the option of bringing rifles to class.

“The law is anybody above 21 can have a handgun and anybody above 18 can have a long gun, and so anyone who complies with the law should be able to carry and protect themselves,” Antani told the paper. “If you look at what happened many decades ago, people brought their firearms to school. They kept them in their cars, maybe, but there was not a problem.”

Antani added that he believes anyone of legal age should be able to carry a firearm wherever they want.

“The only restriction I believe in is for private property,” he said.

Antani first opened up about his very open idea of open carry on Wednesday, during a Twitter beef with Zach Dickerson, a Democrat challenging him in this year’s election.

@NirajAntani will continue his support for HB 233 which is the "stand your ground" bill they oppose. That's why I'm running against Niraj for his seat in the Ohio House. I stand with the students. Niraj ignores them. https://t.co/qprLbCp5Dq — Zach Dickerson (@ZachForHouse) March 14, 2018

Antani fired back.

Woah, Zach. Stop lying. Had they requested to meet with me, I would have. I meet with all constituents. — Rep. Niraj Antani (@NirajAntani) March 14, 2018

Dickerson then asked Antani to renounce state legislation he’s co-sponsoring that would allow people licensed to carry a concealed handgun to avoid charges if they carry a deadly weapon into a gun-free zone.

Here's you opportunity to prove me wrong. Renounce your support for HB 233 and stand with the students. Listen to your constituents and support smart gun safety laws. — Zach Dickerson (@ZachForHouse) March 14, 2018

Instead, Antani advocated armed students, and parroted an NRA argument that more guns enhance safety.

Students deserve a chance to stand their ground and defend themselves. — Rep. Niraj Antani (@NirajAntani) March 14, 2018

On Friday, the president addressed a White House summit on prison reform and later commented ― where else? ― on Twitter:

America is a Nation that believes in the power of redemption. America is a Nation that believes in second chances - and America is a Nation that believes that the best is always yet to come! #PrisonReform pic.twitter.com/Yk5UJUYgHN — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2018

Prison reform is a serious issue, of course, but some people doubted that Trump was mainly concerned about those already behind bars.

And some people were just confused by a Trump who seemed to show compassion.Comedian James Adomian Kelly Sullivan via Getty Images

Comedian James Adomian thinks it would be nice if “Saturday Night Live” put a gay man on the show ― something they haven’t done in more than 30 years.

“I’ve been out of the closet the whole time since I auditioned 13 years ago.” Adomian told The Daily Beast at SXSW. “You would think that they would have tried to put someone else on that was a gay man. It’s about time.”

Adomian is perhaps best known for his recent portrayals of Bernie Sanders, often playing opposite Anthony Atamanuik’s impression of President Donald Trump. He appears with Atamanuik on the latter’s “The President Show” that airs on Comedy Central.

Terry Sweeney was the first openly gay regular cast member from 1986 to 1987, but since then Kate McKinnon has been just the second openly LGBTQ cast member in the show’s 43 seasons.

Danitra Vance was the first African-American woman added as a regular cast member in 1985, but it’s unclear how public she was about being LGBTQ while on the show. Not until her death from breast cancer in 1994 was her relationship with another woman made public.

Adomian doesn’t believe it’s overt homophobia, but rather executives of the show being afraid of what their audiences might think. “TV executives are the slowest cowards.”

“It certainly didn’t help that I was openly gay,” Adomian said of his “SNL” auditions.Seth Meyers revealed an element of truth to one of President Donald Trump’s lies on Thursday’s broadcast of “Late Night.”

Earlier this week, Trump openly admitted to “outright lying to Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, about the U.S.’s trade relationship with Canada,” said Meyers.

“I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid,” Trump said at a Missouri fundraising event on Wednesday.

Trump later walked back his story, but Meyers concluded that “in fairness, ‘I lie because I’m stupid’ is the truest thing Trump has ever said.”

Meyers also likened the White House’s high turnover of staff to “that crappy restaurant you worked at in college.”

“You’d like take two days off, and when you came back there were four trainees and a new manager and now there’s moussaka on the menu and you thought, ‘Oh, this place isn’t going to make it,’” joked Meyers.

AdvertisementVeteran journalist Dan Rather got philosophical to take apparent aim at President Donald Trump on Thursday.

The former CBS News anchor tweeted the following quote attributed to 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in what appeared to be a swipe at Trump’s habit of spreading misinformation.

"By a lie a man throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a man. A man who himself does not believe what he tells another … has even less worth than if he were a mere thing. … makes himself a mere deceptive appearance of man, not man himself." - Immanuel Kant — Dan Rather (@DanRather) March 15, 2018

“By a lie a man throws away and, as it were, annihilates his dignity as a man,” wrote Rather. “A man who himself does not believe what he tells another … has even less worth than if he were a mere thing. … makes himself a mere deceptive appearance of man, not man himself.”

On Wednesday, Trump admitted to making up trade deficit details during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — before then walking the entire story back.

Rather has not been shy about criticizing the White House in recent months, and previously used a food poisoning analogy to sum up the “age of Trump.”

His latest dig was well-received on Twitter:

Trump griped to donors in the state about a made-up bowling ball test Japan imposes on U.S. cars. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters

President Donald Trump had people scratching their heads when he referred — with obvious annoyance — to an unpassable “bowling ball test” that Japan uses to justify excluding American cars from the market.

Trump insisted to donors in Missouri on Wednesday that a U.S. automaker had spent a “fortune” building a super car to beat Japanese regulatory tests — but was pounded in the “bowling ball test,” according to an audiotape of his talk obtained by NBC News and The Washington Post.

“It’s horrible the way they treat us. It’s horrible,” the angry president griped.

The test, he said, involves dropping a bowling ball “from 20 feet up in the air” onto the hood of a car. “If the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify,” he said. “Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn’t qualify.”

There is no such regulatory test. The best guess on what Trump was talking about?

The Post speculated it was likely linked to a goofy Nissan ad showing bowling balls bouncing wildly down a street. The balls smash several parked cars. Only a Nissan cruises by unscathed ... “urban proof.”

When a smiling reporter who covered the Japanese auto industry for 25 years told White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders that no one has any idea what the president was talking about, she said Trump clearly was “joking.”

Sanders closes by claiming that Trump's made-up story about the Japanese dropping bowling balls on cars was a joke.

“Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” Sanders said. Trump’s reference “illustrates the creative ways” countries keep American goods out of their markets, she said.

The donor talk in Missouri was the same place where Trump boasted that he dressed down Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for having a trade surplus with the U.S. (The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative actually reports a trade deficit with America).O.J. Simpson said he appreciated fellow football player Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem the first time he did it, but still thinks it was “a mistake.”

He also said that Donald Trump is a lot of fun to hang around with, although he doubts he’d ever vote for the man.

The former NFL great-turned-“Trial of the Century” defendant offered his take on a wide range of topics in an exclusive interview with the Buffalo News published Friday.

For one thing, Simpson disagrees with Kaepernick’s decision to protest police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.

“I think Colin made a mistake. I really appreciate what he was trying to say. I thought he made a bad choice in attacking the flag,” Simpson told the newspaper. “I grew up at a time when deacons were in the KKK. I don’t disrespect the Bible because of those guys. The flag shouldn’t be disrespected because of what cops do. The flag represents what we want America to be.”

His bottom line: “I would always stand up for the flag.”

Simpson also hesitated to say whether he would have voted for Trump, whom he called “a man’s man.” (It was a hypothetical question because Simpson was behind bars in November 2016.)

The two men were once friends and golfing buddies. Simpson even attended the future president’s 1993 wedding to Marla Maples ― six months before he himself was accused of murdering his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, as well as her friend Ronald Goldman.

“Somebody asked me if I’d have voted for him,” Simpson said. “Probably not, but I only know two of my friends I’d vote to be president. Some of my best, best besties I would not vote to be president. That has no bearing on it, you know?”

He also admitted that he sometimes wonders if he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from his football days.

“Well, I don’t know,” he said. “I feel all right. But I have days when I can’t ... I lose words, and I can’t come up with a simple word. I can’t remember a phone number, so forget that.”Matthew Morrison says he's "called the producers to express my outrage" over the apparent abuse of a German shepard on the set of "Crazy Alien."

Actor Matthew Morrison expressed outrage on Friday over reports that a dog was abused during the filming of “Crazy Alien,” the upcoming science fiction movie he stars in.

A whistleblower reportedly sent animal rights group PETA disturbing footage of what the group says is a caged German shepherd being dropped into a river on the film’s set in Changsha, China.

“I’ve just been made aware and seen a video from the set of a film I worked on in China,” the “Glee” star tweeted. “My heart is broken to see any animal treated this way. Had I been on set or known about this, I would have made all efforts to stop this. I’ve called the producers to express my outrage.”

Had I been on set or known about this, I would have made all efforts to stop this. I’ve called the producers to express my outrage. — Matthew Morrison (@Matt_Morrison) March 16, 2018

PETA says the video was shot in November and shows a cage containing a dog suspended from a crane. Several individuals appear to be holding the cage back with a rope before they suddenly release it. The cage spins wildly in the air, falls into a river, and is submerged for a few seconds before it’s raised back into the air.

PETA told HuffPost that the footage that was being filmed was for a scene in which an alien picks up the dog and tosses it around. HuffPost reached out to the film’s production company, Dirty Monkey Films Group, but did not immediately receive a response.

PETA says the whistleblower reported that there were multiple takes of this scene, and another scene where a handler “tormented the dog ‘into a frenzy’” over a two-hour time period. The dog allegedly never received breaks.

“PETA is urging the actors to hold the production accountable and calling for the public to boycott this film,” the organization said in a statement. “This scene should be cut, and [director Ning Hao] should commit to never working with live animals again. We’re asking that the cast — including ‘Glee’ actor Matthew Morrison — donate their salaries to animal-protection charities in China.”“Weird Al” Yankovic just made digital music history.

His newest song, “The Hamilton Polka,” debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Comedy Digital Track Sales chart and at No. 23 on the Digital Song Sales chart, which counts every genre.

Upon hearing the news, Yankovic asked:

Thanks! I wonder, is this the first time a polka song has landed on the Billboard Digital Song Sales chart? https://t.co/6z291ds3H4 — Al Yankovic (@alyankovic) March 13, 2018

Billboard said yes. The tune is the first-ever polka to crack the Digital Song Sales chart in its 14-year history.

“Polka music, a Bohemian dance genre popularized in Eastern Europe in the 19th century, rarely makes a splash on Billboard’s charts,” Billboard noted. “In fact, Yankovic is almost surely the only artist to land any polka songs on our charts in decades.”

The song had 17,000 paid downloads and 1.2 million U.S. streams, Billboard reported.

“Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, a close personal friend of Al, sent his congratulations:

Yes.

Congratulations, my friend...history has its eyes on you! https://t.co/EtJoQvWzlN — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) March 16, 2018

Miranda has extra reason to be happy. In addition to being a hit for Yankovic, the song also boosted sales of the “Hamilton” soundtrack to an eight-month high, Billboard noted.A Texas newspaper is standing by its decision to remove all references to a gay man’s husband from his mother’s obituary.

When Dallas resident Barry Giles originally submitted an obituary for his mother, Brenda Light, to the Olton Enterprise, it read, “Those left to cherish her memories include her son, Barry Giles, and his husband, John Gambill, of Dallas.”

By the time Light’s obituary appeared in the Feb. 23 edition of the newspaper, however, Gambill’s name had been removed.

“It wiped John completely off the picture like he didn’t exist,” Giles, who has been with Gambill for 31 years, told Fox 4 News. “We’re human beings like anyone else. We have feelings. We have relationships, whether [the publisher] agrees with them or not.”

Gambill told the Dallas Voice he immediately contacted the Olton Enterprise’s owner and editor, Phillip Hamilton, to ask what had happened. Light, he said, had been “like a second mom,” traveling with the two men to Europe, Australia and New Zealand before her sudden death on Feb. 14.

“Because I wanted to cut it out,” Hamilton said, according to the Dallas Voice.

Hamilton, who is reportedly also a bi-vocational Baptist pastor, didn’t refute the couple’s claim. In a statement released Thursday, he said it’s his “religious conviction that a male cannot have a husband.”

“It is also my belief that to publish anything contrary to God’s Word on this issue would be to publish something in the newspaper that is not true,” he said. Calling the paper’s edits “both ethical and lawful,” he added, “It would be unethical to publish a news item that is known by the editor to be false.”

“Based on the truth found in the Word of God,” Hamilton concluded, “I could not in good conscience identify Mr. Gambill as the husband of Mr. Giles.”

Light’s obituary, meanwhile, had been printed in full in a number of other local newspapers without editing, Giles said.

Since news of the story broke this week, the Olton Enterprise’s Facebook page has been filled with negative reviews.

“The fact that your newspaper would do something so hideous and despicable to a grieving son and his husband defies my ability to adequately shame you for it,” one person wrote. “If your editor has his head so far up his own ass that he’s unaware that gays can get legally married now, maybe he should have gone into theology instead of journalism.”

Added another, “Your personal opinions and beliefs have no place anywhere but the editorial page.”Jason Triplett, who this week shoved a Boston police vehicle out of a snowbank while dressed as Elsa from “Frozen,” had one wish for the viral internet fame his helpful stunt earned.

“If this is my 15 minutes, I would like to leverage it to meet Adam Rippon,” the 37-year-old lawyer said.

Rippon, the U.S. figure skater who became a breakout star at the Winter Olympics, responded. Sort of.

In an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” posted Thursday (watch above), Rippon was asked if he had a message for Triplett.

“They say not all heroes wear capes, but sometimes they do,” Rippon said.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) took aim at his own party over its unwavering support of President Donald Trump.

“Never has a party abandoned and fled its principles and deeply held beliefs so quickly as my party did in the face of the nativist juggernaut,” Flake said on Thursday in a speech to the National Press Club, according to the Arizona Republic. “We have become strangers to ourselves.”

Flake, who is not seeking re-election, said:

“If we are going to cloister ourselves in the alternative truth of an erratic leader, if we are going to refuse to live in the world that everyone else lives in and reckon with the daily reality that they face, including the very real anxiety that they feel, then my party might not deserve to lead.”

He called on the Republican Party to act now to “mitigate and repair the damage” caused by Trump.

“As we are discovering and as we will discover for years to come, there is no damage like the damage a president can do,” he said.

Flake has previously warned that his party could lose elections over its embrace of the president, and he donated to Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) when he was running against Trump-endorsed Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual abusing minors when he was in his 30s.Every single one of Chile’s 34 Roman Catholic bishops has offered to resign in response to the country’s clergy sex abuse scandal.

The mass resignation offer from the entire bishops conference, announced on Friday, was the first of its kind in modern Catholic history. The move was greeted with praise by the victims of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest.

Juan Carlos Cruz, one of three men who met privately with Pope Francis last month to discuss the scandal, said on Twitter that the pontiff appeared to have listened to their stories of survival. The resignations would “change things forever,” Cruz said.

“I’m very excited with all of this. It’s good for our beloved country, for so many people who have suffered because of corrupt and deceitful bishops, and also survivors who have been ignored all over the world,” Cruz wrote. ” There’s no going back. History has changed. Thank you truly.”

Estoy bien emocionado con todo esto. Le hace bien a nuestro querido país, a tanta gente q ha sufrido por obispos corruptos y mentirosos, y de paso a todos los sobrevivientes q han sido ninguneados en el mundo entero. Ya no hay pie atrás. La historia cambió. Gracias de verdad. — Juan Carlos Cruz Ch. (@jccruzchellew) May 18, 2018

Jose Andres Murillo, another survivor who met with Francis, tweeted that he hopes the bishops will in fact be removed from their positions.

The 31 active bishops and three retired ones placed their signatures on a document offering their resignation and leaving their fates up to Francis. Francis can accept the resignations on an individual basis, reject them, or delay a decision, The Associated Press reports.

“[The bishops] didn’t know how to protect the weakest, they exposed them to abuse and then impeded justice,” Murillo wrote Friday. “For this, they only deserve to go.”

Por dignidad, justicia y verdad: váyanse todos los obispos. Delincuentes. No supieron proteger a los más débiles, los expusieron a abusos y luego impidieron justicia. Por eso, solo merecen irse — José Andrés Murillo (@JosAndrsMurillo) May 18, 2018

The offer to resign en masse comes at the conclusion of a three-day emergency summit called by Pope Francis to address the ongoing crisis in Chile. For years, abuse victims have claimed the Chilean bishops conference protected abusive priests by shuttling them around to different dioceses rather than reporting them to the police.

The pope had sent the Vatican’s top sex crimes prosecutor, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile after receiving heated backlash about the way he also appeared to dismiss victims’ claims.

In January, Francis was caught on tape accusing Karadima’s victims of slander against Chile’s Bishop Juan Barros. The victims claimed the bishop had witnessed abuse by the pedophile priest and did nothing to stop it. The Vatican found Karadima guilty of sexually abusing minors in 2011, but Barros continued to enjoy the Holy See’s favor. Francis tapped Barros to lead the Osorno Diocese in 2015 over protestations from victims and even local Catholic clergy.

But the crisis in Chile extends far beyond Karadima and Barros. In recent years, sex abuse victims have come forward with claims against Chilean religious orders, such as the Salesians, Franciscans and the Marist Brothers.

After meeting with Karadima’s survivors last month and reviewing Scicluna’s 2,300-page report about the scandal, Francis has reportedly come to the conclusion that the entire Chilean bishops conference was collectively responsible for gravely mishandling the crisis. In a document distributed to the bishops and leaked to Chilean media, the pope apparently rebuked the Chilean church for destroying evidence, minimizing sex crimes, and neglecting to protect children from pedophile priests. The Vatican has confirmed the leaked document’s authenticity to the AP and Reuters.

On Friday, the Chilean bishops thanked Francis for offering “brotherly correction.”

“Above all, we want to ask forgiveness for the pain caused to the victims, to the pope, to the people of God and our country for the serious errors and omissions committed by us,” the bishops’ statement said, according to Reuters.

Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the clergy sex abuse tracking organization BishopAccountability, called Friday’s announcement “stunning” and “necessary.”

She hopes Francis will accept all of the bishops’ resignations, Barrett Doyle told HuffPost. However, she believes it’s crucial that Francis creates efficient systems for investigating and disciplining bishops who have enabled child abuse in other countries.

“The Chilean church is not atypical,” she said. “Change is occurring in Chile simply because that situation caused a public relations debacle for the pope himself.”

“To stop the horror of child sexual abuse by clergy, the church must finally enact reforms at a global level.”
