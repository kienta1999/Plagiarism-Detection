Cedric the Entertainer has done the whole drama thing before.

You know the thing I’m talking about, where comedians take on serious roles meant to defy the wheelhouse Hollywood slots them into. Bill Murray in “Lost in Translation.” Mo’Nique in “Precious.” Mary Tyler Moore in “Ordinary People.”

The year was 2008. Cedric’s reinvention bid was a Broadway play written by none other than David Mamet, the loquacious firebrand whose heady work has been a rite of passage for actors as varied as Al Pacino, Madonna, Patti LuPone and Alec Baldwin.

“Cedric the Entertainer thought he’d try being Cedric the Actor,” The New York Times quipped, expressing understandable surprise over seeing someone with such a stable comedic presence appear in an edgy crime drama.

The production, co-starring John Leguizamo and Haley Joel Osment, closed almost as quickly as it opened. Cedric the Actor never truly took off.

But he’s trying again. With this year’s somber provocation “First Reformed,” opening in limited release May 18, Cedric has found a larger platform to showcase the serious chops that so many comic performers long to mine. A workaholic who is best known for “Barbershop” and “The Original Kings of Comedy,” he’s risen to the occasion. In the film, he plays the compassionate, steely head pastor of a church in upstate New York, where a junior reverend (Ethan Hawke) is struck by grief and a crisis of faith. In a departure from his usual scene-stealing antics, Cedric grounds his performance with watchful dignity.

Casting Cedric the Entertainer, credited in the movie as Cedric Kyles, marks a full-circle moment for Paul Schrader, the “Taxi Driver” and “American Gigolo” scribe who wrote and directed “First Reformed.” In his 1979 directorial debut “Blue Collar,” Schrader employed Richard Pryor as a hard-up autoworker who robs his company’s union headquarters. Pryor didn’t get enough plaudits for that movie, which means we can’t let Hollywood undervalue just how solid Cedric is in “First Reformed.”

The day before I called Cedric to talk about his career evolution, CBS announced that it had picked up his new multi-camera sitcom, “Welcome to the Neighborhood” ― a mere two weeks after TBS ordered a second season of the Tracy Morgan comeback vehicle “The Last O.G.,” in which Cedric has a supporting role.

During our conversation, we talked about the politicization of comedy, what it’s like to audition for the first time in years, Bernie Mac holograms and who bit Beyoncé.

With “First Reformed,” “The Last O.G.” and your new CBS series, you’re suddenly inhabiting a few different creative realms. Since these projects tend to get made in vacuums, do you feel like you’re shifting from one headspace to the next right now?

For me, it is that kind of thing. I definitely always felt very versatile, and now it’s all coming at once. As a comedic actor, we always want to look for roles and opportunities to be seen seriously, where people go, “Oh, OK, I didn’t know you had that in you. I like that.”

Had you told your agents you wanted serious material?

Yeah, that definitely was a conversation. We did the third or fourth “Barbershop,” and I’d done a sitcom, “The Soul Man,” for five seasons. That was a real conversation, and it was one where we knew, to be in the dramatic roles, you may have to go audition. You have to take the idea that you’re a big deal and put that on the back burner, and decide, yeah, you’re going to go in and meet with people and convince folks.

Even the opportunity to appear in the movie “Why Him?” was one, as well. That was another small movie, but with James Franco and Bryan Cranston, really dope actors, that you show up and you have to go audition for. You go in and you make your splash.

So this all fell in that same realm, where I was willing to do the work, willing to go meet the people, willing to try to convince Paul Schrader to do something different. He actually wanted to cast differently for this role, and it just kind of worked out that, when we met, it made sense for him.

Do you have an idea of what he was looking for?

From my understanding, he knew he had Ethan [Hawke] and Amanda [Seyfried]. It seemed like he wanted somebody who was going to be a shocking cast, in a way. A casting where people go, “Oh, shit, I wasn’t expecting that.” But he didn’t want comedy at all, so he wasn’t sure he wanted a comedian.

It was another preacher, and I’ve played preachers in comedies, so that was one of the things I was a little apprehensive about. I was like, man, my audience is not really going to see me do anything different if I’m playing a preacher. But after meeting with Paul and understanding what he was looking for, I was like, this movie is going to be dark. I read the script, and there’s no way for you to see me as the same “Soul Man” preacher watching this movie. These are not the same dudes at all.

So you did audition?

I didn’t have to audition. It was a meeting. And from the meeting, we were able to go, “All right, I like it. Let’s do it.”

I did have to go and audition for “Why Him?,” which was weird because the audition process is ― you go in and all your friends are there. I was finishing up “Soul Man,” and I was the executive producer and No. 1 on the call sheet. I’m sitting in there with [people who auditioned for “Soul Man”], and it’s like, “We’re the same now. This is Hollywood.”

Before “Why Him?” it must have been years since you’d auditioned for anything.

Yeah, it had been quite a while. Everything was usually a call: “Hey, we want you to be part of it” and “Ced, are you available?” You know, the great side of Hollywood, when life is good and you’re drinking seltzer water.

Do you see it as a mark of achievement that you don’t have to audition, rather than a sign that Hollywood slots you into the same roles over and over?

In the way that Hollywood is built, once you’re offer-only, as they call it, you take on this attitude that you’ve built up this pedigree. People know you’re either going to make me an offer [without auditioning] or you’re not, in which case I’m going to keep on moving.

For me, the parallel to your question is that I know people are going to offer-only me for comedy spots, but not necessarily for dramatic roles. So I have to be willing to go in and audition [for dramatic roles]. I have to show people that I’m willing to put in the work and want to do something different here.

You’ve talked about how you arrived at Cedric the Entertainer as your professional name, but this is the first time you’re credited as Cedric Kyles. Did that decision come out of a desire to be seen as a more serious actor?

Yeah. In trying to have the opportunity to be seen as a dramatic screen actor, I understand that, after 30 years of building this thing as Cedric the Entertainer, with great stand-up properties and Netflix specials and “Kings of Comedy,” and then to do movies and television as well, it’s one of these things where you know that when people see the name, they’re going to instantly think it’s comedy. If you see me onscreen, you expect to see the comedy.

But now, if you see Cedric Kyles, I feel like it’s the opportunity to grow an audience in a different direction ― to have not only my audience look at me that way, but casting directors and writers. “Oh, I like Cedric. I like the humanity that he brings,” as opposed to the comedian that’s expected to show up.

Paul wanted to know if I was willing to do it. And it was something that we had been considering as part of my team, as well. We all went over it many different times, like, “Should I change my name?” You’ve got branding that’s been working for 30 years, and certain things you don’t want to give up. In this particular case, it made sense. This was the opportunity for me to say I’m the more dramatic character now.

In the future, do you think you’ll use Cedric the Entertainer for comedic work and Cedric Kyles for dramatic roles?

We don’t know. You definitely don’t want to keep pulling people in two directions. We’re going to try to massage that. I said, “Well, if you have Bono and Sting and Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, they get to still be certain names into their 60s.” The Edge! If you get to be The Edge when you’re 69, I get to be the Entertainer all the way through.

It’s different for rock stars, I guess, but you do wonder. I’m a little concerned about all the littles in the world. I don’t know how little you can stay for a long time. I don’t know if you can be Lil Wayne when you’re 65, but let’s give it a shot.

Have you ever asked any of the littles about their plans? Maybe they become bigs next.

I literally just thought of that sitting here talking to you, so this is actually new material right now. Thanks for writing jokes with me, buddy. Check’s in the mail.

I’ll be dining out on those royalties for a long time. Obviously, you have tremendous clout in Hollywood, but do you feel you’ve gotten your due? Do you think your career has been taken seriously enough as a comedian and an entertainer?

Of course, you see people get credit, and the world is starting to spin really fast from a stand-up point of view. You had the big tiff come up with Mo’Nique about Netflix paying certain comedians right. You’ll see yourself in that argument as, you know, really being the guy that people can trust, from “Kings of Comedy” to being consistent for 30 years to selling out concerts all the time. If you spend your money to go see me, you’re going to get a good time. I’m not a call-it-in kind of guy.

You wonder, “Wow, am I getting the proper accolades for that? Why am I not considered in the top blah-blah-blah?” That happens. And then when you’re consistently in film and on television — and I say this about John Goodman and actors where, no matter what they’re in, you know they’re going to kill it — what is that worth?

So yeah, you consider that sometimes. I think it is a world where there’s a lot of media where people get behind hype. There’s a lot of voices, including individual bloggers who have the ability to say, “Hey, you should pay attention to this guy.” I think it’s important for the actor to pay attention to them, too, because you recognize that they have unique and important jobs of really transferring your message to other people that you don’t know how to get to.

That’s something I have to learn. When you’re from the old school, you’re used to people giving you props. You get your props, you take that and then you kind of spin it. But now you have to go and re-earn an audience.

That’s the thing about being in this town. You realize if you don’t have 20 million followers that Hollywood somehow is going, “I don’t know if you’re really super A-list.” And you’re like, “Really? I’m 30 years deep with this brand.” It’s, “But you gotta have 7 million followers, otherwise we’re not putting you on our Met Gala list.”

So Cedric wants a Met Gala invitation. That makes sense. Do you think it’s easier for white actors to cross over in their careers? John Goodman is the perfect example of someone who navigates different worlds. Have you struggled as a performer of color in that regard?

I don’t know. I can’t really put my finger on anybody who has that same kind of ability to get cast like that. Maybe Anthony Mackie. Maybe. He can show up in different things. Usually, it’s dramatic, but he’s the kind of guy who can transfer from an all-urban film to a bigger film.

But I think, in Hollywood, there’s not a lot of versatility like that where people get to cross over. I’ve had a lot of versatility, when you think about it, from the opportunity to do a movie with the Coen brothers, “Intolerable Cruelty,” and then “Be Cool.” Then you come back and you do a “Barbershop” series. But I think that in the course of the last year or so, with the big emergence of urban film and writers and directors, that these opportunities may open up a little bit more.

The last time people banged the drum for Cedric the Serious Actor was in 2008, when you appeared on Broadway in David Mamet’s “American Buffalo.” Mamet’s writing is considered very highbrow and literary. That play didn’t stay open for long, but did you see it as your entryway into serious parts?

Definitely. It was definitely the first step. To do that at the time was really just to say, “OK, I want to do Broadway. I want to have that on my résumé.”

But when I went to do the work, I was surprised. I was working with John Leguizamo, who’s a Broadway legend who loves doing it and is also a great dramatic actor. It was the kind of experience where I had to work the most I’d ever worked. I didn’t realize how serious it was, and I didn’t have what would be my normal go-to tools in the sense that I’ve got a sense of humor and I’m an observationist. I can improvise, I can jump off the page, I can make up something on the spur of the moment. Even when you’re in comedic films, I’ve kind of earned the leisure to do that. In all the “Barbershop” movies, if I feel like saying something different in a take, it’s just A-OK because it’s Cedric and it’s going to be funny.

But when you do Broadway, you can’t.

So without having my regular stuff out of my toolbox that I get to use, I found myself really having to put in a lot of work. I did look at that as an opportunity to platform me into more dramatic roles. My personal reviews were good, but because it was a short run, I didn’t get to maximize on that. But it definitely was the thing that sparked me to want to do more dramatic roles like “First Reformed.”

Around the same time, you said you wanted to develop a Marcus Garvey movie. What happened?

I’ve been trying to find the right writer. I haven’t found anybody. I just recently came across a person who had the skeleton of a screenplay that I liked. I went to Costa Rica and found this little town where Marcus Garvey lived. I thought it was a more interesting tale. I’m looking for a really specific tale. It’s something I’m still on. I feel like I can’t take a chance where I just throw anything out there and it looks like a Lifetime movie. It’s got to be something that I’m really surprised by. But it’s definitely a passion project.

Do you have a lot of projects that you’ve tried to get off the ground over the years that haven’t come to fruition?

Oh yes. Oh man, a million of them, including “Johnson Family Vacation 2.” It’s so hard to do a movie. That’s one where the studio green-lit the basics of the idea. I do write, but I don’t necessarily have the time to write the whole script because I’m constantly being booked. That’s one of the things now, just finding writing talent that can transfer what you say, put it on paper and make it a story that you want to do so you can go forward and shoot the movie.

A couple of great ideas I love: a Columbo-esque, “Monk”-type character that I’ve wanted to develop for a while. That’s the type of character I grew up on. When “Monk” came out, it reminded me of that same kind of eccentric character that solves weird crimes. I have a character, Sudden Flavors, that’s another thing I want to do.

You’d wanted to get the Original Kings of Comedy back together at one point.

Yeah, we tried. We were very close. We had a couple of scripted ideas, and then we had the idea of just getting back together to do a mini-tour. It was right around the time Bernie [Mac] was ill. A lot of people didn’t know how ill he was. We thought we could squeeze it in, but unfortunately the timing on that didn’t work out.

Since then, nobody really wanted to do it without him. It was this weird thing: Do we replace Bernie with someone? Do we do it without him? Do we do him as a hologram like at Coachella with Tupac? How weird do we want to go with this? It just became an idea where eventually Steve [Harvey] took on his 137th show. He just couldn’t do it. He’s hosting “Family Feud” and “Little Big Shots” and a radio show, and I’m like, “OK, Steve, that’s it.”

Did you really talk about a Bernie Mac hologram?

It did come about. It was one of those things. The technology was supposedly getting a lot better, and maybe we would do a short bit where we put Bernie up in this hologram situation. It was gonna be an expensive task. MTV still had the rights to the film, and I think they were transitioning into some other things. The idea never manifested all the way.

During the 2016 election, you more or less stayed away from Trump material because his mishaps were so constant. Now, they’ve only gotten worse. At this point, the jokes must write themselves. Do you feel an obligation to incorporate Trump fodder?

It is such a Trump fatigue. I feel like I got a couple of great jokes that I would be remiss if the audience didn’t hear ’em. But it’s definitely not a big part of my set. I’ve got a couple of nice punches I like, and I’ll do those things, but then I just kind of move on.

Even more so when I’m on the tour with the guys. D.L. [Hughley] is an extremely political comedian. George [Lopez], being Mexican, took it straight personal. He did a whole HBO special called “The Wall.” And [Eddie] Griffin is the same way, just an outspoken character about all things. So I go last, and when I’m onstage I definitely try to just stay away from it in general. It ends up being a thing where, if you don’t repeat it a lot, you find it being less and less a part of your act.

It’s almost like you’re a palate cleanser. “We’ve gotten Trump out of the way, now let’s talk about the rest of life.”

Word. But the fact that he’s about to take credit for getting these prisoners out, I just can’t even imagine how cocky he’s about to be right now. He might be like, “Melania, come hold my hand; you saw me get these men out.” He’s gonna be the new Ike Turner right now. He’s gonna change his hair. He’s gonna slick it back now like a blond Pat Riley. He’ll open up his shirt.

In terms of the cycle of joke-writing, by the time you’re done with an act, four more catastrophes have happened and we’ve already moved on to the next trauma.

That’s the truth. You gotta write the kind of jokes that can sustain over time. My tour manager takes notes while I’m on stage if I get up there and do something I’ve never done. He’ll be like, “Oh, that’s great.” I”ll be like, “That joke was for today, man. I’m not going to keep doing that joke. It went with the moment.” He’s like, “Why do you think like that?”

Certain things I can tell have a shelf life, and certain things you go, “It happened today. It was perfect for today. It may last till next weekend, but it’s not a joke I’m going to keep in my set.”

In “The Original Kings of Comedy,” one of your popular jokes discussed how differently a black president would have responded to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In thinking about how little Trump’s base seems to care about his sex scandals, does that joke make you think about how much those same people would have eviscerated President Barack Obama were he embroiled in harassment allegations and the Stormy Daniels story?

You know, it is really interesting to think about that. But I do think it is probably really the DNA of the society at the time. When Clinton came out, his story was like the new “Dallas.” It was something you wanted to watch because we had never really heard anything like that. Even if you go back to JFK in the ’60s, it was actually applauded. For him to be mashing Marilyn Monroe, people was like, “Yeah! That’s the dude!” It reminds you of “Mad Men.” It reminds you of the idea that misogyny and guys who had become successful had the right to be whatever they wanted to be. “You’re successful, so you should have it all.”

When you get to Obama, you recognize he was in the Twitter age and the early Instagram age. You definitely realize that, being a first, he would not have any of the leisure to blow off a scandal of any type, especially one of paying prostitutes and having unprotected sex with people that’s not your wife.

This Stormy Daniels stuff sounds crazy, but we live in a world now where we’re fatigued. We went through Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons and Brett Ratner and Matt Lauer. Everyone’s like, “OK, so people are having sex, and so did the president. Big deal.” That’s basically how he spins it. He’s the most unique spin artist I’ve ever seen. This guy, if you played ping-pong with him, you would not be able to hit his backhand. That’s for sure. I’ve never seen anybody take a story and say, “Look, guys, that’s nothing. Sure, I did it. Maybe my lawyer did pay her and I didn’t know about it.” And then Rudy Giuliani comes on, and he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. And that’s the answer we’re supposed to accept? “He’s new, guys, he doesn’t know everything.” Really, guys? Y’all are going to accept that as the answer? It’s so interesting.

But I think, to your point, within four hours, there’s going to be another new story. But I believe Trump, as a reality show personality and a superstar at it, he knew how to do a reality show. People loved “The Apprentice,” and I think he recognized that if you can just survive through the next news cycle, don’t worry about it.

I’m like, man, I wish Tiger Woods would have learned that, because he would have never had to fall so hard. But he took it so personal when he felt like the world hated him. Really, all you had to do was go, “Yeah, I messed up, guys, but let’s keep moving.” When he took it all personally, he fell out of the limelight for five, six, seven years. He lost all his confidence. Trump doesn’t have that in him at all. And now he’s a hero for getting three people out of North Korea, and that’s going to be the news.

Political fodder is commonplace in stand-up, but do you find that the film scripts you’re reading are more politically driven than the material you were handed earlier in your career? I’m thinking about the third “Barbershop” movie, which smartly addresses gang culture, the prison system, gentrification.

I definitely think so. I think about all the projects that I’ve been doing, including “The Last O.G.” and now “Welcome to the Neighborhood.” They all have a political undertone to them. Even in “First Reformed,” it’s religious, but it’s still this idea of choice and this idea of questioning big institutions, things where we say, “All right, these are big institutions in our world, and they should never be challenged.”

I think you’re right. It’s more common. From a writer’s point of view, what you feel the audience is expecting is this need to make sure that, even if you’re going to make something comedic, you need to have something real in there, some kind of message that people can be drawn to so you’re not just coming off with a degree of buffoonery, I guess. Most of the projects I see have a thing where it’s important to make this subversive, politically toned consciousness — a behavioral, cultural reference to something.

Having hosted the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, did you watch Michelle Wolf’s set?

Yeah, I thought she was amazing. I’ve done that before, and I know how stark that room can be. It’s a room of political people who come from all different sides. I did it for George W., so it was a very Republican White House.

But, in my opinion, even though it was a Republican Party behind him, he didn’t have that kind of “we toe the line for this guy” grouping behind him that Donald Trump has. Trump has almost a gang mentality. The Republican Party just rock with him strictly because they’re on that side, like, “We’ve claimed it, and therefore that’s it. We don’t look at the policies, we don’t look at the man. We’re Republicans, and we’re with this guy no matter what he does.”

That’s hard, for [Wolf] to stay true to her set even in the moments when the jokes weren’t going great. She started out with some great laughs, and then she had a little lull. But she stayed focused, and I really appreciated that. I thought she did great.

Final question: You appeared on Jay-Z’s “Black Album” and worked with Tiffany Haddish on “The Last O.G.” Who bit Beyoncé?

[Laughs.] That is the question. And I always say it’s pretty obvious. It goes back to my Columbo-“Monk”-type character: Who is the celebrity we know would be in the same place, has the same access, that is known for biting people?

It was Mike Tyson, guys. He just left a bite mark; he didn’t take the whole ear. But he’s a biter! Nobody’s saying anything. Nobody wants Mike to flare up again, so we just keep it down.Beyonce and Jay-Z looked crazy in love in photos that emerged Tuesday night from Kingston, Jamaica.

I’ve officially met Beyoncé — layne🦋🇯🇲 (@limetreelayne) March 20, 2018A coalition of environmental and animal welfare groups has filed an amended lawsuit targeting a new Trump administration policy that allows African elephant hunting trophies to be imported to the United States on a “case-by-case” basis.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, reversing President Donald Trump’s pledge to uphold a ban on importing elephant body parts, announced in a March 1 memo that it would immediately begin considering permit applications. The order ended an Obama-era ban on the import of such trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, describes the new Fish and Wildlife Service guidelines as unlawful and violations of the Endangered Species Act. The suit was brought by four groups, including the Humane Society and the Center of Biological Diversity, and names Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as a defendant.

“Despite ample scientific and economic concerns and tremendous public outcry over trophy hunting, this administration seems determined to allow Safari Club International and other special interests to unduly influence federal wildlife policy decisions,” Anna Frostic, an attorney for the Humane Society, said in a statement. Safari Club International is a trophy hunting lobbying group with close ties to Zinke.

Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017

Trump in November described big-game trophy hunting as a “horror show,” and in January pledged to uphold the ban on importing body parts.

The Fish and Wildlife Service memo undermined that vow, granting elephant trophy permits “on an individual basis.”

“Elephants shouldn’t be killed for cheap thrills, and the Trump administration shouldn’t make crucial trophy hunting decisions behind closed doors,” Tanya Sanerib, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Federal wildlife officials seem to be thumbing their nose at President Trump after he called for an end to the horror show of trophy hunting.”

The government memo also dismissed Endangered Species Act concerns for trophies taken from lions and bontebok, a species of antelope, hunted in several African countries.

The Fish and Wildlife Service said it changed the policy in response to a court ruling in December that faulted the Obama administration’s implementation of the trophy restriction.

But the lawsuit says the agency went beyond the court ruling by “wiping the slate clean” of longstanding restrictions, and violated its “statutory duty to promote the conservation of species threatened with extinction.”

The suit adds that the government “failed to rationally explain its 180 degree turn from determining that Zimbabwe is incapable of managing elephant hunting sustainably, to proclaiming open season on elephants and lions in Zimbabwe, a top destination for American trophy hunters due to lax regulations exacerbated by rampant corruption.”

In #Zimbabwe, the country from which most elephant trophies imported to the United States originate, wildlife management is so poor that the country has lost six percent of its elephants since 2001. 💔 https://t.co/7PJpxvjSfQ pic.twitter.com/4f1WmOL6O5 — The Humane Society of the United States (@HumaneSociety) March 20, 2018

The Fish and Wildlife Service has yet to issue any permits to import elephant trophies under its new guidelines, according to The Associated Press. It issued 37 permits for lion trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia after a similar ban was lifted last year. Zinke was sued by the same four environmental groups over that decision. This week’s complaint is an amendment to that ongoing case.

Zinke, a former Montana congressman, has a history of attacking endangered species.

He recently came under scrutiny for appointing an advisory board full of trophy hunters. His International Wildlife Conservation Council, which held its first meeting last week, includes “celebrity hunting guides, representatives from rifle and bow manufacturers, and well-heeled trophy collectors,” AP reported.

One board member, Peter Horn, is a co-owner of a private New York hunting preserve with Trump’s two big-game hunting adult sons.When he turned 18, Greg Demer lost his right to vote because of his autism, joining thousands of other people with mental disabilities who were stripped of the right during guardianship proceedings. More than a decade later, a different judge returned to him the right to vote. Linda Demer

By Matt Vasilogambros

Like many people with autism, Greg Demer is bright but has difficulty communicating. He has a passion for the history of military aircraft, but he can’t quite keep up a conversation with new people. When he meets someone, he’ll quote from movies or ask them about their favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.

His mother, Linda Demer, worried that he wouldn’t be able to make complicated decisions about his finances and health care once he turned 18. So, in 2005, a judge in Los Angeles, where they live, granted her conservatorship over Greg.

“I wanted to protect him,” she said of her son, who is now 31.

But in the conservatorship process, the judge also stripped away Greg’s right to vote. He was not only unfit to make decisions about his health care and finances, the judge ruled, but he also was unfit to participate in the democratic process.

In being declared “mentally incapacitated,” he joined tens of thousands of Americans with disabilities who every year lose their right to vote during guardianship proceedings, according to the California-based Spectrum Institute, an advocacy group for people with disabilities.

Laws in 39 states and Washington, D.C., allow judges to strip voting rights from people with mental disorders ranging from schizophrenia to Down syndrome who are deemed “incapacitated” or “incompetent.” Some of those states use archaic language like “idiots” or “insane persons” in their statutes.

The states that do not have similar restrictions are Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

Not only is there no agreement among legal and psychological experts over whether certain people with disabilities should be disenfranchised, but there is also no set standard for measuring the mental capacity needed to vote. There is a tension between protecting the integrity of the electoral process and the civil rights of a person under guardianship, said Dan Marson, a professor emeritus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s department of neurology.

“What should we require as a minimal standard?” he said. “There is not a clear answer.”

Should There Be Limits?

Fear of voter fraud is a primary reason why certain people with cognitive impairments are kept from the polls.

Alzheimer’s patients, for example, could be given a ballot while awake but only partially alert, and their caretaker or family member could cast it for them. Or a staff member at an assisted living facility could fill out or influence the ballots for dozens of people with severe cognitive issues.

“You would have people essentially voting twice,” said Pamela Karlan, the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at the Stanford University Law School. “Some people’s cognitive abilities are so impaired, they shouldn’t vote. They have no idea what’s going on.”

Karlan said people should not only express an interest in voting, but also understand what voting means.

A very small number of votes, and in some cases potentially “tainted” votes by people who don’t have the “mental capacity of understanding an election,” can make a big difference in a close race, said Paul Appelbaum, the director of the division of law, ethics and psychiatry at Columbia University’s department of psychiatry.

That sort of situation is not so farfetched, he said. A congressional race in Pennsylvania this month was decided by around 600 votes.

“Imagine if it became known that all the residents of a nursing home in the district voted in the election,” he said, “and many of them were so impaired that they didn’t know what the election was about or didn’t know what filling in a bubble on a form was.”

But in those examples of voter fraud, it’s not the person with a disability committing the crime — it’s the caretaker or family member, said Michelle Bishop, an advocacy specialist at the National Disability Rights Network based in Washington.

“We don’t strip someone of their rights in the name of protecting their rights,” Bishop said. “They are literally the last people in the U.S. who can get their right to vote stripped because of their identity. Having a disability does not mean you are not competent to vote.”

While some may not be able to make sound choices about their health care or finances, they can still understand and participate in the electoral process, Bishop said. The capacity to make choices depends on the situation.

Why a Standard Is Needed

Most states lack a clear legal definition of mental incapacitation, so it’s often up to a judge to make that determination, according to Jennifer Mathis, the director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Limiting the vote to people who have the mental capacity “sounds reasonable,” Mathis said, “but it is applied indiscriminately.”

Some judges take away the right from every person who comes before them in a guardianship case, she said. Other judges won’t preserve the right unless the person with a disability can name the mayor or president — something many people without disabilities can’t do, Mathis said.

Without a standard for measuring capacity, people with mental disabilities need to be properly represented in court, said Tom Coleman, the legal director of the Spectrum Institute. Coleman analyzed six months of court records and found that 90 percent of people with developmental disabilities placed under conservatorship in Los Angeles County were losing their right to vote. Statewide, 32,000 Californians have lost their right to vote in the past decade, he said.

“They were being pushed through the system as a matter of routine.”

Coleman lobbied for the California law, which took effect in 2016 and says the right to vote can be taken away only if a court finds “clear and convincing evidence” the person can’t express a desire to vote.

Voting ‘Capacity’

California, in its new law, joined Maryland, Nevada and New Mexico in adopting a standard promoted by the Bazelon Center and the American Bar Association. The standard is simple, Mathis said: Can a person communicate, with or without accommodations, a desire to vote?

“Can you make a choice?” she said. “It’s self-selecting. If someone with dementia can’t make a choice, yeah, that person doesn’t have the capacity to vote.”

However, a 2001 decision from the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine offered a stricter standard: Does a person understand the “nature and effect” of voting? Washington state uses that language in its statutes.

Appelbaum from Columbia University helped create that standard. He argued that people should know what they’re doing when they’re voting — both the process of casting a ballot and the consequence of that vote. If people don’t understand, it could “cast a shadow on the legitimacy of the process.”

The groups of people who are at the greatest risk of lacking capacity are those with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, his research shows. People with mild Alzheimer’s and nearly all people with a serious mental illness have the capacity to vote, his studies show.

Vague responses about candidates, like, “I just think he’s good,” are insufficient, according to the stricter standard. But Americans often vote for candidates for vague reasons, such as liking someone’s hair or thinking the candidate would be nice to have a beer with, said Jason Karlawish, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. People with disabilities shouldn’t have a tougher standard, he said.

The reason for wanting to vote for someone is sometimes as simple as, “She made me happy,” which was why Daniel Holm, a Nebraska man with Down syndrome, said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Mary McHale, his mother and legal guardian, sat down with the then-18-year-old and helped him fill out his absentee ballot, going candidate by candidate, consulting a chart she made about the candidates and their positions.

“I framed it in a way that he could understand,” she said. He reads at a fourth-grade level, and is making his way through the Harry Potter books.

When they finished, he signed his name and they mailed in the ballot. He was proud of his vote, his mother said, joining his cousins and other “typical people” who got to participate in the democratic process.

Getting the Right to Vote Back

An estimated 1.5 million adults are under legal guardianship nationwide, according to the AARP, but there is no data indicating how many have lost their right to vote. There is little movement in state legislatures to eliminate restrictions on voting for people with mental disabilities, Mathis said.

So, in places such as California, Coleman is hoping to restore the right to vote for many others who had them taken away. He’s helped Greg Demer get his back.

A decade after a judge stripped Demer of his right to vote, he had it restored by a different judge bending to pressure from Coleman. He missed 10 years of presidential, gubernatorial and mayoral races, but at the age of 28, Demer could finally vote.

“It was a way for my son to be proud of himself,” Linda Demer said, “and return some of his self-esteem.”

Henry Cavill’s mustache may now be gone. But it will certainly not be forgotten, especially by the British actor himself.

On Wednesday, the “Justice League” star shared an amusing tongue-in-cheek tribute to the former facial hair that he’d grown for his role in “Mission: Impossible ― Fallout” and dubbed the “Kingstache.”

“Oh, hello, don’t be alarmed. It’s me, Henry Cavill,” the actor said in this Instagram video that’s now going viral:

“I know, it’s hard to recognize me without Kingstache. Sometimes I even have trouble recognizing myself,” Cavill added.

“It’s hard for me to admit, this is not CGI,” he quipped, in reference to the awkward digital erasure of the hair for “Justice League” reshoots. “He’s really gone. I can tell you this, though: I will remember him, always.”

A nostalgic montage of photographs showing the mustachioed Cavill followed.

R. I. P. Kingstache.Katie Couric thanked Jimmy Kimmel for “donating his ass to awareness” after he underwent his first colonoscopy.

In a bid to raise awareness about colon cancer, the late-night comedian invited Couric and the cameras in to watch him undergo the procedure — which was then aired on Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

“You’re about to watch a camera go where no camera has ever gone before,” said Kimmel, who was prompted to take the test after turning 50.

The pre-recorded segment showed everything from Kimmel prepping for the screening the night before to him waking up from sedation after it was all over. And he was thankfully deemed fit and healthy.

As is to be expected from Kimmel, he also inserted plenty of gags to lighten the serious nature of the bit.

Couric, whose first husband Jay Monahan died of colon cancer at 42 in 1998, said she now felt a “responsibility to inform people about this test because it’s the second leading cancer killer of men and women combined.”

“Getting screened, you can nip it in the bud, literally,” she added.A Donald Trump supporter holds an anti-Hillary Clinton sign during a rally at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center on April 21, 2016 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Mark Makela via Getty Images

The president’s ability to come up with insulting nicknames may not be as keen as we thought.

Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that was hired for Trump’s 2016 election campaign, made headlines over the weekend for using data acquired from 50 million Facebook users to build “psychographic profiles” about voters without their knowledge.

Undercover footage — shot between November 2017 and January 2018 — released by Britain’s Channel 4 News on Tuesday shows Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, bragging about how the company came up with the “Defeat Crooked Hillary” campaign and promoted it on social media.

“The ‘OO’ of ‘Crooked’ were a pair of handcuffs and it was all about … she belongs behind bars,” Turnbull says in the video.

He then says the company made “hundreds of different kinds of creatives, and we put it online.”

According to Channel 4 News, videos promoting the phrase “Crooked Hillary” — which Cambridge Analytica said received millions of views through Google, Facebook and YouTube — were linked to an independent organization (a pro-Trump super PAC) called “Make America Number 1” so users couldn’t trace them directly to the Trump campaign.

“We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,” the firm’s CEO, Alexander Nix, says in an interview in the video. “And so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”

Nix is also shown saying that Cambridge Analytica’s data was key to Trump’s successful campaign.

“We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting,” he says. “We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy.”

During Stephen Colbert’s opening monologue on “The Late Show” Monday night, the host poked fun at the situation.

“Wait, wait! They made up ‘Crooked Hillary!’” Colbert exclaimed. “Coming up with demeaning nicknames was the one skill we knew Trump had. You can’t take that away from the man.”TONIGHT: Despite evidence pointing to a rigged election in Russia, President Trump called Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his victory. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/4sqx5Ri90m — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) March 21, 2018

Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have gutted privacy around the world. This weekend brought another stunning example. A bombshell report revealed that political research firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign, secretly exploited the personal data of 50 million Facebook users.

Zuckerberg has been silent about the scandal. That comes as no surprise. He founded Facebook on a betrayal and, from the start, has self-servingly preached openness, transparency and “connection” while growing his secretive company into a massive data-mining business that now functions as a social engineering and surveillance system without precedent. He zealously guarded his own privacy the whole time.

I know this firsthand. In 2007, Facebook came after me in Massachusetts federal court after I wrote an investigative story about the company’s founding for 02138, an independent magazine geared toward Harvard alumni. During my reporting, I unearthed documents about Zuckerberg and his company. One was Zuckerberg’s Harvard application. Another was an online diary he kept in which he called a woman a “bitch” and described hacking into Harvard’s online “facebooks” to grab student photos for “Facemash,” a website he created that let users rank students by attractiveness. (Some media outlets erroneously latched on to Facemash as the inspiration for Facebook, a misapprehension that Zuckerberg promoted because it gave him legal cover in his battle against three other Harvard students who accused him of stealing their idea for the social media platform and eventually reached a settlement agreement with Facebook.)

Zuckerberg didn’t like that we published these documents. His lawyers sought an injunction to censor us. A judge told Facebook to screw, in more elegant terms.

U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock said that when “core journalism,” as he described my reporting, gains access to information, legally or illegally “as a result of negligence or as a result of some improper disclosure,” there’s no basis “for a court to restrain it” without a very compelling reason.

We’ve republished the documents below because we believe that transparency and openness and, yes, privacy are more than mere buzzwords to be used in product rollouts and marketing material. Zuckerberg became a billionaire many times over by harvesting and ruthlessly exploiting our personal information.

There was a time, though, when he was just a callow 17-year-old at Phillips Exeter Academy, rhapsodizing about fencing:

Every Tuesday evening, the bell over the Academy Building rings out and invites students on campus to convene at the Love Gymnasium. Each Tuesday, I answer that invitation and go to fence with my peers. Amidst a hectic week of work, fencing has always proven to be the perfect medium; for it is both social and sport, mental and athletic, and controlled yet sometimes undisciplined. Whether I am competing against a rival in a USFA tournament or just clashing foils, or sometimes sabres, with a friend, I rarely find myself doing anything more enjoyable than fencing a good bout.

But despite the all-caps notation reading “DO NOT CONGRATULATE,” Trump did so anyway, according to a report Tuesday by The Washington Post.

According to a White House statement, “President Trump congratulated President Putin on his March 18 re-election, and emphasized the importance of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The two leaders confirmed the need for the United States and Russia to continue our shared efforts on strategic stability.”

“We had a very good call,” Trump told reporters at the White House after the exchange, noting that the pair “will probably be meeting in the not-too distant future to discuss the arms race, which is getting out of control.”

The Post noted that the same briefing document supplied to the president about the call also urged Trump to discuss allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and to condemn a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in England earlier this month.

The president did neither, and the Post said it was unclear if Trump had even read the material.

Rather, the White House said the leaders discussed “the state of bilateral relations and resolved to continue dialogue about mutual national security priorities and challenges.” The Kremlin has denied tampering with U.S. elections and any involvement in the poisoning.

The president defended his decision to congratulate Putin on Wednesday, tweeting: “Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.”

I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong!

“They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race,” he added in a second tweet. “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!”

The departure from his aides’ suggestions is relatively normal for Trump, who often goes off script and ignores the advice of his advisers and lawyers. He has often refrained from outright condemnation of Russia and has mostly refused to comment on claims that the country tried to influence the last presidential election.

Last week, however, the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on several Russian citizens and organizations over the country’s role in such meddling. Trump also said at the time it “looks like” Russia was behind the nerve gas attack, although he refrained from harsher punishments akin to Britain’s expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats.

Trump’s congratulatory call sparked immediate condemnation from some lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who said the president “insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election.”

Trump promised big changes after the February shooting in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed.

Trump “spoke very pointedly to a number of U.S. senators and said that they were scared of the NRA and maybe he would have to be the person [to strengthen] background checks,” Kelly said. “That was Tuesday. By Thursday, he’d completely lost interest. And about two months later, he was the speaker at the NRA convention in Dallas.”

Cooper referred to a statistic reported Friday by The Washington Post that more people have been killed in U.S. schools this year than people serving in the military.

Kelly responded: “It’s ridiculous that these kids have to live in a country, these kids in Santa Fe or in Parkland or 22 other places around the country just this year alone, that they have to assume that kind of risk when they go to school.”

He added: “To see our elected leaders do nothing over and over again, it’s just an incredibly sad situation.”Chrissy Metz says she was “a tough cookie” growing up, but that didn’t stop her stepfather from abusing her.

The “This Is Us” actress, in People magazine’s April cover story, talks about her hard teenage years and her upcoming memoir, This Is Me, which hits bookstores March 27. In an excerpt from the book, Metz tells how she was 8 when her biological father left her mother. Her stepfather, who she called Trigger, came into her life a few years later.

“I don’t remember why Trigger hit me the first time,” Metz writes of her childhood in Gainesville, Florida. “He never punched my face. Just my body, the thing that offended him so much. He shoved me, slapped me, punched my arm. He would hit me if he thought I looked at him wrong. I remember being on the kitchen floor after he knocked me over, and I was begging to know what I did. He just shoved me hard with his foot.”

Metz, now 37, said her stepfather loved his two biological children, but not her. She said he constantly body shamed her, and began weighing her when she was 14.

“He’d get the scale from the bathroom and clang it hard on the kitchen floor. ‘Well, get on the damn thing!’ Trigger would yell. ‘This is what you need to know,’” Metz said.

“My body seemed to offend him, but he couldn’t help but stare, especially when I was eating. He joked about putting a lock on the refrigerator. We had lived with a lack of food for so long that when it was there, I felt like I had to eat it before it disappeared,” she continued. “Food was my only happiness.”

WASHINGTON ― Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) used his first Senate floor speech on Wednesday to offer several proposals Congress should pass to help stem gun violence.

“I believe we’ve finally reached a tipping point on gun violence,” Jones said, after stressing that he enjoyed using firearms as an “avid hunter.”

“For too long, gridlock and partisanship have stood in the way of compromise. But I didn’t come here to do nothing. And I don’t think any of you did, either,” he said.

With a handful of Republicans and Democrats listening to him in the chamber, Jones laid out his vision for how best to tackle the controversial issue. The surprise winner of a December special election called for banning bump stocks, the devices used to simulate automatic fire; increasing the age at which one can purchase a semi-automatic weapon to 21; toughening the criminal background check system; allowing the government to study gun violence, and requiring a three-day waiting period for pistol and semiautomatic purchases.

He also proposed instituting universal background checks, with some exceptions.

“We have to require background checks on all gun sales, whether it is at a gun show or over the internet or between individuals,” Jones said. “It may be an inconvenience, but it will save lives.”

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who broke party ranks and gave money to help Jones defeat controversial Republican Roy Moore, tweeted praise for his new colleague.

Just listened to @SenDougJones deliver his maiden speech on the senate floor. He’s a good man and will be a good senator. I’m glad he’s here. — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) March 21, 2018

The push for stricter gun laws has largely stalled in Congress after seeming to gain momentum after the Feb. 14 deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Lawmakers this week are struggling to include even incremental measures ―such as a plan to boost the FBI’s beleaguered background-check system ― in a must-pass government funding bill.

President Donald Trump has done little to help in the process. He talked a good game in the wake of the school massacre, endorsing several Democratic-supported proposals like universal background checks and an increase in the minimum age for buying an assault weapon. But he has not endorsed any legislation that would do so, nor has he called on Republican leaders to bring those measures up for a vote.
