The Louisiana attorney general said Tuesday he won’t charge two white police officers in the fatal shooting of a black man that sparked heated protests across the country.

Attorney General Jeff Landry said at a news conference in Baton Rouge that Alton Sterling, 37, had a loaded gun, fought with officers and continued struggling even after he was shot with a Taser stun gun.

“Both officers acted in a reasonable and justified manner in the shooting death of Mr. Sterling,” the prosecutor said, explaining his decision not to bring charges in the 2016 killing outside a convenience store, where police had been summoned to investigate a report of a man with a gun. He said one of the officers fired six shots, hitting Sterling in the chest and back.

Landry’s office took over the probe 11 months ago, when the Justice Department, citing a lack of evidence, decided not to pursue federal civil rights charges against the officers.

Baton Rouge officials were bracing for potential protests, according to The Advocate. The attorney general told his office staff not to report to work on Tuesday, and state police activated a mobile force.

“We all out of tears,” Quinyetta McMillon, mother of Sterling’s oldest son, said at a news conference that followed the prosecutor’s announcement. “We have nothing else to cry about.”

Sterling’s aunt, Sandra Sterling, called the killing murder, and said Landry should be ashamed.

“You put a killer back on the streets,” she said of the attorney general. She added: “I’m going to get justice from a higher power.”

The family will continue to pursue a civil rights lawsuit against the city, said lawyer L. Chris Stewart. “This wasn’t justice,” he added.

Landry acknowledged Sterling’s family likely will disagree with his decision.

“I’m asking that everyone consider the family in the coming days,” he said. “I pray that God blesses and keeps the Sterling family during this difficult time.”

Sterling, a father of five, was fatally shot July 5, 2016, outside a Baton Rouge store where he frequently sold CDs. Officer Howie Lake II wrestled Sterling to the ground, and Officer Blane Salamoni shot him multiple times at close range in the back and chest.

It’s unclear from cellphone videos whether Sterling was a threat. Store owner Abdul Muflahi told HuffPost in July 2016 that he witnessed the shooting, but didn’t see Sterling with a gun. He said he did see officers remove a handgun from Sterling’s pocket. Landry said Tuesday the gun was loaded, and said the officers repeatedly tried to control Sterling without using deadly force.

Salamoni, a four-year veteran, and Lake, a three-year veteran, have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. With the federal and state investigations concluded, police Chief Murphy Paul can decide whether to discipline or fire the officers.

Paul said at an afternoon news conference that a disciplinary panel will hold a hearing this week, and will allow the two officers and their attorneys an opportunity to speak. The chief said he planned to release evidence gathered during the shooting investigation, including videos and police recordings, after the hearing concludes.

Cellphone videos of events surrounding the killing went viral on social media and sparked heated protests in Baton Rouge and elsewhere. The Baton Rouge protests led to nearly 200 arrests.

Demonstrators criticized Baton Rouge police for displays of military-style equipment and use of ear-splitting sirens. Officers also were accused of haphazardly pointing assault rifles at protesters and journalists.

Less than two weeks after Sterling was killed, Gavin Long, a former Marine from Missouri, opened fire in Baton Rouge, killing city police officers Montrell Jackson, 32, Matthew Gerald, 41, and East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, 45. Long wounded three other officers before he was fatally shot.

The protests eventually ceased, and national media attention began to drift away in August 2016, when torrential rain in southeastern Louisiana caused massive flooding that claimed more than a dozen lives.

The co-founder of the group Black Lives Matter, which has been calling attention to police violence since 2014, when police outside St. Louis shot an unarmed black teenager to death, said she was “saddened and sickened” that officers still aren’t held to account for fatal shootings.

“Black people continue to be betrayed by this country. A country that claims liberty and freedom for all. Yet continues to allow for the murders of black people with impunity,” Patrisse Khan-Cullors said in a statement.

The ACLU deplored the attorney general’s decision as “yet another example of police brutality against people of color and our country’s systemic failure to hold law enforcement accountable for that brutality.”

“Justice will not be served until we end this epidemic of police violence against people of color once and for all,” Jane Johnson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, said in a statement calling on the police chief to fire the two officers, release video evidence and respect the rights of demonstrators to peacefully protest.

In a GQ story published Monday, actress Tiffany Haddish spilled the tea about an unidentified actress allegedly biting Beyoncé in the face at a party in December. Teigen, naturally, became determined to discover the person’s identity.

“Beyonce’s at the bar, so I said to Beyonce, ‘Did she really bite you?’” Haddish told GQ. “She was like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.’”

Teigen declared on Twitter Monday morning that finding out the truth was of the utmost importance to her. She wasn’t alone: Fans got the hashtag #WhoBitBeyonce trending on social media.

“I cannot leave this planet without knowing who bit Beyonce in the face,” Teigen tweeted. “I can only think of one person who would do this. but I cannot say. but she....is the worst.”

I can only think of one person who would do this. but I cannot say. but she....is the worst. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 26, 2018

However, it seems Teigen ― who does pal around with Bey when she’s not bowing down to her ― was way off with her original guess.

Teigen said Monday afternoon that someone had tipped her off to the biter’s real identity, and it was not who she thought.

Update it is NOT the person I think is the worst. IM DONE — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 26, 2018

My initial guess was wrong. The real person? I *never* would have guessed. I’VE SAID TOO MUCH — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 26, 2018

But Teigen refused to give the goods to inquiring minds.

“I AM NEVER TELLING,” she tweeted. “I’m scared I’ve said too much KNOWLEDGE IS A CURSE!”

I AM NEVER TELLING I’m scared I’ve said too much KNOWLEDGE IS A CURSE! — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 26, 2018

Of course, by that point the Beyhive had already been activated. The “Lemonade” singer’s followers have been on a mission since Monday to determine who bit their queen.

Sanaa Lathan and Sara Foster, two actresses who were at the December party in question, have denied any wrongdoing.

Y’all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyonce and if I did it would’ve been a love bite 💋 — Sanaa Lathan (@justsanaa) March 26, 2018

A post shared by Sara Foster (@sarafoster) on Mar 26, 2018 at 11:47am PDTIron Man is shook and Captain America is in hiding, because Brie Larson is reporting for superhero duty.

Over the past nine months, the Oscar-winner has transformed herself into Carol Danvers for the highly anticipated “Captain Marvel” movie, the first solo superhero property in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to feature a female lead.

As production on the film began Monday in Los Angeles, Larson has been sharing some behind-the-scenes peeks at what it takes to go toe-to-toe with the Avengers.

Diet and training for Marvel movies are notoriously strict, but the actress certainly looks up to the task, showing off some serious pull-ups and push-ups with a metal chain around her waist.

A post shared by Brie (@brielarson) on Mar 26, 2018 at 4:55am PDT

“9 months of training really does some stuff to your body,” she captioned one video, adding in another that “Getting stronger is a process I’m committed to showing up for everyday.”

Larson also got some tips from pilots to help “get closer to the core” of her character. She shared a photo of herself and a brigadier general perched on a cockpit wearing full flight suits.

Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, “Captain Marvel” will follow fighter pilot Danvers “as she becomes one of the universe’s most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races,” according to the official synopsis.

Set in the 1990s, the film will also feature the return of Nick Fury sans eyepatch, played by Samuel L. Jackson, as well as actors Jude Law, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Algenis Perez Soto, Rune Temte, and McKenna Grace.The world’s most famous groundhog could also be a jailbird.

On Feb. 2, Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow and predicted six more weeks of winter.

However, when spring came to Pennsylvania last week, it was accompanied by a storm that brought several inches of snow to parts of the Northeast on Wednesday and Thursday.

That was the straw that broke the camel’s back for Cpl. Scott Martin of the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. Martin decided he was tired of a rodent pretending to be a meteorologist, so he created a wanted poster for Phil.

The crime that the Phil is accused of: deception.

Martin made the poster because he is sick of the snow, especially in spring.

“If [the public] sees him, give us a call, because we want to take him into custody,” Martin told local NBC affiliate WBRE-TV.

However, anyone who attempts to do that will have problems with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, which has jurisdiction over the groundhog’s hometown of Punxsutawney.

Jefferson County Sheriff Carl Gotwald said his department will do whatever it takes to protect Phil from getting arrested.

“That’s not what we’re hoping for; that’s what we’re going to do, is make sure Phil has no trouble from anybody or any bounty hunters,” he told Inside Edition.

Phil’s handler, A.J. Dereume, thinks the weather-predicting groundhog is the subject of misplaced anger.

“It’s probably is a misunderstanding on their part, because Phil is the messenger. He does not actually create the weather,” Dereume told Inside Edition.The “Roseanne” that existed two decades ago didn’t have to remind us that it was topical. From 1988 to 1997, the show built its foundation on the everyday plight of a working-class family struggling to stay afloat in small-town America. The verisimilitude was often searing, and always rollicking. Even in the titular matriarch’s loudest moments, no one preached about current events in such a way that politics superseded the actual situations greeting characters in this situational comedy.

But today’s rendition, returning to ABC on Tuesday, is jonesing to announce its topicality, figurative megaphone in hand, almost as quickly as the opening credits roll. Face-to-face with the Donald Trump era, the inaugural episode’s politics are thundering, confrontational and ham-fisted.

Roseanne Barr, Sara Gilbert and John Goodman on "Roseanne." ABC

Early on, a svelte Dan (John Goodman) returns from the pharmacy to report that the Conners’ health insurance no longer funds all the medicine they need ― their “candy,” as Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) calls it. Dan and Roseanne are left to divide what’s left of their statins, anti-inflammatories and pain pills as if playing a game to see who lands the bigger stash. After the next commercial break, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) arrives at the Conners’ comfortingly cluttered home wearing a pink “Nasty Woman” shirt and pussy hat, estranged from her sister because Roseanne pulled the lever in Trump’s favor.

“How could you have voted for him?” Jackie demands before we’ve even been reintroduced to the whole clan. Their argument turns to talk of “snowflakes” and “making America great again” ― the same polarization that plays out ad nauseam on social media and during cable-news cage fights.

The Conner clan on "Roseanne." ABC

That transition, from medical woes to tired retorts about an election we’ve spent a year and a half mourning, epitomizes the shift in woke sitcom writing that has occurred in the years since “Roseanne” first signed off. The original program was founded upon situational concepts that couched real-world issues in primetime banter, while the reboot opens with a showboating scheme that borrows low-hanging ideological fruit to paint a heavy-handed divide across party lines.

Despite her feminism, it makes some sense that Roseanne Conner would have voted for Trump. Discounting the messy final season that aired in 1996 and ‘97, in which the Conners won the lottery and imploded the series’ spirit, the eight years Roseanne spent assembly-lining at a plastics factory, sweeping a beauty-parlor floor, telemarketing, working a fast-food joint and eventually co-owning a small luncheonette, all the while fretting about bills and taxes and college funds, make her a fitting figurehead for toiling middle-class parents who felt ostracized by the proverbial establishment and lashed out in the 2016 election. Trump “talked about jobs,” she insists.

Alas, watching Roseanne and Jackie bark clichés at each other in 2018 is already stale, as if the writing team ― spearheaded by Bruce Helford (who also oversaw one previous season) and Whitney Cummings ― took too many notes from the virtue signaling that attracts retweets and viral headlines. “Roseanne” was already the most political sitcom in history; must it be so literal and loudmouthed about it now?

But, as a longtime disciple who thinks the Conners’ living room is among popular culture’s greatest hallmarks, I’m pleased to report that this bug is not a feature of the entire season ― at least it isn’t so glaring in the third and seventh episodes, which, oddly enough, were the only other installments ABC provided to press ahead of the premiere. In fact, once we get past the unrefined, rhythm-less debut, what I’ve seen of the show is downright wonderful. We can exhale. “Roseanne” is indeed back.

Roseanne Barr and Ames McNamara on "Roseanne." ABC

It must be hard, anyway, to revive characters left dormant for 20 years, especially for someone as erratic as Barr, who hasn’t maintained much of an acting career beyond guest spots on “The Office,” “Portlandia” and the short-lived “Cristela.” But by Episode 3, she’s restored her brassy groove. Everything about Roseanne’s repartee with Jackie, along with her hard-edged but ultimately loving parenting tactics, feel plucked right out of the “Roseanne” we once knew, with one golden difference: Where her own mother (Estelle Parsons) was once the out-of-touch try-hard, it’s now Roseanne who has to play catchup with the world her children (and grandchildren) occupy. As such, the banter between them is laugh-tracked and whip-smart, the punchlines are pithy and purposeful, and the politics aren’t reduced to ersatz sermonizing.

“Roseanne” does a splendid job recontextualizing its characters. A divorced and jobless Darlene (Sara Gilbert, who orchestrated this reunion) moves back in with Roseanne and Dan, bringing along her teenage daughter (Emma Kenney) and gender-probing 11-year-old (Ames McNamara), who identifies as a boy but prefers to wear skirts and nail polish. These are the sort of politics at which “Roseanne” excels: Through the lens of their underemployed daughter and nonconforming grandchild, Dan and “Granny Rose” are forced to examine their own prejudices. They want to protect their beloved from schoolyard bullying but encourage his self-acceptance, opening up a conversation about identity that need not to underscore its message with platitudes or homilies.

Lecy Goranson and Sarah Chalke on "Roseanne." ABC

The rest of Episodes 3 and 7 operate with the same delicate blend of comedy and domestic drama. Jackie spouts the canned advice she now doles out as a life coach ― Metcalf again nails Jackie’s mania with supercharged precision ― while a waitressing 43-year-old Becky (Lecy Goranson) sparks when a woman (Sarah Chalke, the other Becky) offers her $50,000 to serve as a surrogate mother. And tender D.J. (Michael Fishman) has just returned from military duty in Syria, caring for his young mixed-race daughter Mary (Jayden Rey) while his wife serves overseas. Meanwhile, Roseanne can’t afford surgery to fix a bad knee, so she’s hogging those analgesics her insurance will hardly pay for. When she and Dan attempt to cash in on rewards points for their anniversary by spending a night at a hotel, the credit card they’re required to log upon check-in is declined, thwarting their respite and shoving them back out into the jungle. (“I just want to go home, and if you saw where we live, you would know what an insult that is,” Roseanne quips.)

There’s even a peanut-allergy subplot thrown in, proving just how down and dirty this reboot is willing to get.

Through it all, the writing is faithful to the Conners we knew in the pre-internet age, letting the show be woke without proclaiming itself as such. Maybe that’s the hurdle in expunging a series’ plot points, as “Roseanne” did with Dan’s death and “Will & Grace” did with the title pair’s parenthood: There’s so much exposition to establish and history to redraft that preaching about the corrupt election we can’t stop stressing about simply adds another layer of bulk. Why are our characters debating Trump’s candidacy now? Well, because that’s when their TV show is airing ― a poor excuse that convinces some sitcom writers they have a duty to address the national mood head-on.

Roseanne and Jackie’s feud probably sounds familiar to many American families, sure, but let’s see them experience the world, not just argue about it like a half-baked Facebook debate. That dynamic may have worked for Archie Bunker on “All in the Family,” but, 40 years later, we need characters who will do more than regurgitate media buzzwords.TOP LGBT EXECUTIVE

There have been other signs of growing acceptance.

Hong Kong is set to become the host of the 2022 Gay Games, a sports and cultural event dubbed the “Gay Olympics,” after fighting off bids from cities in the United States and Mexico.

In a rare victory, a Hong Kong court last year ruled that a British lesbian whose partner worked in the city should receive a spousal visa.

The charity Big Love Alliance - of which Chao is a founding member - organises an annual Pink Dot gathering to campaign for LGBT rights and it has attracted sponsorship from embassies and investment banks.

Chao also works with the United Nations on LGBT rights and became the first Asian to be named as the top LGBT executive on an annual OUTstanding list compiled by the Financial Times which ranks LGBT role models in business.

A qualified helicopter pilot, Chao said the marriage bounty episode did not tarnish her ties with her father - who like her also shares a passion of flying.

“You build a much stronger bond in these relationships after you have been able to live your full self, be a full person and live as an honest person in front of your mum and dad,” she said.

“It is an important process to go through although in the short term it does jolt them into a bit of shock.”

But in a signal that there is still a long way to go for same-sex marriage in Hong Kong, Chao said she and her partner have had to temporarily put aside the idea of having children.

“Even for people like me - who many perceive as having all the resources in the world to do whatever I want in some ways - it is very difficult,” she said.

“It is not easy because you can’t do it in Hong Kong or anywhere else in Asia.”Don’t know whether to apply cologne to your privates before a romantic night out?

Aaron Carter appeared to backpedal on remarks he made about his sexuality last summer, saying reports he’d come out as bisexual were “misconstrued.”

In a Hollywood Life podcast interview last week, the pop singer was asked about an emotional note he posted to Twitter last August. In the tweet, which has since been deleted, he said he’d “started to find boys and girls attractive” as a teen, and had “an experience with a male” whom he “worked with and grew up with.”

Carter, however, set the record straight March 23, and told Hollywood Life’s Bonnie Fuller he doesn’t see himself in a relationship with another man anytime soon.

“It was more so just a story that happened when I was, like, 17 with somebody,” he said on the podcast. (Carter’s comments on sexuality start at about 19 and a half minutes into the interview.) “I can find men and women attractive, but when it comes down to it, I think it was a little misconstrued. I see myself being with a woman and having kids.”

“I want to have a family,” he added. “I keep telling people that. I don’t want it to be misconstrued too much.”

It’s a head-scratching clarification from Carter, who is currently on tour in support of his new album, “LØVË.” The singer has spoken about his sexuality in numerous interviews since the original tweet, but made no effort to shrug off the “bisexual” label.

Just days after his original tweet, he told morning radio show “The Bert Show,” “All I can say is that I’m really looking forward to the future right now, and whether I choose to be with a woman or a man is my decision ― no one else’s. It was something that I just felt like was important and I needed to say.”

At the time, he hinted that his relationship with girlfriend Madison Parker ended because of his admission. Carter told TMZ, “If someone loves you enough, they’ll never leave you. They’ll never leave you over you saying that ‘I want to be honest’ about whether it’s about me being bisexual, bicurious, being gay, or anything.” (Parker denied Carter’s claims.)Lindsey Port, 35, doesn’t really know Al Franken. She met the Minnesota Democrat in passing at political events, but that’s about it. And she never even called on him to resign from the Senate after a number of other women accused him of sexual harassment.

But for some reason, she’s being blamed for his downfall.

Port has spoken out about sexual harassment. In November, as a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota state House, she and state Rep. Erin Maye Quade (D) accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of harassing them. Schoen eventually stepped down, and Port became one of the most visible faces of the Me Too movement in Minnesota.

She initially received a flood of goodwill for speaking out. But the reaction changed when the Franken allegations surfaced.

Port’s willingness to call attention to sexual harassment went from being applauded to being questioned. Members of her own party said she had “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation in early January, and some people even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative who had planned to take down the popular senator all along.

On social media, Port saw comments that questioned her identity, motives and truthfulness.

Social media commenters, such as this person on Facebook, seemed suspicious that U.S. Sen. Al Franken resigned shortly after state Sen. Dan Schoen, a fellow Minnesota Democrat, was also accused of harassment. Facebook

This Facebook commenter above was right that it wasn’t just a “coincidence” that the Schoen and Franken scandals happened so close together ― but it’s not because there was a large GOP conspiracy to bring them down. The country was in the middle of the Me Too moment, when powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer were facing a reckoning for their years of abuse, and more women were feeling emboldened to speak up.

That the backlash came from within her own community is particularly disheartening for Port.

“I honestly think the most frustrating part of it has been not only Democrats ― this is our team, these are the people who are supposed to be with us ― but it has been primarily women. There’s definitely a generational divide, 100 percent. But it has primarily been women pushing this,” she said of the criticism she’s faced.

Speaking out has cost Port financially. About a week after Franken’s resignation, she dropped her state legislative bid because donors began pulling their contributions, and she felt she couldn’t focus on the district and its priorities.

Port also co-operates a nonprofit, Blueprint Campaigns, that helps progressive individuals from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds run for office. The nonprofit also lost donations.

“We had $70,000 pulled the week that Al Franken said he was going to resign,” Port said. “In that same window, I also lost $6,000 from my own campaign.”

One person asked that her contribution to the campaign be returned. The rest of the unhappy donors, to both the campaign and the nonprofit, pulled their pledges. One donor told Port that she was “too controversial” to support at that time, as MinnPost reported. Port had never had any contributions taken back before.

Meredith Stacey, Port’s partner at Blueprint, said she also noticed that after the allegations against Franken broke, people weren’t reaching out or returning their phone calls quite as frequently.

“No matter who it is, it’s always about the fall of men and never about the women who were just trying to work and do their job and have to endure this over and over and over.” - Minnesota state Rep. Erin Maye Quade

“Democratic donor doors are very shut to me right now,” Port said. As evidence, she noted that Ken Martin, the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state’s version of the Democratic Party), unfriended her on Facebook ― an accusation that he denies.

“God’s honest truth, I’ve never unfriended anyone,” Martin said. “So to be honest with you, I don’t even know how to do it.”

“I guess what I am concerned by is any kind of insinuation that me personally or the state party hasn’t stood by Lindsey. We’ve been very supportive of her in these efforts. We believe her,” he added. “We think that at the end of the day, if there’s any retaliation going on ― as I mentioned to her the other day ― I want to know about it. Because I will call those donors myself.”

Port said she hasn’t been able to get Martin on the phone to tell him about the problems she’s had and the donations that were pulled. She also said she’s asked him to raise money to replace the sums that Blueprint Campaigns lost, and he hasn’t followed up.

Martin said that he hadn’t heard from Port about any request to help her raise money and that he has tried to be as helpful as possible in supporting her.

Feelings about the Franken scandal are still raw in Minnesota. The issue remains so divisive that a number of state Democrats were only willing to give their opinion about the situation off the record.

The former senator’s Facebook page is filled with people saying how much they miss him:

“I am still incredibly bitter that you were forced to resign. You were/are one of the good guys.”

“I hope you don’t retire from politics, Al Franken. There was no due process when you left. I thought it was premature.”

State Rep. Erin Maye Quade has also heard the insinuations that she and Port were part of some grand conspiracy to oust Franken or that they’d put party members in a difficult position because after denouncing Schoen, Democrats then were forced to weigh in on Franken.

“I’m the one who gets harassed, and all of a sudden I face all the consequences,” Maye Quade said. “No matter who it is, it’s always about the fall of men and never about the women who were just trying to work and do their job and have to endure this over and over and over.”

“I was more surprised about how much my story was never really about me after that,” the lawmaker added. “It was always about the men and their downfall.”

Port and Maye Quade aren’t the only women who have faced the ire of Franken supporters. At least one major Democratic donor has said she’ll reconsider her support for senators who called for Franken to quit ― including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was one of his toughest critics. (Recall that Port never actually urged Franken to resign.)

MinnPost first reported on Port’s decision to drop her state legislative bid because of the backlash she received after the Franken scandal. The story received surprisingly little pickup, especially compared to the attention her initial allegations against Schoen garnered.

But one person who did notice was Laura Flynn, a member of the advisory board for the Movement Voter Project, which raises funds for nonpartisan and progressive groups around the country that are mobilizing and doing voter engagement work. In February, Flynn mobilized other MVP donors and so far, they’ve raised $26,000 for Blueprint.

“Yes, this is a story about an individual woman facing backlash because of what she did, because of speaking out. ... But secondly, it’s a real question for the Democratic Party,” Flynn said. “If you’re going to turn on the most forward-thinking young people who can actually go out there and run grassroots campaigns and win elections ― it’s very clear here in Minnesota, we’re not going to be able to win the statehouse if we’re going to silence or quash those voices.”

Another person who has supported Port has been state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who made history in 2016 when she became the first Somali-American legislator in the country.

WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the world’s largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.

Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.

“We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,” Mnuchin said in a television interview on “Fox News Sunday.”

On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China.

During an initial round of talks earlier this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries’ joint statement on Saturday.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross planned to go to China, Mnuchin and Kudlow said.

“He’s going to be looking into a number of areas where we’re going to have greatly significant increases,” including energy, liquefied natural gas, agriculture and manufacturing, Kudlow said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.”

Mnuchin said the United States expects to see a big increase of between 35 percent and 40 percent in agricultural exports to China and a doubling of energy purchases over the next three to five years.Nickelodeon has officially cut ties with famed producer Dan Schneider, creator of major hits including “iCarly,” “All That,” “The Amanda Show” and “Drake & Josh,” following allegations of abusive behavior.

The network and Schneider, who’ve worked together since the late ’80s, mutually agreed not to extend a production deal with his company, Schneider’s Bakery.

“Following many conversations together about next directions and future opportunities, Nickelodeon and our long-time creative partner Dan Schneider/Schneider’s Bakery have agreed to not extend the current deal,” Nickelodeon and Schneider said in a joint statement to HuffPost. “Since several Schneider’s Bakery projects are wrapping up, both sides agreed that this is a natural time for Nickelodeon and Schneider’s Bakery to pursue other opportunities and projects.”

Neither Nickelodeon nor Schneider gave a reason for the split. Deadline reports the decision was years in the making due to “multiple complaints of abusive behavior” by members of Schneider’s staff, and “well documented temper issues.”

The report says Schneider worked “under a cloud of suspicion” because of relationships with young stars on his shows, and notes he shared photos of actresses’ toes on social media.

Over the past 20 years, Schneider has been behind some of the network’s most successful shows, launching the careers of breakout stars like Arianna Grande, Jamie Lynn Spears, Amanda Bynes and Victoria Justice.

“Dan and his Schneider’s Bakery team have created a string of lasting, groundbreaking hits over the years including ‘iCarly,’ ‘Drake & Josh,’ ’Victorious, ‘Kenan & Kel’ and the current number-one hit show on Nickelodeon, ‘Henry Danger,’ the Nickelodeon-Schneider statement continued. “We thank Dan and his Schneider’s Bakery producers, executives and social media team for their immeasurable contributions to Nickelodeon, and we wish them the best in their future endeavors. And Dan and Schneider’s Bakery are proud of the work they did together with Nickelodeon and will always remain big fans of the network.”

Schneider’s series “Game Shakers” also reportedly has been canceled. “Henry Danger,” his only remaining franchise on Nickelodeon, is expected to continue for a fifth season.

Schneider is the latest showrunner to part ways with Nickelodeon following abuse accusations. Chris Savino, creator of the hit animated series “The Loud House,” was fired after multiple sexual harassment allegations.President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his Justice Department would proceed with plans to ban bump stocks, the firearms accessories the Las Vegas gunman used during his October attack on a country music festival that left 58 dead and hundreds more injured.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed Trump’s announcement on Friday with a statement saying he’d filed a proposed rules change that would “effectively” make the devices illegal under federal law.

The moves mark Trump’s latest step toward unilaterally outlawing bump stocks and other similar accessories, which he’s repeatedly vowed to do in the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month.

The president’s announcement came a day before the highly anticipated March for Our Lives, a well-attended series of rallies against gun violence on Saturday that was organized by student survivors of the Parkland shooting.

Although Trump didn’t personally address the movement from his golf resort in Mar-a-Lago, where he spent the weekend, his decision to roll out new action on bump stocks may have been an effort to send a message that he is doing something on guns ― and in particular, a modest measure that receives broad bipartisan support.

To get a better sense of the long and potentially difficult road ahead, let’s take a closer look at what’s going on with this effort.

First, it’s important to understand that bump stocks are not firearms. A bump stock is a component, typically made of plastic, that replaces a rifle’s standard stock and harnesses the gun’s recoil to slide the firearm back and forth onto the shooter’s trigger finger, allowing it to fire like an automatic weapon. (In the image below, the bump stock is the piece resting against the shooter’s shoulder.)

Federal law strictly regulates private ownership of automatic firearms, which the 1934 National Firearms Act defines as “machineguns.” But in most states, anyone who can buy a gun can get a semi-automatic rifle and a bump stock.

Although firearms equipped with bump stocks may fire like so-called “machineguns,” federal law specifically defines that term as any weapon that can “shoot automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.”

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has previously determined that it does not have the authority to regulate bump stocks because they don’t fit this definition. Not only are bump stocks not firearms, but because the accessories still require users to pull the trigger each time they fire a cartridge, the agency has ruled that automatic firing is not technically activated by “single function of the trigger.”

The Trump administration now wants the ATF to change its determination. In his statement Friday, Sessions laid out a proposal to amend the regulations and clarify that bump stocks fall within the definition of “machinegun” under federal law, claiming that they do allow semi-automatic firearms to initiate a “continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.”

Because bump stocks ”[allow] the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter,” according to the document, “a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger.”

It’s not yet clear if this attempt to change the reading of federal law will pass muster. Critics from across the political spectrum believe the administration’s move is likely to face a legal challenge and may ultimately be struck down.

Others have argued that Congress should act instead, and change the federal statute on machine guns to specifically cover bump stocks and similar devices. Although congressional lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation to prohibit such accessories, the National Rifle Association and a number of Republicans have said they’d prefer that the ATF handle the matter by simply changing its ruling.

GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have opted not to take up the bump stock issue, allowing them to duck accusations that they’re considering a gun ban.

It remains to be seen how this will all play out, but if Trump is ultimately successful in his effort to ban bump stocks, it will take a while. Although Sessions filed his Notice of Proposed Rulemaking last week, it hadn’t been published in the Federal Register as of Monday. Justice Department officials expect that to happen sometime this week, initiating a 90-day comment period for members of the public.

At the end of that three-month window, the Justice Department must decide whether or not to proceed with a Final Rule. If it does, it must post that document in the Federal Register as well, in which it would lay out an effective date to be “no less than thirty days ” after publication.While your intention may be to only pack the essentials, we know the struggle that is eventually just shoving everything into a suitcase for a simple weekend getaway.

Three of the firm’s former employees, including whistleblower Christopher Wylie, said the company was mostly staffed with non-U.S. citizens as it worked across several states to help elect Republicans. The campaign ― dubbed “Project Ripon” ― continued even after an attorney warned the firm to obey U.S. election laws, which mandate foreigners cannot “directly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process” in a political campaign.

Despite the warning, at least 20 non-Americans were sent to advise congressional and legislative campaigns in 2014, and helped to decide who to target with political messages, the Post reported. Such voters were dubbed “hidden Republicans.”

Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and worked at the firm until 2014, sparked a firestorm earlier this month when he revealed that the company had misused the private information of more than 50 million Facebook users. He told the Post that the use of foreigners on the ground often led to legal discussions about U.S. election laws between Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix and then-vice president Steve Bannon.

“Its dirty little secret was that there was no one American involved in it, that it was a de facto foreign agent, working on an American election,” Wylie told the Post.

Earlier this week he told NBC News that “it was not just me.”

“Like 20 other people were. We had Canadians, British, Eastern Europeans, Lithuanians, Germans, Romanians, Greeks,” Wylie said. “We weren’t just working on messaging. We were instructing campaigns on which messages go where and to who.”

The use of foreign nationals in U.S. elections was first detailed in a memo Wylie supplied to media outlets earlier this month. In the document, a lawyer for the data firm warned Nix that he would need to refrain from “substantive management” due to his citizenship and that Cambridge Analytica would need to find U.S. citizens or green card holders to make any larger decisions.

Two other employees at the firm, speaking anonymously, told the Post that they worried about violating U.S. law and echoed that such concerns were regularly discussed in 2014.

“We knew that everything was not above board, but we weren’t too concerned about it,” one of the employees said. “It was the Wild West. That’s certainly how they carried on in 2014.”

By Michael Ollove

Toby Davidow was always tight with her mother, Elaine, a part-time nursery school teacher who was “a very kind, nurturing mother and was very optimistic,” according to her daughter. Elaine and Dennis, Toby’s father, were single-minded in their devotion to their only child.

All of which makes the story of their relationship during the last years of Elaine Davidow’s life so surprising.

Toby Davidow, a program coordinator in the student affairs office at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., lays the blame on her parents’ live-in caregiver, 58-year-old Ann Fry. With Toby’s father’s cooperation, Fry barred Toby and the rest of her family, including Elaine’s only surviving sister, from seeing or speaking to her for the last three years of her life, from late 2014 until her death in October, at age 72.

Toby Davidow said she didn’t even know that for the last three months of her life, her mother, who had multiple sclerosis and dementia, was in hospice care, first in her Cherry Hill, New Jersey, home and then in a nearby facility.

Nobody bothered to tell her or other relatives that her mother had died until a week later. By then, Elaine Davidow had been cremated, against the wishes she had expressed before her cognition began failing, according to her daughter.

The events over the past years have devastated Davidow.

“Especially in the later years, Mom and Dad would travel down to my home in Virginia every 6 to 8 weeks from New Jersey, so that Mom and I could go to the spa together,” she recalled in an email. “We’d both get manicures and pedicures done together, giggle over magazines, and share stories. Mom really loved those visits, so much so that I even got a two-bedroom apartment so that my parents had a place to stay when they visited.”

Experiences like Davidow’s have prompted at least 11 states to enact laws that would provide a legal remedy, besides seeking guardianship, which can be costly and complicated, for relatives who have been prevented from seeing infirm or disabled family members.

Under the laws, relatives can seek a court order permitting visitation and communication. The order must be granted, unless the ailing relative is found to be mentally competent and objects to contact.

Celebrity Children Testify

The Maryland House this month passed a visitation bill unanimously, sending it to the Senate. The vote came a few weeks after the children of a trio of celebrities appeared before a House committee to recount experiences similar to Davidow’s.

They were led by a daughter of the late disc jockey Casey Kasem. Through public appearances and her foundation, Kasem Cares, Kerri Kasem has spearheaded largely successful efforts to enact visitation laws throughout the country. Her father, creator and host of radio’s “American Top 40,” a countdown of popular hits, died in 2014 at 82, kicking off a round of wrongful death claims and counterclaims between his widow and his children. Before his death, there had been highly publicized legal squabbles about his guardianship.

Joining Kasem in Annapolis were Travis Campbell, son of the country music legend Glen Campbell, who died at age 81 last summer of complications from Alzheimer’s disease, and Kelly Rooney, the eldest of Mickey Rooney’s eight children. Rooney, the movie star whose career spanned nine decades, died at age 93 in 2014.

Davidow joined them to testify about efforts by stepparents or caregivers to keep them from seeing or communicating with ailing parents or siblings with disabilities.

“He was in a guardianship for the last 18 months, and we never saw him again,” Kelly Rooney said in an interview. At age 90, Mickey Rooney appeared before a U.S. Senate committee and claimed he had been a victim of physical, emotional and financial abuse at the hands of his eighth and last wife and her adult children. His conservator, another term for “guardian,” continued to keep her father from his biological children until his death, Kelly Rooney said.

Travis Campbell also was denied visits with his father. He only found out through media reports that his father, who lived in California, had been transferred to an Alzheimer’s facility in Tennessee. Once he found out, he said, his stepmother still severely curtailed his ability to spend time with his father, whose most famous songs included “By the Time I Get to Phoenix” and “Wichita Lineman.”

“If there had been a law in effect,” Campbell said, “I would have had the most precious gift of all — time with my father.”

In Maryland, the visitation bill has not attracted a great deal of opposition. But Ria Rochvarg, a Maryland attorney who practices guardianship law, testified against it.

“I’m not against the idea, but it doesn’t do what supporters say it does,” she said in an interview. The legislation, Rochvarg said, would require another, possibly expensive judicial process involving lawyers.

“I want people to get visitation without a lengthy process and without lawyers,” she said. “This bill doesn’t do that.”

Isolation

Catherine Seal, the immediate past president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, said the underlying concern in such cases is that somebody is exerting “undue influence on the senior.”

“One of the classic hallmarks of undue influence is to isolate the person in question by limiting both in-person and phone contact,” said Seal, who practices in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “They convince the person that all these outside people, even family members, are a threat.”

Seal is sympathetic to the intentions behind the new visitation laws, but she prefers her organization’s model guardianship legislation, which would prevent guardians from restricting access to family members the ward wishes to see or communicate with. Critics point out, however, that Seal’s approach doesn’t address the many situations where there is no appointed guardian, or cases in which the caregiver is manipulating the ward into thinking poorly of family members. No state has yet enacted NAELA’s model legislation.

The Maryland bill, like laws that have passed elsewhere, contains provisions beyond visitation. It also would require guardians or caregivers to quickly notify family members when their wards have been hospitalized or when they have died.

Not all of those hoping for passage of the Maryland bill have elderly parents in mind.

Kim Ruszala of New Market, who also testified at the Capitol in Annapolis, has been fighting with her stepmother to gain unfettered access to her 44-year-old brother, Chris Asher, the youngest of her three siblings, who is developmentally delayed. From December 2015 to February 2017, a period after the death of their father, Ruszala said, she wasn’t allowed to see Asher except for a single brief visit at a McDonald’s. The guardianship agreement now permits Ruszala to visit with Asher twice a month.

“I just wanted to see my brother on a regular basis,” Ruszala said in her testimony.

On a recent Friday afternoon, Chris’ stepmother, Constance Asher, brought him to see Ruszala at a Cheesecake Factory in Columbia, Maryland, so the siblings could spend the weekend together. Chris joked happily with Ruszala and her boyfriend, Glenn Weigle, reminiscing about their times together, going camping, thrilling to amusement park rides, and that day he had his face painted for a Baltimore Ravens game.

“The biggest frustration for me,” Ruszala said, is “there’s no avenue to get into the court system to ask for visitation for someone who has a guardian.”

In November, Constance Asher alleged in a court filing that Ruszala’s visits with Asher were “damaging Christopher’s social and emotional well-being.” Asher told the court that Ruszala gave her brother alcohol and cigarettes.

Ruszala told Stateline she allowed Chris to have an occasional beer, as did his father, and that her brother had once stolen a pack of cigarettes from her and smoked one. At the Cheesecake Factory, Chris backed up his sister’s story.

Asher did not respond to several phone and email requests for comment.

If a visitation law had been in place in New Jersey, Davidow might have been able to spend time with her mother. Until the caregiver appeared around 2010, Davidow said, she was also close to her father, a school administrator in New Jersey for 30 years. “We were friends my entire life,” she said.

But he became a man she didn’t recognize, hostile to a daughter he had once showered with affection. He wouldn’t let Davidow in the house and hung up on her when she called. Toby hasn’t seen her father in four years and has spoken to him for about 15 minutes in that time, she said.

She also said that her father and Fry refused to open the door when she came several times to her parents’ home. And she was unable to get her mother on the phone.

In 2013, Fry’s name was added to the deed of a property Dennis and Elaine Davidow owned in Atlantic City. Her father also gave Fry his power of attorney and made her his health proxy.

Davidow said Fry sold her mother’s jewelry, purses and other possessions on eBay.

She said the reason Fry gave for shutting off contact was that she was “mentally unstable and a big stressor to my mom and dad.” Davidow said she has never been diagnosed with a mental illness.

Fry is now Davidow’s stepmother, having married her 75-year-old father in New Jersey in January. Fry did not respond to several email requests for comment, and Dennis Davidow did not respond to several phone messages.

Toby says her father’s behavior is so at odds with their previously warm relationship that she believes he is mentally unfit. But earlier this month, when Davidow attempted to gain guardianship over him, a doctor determined that he was capable of making his own decisions. Davidow fears she has reached a dead end.

“It has been so crushing to come to the realization that I may never see my father again,” she said.Dozens of Wisconsin high school students are spending their spring breaks this week walking more than 50 miles to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) hometown of Janesville to deliver a message: Pass meaningful gun reform legislation now.

A group of students from Shorewood High School, roughly four miles north of Milwaukee, organized the march to call out Ryan for blocking gun legislation reform and to demand lawmakers take immediate action to curb gun violence.

“We started 50 Miles More to keep the national demand for gun reform going after the March 24th March for Our Lives events are over,” according to the movement’s website. “Our generation has grown up watching school shootings destroy lives and then get swept out of the spotlight. We refuse to let this happen again.”

“It wasn’t my original plan, but I’m much happier doing this and effecting some change with my fellow students than just being on a beach somewhere.” - Brendan Fardella, 17

It’s no coincidence that the four-day, 54-mile trek from Madison began Sunday ― exactly 53 years after Martin Luther King Jr. led thousands of civil rights activists into Montgomery, Alabama, to conclude a five-day, 54-mile march that began in Selma.

“We looked to history and an earlier generation of young leaders who fueled real change,” the 50 Miles More website says. “In 1965, civil rights leaders organized the multi-day, 54-mile Selma to Montgomery marches. Those 54 long miles took us a long way toward progress, and are the inspiration for our march.”

Day two and we're off! #50More pic.twitter.com/XBEdUOka9E — March For Our Lives: 50 Miles More (@50milesmore) March 26, 2018

March participation swelled to at least 40 young people by Monday, with students across Wisconsin joining the journey. At the end of every mile walked, the 50 More Miles participants honor a victim of gun violence. The march is expected to end Wednesday with a rally in Janesville.

“We’re definitely a little sore in the feet and in some of the joints, but our spirits are high,” Brendan Fardella, a 17-year-old student at Shorewood High School, told HuffPost by phone Monday as he marched through the “middle of nowhere.”

“This is definitely what I’d like to be doing on my spring break,” he said. “It wasn’t my original plan, but I’m much happier doing this and effecting some change with my fellow students than just being on a beach somewhere.”

The marchers have been subjected to a few negative statements from passing drivers and bikers but overall have felt supported, said Alemitu Caldart, who also attends Shorewood High School.

“We just respond by saying, ‘Spread love, not hate,’” Alemitu, 15, told HuffPost.

“[We hope] to show people that we’re not done until actual change is made,” added Alemitu, who plans to participate in a spoken-word performance about gun violence at the rally in Janesville. “We’re still here. We’re stubborn. We’re going to keep on fighting for our lives to be safe every single day.”

Asked by HuffPost for comment on the march, a spokeswoman for Ryan said he “respects those expressing their views.”

“The House recently enacted new laws to keep children safe without infringing on constitutional rights,” she added.

But the legislation she likely referred to, which includes expanding federal background checks for gun purchases, is only a tiny step forward when it comes to the reform proposals pushed by many firearm safety advocates.

The 50 Miles More movement laid out a heftier list of demands on their website:

Military-style weapons, and all weapons of war, should be banned from civilian society.

All accessories that turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons, such as bump stocks, should be banned.

Four-day waiting period on all gun purchases.

Require background checks on all gun sales.

Raise the legal purchasing age of all guns to 21

“I stand here today to say to all of you that now is the time to do the impossible,” Katie Eder, an 18-year-old organizer of the march, said Saturday in a speech at Milwaukee’s March for Our Lives. “If the politicians won’t listen to us, if the politicians won’t make the change, then come November, we are prepared to change the politicians.”HuffPost
