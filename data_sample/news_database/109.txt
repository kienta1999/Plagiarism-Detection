The New York State Legislature passed a bill last week that would prohibit convicted domestic abusers from buying and owning all guns.

“New York is once again leading the way to prevent gun violence, and with this common sense reform, break the inextricable link between gun violence and domestic violence,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said in a press release on Saturday. “This legislation builds on our gun laws ― already the strongest in the nation ― to make New York safer and stronger.”

Cuomo had advocated for the measure as part of his 2018 Women’s Agenda. It passed both houses of the legislature by wide margins: 85-32 in the State Assembly and 41-19 in the State Senate.

The legislation requires convicted domestic abusers to surrender all firearms, closing a loophole in previous legislation that required abusers to surrender only handguns. In addition, New York law previously stated that domestic abusers convicted of a felony or a “serious” offense were prohibited from owning guns. The new measure adds some assault and battery charges to the list of applicable “serious” offenses.

Laws like this address a very real problem across the country. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide by 500 percent, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Every 16 hours, a woman in the U.S. is fatally shot by a current or former intimate partner, according to FBI and state crime data. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a 2017 report that firearms were used in 54 percent of all female homicides.

“The recent wave of mass shootings is horrifying, and the federal government’s failure to act on any form of meaningful gun safety laws is unconscionable,” Cuomo said in the press release.

In addition to reducing individual female homicides, the New York legislation could also prevent future mass shootings. The majority of mass shootings, defined as four or more people being fatally shot, involve domestic violence. According to a 2017 report from NPR, 54 percent of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016 were carried out by someone who had previously committed violence against an intimate partner.Political cartoonist Mike Luckovich of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution used the Easter holiday to call out evangelical supporters of President Donald Trump .

“Evangelicals still believe in the commandment: Thou shalt not have sex with a porn star,” Trump-supporting pastor Robert Jeffress said on Fox News last month. “However, whether this president violated that commandment or not is totally irrelevant to our support of him.”Yes the shop specializes in coverups that aren’t 32 million dollars https://t.co/2hklA6Ix4PIt’s being slammed on Twitter as a “hostage” video.

Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which owns more than 170 U.S. TV stations, has ordered local news anchors across the country to read a script decrying “some media outlets” for “false news” and “fake stories.”

“This is extremely dangerous to a democracy,” the script reads.

Deadspin created a supercut of anchors reading the script and ThinkProgress shared a similar clip that showed newscasters reciting the identical lines:

“I felt like a POW recording a message,” one anchor at a Sinclair-owned station told CNN last month.

“They’re certainly not happy about it,” an unnamed employee at Sinclair-owned KOMO in Seattle told The Seattle Post-Intelligencer last week. “It’s certainly a forced thing.”

Sinclair is also requiring its stations to run segments from Boris Epshteyn, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, who often speaks in support of the White House, the newspaper reported.

Sinclair has been accused of being too close to Trump in other ways as well.

In 2016, Jared Kushner, president’s son-in-law and adviser, said the campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair to give the network more access in exchange for running interviews with Trump without commentary, Politico reported.

Sinclair denied anything improper occurred.

“It was a standard package, but an extended package, extended story where you’d hear more directly from candidate on the issue instead of hearing all the spin and all the rhetoric,” Sinclair spokesman Scott Livingston told Politico at the time.

Sinclair is currently in the process of purchasing Tribune media, a deal that would give it access to 42 more stations. Once complete, Sinclair will reach 72 percent of U.S. households.

Last year, “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver warned of the implications of the purchase, and spoke out against Sinclair’s tendency to push “must-run” content on its stations.

On Twitter, critics slammed the company over the script local anchors were forced to record:

I worked for Sinclair during most of my time in El Paso. They were awful & I would never work for them again. What they’re doing now is ridiculous propaganda and it’s an embarrassment to the profession. I feel for my former colleagues being forced to read this garbage. https://t.co/hnqIU2EfW7 — Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) March 31, 2018

Back when I anchored, the worst thing I’d have to read was usually just a poorly written package intro I hadn’t had time to put in my own words. But this Sinclair crap is so, so, so much worse. Almost like a hostage video. Scary and disgraceful. — David Gillin (@DavidDGillin) April 1, 2018

A 17-year-old senior in Houston has the enviable challenge of deciding which college to attend this fall. He was accepted by 20 top schools ― all that he applied to, and all on full-ride scholarships.

Micheal Brown’s list includes Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern, Georgetown and the University of Michigan.

He hasn’t picked a school yet, but he’ll bring at least $260,000 in scholarships from various sources outside the college application process, according to The New York Times.

Micheal’s credentials include a 4.68 grade-point average, an ACT score of 34 out of 36, an SAT score of 1540 out of 1600, and outside activities like his school debate team, Key Club and various internships.

Although Micheal learned of his application sweep back in December, the news went viral recently after he posted a video on YouTube showing his reaction to the news that 20 top universities wanted him to be part of their student body.

Micheal said his academic achievement was inspired by his mother, Berthinia Rutledge-Brown.

“When I was in elementary school, I saw my mom graduate from community college and that just meant a lot to me,” he told Houston station KHOU-TV.

Micheal has until May 1 to decide which school he’ll attend. His mom told The New York Times she’s hoping he picks Stanford, because it’s been his top choice since he was young. Harvard, however, might be the best fit, she said.

Micheal said he plans to major in political science and eventually become a lawyer. He also wants to do his best to help other students of color.

“For me, it’s important to highlight that I’m not the only student of color who is achieving,” he told CNN, adding that he has been helped by organizations like QuestBridge, Emerge Fellowship and Breakthrough Collaborative, which provide students from low-income communities information about higher education options.New York City's Flushing neighborhood in Queens, which has a significant Asian-American population. sx70 via Getty Images

The Trump administration’s decision to add a question about citizenship to the census does not bode well for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, civil rights groups fear.

Research has already shown that the minority group is significantly undercounted in the survey, with one-fifth of Asian-Americans and one-third of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders living in hard-to-count census areas. This is partly due to the fact that some Asian-American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, subgroups have relatively high rates of poverty, unemployment and educational attainment, among other factors.

Experts say the question about citizenship will significantly reduce participation in the census, and Asian-American civil rights organizations are worried about how the question could affect the growing minority group.

“Given the high number of Asian immigrants, any question regarding citizenship is likely to scare the Asian community. We are very concerned that the addition of citizenship question will disproportionately cause an undercount in the Asian community,” John C. Yang, president and executive director of the civil rights group Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, told HuffPost by email.

“The community already is fearful of the anti-immigrant rhetoric and immigration policies advanced by this administration,” Yang added. “At a minimum, the addition of this question will make it even more challenging to ensure that the community has sufficient trust in the census such that they will respond.”

“We are very concerned that the addition of citizenship question will disproportionately cause an undercount in the Asian community.” - John C. Yang, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC

Treating AAPIs as a monolith ignores how poverty and other factors contribute to undercounting in particular AAPI subgroups, according to a joint fact sheet by the Leadership Conference Education Fund and Georgetown Law’s Center On Poverty and Inequality. While it’s often assumed that AAPIs are financially well-off, reports show that Cambodian-, Hmong- and Laotian-Americans, who predominantly came to the U.S. as refugees, experience higher than average rates of poverty and lower levels of income. More than one-third of Nepalese-Americans also live in poverty.

Communities with lower educational attainment are more difficult to count, too. And Southeast Asian-Americans have some of the highest dropout rates in the country, with about 34.3 percent of Laotian-American adults lacking high school diplomas, as well as 40 percent of Hmong-American and nearly the same percentage of Cambodian-American adults. Yet about 90 percent of the general U.S. adult population finishes high school or gets a GED certificate.

Lower rates of English proficiency contribute to undercounting in the census as well. More than one-third of AAPIs have limited English proficiency, defined as a limited ability to read, speak, write or understand English. And the majority of AAPIs speak a language other than English.

What’s more, much of the AAPI community in the U.S. is made up of immigrants. In fact, almost 60 percent of AAPIs were born in another country, and an estimated 1.7 million undocumented AAPI immigrants live in U.S. The concept of a census is completely foreign for many new immigrants, Yang said, which, along with the citizenship question, would further discourage many AAPIs from participating.

“An undercount will mean that congressional districts will be allocated and drawn without an accurate understanding [of] the Asian American community.” - John. C. Yang

Increased undercounting of AAPIs could have notable repercussions, Yang noted. A report from the GW Institute of Public Policy shows that more than $800 billion of federal funding in fiscal year 2016 relied on census data. And with census data meant to determine political representation, lower participation in the survey could mean AAPI concerns go ignored while resources for hospitals, disaster relief services, health care services and more are misallocated, Yang said.

“Undercount of the Asian American Pacific Islander community will leave the community underrepresented, under-resourced, and under-protected,” he explained. “An undercount will mean that congressional districts will be allocated and drawn without an accurate understanding [of] the Asian American community.”

Already, several AAPI organizations have spoken out against the citizenship question. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) chair, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), issued a statement condemning the new measure and expressing her commitment to using the legislative process to stop its implementation.

“The census is essential for ensuring fair and accurate representation and distribution of government resources,” Chu wrote. “But by including a question on citizenship, which is not required by the Constitution, the Trump Administration is exploiting the fear of immigrant communities who are already reticent to divulge personal information to the federal government.”

Social services nonprofit Asian American Federation, along with 35 partners, sent letters to both the CAPAC and the New York Congressional Delegation to advocate against the question. Citing the cost of hiring additional staff for follow-up on unanswered census questions, the question’s lack of testing, and the concerns of immigrant communities, the federation’s executive director, Jo-Ann Yoo, called on legislators to speak out.Netflix is adding quite a few quality movies over the next few days.

The recently Oscar-nominated “The Incredibles 2” hits the service Wednesday (you can read more about that below). “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” another recent Disney blockbuster, joins the day before.

Then on Friday, Netflix gets 18 new movies, including “Jaws,” “Personal Shopper,” “Pretty in Pink” and “The Edge of Seventeen.” The three main “American Pie” movies also become available to stream, so there’s that.

Netflix has one major Original movie coming out this week: “Velvet Buzzsaw.” This satire stars Jake Gyllenhaal, John Malkovich and Toni Collette as figures in the Los Angeles art world. As a fan of dark comedies, Gyllenhaal and stories that make fun of the ultra-rich, I am excited for this.

Is it good? This movie earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature and has a credible chance at winning (although “Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse” has the best odds). It also has a 93 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 80 on Metacritic. If you have loved Pixar movies in the past, this continues in that lineage of tone and quality.

Heads Up: Disney had to issue a warning that this movie might cause those with epilepsy to have a seizure. The movie has many flashing lights and colors that even those without epilepsy may find overwhelming.

The 2020 census will ask couples residing in U.S. households to define their relationship in a new way: “same-sex” or “opposite-sex.”

The question ― the first serious attempt by the Census Bureau to identify the number of LGBTQ couples in America ― was noted in a Thursday report to Congress by the bureau. You can read that report here.

Wendy Becker, who married her longtime partner, Mary Norton, in Massachusetts in 2006, told NPR that she welcomes the change.

“It really normalizes our experience on an American government form so that everybody looking at it and everybody filling it out sees that we exist,” said Becker, who is part of an early census test run in Rhode Island.

Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution requires that a population count be taken every 10 years. The first census was taken in 1790; the 2020 census will be the 24th count.

The data gathered in the census is used for reapportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and calculating the distribution of federal funds to state and local governments. The number of representatives allocated to each state also determines the number of electors each state has in a presidential election.

By law, the Census Bureau cannot share answers from individual persons with the CIA, FBI, Internal Revenue Service or any other government agency.

Cecilia Chung, senior director of strategic projects for the Transgender Law Center, told NPR that she’d like to see the Census Bureau add additional questions about sexual orientation and gender identity.

“You know, these are all labels,” Chung said. “But if we don’t have the proper labels when we try to look at the picture, there will be a lot of missing pieces, like jigsaw puzzles.”John Oliver called out what just may be one of the worst parts of the U.S. legal system.

On Sunday’s “Last Week Tonight,” Oliver showed how children can be forced to defend themselves in immigration court because they were not entitled to legal representation.

“I’ve taught immigration law literally to 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds,” immigration judge Jack H. Weil argued in 2016. “It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of patience. They get it. It’s not the most efficient, but it can be done.”

“No, it can’t!” an incredulous Oliver shot back. “You can’t teach immigration law to a 3-year-old. You can’t even explain to a child that age that Elmo isn’t his best friend.”More recently Bochco co-created mystery crime-drama “Murder in the First,” which began its run on TNT in 2014.

Bochco launched such series as “Hill Street Blues” ― a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show ― and “L.A. Law” for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (“NYPD Blue,” “Doogie Howser, M.D.”) and notable failures, including the musical police drama “Cop Rock” and the serialized courtroom drama “Murder One,” which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title “Murder in the First,” for TNT.

Asked how he could risk gambling on a musical like “Cop Rock” given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, “With my deal, how could I not?”

Maintaining a high profile, Bochco wasn’t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of “NYPD Blue” led to the actor’s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former “L.A. Law” co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run 11 years.

Although Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of “Hill Street” was born more out of necessity than design.

“We had so many characters that we realized we couldn’t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,” he told the New York Times.

The producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When “Cop Rock” came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.

Bochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against “NYPD Blue” - which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered - ultimately helped promote the series and turning it into a hit.Taylor Swift defended Hayley Kiyoko's right to make statements that some people took as shade toward Swift. Getty/Reuters

Stand down Swifties, because Taylor Swift doesn’t have bad blood with Hayley Kiyoko ― despite what you might have heard.

In a recent interview with Refinery29, Kiyoko, who openly and unapologetically identifies as LGBTQ, voiced her frustrations with the music industry and getting put in a box because she sings about women. Incidentally, she looped in Swift in an effort to express her criticism.

“I’ve had several music industry execs say, ‘You’re doing another music video about girls?’’’ the “Curious” singer said in an interview published last week. “I literally looked at them and was like, ‘Um, yeah ... Taylor Swift sings about men in every single song and video, and no one complains that she’s unoriginal.’”

She added, “I’m not over-sexualizing my music. I make out with women because I love women, not because I’m trying to be sexy. That’s not to turn heads — that’s my life.”

Some interpreted the quote as Kiyoko “shading” Swift, but Swift didn’t take it that way at all. The “Gorgeous” singer responded to a fan’s comment about the quote on Tumblr.

“We should applaud artists who are brave enough to tell their honest romantic narrative through their art, and the fact is that I’ve never encountered homophobia and she has,” Swift said. “It’s her right to call out anyone who has double standards about gay vs. straight love interests.”

The Tumblr user Swift responded to had noted that Swift herself has said similar things about male artists to point out sexism in the industry.

“It is actually very similar to when Taylor back in 2014/2015 would say in interviews how she believes people are sexist when they call her out for writing about her exes but don’t call out people like Ed Sheeran or Bruno Mars for writing about theirs,” the fan said.

“She wasn’t calling out Ed or Bruno at the time, yet rather criticizing how the media and the public handle the situation. Hayley appears to be doing the same.”

During an appearance on an Australian radio show in 2014, Swift pointed out the unfair standard of people who didn’t approve of her singing about past relationships.

“You’re going to have people who are going to say, ‘Oh, you know, like, she just writes songs about her ex-boyfriends,’” she said, according to Time. “And I think frankly that’s a very sexist angle to take. No one says that about Ed Sheeran. No one says that about Bruno Mars. They’re all writing songs about their exes, their current girlfriends, their love life, and no one raises the red flag there.”

And in the end, things worked out with Kiyoko, as she responded to Swift’s Tumblr comments via Twitter on Saturday.

″[Love] and respect to @taylorswift13 and all the brave artists out there sharing their truth with the world,” she tweeted. “I appreciate you. We keep climbing.”Katy Perry gets pretty demonstrative as a judge on “American Idol,” but we hadn’t seen a contestant make her stand, scream and drop her chair until Sunday night.

Grindr security chief Bryce Case told Axios that the issues with the app’s data-sharing practices were “a misunderstanding of what was being shared and with whom.”

“I understand the news cycle right now is very focused on these issues ... I think what’s happened to Grindr is, unfairly, we’ve been singled out. It’s conflating an issue and trying to put us in the same camp where we really don’t belong,” said Case in reference to people comparing Grindr sharing user information to recent scandals involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.

The company has said it will change its policy, allowing advertisers to have access to user information like age, interests, location and relationship status, but not HIV status.

PREVIOUSLY: One week after queer hookup app Grindr announced it would offer a feature reminding users to get tested for HIV, an explosive news report reveals the site is sharing customers’ HIV status with at least two outside companies.

Apptimize and Localytics, companies that help apps sharpen marketing strategies, “receive some of the information that Grindr users choose to include in their profiles,” BuzzFeed reported. That information includes HIV status and “last tested date.”

Because HIV information is sent alongside users’ GPS data, phone ID, and email, an individual’s status could easily be discovered, Antoine Pultier, a researcher at the Norwegian nonprofit SINTEF, told BuzzFeed.

“The HIV status is linked to all the other information. That’s the main issue,” said Pultier. “I think this is the incompetence of some developers that just send everything, including HIV status.”

Grindr told BuzzFeed that the services provided by Apptimize and Localytics are intended to improve users’ experience.

“Thousands of companies use these highly regarded platforms. These are standard practices in the mobile app ecosystem,” Scott Chen, Grindr’s chief technology officer, told BuzzFeed in a statement. “No Grindr user information is sold to third parties. We pay these software vendors to utilize their services.”

The news follows Grindr’s repair of a security flaw that allowed users to see who has blocked them. That flaw also allowed users access to others’ location data, which NBC News reported could “lead to increased harassment — especially in places where homosexuality is criminalized.”

“The security flaw was identified by Trever Faden, CEO of the property management startup Atlas Lane, after he created a website called C*ckblocked” (the asterisk is part of the name of the service), NBC News reported.

“His website allowed users to see who blocked them on Grindr after they entered their Grindr username and password. Once they did so, Faden was able to gain access to a trove of user data that is not publicly available on user profiles, including unread messages, email addresses, deleted photos, and the location data of users, some of whom have opted to not share their locations publicly.”“Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Jenner said in an announcement after giving birth. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”

Though the 20-year-old remained extremely secretive throughout her pregnancy, she’s recently opened up about the experience and being a new mother.The author of the latest book on President Donald Trump’s White House claims that the president’s counselor Kellyanne Conway leaks more information to the media than anyone else in the administration.

“If you wonder why there are so many leaks out of the White House, one reason is Kellyanne Conway is the number one leaker,” author Ronald Kessler told Jake Tapper on Sunday during CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Kessler, who once worked for The Washington Post, said Conway was unguarded in her criticisms of her colleagues when she spoke to him while he was researching The Trump White House: Changing the Rules of the Game, due out Tuesday.

Conway said some of the “most mean, cutting and obviously untrue” things about former chief of staff Reince Priebus, Kessler told Tapper. She also “lit into” first daughter Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, for leaking information about ousted White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Also, aides told Kessler that they saw texts from Conway to members of the media “dissing her colleagues” and “leaking material,” he said.

Conway responded on Monday to Kessler’s comments.

“I have a great working relationship and great relationship with Jared and Ivanka,” she said during an appearance on “Fox & Friends.” “First of all, the president and I talked at length last night about a number of issues ― talked about that very briefly, because there’s so many relevant things happening. He knows ... who the leakers and the liars are and have been.”

“We don’t need a book to tell us that Mr. Trump is going to be a great president,” she added. “And I just want to say one thing, leakers get great press. I got a lot of texts and emails yesterday, ‘Wow, I feel so left out. You never tell me anything.’ Leakers get great press. One day ... I will have my say.”

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

Kessler also revealed on Sunday that Trump understands that his daughter and Kushner are “problems,” and that their inexperience led them to press the president into some of the most dangerous moves of his presidency, such as the “disastrous” firing of former FBI Director James Comey.

“In the end, Jared and Ivanka would push the most disastrous and foolish decisions of Trump’s presidency ... they had no understanding of the basic fundamentals of how government works ... most of all, they had no understanding of the political consequences of their actions,” Kessler wrote in his book.

Trump is unlikely to force the couple out of his administration because they’re family, Kessler said.

The book is expected to present a dramatically different view from Michael Wolff’s explosive Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.

Kessler told Tapper that Trump will one day be considered a great president. He also told TMZ Sunday that the White House is plenty diverse.

This article has been updated with comments from Conway.In many ways, “The Walking Dead” is a perfect show for Easter. People are constantly rising from the dead, everyone’s always crying like that picture of you with a costumed bunny at the mall, and the show’s full of Easter eggs.

This holy weekend, the series exceeded expectations by resurrecting an old storyline and giving us a scene we’ve been waiting for since Season 2.

In the episode “Still Gotta Mean Something,” Carol (Melissa McBride) went on a journey to find Henry (Macsen Lintz), who’s been missing from Hilltop since accidentally letting the Savior prisoners escape in last week’s show.

It really wasn’t looking good for this kid. After he opened the gate to a pen filled with Savior captives in an effort to kill the person who murdered his brother, Henry was pushed over and then was nowhere in sight as the Saviors fled. At the same time, zombies were attacking the Hilltop after healthy residents turned undead thanks to cuts from the Saviors’ zombie-blood tainted weapons, so the odds were definitely against Henry.

But Carol’s been in this situation before.

The survivors spent a big part of Season 2 looking for Carol’s missing daughter Sophia (Madison Lintz), only to learn she was a zombie in a barn the whole time.

After Carol and Morgan (Lennie James) discovered Henry’s weapon, a sharpened stick, sticking out of a zombie, it seemed the boy might receive a similar fate.

Then, somehow, Carol actually found him, and the whole scene turned into a big Easter egg/callback for Sophia. You see, the actress who plays Sophia and the actor who plays Henry are siblings in real life.

So about six seasons after Madison’s Sophia went missing, Carol was able to find her real-life brother.

The discovery scene is basically a mirror image of the last time we saw Sophia alive, when Rick (Andrew Lincoln) left her hiding under roots in a stream while he diverted zombies.

The face of someone who knows this is a crappy plan. Netflix

In an email interview with HuffPost, Macsen reflected on the callback to his sister.

“Definitely ironic,” he said, “An Easter egg on Easter for the true ‘Walking Dead’ fans. Us Lintz kids have to stop getting lost like this!”

We second that, dude.

“It was actually really hard,” he said of the scene. “The water was freezing and mud was creeping inside my wetsuit. Zombies were coming at me. I earned my paycheck that night.”

In an interview last year, his sister Madison told HuffPost she was touched that her brother’s character was so connected to hers, adding, “I think it’s so weird, and I love hearing about everything he’s doing on set. I’m super proud of him.”

AMC

Henry’s character has taken on a darker demeanor this season, but according to Macsen, he may be getting back to his old self now.

“We do see him go back to how he originally was when Carol finds him. I think he realizes that he is just a kid and the adults should take care of this kind of thing.”

And for those wondering why Henry opened the Savior pen in the first place, Macsen agrees it was not a good move.

“It was definitely one of the dumber things he’s done. But, if someone killed my brother I would want to know who it was, too. I can’t blame him too much. Twelve-year-olds don’t always think things through.”The so-called affluenza teen who once claimed his parents’ wealth prevented him from distinguishing between right and wrong was released from a Texas jail Monday after a two-year sentence related to a drunk-driving crash that killed four people.

Ethan Couch, now 20, exited the Tarrant County jail to begin probation, which requires him to wear a GPS ankle monitor and be home by 9 p.m., NBC Dallas Fort Worth reported.

Couch “will now serve the remaining six years of his period of community supervision under the terms and conditions imposed by the court,” his lawyers, Scott Brown and Reagan Wynn, told ABC News in a statement.

Couch wants to regain his privacy “so he may focus on successfully completing his community supervision and going forward as a law-abiding citizen,” the defense lawyers added.

Couch initially avoided prison for the deadly 2013 crash after a judge accepted a psychologist’s diagnosis of “affluenza” that prevented him from distinguishing right and wrong because of his parents’ wealth. He was sentenced to 10 years’ probation and ordered not consume drugs or alcohol.

But in 2015, after he was caught on video at a party featuring alcohol, apparently violating the requirement, Crouch fled with his mother, Tonya Couch, to a Mexican resort town.

In a twist, Tonya Couch last week was booked into the same jail as her son after she failed a court-ordered drug test. Her trial is scheduled to begin in May.Former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama’s post-White House legacy will now include being media moguls, marking a new step in expanding their already influential cultural footprint.

The Obamas will produce films and series for Netflix, the streaming service confirmed on Monday, after several news outlets reported earlier this year that the deal was in the works.

Representatives for Netflix and the Obamas declined to comment on the deal’s details, including the timeline for their projects or what subjects the Obamas might explore. A source close to the deal told HuffPost that the earliest the Obamas’ work would appear on the streaming platform would be in late 2019.

A source told CNN that some of the projects will include the Obamas appearing on camera, while they’ll be working behind the scenes on others.

“One of the simple joys of our time in public service was getting to meet so many fascinating people from all walks of life, and to help them share their experiences with a wider audience,” the former president said in a statement. “That’s why Michelle and I are so excited to partner with Netflix ― we hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world.”

The former first lady said in a statement that she and her husband “have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others. Netflix’s unparalleled service is a natural fit for the kinds of stories we want to share, and we look forward to starting this exciting new partnership.”

According to the streaming service, the Obama’s work will include a variety of content, adding to Netflix’s already large catalog of original programming, according to the streaming service. Their projects will appear across all of Netflix’s international editions, potentially reaching 125 million members in 190 countries, the service said.

The Obamas will produce their work through a newly founded company, Higher Ground Productions, the streaming service said.

Their work will likely focus on some of the issues they championed in the White House, part of a wide range of projects and initiatives they have launched in their post-White House life, including public service fellowships and ongoing plans for the Obama presidential library in Chicago.

Netflix head Ted Sarandos called the Obamas “uniquely positioned to discover and highlight stories of people who make a difference in their communities and strive to change the world for the better.”

AdvertisementMusician and National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent personally attacked survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting who organized last month’s March for Our Lives to push for stricter gun laws.

Nugent slammed the teens during a Friday interview on the nationally syndicated conservative radio program “The Joe Pags Show,” calling the teens “liars,” “soulless” and “poor, mushy-brained children.”

“All you have to do now is not only feel sorry for the liars, but you have to go against them and pray to God that the lies can be crushed and the liars can be silenced so that real measures can be put into place to actually save children’s lives,” Nugent said about the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students, just six weeks after a gunman shot and killed 17 people at their South Florida high school.

“The lies from the left, the lies from these poor, mushy-brained children who have been fed lies and parrot the lies, they are actually committing spiritual suicide because everything they recommend will cause more death and mayhem, guaranteed,” Nugent said.

Later in the segment, host Joe Pagliarulo showed Nugent clips of two of the most vocal student activists, David Hogg and Emma González, railing against the NRA. That spurred Nugent to say:

“The dumbing down of America is manifested in the culture deprivation of our academia that have taught these kids the lies, media that have prodded and encouraged and provided these kids lies. I really feel sorry for them because it’s not only ignorant and dangerously stupid, but it’s soulless.”

He added:

“To attack the good, law-abiding families of America when well-known, predictable murderers commit these horrors is deep in the category of soulless.”

In response to the “Cat Scratch Fever” rocker’s comments, several Stoneman Douglas students spoke out online, including Cameron Kasky.

If only he saw all the tears.



If only he had to look into the eyes I’ve looked into.



If only he saw what this did to all of us...



And here the NRA is, receiving more fear-based donations than ever.



Talk about ‘no soul.’ This guy better apologize. Seriously. https://t.co/NHL4yr5r4M — Cameron Kasky (@cameron_kasky) March 31, 2018

Another of the school’s students, Kyra Parrow, called Nugent a bully.

it’s funny how the NRA argues that guns aren’t the issue, it’s bullying that is. Yet literally a NRA board member is being a 5 year old acting like a bully to me and all of the students at douglas. https://t.co/9Upcqdr8e4 — Kyra Parrow (@longlivekcx) March 31, 2018

The NRA launched a heated offensive soon after the Feb. 14 massacre. It has warned its members against the “freedom-hating left,” and claimed that the students’ campaign for reforming gun laws violates Americans’ “fundamental rights.”WASHINGTON — Student activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School inspired hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets last month to call attention to gun violence. Many protesters seemed to have their sights set on this year’s midterm elections, as they carried signs alluding to their voting power and arguing that politicians backed by the National Rifle Association needed to be voted out of office.

But anti-gun violence advocacy groups say there is one more test: whether the momentum that led students to organize the March For Our Lives in the nation’s capital can continue until Election Day in November.

“The issue is, are kids going to show up to vote?” said Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “Because that’s the banner of success for us.”

“We need to make sure when voters vote in November, that this is something they’re voting on,” said Shannon Watts, co-founder of Moms Demand Action.

Both Watts and Brown pointed to last year’s gubernatorial election in Virginia as a promising blueprint for electoral success. Exit polls showed that guns were the second most important issue for voters, behind only health care. Now-Gov. Ralph Northam (D), as well as Democratic candidates on the local level, used gun control as an issue to their advantage; Democrats and gun safety advocacy groups successfully made the NRA’s support for Northam’s opponent, Ed Gillespie, a political liability.

Stoneman Douglas students from Parkland, Florida, and the people they’ve inspired seem intent on keeping the issue of gun violence front and center in the coming weeks: Marches and rallies have continued, and there are plans for a nationwide school walkout on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.

Victoria Kaplan, organizing director for MoveOn.org, said she considers those steps “really strong indicators” that political engagement will continue through November — and perhaps far beyond.

“For me, it was the Iraq War, when I was a senior in college, when I saw exactly how important political engagement was. I think for this generation, that’s happening through the lens of gun violence. The impact of that is going to ripple for years.” - Peter Ambler, executive director and co-founder of Giffords

Many of these advocacy groups are now collaborating with the students on further political engagement, such as making it easier for them to attend lawmakers’ town halls — while bearing in mind that “they’re the ones with agency here,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, the group co-founded by gun violence survivor and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).

“Given the failure of adults to protect kids, the kids are understandably suspicious of the adults, so it’s really important that you approach young people as partners,” Ambler said, noting that students planned the March For Our Lives without being asked.

Several of the gun control advocates emphasized that the student activists have already started to build a sustainable, long-term political movement. The urgency and personal nature of the issue, they said, is likely to continue to motivate young people.

“This active shooter generation, they’re coming of age — and they’re pissed,” Ambler said.

Brown said frequent lockdown and mass shooter drills at schools around the country have shown kids what needs to change.

“For many kids, this is how they grew up, and it’s a reminder, every time they go through it, of how little has been done to truly protect them,” Brown said. “The answer that the adults have put into place, they know, really, is not going to stop it from happening again.”

“I don’t see them just walking away from this,” she added. “This is something that’s deeply personal, like, ‘You’ve told me this is the way our government is supposed to work. I see that this is — pardon my French — a bastardization of it. Fix it, and if you’re not going to fix it, then get out of the way.’”

A major motivator is students’ visceral anger at “the corruption of our political system,” as Ambler characterized it.

“The NRA is a really good bad guy for folks, and kids naturally understand that money in politics has had insidious effects on the direction that our country takes politically,” he said. “It just seems obvious [to them].”

Kaplan noted that the Parkland students have tried to make their movement inclusive and show just how many people are regularly affected by gun violence: They have put attention on shootings in urban areas where people of color predominantly live, and have spoken out about their own experiences in mostly white suburban areas.

The students’ “complete frustration and almost righteous indignation” with the government, as Brown put it, has a recent historical parallel: activism against the Iraq War, which reshaped the Democratic Party and catalyzed a generation of progressive leaders.

It is too early to say whether students motivated by gun violence now will go on to run for office, but Ambler said he sees the seeds being planted.

“You’ve got a generation of Americans that is engaging politically for the very first time in their lives. We probably all remember that moment when politics became more significant for us, right?” he said. “For me, it was the Iraq War, when I was a senior in college, when I saw exactly how important political engagement was. I think for this generation, that’s happening through the lens of gun violence. The impact of that is going to ripple for years.”

Kaplan, who was also a college student during the anti-Iraq War movement, said she believes today’s students will stay active.Stoner attends the World Of Dance Industry Awards on Feb. 7, 2017, in Los Angeles, California. Paul Archuleta via Getty Images

Actress, dancer and singer Alyson Stoner revealed she’s “attracted to men, women and people who identify in other ways” in a poignant essay for Teen Vogue.

Stoner ― who you may recognize from roles in the TV series “Step Up” and “Cheaper By The Dozen,” or as the little girl who used to dance with Missy Elliot ― opened up about coming to terms with her sexuality and her faith under the constant pressure of fame.

The 24-year-old said she fell in love with a female instructor teaching a dance workshop she attended. For a long time, Stoner said, she wasn’t sure why she felt such a strong connection.

“The question of whether she was a cool new friend or more kept me awake in wonderment and dread,” Stoner wrote in the essay, published Friday. “Our bond didn’t feel quite sisterly or platonic. Flashes of her smile progressed to flashes of her wavy hair followed by the curve of her hips through her straight-leg pants. I realized I had never fantasized about a guy this way, nor really ever felt comfortable dating guys.”

Over time, the relationship became intimate, and Stoner said she fell deeply in love. Her faith, however, made it hard to accept that she could be attracted to women.

“My faith at that time played a large role in every aspect of my life, and my worldview neither supported nor accepted same-sex relationships. I prayed in turmoil nightly, begging to be healed from these desires,” Stoner wrote.

A post shared by @alysonstoner (@alysonstoner) on Sep 12, 2017 at 9:09am PDT

Stoner said she tried conversion therapy and physical relationships with men. Nothing worked, she wrote, and she feared she’d lose her career success.

“Some people in the industry warned me that I’d ruin my career, miss out on possible jobs and potentially put my life in danger if I ever came out,” she wrote. “My dream and all I’d worked tirelessly for since the age of 6 was suddenly at risk by my being ... true to myself.”

In a moment of awakening, Stoner wrote that she finally accepted herself for who she was: “I felt a transformation, an ascension, an approach to life rooted in real love.”

“I, Alyson, am attracted to men, women, and people who identify in other ways. I can love people of every gender identity and expression,” she wrote. “It is the soul that captivates me. It is the love we can build and the goodness we can contribute to the world by supporting each other’s best journeys.”

Stoner concluded her essay by reaching out to others who may be struggling with their identity.An activity that was the subject of “condom-nation” five years ago is supposedly making a comeback: snorting condoms up one’s nose.

The “condom snorting challenge,” as it is called, requires participants to video themselves snorting an unrolled condom up one nostril and then pull it through the mouth.

Although the activity was first reported back in 2013, it’s apparently returned unlike other bizarre but forgotten internet fads from that era like planking, Tebowing, owling and Vadering.

Stephen Enriquez, an education specialist in Texas, told San Antonio station KABB that condom snorting is coming back because the extreme activity can help teenagers make a name for themselves on social media.

“Because these days our teens are doing everything for likes, views and subscribers,” Enriquez said. “As graphic as it is, we have to show parents because teens are going online looking for challenges and recreating them.”

In an article for Forbes, Bruce Y. Lee, associate professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, warns there are numerous reasons why people should turn up their noses at condom snorting.

These include risks like damaging the inner lining of the nose, getting an infection or choking if the condom gets stuck in the throat.

All of these add up to one burning question for Lee.Dustin Lance Black and Tom Daley surprised fans on Valentine’s Day by revealing that they were expecting a son via a surrogate ― and have since endured their share of criticism from conservatives who say their child would be better off if brought up by a heterosexual couple.

A man called in to BBC Radio 5 Live’s Afternoon Edition during an interview with Black last week, for example, and said he “didn’t think two blokes can bring a baby up.”

“I don’t have an issue with gay people, I want to make that clear,” said the caller, who was not identified. But, he added, “you need the mother there. The mother’s the one. [Women] are very different, the way they do things ― everything.”

Dustin Lance Black (@DLanceBlack) speaks to a 5 live caller who thinks two men shouldn't raise a child pic.twitter.com/D78MIyYrJH — BBC Radio 5 live (@bbc5live) March 27, 2018

Black, who wed Daley last year in Devon, England, offered an extremely composed response to the caller.

“There are all different kinds of families out there in the world, and for many different reasons ― some more tragic than others ― children are raised by single parents all the time,” he said. “Those children ― I’d like to claim myself as one, who was raised by a single mother for some difficult reasons ― I think I had a very strong mother who raised me incredibly well.”

Black, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of “Milk,” also assured listeners his future son would meet and interact with women.

“It would be wrong to deprive a child of that, and, frankly, bizarre and probably impossible,” he said.

Black also acknowledged and he and Daley will face “some real legal challenges” because they had chosen to raise their child in the United Kingdom. Surrogacy contracts aren’t enforced under British law, so the woman who gives birth is treated as the child’s mother until parental rights are transferred through a parental order.

“It would be a much easier path if we decided to raise our son in the U.S., but this country is home for us,” Black said.

He also indicated that he and Daley have a good relationship with their surrogate.

FRANKFORT, Ky. ― Thousands of teachers and public workers from across Kentucky flocked to the state Capitol on Monday morning to protest potential budget cuts to public education and the passage, last week, of a controversial package of changes to the state’s public pension system that teachers had opposed.

The rally began before 9 a.m. outside the Kentucky Education Association building just blocks from the Capitol complex. Teachers, most of them clad in red (as part of the grassroots Wear Red for Ed campaign), later marched to the Capitol itself, filling up the rotunda outside legislative chambers and spilling out the front doors and down the steps.

“Enough is enough,” they chanted, many of them carrying signs telling lawmakers to fully fund their pensions and their schools and threatening that if the legislators failed to do so, the teachers would do everything in their power to remove them from office in elections this November.

“We feel demoralized, we feel assaulted and we feel like we’ve been marginalized,” said Chris Wilder, a teacher at Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg. “We’re angry.”

Teachers have filled the Capitol complex off and on for more than a month in an effort to derail pension changes and education budget cuts proposed by Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Republican majority leaders in both chambers of the legislature.

But their anger boiled over Thursday night when GOP lawmakers attached a slate of pension changes to a previously unrelated bill meant to address public sewage issues. Hours later, both the state House and state Senate approved the measures on party-line votes.

“The way they introduced this bill was the linchpin, the insulting part,” Wilder said. “We’re basically equivalent to excrement. It’s like, ‘This is what we think of you and your contribution to our state. Nothing. You don’t matter.’ But we matter, and our kids matter.”

The pension bill, which Bevin is expected to sign before the legislative session ends next week, did not contain some provisions teachers had been most angry about, including a cap on annual cost-of-living adjustments. The bill dropped many of the previously proposed changes to current teachers’ benefits. But it maintained a provision that places a cap on the number of a current teacher’s accumulated sick days that can count toward pension benefits ― a move Attorney General Andy Beshear, who said he would sue if the bill becomes law, has said is unconstitutional.

It also switches new hires to a “hybrid” 401(k)-style plan and ends some contractual protections that currently prohibit lawmakers from altering pension benefits for public workers, teachers included.

Those changes, teachers said, would make it hard for the state to recruit new educators in Kentucky, which already has a struggling public education system.

Even before Monday’s rally, teachers forced public schools to close in at least 25 Kentucky counties on Friday when they called in sick en masse to protest the pension plan. In Lexington, the state’s second-largest school district, more than one-third of school employees stayed out Friday. In Louisville, the absences forced the closure of Kentucky’s largest school district.

Most public school districts were already closed Monday for spring break, but the threat of another round of sick-outs caused more than a dozen school districts that were supposed to be open to close instead. The result was that public school districts were shuttered in each of Kentucky’s 120 counties on Monday, accomplishing a goal organizers had set when they announced plans for the protest.

The educators came to Frankfort from cities across the state. In Louisville, a group of Jefferson County Public School teachers met at a local Teamsters union hall and took a 45-minute bus ride to the capital. In Frankfort, groups of teachers gathered under banners bearing names of school districts spread from Pike County in eastern Kentucky to Marshall County in the west.

The initial crowd for the bus ride from Louisville disappointed some organizers. They had planned for four full busloads but sent three half-full buses instead. But upon arriving in Frankfort, it was clear that the crowd had exceeded expectations.

Organizers estimated that more than 5,000 people gathered inside and outside the Capitol, though no official estimate was available.

“This is spring break,” said Mike Kral, a retired teacher from Hardin County. “If it’d been a regular school day, it’d have been 10 times this.”

Still, it was a show of force against a state legislature that, teachers said, has failed to prioritize teachers or Kentucky’s public education system for years and, by passing the pension package so quickly Thursday, had broken a promise to its educators.

“When we signed on the dotted line to become a teacher, we knew we weren’t going to make a lot of money,” said Lynn Luking, a retired teacher from Louisville. “But we were promised a full pension and full health care. And every year they’ve taken more and more of that away.”

The protests weren’t aimed only at last week’s pension overhaul. With the end of Kentucky’s legislative session looming, lawmakers returned to the capital Monday to consider new tax legislation and a budget bill that held the potential for further cuts to public education spending.

Bevin, in January, had proposed cuts to several school-related programs in ways that some administrators said threatened the solvency of some poorer, rural districts. Many of the teachers also opposed potential new funding for charter schools that Bevin had pushed in his proposed budget.

“It seems like these folks want to privatize everything,” said Mike Haile, a retired teacher from Henderson County, in western Kentucky. “They privatized prisons and they privatized schools. It’s take the money and run.”

With the budget vote looming, a crowd of protesters gathered around a side entrance to the Capitol and chanted “Shame! Shame!” at Republican lawmakers as they entered.

Republicans ultimately introduced a bill that did not include many of Bevin’s preferred cuts or new funding for charter schools, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal, though many protesters and legislative Democrats still criticized it for cutting taxes on the rich and falling short of previous K-12 education funding levels.

The protests and school closures were reminiscent of similar movements in states including West Virginia, where teachers went on strike to protest years of tax cuts that had left the state unable to fully fund schools, and Oklahoma, where teachers were set to go on strike Monday. Teachers in Arizona could soon join them in walking out.

In Kentucky, the educators said the pension changes and budget cuts were a breaking point in their relationship with state government. They vowed that the protests and organized opposition would continue. And they promised that they would be a political force come November.

“I will walk and knock on every door,” Luking said, “to see that every one of these guys are defeated.”
