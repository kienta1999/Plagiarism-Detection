In some alternate universe far better than the one we’re all toiling away in, Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding was officiated by the one and only Adele.

When the “I Feel Pretty” star tied the knot with chef Chris Fischer in February after just a few months of dating, the Grammy-winning “Hello” singer was initially set to be the master of ceremonies after having been ordained the month before for another friend’s nuptials.

Schumer explained on SiriusXM’s “The Jim and Sam Show” Tuesday that she had been staying in Los Angeles near her friend Jennifer Lawrence, who lives near the singer.

“They’re really good friends and I’d never met her before, so we hung out a little bit that week,” Schumer said.

“Then we were real drunk one night and talking about how we wanted to get married and Adele was like, ‘Well, I can marry you,’ and we were like, ‘OK, cool,’” she added. “We were making a whole plan, like Tuesday at noon, because she takes care of her kid.”

In the light of day, however, they realized that maybe it wasn’t the most sensible idea after all.

“Then the next day, she’s like, ‘Hey, we’re not really friends,’” Schumer joked. “She got ordained to marry her good friend, so I think she was like, ‘They’ll be annoyed if I just start marrying random basic bitches.’”

But the comedian charged forward with her wedding anyway, getting married in front of family and friends including Lawrence and Chelsea Handler.

“So, then we were like, ‘Should we still get married on Tuesday?’ and decided, ‘Yeah, who cares, let’s do it, so there’s no drama. No planning,’” she explained. “When you see your friend go through planning a wedding, it just seems like it sucks, so I just texted people.”

Comedian John Early ended up stepping in for Adele, dressing in drag as his alter ego Vicky from Netflix’s “The Characters.” He was, however, understandably nervous to take the reins from the British singer.

But thanks to a new study from CheapAir.com, we now have some guidelines for the best time to book international flights. (Don’t worry, we’ll still be over here clicking refresh for all the domestic trips we’ve got coming up.)If you were to visit Lençóis Maranhenses National Park in northeast Brazil during dry season, you’d be blinded by a sweeping landscape of rolling white sand dunes (its name literally translates to “bedsheets”). But from July through September, the stark scene turns, miraculously, into an oasis of countless emerald-blue lagoons. And yes, you can swim in them (the water reaches a soothing 87 degrees Fahrenheit). Here’s everything you need to know about this magical, little-known place.

ELLEON/GETTY IMAGES

Wait, so where does the water come from? Out of the sky. Seriously. Lençóis might give off Saharan vibes, but the park is not technically a desert. With its January-through-June torrential downpours, it’s way too rainy. By July, the skies clear and the pools are at their largest, some reaching over 300 feet long and 10 feet deep. After September, however, the winds get more powerful and the pools disappear, as if they were never there, and the rainy season begins again.

Are there fish in the pools? Actually, yes. Since the lagoons are connected to nearby rivers, fish find their way over (or stay burrowed deep in the mud between seasons).

OK, how do I get there? It’s definitely an adventure. Your best bet is to fly into São Luís, rent a car (or organize transportation) and drive the nearly four hours to the town of Barreirinhas. From there, we suggest going with a guide or pre-planned group trip (like Brasil Planet) that can escort you and keep you from getting lost in the vast park. The long, bumpy ride in is not for the faint of heart. But considering it’s one of the most beautiful sites you’ll ever set your eyes on, it might be kinda sorta worth it. (Psst: Make sure to pack for the ultimate beach trip — aka plenty of hydration, snacks, portable shade, walking shoes and ample SPF.)When it comes to paradise, Maldives, Hawaii or Fiji come to mind — take it from me: My job is literally to travel around the world. But if you want one of my best-kept vacation secrets, it’s this: A direct ten-hour flight on Air New Zealand from LAX will transport you to the little-known gem called Rarotonga of the Cook Islands. (A direct flight to the Maldives? That’ll take you 20 hours.) Here’s my guide to the magical getaway.

By Lisa Linn

WHERE IS THIS PLACE AGAIN?

The Cook Islands, made up of 15 individual islands, are in the South Pacific northeast of New Zealand, between American Samoa and French Polynesia. They’re at once completely isolated but also connected to the world by the international airport on Rarotonga, the biggest and most populous of the islands.

By Lisa Linn

WHERE TO STAY

My take? Enjoy the full beauty of the island — in all of its outdoor glory — and stay at the Ikurangi Eco Retreat. Glamping, as many call it, in safari tents and waking up to fresh breakfast at your doorstep, with an outdoor shower to complete the experience, will make it nearly impossible to think about work emails (and actually, you probably will have to disconnect; our cell-phone service did not provide coverage here).

By Lisa Linn

WHAT TO DO

The number one thing? Relax. Like really relax. No Facebook, Instagram or texts reminding you to make your next dentist appointment (but, you know, you should eventually do that). If you get antsy and want something to do aside from lounging on the beach, try island hopping: A short, 45-minute flight will get you to Aitutaki, another Cook Island, known for its azure blue lagoon. It’s seriously dreamy.

More of the adventurous type? Go snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters or ATVing through the mud. Plus, Rarotonga has two breweries you can tour (and take a bottle or two home with you).

By Lisa Linn

WHEN TO GO

Any time! The weather is always gorgeous, maybe some rainfall during the cooler seasons, but overall the Cook Islands are a year-round destination. Kia Orana!

AdvertisementIt started with a letter in Bettye Washington’s mailbox. “Move out, move on,” the letter said, as if leaving East Austin after spending 80 years there would be a simple choice. Then came the phone calls from eager-sounding men and women — realtors, developers, and opportunists of all types — explaining how they just loved Washington’s house, a “shotgun shack” built in the 1970s.

Washington, 85, handles each call by politely saying she is not interested in selling. “Every time they buy one of my neighbor’s houses, they put up one of those mansions and the taxes go up,” Washington said. “It’s been a rugged ride, but I’m still going. I’m in overtime, but I’ll outride them yet.”

This isn’t a new phenomenon. Washington has a basketful of letters and flyers, collected over years, encouraging her to sell the home she’s been in for more than 40 years. It’s a part of life in the now-trendy community.

The real problem is what all this interest in her neighborhood has done to East Austin itself.

“I thought gentrification was supposed to be a good thing, that it was supposed to make the neighborhood nicer, and improve things for us, but it’s not been that,” Washington said. “It’s pushed so many of us out.”

City authorities have come up with a new plan to try to help residents at risk of displacement as well as those already forced out. In March, Kathie Tovo, representative and mayor pro tem for Austin City Council, penned a resolution to create a “right to return” ordinance, aiming to prioritize access to affordable housing for residents with generational ties to East Austin and other gentrifying parts of the city. “We are losing these longtime residents. We have to use everything in our toolbox to help them,” said Tovo.

How the ordinance will work in practice is still unclear. The Austin city manager now has until May 25 to come up with wording that fits within state laws and the federal Fair Housing Act, which forbids decision-making based on race.

Clues may be found in a similar “right to return” scheme launched last year in Portland, Oregon. The city is offering down payment assistance to people with long-term ties to the rapidly gentrifying city, who have been displaced or are at risk of displacement. It scores applicants on a points-based system, with top priority given to people whose land was seized by the city government.

However, that scheme also indicates the potential challenges of such a policy. Of the more than 1,100 people who applied, Portland only has the funds to help 65 families. So far, just a handful of people have successfully used the program to secure homes.

Gentrification is a knotty issue, and critics suggest “right to return” policies have little chance of success.

“If it was easy to fix, it would have been fixed by now,” said Fred McGhee, an advocate for affordable urban housing in East Austin. “Some people think that things are going to have to get worse because then people are going to be willing to take to the streets and demand that this unfair economy be changed.”

Pointing to the city’s history of resolutions, task forces and councils, including the Anti-Displacement Task Force — made up of experts, community leaders and activists — set up by Austin Mayor Steve Adler in February, McGhee said: “It’s a structural way of governing that allows for plausible deniability. We do the work, and we make our report to the city council, and then they don’t do anything with it,” McGhee said.

Austin, now one of the fastest-gentrifying cities in the U.S., has a long history of inequality. And East Austin has been at the frontline. City officials deliberately drove African-Americans and Hispanic residents into the neighborhood as part of the city’s 1928 master plan. The city would only run utilities to their homes if they were in East Austin and made sure that, pre-desegregation, the black schools were built in that neighborhood.

“East Austin was created as a reservation for the black and brown people — that’s what people called it,” said Daniel Llanes, a longtime East Austin resident and community activist. “But in the early ’90s, the city council did a blanket rezoning of East Austin. When that happened, it accelerated gentrification here, because the properties that had been residential suddenly had the ability to be commercial, so the property owners pushed residents out and got commercial renters in because they could.”

A study by the University of Texas in 2017 found that in East Austin, a once predominantly low to moderate income African-American and Mexican-American neighborhood, saw a 442 percent increase of white residents between 2000 and 2010, while its African-American population dropped by 66 percent.

People left East Austin for a variety of reasons, but the bulk of those who moved away — more than half, according to UT survey results — did so because housing was no longer affordable.

Relocating to suburbs such as Pflugerville, Round Rock and Manor has often meant increased transport costs, and less access to grocery stores and health care.

“These are suburbs to the extent that they’re outside the urban core. But they are not a move up for people. They’re simply a move out,” UT study author Professor Eric Tang told NPR.

For those that remain, the impacts of gentrification are also felt. Washington’s family moved to the East Austin in 1936, when she was just 3 years old, so that her father, a cement finisher, could get work during the Great Depression. She loved the neighborhood and, after marrying, she and her husband saved up their money — at one point she was working two jobs in addition to her day job as a teacher — and bought an empty lot where they built the house she now lives in.

Starting in 2000, Washington noticed a change in the community. As her neighbors died or moved into retirement homes, their houses were overhauled and expanded, or knocked down and rebuilt. Along the way, developers were eliminating affordable housing in an area that had historically been home to low-income families.

“Those little houses, some of them were nice and had been kept up. They weren’t fancy, but a family without a lot of money could have afforded one. I don’t see them building houses like that anymore,” Washington said.

As the housing market becomes less affordable — rents rose 50 percent in the city between 2004 and 2013, while the average house price in East Austin tripled from $125,000 to $375,000 between 2011 and 2014 — affordable housing stocks are falling. The number of units needed went from 40,000 in 2012 to more than 48,000 by 2014.

“The developers come in and the city council lets them pay into a fund instead of actually building affordable housing on their properties, and it’s a mistake,” council member Tovo said.

While Austin’s experience is part of a wider U.S. affordable housing crisis, the city is particularly affected, said Susan Popkin, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute, a D.C.-based social policy think tank. “The need that we’re seeing in the country is even worse in Austin, which has some of the worst economic segregation in the country.” Black households in Austin bring in about $50,820 per year to white households’ average of $97,939, according to a 2016 city demographer report.

City authorities have an uphill battle to address these systemic problems. And even if the “right to return” policy is enacted, it’s unclear how much impact it would have. Tovo said it will make a difference for people, that they will be eager to come back to neighborhoods where they have longstanding ties. But finding a way to come back is just the start of the challenges those returning may face, Popkin said. “We know how to redevelop a distressed neighborhood and make it nice, but we have yet to see it still be a place where the people who live there at the start of that redevelopment still feel like it’s the place they know,” she noted. “Moving back isn’t always as easy as people might think.”Days before Khloe Kardashian is expected to give birth, several videos of her boyfriend, basketball star Tristan Thompson, seemingly cheating on the reality TV star are making the rounds.

While the Good American designer prepares to welcome her first child in Cleveland, surrounded by family, a video obtained by The Daily Mail on Tuesday appears to show Thompson cozying up to another woman at a rooftop bar in New York City on Saturday night.

The two were later spotted entering and then leaving his hotel together ahead of a game against the New York Knicks, according to a video obtained by TMZ and The Shade Room.

Hours after that video surfaced, footage of Thompson kissing two women at a hookah lounge in D.C. in October, when Kardashian was three months pregnant, was posted by TMZ.

Neither Thompson nor Kardashian have responded to the videos.

The couple, linked together since August 2016, revealed they were expecting a baby girl together on a recent episode of the famous family’s TV show, “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” Thompson has made multiple appearances over the last season, seemingly embraced by the ever-expanding family.

Kardashian has thoroughly documented their love story on social media, sharing romantic snaps of the couple in the weeks leading up to her April due date.

“We are ready whenever you are little mama 🦋,” Kardashian wrote alongside an Instagram of her kissing Thompson on Monday.

While the footage of Thompson may come as a shock to fans of the couple, it was rumored that the two began dating while Thompson’s ex-girlfriend, lifestyle blogger Jordan Craig, was pregnant with his child. She welcomed a son named Prince in December 2016.

On Tuesday, Craig seemed to respond to the speculation, sharing a heartfelt message on Instagram.

“If you respect yourself and you respect others, you would never make light of the misfortune of anyone, nor would you feel indemnified when it comes at the expense of others,” Craig wrote. “Wishing peace for everyone.”

“Tristan has been consistently cheating on Khloé,” People quoted an “insider” source as saying about the NBA star. “He’s a serial cheater. And there will be more women to come out of the woodwork.”“Game of Thrones” just wrapped a 55-night production schedule for a single battle scene you’ll be able to watch in the upcoming final season. But, as you’re probably well aware, you still have a long wait for Season 8, which isn’t debuting until 2019.

So you might want a few shows to tide you over until you can finally see these new episodes. HBO doesn’t really have aesthetically similar shows, but as Netflix has over 1,500 shows in its library, there are obviously a few that have clear resemblances to “Game of Thrones.”

Netflix added many of these relevant shows with gratuitous sword-based fighting, warring families and plentiful sex scenes in just the last few years, so it’s also safe to say the popularity of “Game of Thrones” is at least part of the reason Netflix gobbled up these shows in the first place.

As “Game of Thrones” is both a very popular and (at least generally) critically adored series, a list of recommended titles to watch next could really feature any other successful, well-written show. If you like “Game of Thrones,” your taste would probably lead you to HBO’s “Westworld” or even something fairly dissimilar at face value like FX’s “Atlanta.” So if you just want recommendations for other good shows, you can also check out HuffPost’s weekly roundup of what to watch.

Here, we’re specifically focused on shows that have distinct visual and narrative similarities to “Game of Thrones.” This list is if you basically want to watch episodes of “Game of Thrones” you haven’t seen yet, but can’t. Maybe if you squint while watching “Frontier” from the list below, you’ll just see Jason Momoa doing a violent act and think ― “Hey, this ‘Game of Thrones’ episode is pretty good.” That’s the goal here.

Watch the trailers for all the shows below. And, if you want to stay informed on what shows are coming to Netflix every week, make sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.

"The Last Kingdom" on Netflix. The Last Kingdom

Streamline makes recommendations for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline highlights the best shows to watch online, with a focus on Netflix.

“The Last Kingdom”

The Last Kingdom

Premise: This is based on a novel series called The Saxon Stories, which the British author Bernard Cornwell wrote. The story takes place in the 9th century as the kingdoms in what would become the area of England are still divided. These kingdoms are also under attack from the Vikings.

The story kind of has a “Gangs of New York” vibe of warring groups centered around a protagonist that needs to avenge his father and outside forces, who make ideas of tribalism less important.

Runtime: 16 episodes of approx. 60 minutes.

Here’s the trailer...

“Frontier”

"Frontier" on Netflix. Frontier

Premise: This stars Jason Momoa, who played Khal Drogo in “Game of Thrones,” so similarity points there.

Momoa’s character is a ruthless figure in the Canadian frontier during the 1700s. His goal is to upset the authority of the Hudson’s Bay Company over the fur trade. He does this through tons of violence.

Runtime: 12 episodes of approx. 45 minutes.

Here’s the trailer...

“The Tudors”

"The Tudors" on Netflix. The Tudors

Premise: The most popular show on this list is also the oldest. “The Tudors” ended a four-season run in 2010.

This show delves into an imagined backstory of the famous King Henry VIII, who famously killed many of his wives to move on to different women. This has similar royal power struggles and gratuitous love scenes to “Game of Thrones.”

Runtime: 38 episodes of approx. 50 minutes.

Here’s the trailer...

“Borgia”

"Borgia" on Netflix. Netflix

Premise: The Netflix series, “Borgia,” is a loose interpretation of history. The 2011 show depicts the rise of the Borgia family during the Renaissance period as they took over the papacy. The series has a similar appeal of “The Tudors,” with the warring families and plethora of lovemaking.

Confusingly, there’s another show that came out at roughly the same time called “The Borgias,” produced by Showtime, that is also on Netflix. “Borgia,” the show recommended here, seems to be the better of the two, but if you end up loving this show, you could always watch the slightly different version as well.

Runtime: 38 episodes of approx. 55 minutes.

Here’s the trailer...

“Norsemen”

"Norsemen" on Netflix. Norsemen

Premise: This series is actually a comedy and with just a few episodes, “Norsemen” is certainly the easiest watch on the list.

It’s basically a workplace comedy, but the workplace is a Viking tribe in the late 700s.

Runtime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes.Snag a ticket to "Lean on Pete," "Where Is Kyra?" or "You Were Never Really Here" before the blockbuster deluge. A24 Great Point Media/Paladin Film Amazon Studios

Now that blockbusters ― namely reboots and franchise fare ― have graduated from summer escapism to year-round fixtures, April is no longer a safe space at the multiplex. The month that once birthed “Field of Dreams,” “The Matrix,” “Election” and “Mean Girls” now belongs to the “Fast and the Furious” vehicles, Marvel and “Clash of the Titans.”

To see “A Quiet Place” rumble into theaters last weekend was to witness a small miracle. Heralding John Krasinski’s directing talents and notching an august $50 million opening, the post-apocalyptic creature feature is the sort of studio product meant to warm jaded cinephiles’ hearts: a high-concept crowd-pleaser that manages to be fresh and whip-smart ― an increasingly rare sight in the year of our big-budget Lord 2018. “A Quiet Place” boasts the highest-grossing April debut for an original film in history, as well as the heftiest intake for an original live-action release since “Happy Death Day” last October.

The rest of April’s wide releases are, well, less thrilling. Oversized beasts are stampeding Dwayne Johnson and Naomie Harris, “Isle of Dogs” barks its way into more corners of the country, Shia LaBeouf flaunts short shorts in the otherwise staid “Borg vs McEnroe,” Amy Schumer stars in a feminist “Shallow Hal,” we finally get a sequel to ... “Super Troopers” (?), “Truth or Dare” turns its titular pastime into something deadly (Tyler Posey doesn’t take his shirt off in the trailer; skip it), and the Avengers threaten to put more superheroes on one screen than a VH1 Divas telecast.

Those movies will flood multiplexes in the coming weeks, ushering us toward the blockbuster domination that is May, June and July. Meanwhile, three worthwhile underdogs opened opposite “A Quiet Place,” shouldering the month’s indie marketplace. “Lean on Pete,” “Where Is Kyra?” and “You Were Never Really Here” are hardly light fare, but isn’t there some adage about bleak movies being the perfect way to escape April showers? No? You’ll want to invent one after seeing this trio.

We talked to the filmmakers responsible for these gems. If you don’t live near a theater where the movies are playing, add them to a list of rainy-day streaming options for later in the year, when you find yourself wondering who among us requested yet another Robin Hood retelling.

“Lean on Pete”

For fans of “Boyhood,” “The 400 Blows” and “The Black Stallion”

Written and directed by Andrew Haigh

Starring Charlie Plummer, Steve Buscemi, Chloë Sevigny, Travis Fimmel, Amy Seimetz and Steve Zahn

A24

Lean on Pete is a racehorse whose cantankerous trainer (Steve Buscemi) describes him as a “piece of shit” ― catnip for our protagonist, Charley (Charlie Plummer), a motherless 15-year-old working the stables for $25 a day, partly as a respite from his aloneness and partly to gird his father’s (Travis Fimmel) limited income. Gentle Charley can’t stomach the thought of Pete being carted off to Mexico, where aged steeds are slaughtered once they are no longer moneymakers. So, in the dark of night, this spindly boy absconds with his beloved horse (an expert listener), trekking through the Oregon desert toward a broader horizon.

On paper, it’s a quintessential coming-of-age tale. But in practice, writer and director Andrew Haigh sees “Lean on Pete” as the events that occur before Charley comes of age. And he’s right: Charley doesn’t yet have the means ― the familial support, the peers, the finances ― to determine his place in the world. The only thing that steadies him is a tender heart. “Until he finds somewhere to have a base, in order to grow, he can’t even deal with ideas of identity or who he’s going to be or what kind of man he wants to be,” Haigh said. “And also, I suppose, in all of my films, I can’t help but want to show a different version of masculinity.”

Haigh is the master of compassionate relationship dramas, having explored a one-night stand in “Weekend,” a long-term marriage in “45 Years,” a group of gay friends on HBO’s “Looking,” and, now, a teenager and his equestrian companion in “Lean on Pete,” based on the novel of the same name by Willy Vlautin. It’s Charley’s desperate need to be kind, and to receive kindness from others, that grounds this particular relationship and separates him from the average teen boy. Whereas most kids his age are striving to master schoolyard politics or sibling rivalry, Charley is trying to conquer the oppressive ugliness of the world around him, hoping that relatives in nearby Wyoming will provide the stability he lacks.

“What do you do in your life if you don’t have support from your loved ones?” Haigh said. “Or you don’t have support from the society around you? It felt like it was something more important, almost, than just questions of identity. It was about something like, how do you survive in the world if you don’t have a framework?”

Charley’s journey makes for a magnificent travelogue in which none of the travel is glamorous. With a parting shot that evokes “The 400 Blows,” this is one of the year’s best movies to date. Another recent release, “Ready Player One,” centered on an orphan in an ugly world, but its virtual-reality bedlam lacked humanity. “Lean on Pete” more than makes up for it, sending its hero ― Plummer’s performance is a wonder; a true star is born ― on an expedition through the great Northwestern outdoors that ends with an introspective discovery. Bring tissues; you’ll need a bunch.





“Where Is Kyra?”

For fans of “Klute,” “99 Homes” and Gena Rowlands movies

Written by Darci Picoult • Directed by Andrew Dosunmu

Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Kiefer Sutherland, Suzanne Shepherd and Sam Robards

Great Point Media/Paladin Film

“Some people say it almost feels like a horror film,” Darci Picoult, the writer of “Where Is Kyra?,” said. “It becomes this terrorizing psychological deterioration.”

Those horror trappings are evident in Picoult’s sparse script, but they’re largely owed to Andrew Dosunmu’s shadowy direction. Working with Oscar-nominated cinematographer Bradford Young (“Selma,” “Arrival”), Dosunmu shades Michelle Pfeiffer’s titular Brooklynite with fuzzy grays and anesthetized blues. Laid off from her job and cashing her late mother’s pension checks for income, Kyra is often framed from a distance, the atrophy she’s facing as she nears senior citizenship foregrounded to reveal a genre of poverty rarely explored in popular culture.

Picoult wrote “Where Is Kyra?” in 2013, surveying the aftereffects of the late 2000s’ economic crisis. She first set the movie in Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy that same summer. But Picoult and Dosunmu, who also collaborated on the Nigerian drama “Mother of George,” relocated the backdrop to New York, where the glaring disparity between haves and have-nots underscores everyday economic strife. What is a middle-aged woman to do when she finds herself unemployed and undesirable, reduced to placing advertisements on vehicles’ windshields and being turned down for gigs at fast-food restaurants in favor of younger candidates?

“I always envisioned Kyra being someone who, if you will, had a life that had promise, someone who believed things were going to work out,” Picoult said. “And then, when they don’t, it becomes even more disparaging because she’s holding on, hoping for something better that doesn’t happen.“

Pfeiffer, who made something of a comeback last year with “mother!” and “Murder on the Orient Express,” has found one of the richest roles of her career, looking more desperate with each rejection and more weathered with each dignity-shattering wakeup. Kyra’s corner of the world struggles to blossom into anything sunnier; farther and farther she drifts down the rabbit hole of anguish, Pfeiffer’s oceanic eyes absorbing every psychic bruise.





“You Were Never Really Here”

For fans of “Taxi Driver,” “Good Time” and “Drive”

Written and directed by Lynne Ramsay

Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Judith Roberts, Frank Pando, Ekaterina Samsonov, Alessandro Nivola and Alex Manette

Amazon Studios

“You Were Never Really Here” demands to be seen twice: once to absorb its ethereal grime, and another to peek more clearly into its protagonist’s fractured mind. As Joe, a contract killer (and PTSD-addled war veteran) paid to extricate young girls from corruption, Joaquin Phoenix dances with the camera, angling through the New York streets, slipping between past and present, reality and hallucination. Joe is purposefully elusive, a design that is at once frustrating and hypnotic.

“I thought I was making an action movie, but it also became a character study,” Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, who adapted Jonathan Ames’ novella of the same name, said. “I think I just gravitated to the inner workings of the character.”

Those inner workings are bleak: At home, where he cares for his ailing mother (Judith Roberts), Joe sometimes covers his head with a plastic bag, wondering what would happen if he finally ended it all. Outside, he seems as likely to take a gun to his own head as he does to avenge the brutes holding innocent preteens hostage. But that’s familiar territory for Ramsay, who treats grief and death as leitmotifs (her other credits include “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” “Morvern Callar” and “Ratcatcher”). What makes “You Were Never Really Here” powerful is its ability to place us next to Joe, psychologically and physically, as he flits between avenger and avoider. Think Travis Bickle with a splash of the adrenaline-pumping “Good Time.” The movie telegraphs a woozy paranoia, aided by another stirring score from Jonny Greenwood, who composed the music for “We Need to Talk About Kevin” and last year’s “Phantom Thread.”

For Phoenix, the role encouraged a certain visceral improvisation. “We would make decisions in the moment, and sometimes there are things I’m reacting to in the moment,” he said. “There are times when other actors didn’t know what was going to happen because we didn’t know what was going to happen in that moment. And I think I probably like that way of working in general, but I think it was probably really applicable to that character and this experience.”A coin released by the White House to celebrate a planned U.S.-North Korea summit.

UPDATE: May 24 ― President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled his scheduled peace summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, citing the dictator’s “tremendous anger and open hostility.”

PREVIOUSLY:

A commemorative coin released by the White House is drawing ire over its depiction of President Donald Trump face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

The flashy coin, known as a challenge coin, shows the two men’s portly profiles with the words “Peace talks” above them. Both men’s names are printed along the coin’s border, with Kim referred to as “Supreme Leader” ― a title that the U.S. government is not known to use.

The coin was released to memorialize the pair’s planned peace summit — which, as of this week, may not happen.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders waved off questions about the coin during a press briefing on Tuesday, saying the White House Communications Agency, a special military unit that provides support to the president and his staff, is the organization responsible for its design. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.

In addition to the status of the two leaders’ announced June 12 meeting in Singapore being up in the air as of this week, critics are expressing concern over Kim’s being given such a prestigious recognition while sharing a platform with the U.S. president.

In addition to torturing and causing the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, North Korea is widely known for human rights abuses against its people and foreigners. It has threatened to wage a nuclear attack on the U.S. and South Korea. It most recently refused to dismantle its nuclear arsenal unless it first sees some benefits.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is among those urging Kim’s removal from the coin.

I urge the White House to take Kim off the coin. Challenge coins are a time honored tradition and certainly appropriate in this situation, but Kim Jong Un’s face has no place on this coin.

“Challenge coins are a time honored tradition and certainly appropriate in this situation, but Kim Jong Un’s face has no place on this coin. He is a brutal dictator and something like the Peace House would be much more appropriate,” Schumer tweeted.

The Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, has been proposed by Trump as a meeting place for the men. It’s where Kim met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month.

Robert E. Kelly, a political analyst on Korean international affairs and a professor at South Korea’s Pusan National University, also decried the design on Twitter, calling it “gross” and “un-American.”

Are you kidding me?! This is just gross. Whose personality cult exactly is this summit legitimizing? This is un-American. Can’t imagine what Fox would say if any other POTUS did this. Wow. Just wow. https://t.co/rn79W4RWO9 via @voxdotcom — Robert E Kelly (@Robert_E_Kelly) May 22, 2018

Others on social media raised eyebrows over both men’s physical depictions. Trump’s jawline appears much more defined than it typically appears, while Kim has noticeable rolls under his chin.

As far as their relationship goes, placing the two men’s faces side by side appears to blanket over what has been a pretty volatile relationship.In Tuesday’s storyline, Becky (Lecy Goranson) learned her chances of getting pregnant were slim after a visit to the doctor. She later remarked to Darlene (Sara Gilbert) that she and Mark had been trying to conceive and that she hadn’t been able to “find anyone as good” since he died. Darlene then tried to persuade her to move on, explaining that it wasn’t a betrayal to Mark.Calum Scott released his debut album, “Only Human,” March 9. Frank Ockenfels

Calum Scott’s success in the music industry has caught just about everyone off guard ― including Calum Scott himself.

The “Britain’s Got Talent” veteran catapulted to global fame in 2016 with a silky, piano-driven cover of Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own,” which has received over 259 million views on YouTube and surpassed the original on the charts. Scott, who had been working a 9-to-5 human resources job in his native England before landing a spot on “Britain’s Got Talent” a year prior, was suddenly recognized across Europe. A pair of live performances on “Good Morning America” and “Late Night with Seth Myers” got the U.S. to take notice, too.

The search for success beyond a novelty hit has, of course, thwarted many would-be stars. But Scott puts doubts about the dexterity of his musical chops to rest with his full-length debut album, “Only Human.” Released March 9, it’s well-produced and sonically cohesive, showcasing the rich, unaffected vocals that garnered Scott worldwide acclaim.

“Dancing on My Own” is there, of course, as is the sterling kickoff single, “You Are the Reason,” which is one of 11 original songs. The album is at its most compelling, however, when Scott delves into surprisingly personal territory, reflecting on life, love and his journey toward living authentically as a gay man.

Check out the video for “You Are the Reason” below.

“In the past two years, I’ve kind of been finding my feet as an artist because I was catapulted into the limelight, and it was quite difficult for me to come to terms with that at first,” the 29-year-old told HuffPost. “The creative process has been a little bit of an experience, really ― to try and make that work for me. The only way I know how to do that is just to remain genuine, humble and true to everything I know already in my life.”

Unlike other queer artists like Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko, Scott said he had yet to fully come to terms with his sexuality when “Dancing on My Own” became a hit, and he shied away initially from speaking about his private life in the media. Coming out as gay “terrified me to the core,” he said in a previous interview, particularly when it came to his father, Kevin, from whom he’d been mostly estranged since age 2.

That struggle informs a number of the album’s tunes, including “If Our Love Is Wrong,” which Scott has deemed his “coming out” song. Meanwhile, “Hotel Room” could very well be a first in mainstream pop as a love song inspired by a gay man’s unrequited feelings for a straight man. (In Scott’s case, it happened to be someone he met while on tour in Asia.)

“I’m a very sensitive bloke, and I wrote [‘Hotel Room’] as a very honest, heartbroken guy,” Scott said. “I’m kind of unlucky in love and I have, for some reason, always fallen for the straight guy. I don’t know if it’s some cruel irony, [but] I think it’s because I see the good in everybody and I fall in love very deeply and quickly.”

Scott said he’d ultimately like to “inspire bravery, strength and courage” among his fans, whether they identify as LGBTQ or not. Newspix via Getty Images

Fortunately, “Only Human” isn’t mired in melancholy. As its title suggests, “Rhythm Inside” is an uptempo dance track, while rumored second single “What I Miss Most” is a rocking ode to Scott’s hometown of Kingston upon Hull, England.

If anything, those moments of pure optimism may be more indicative of Scott’s current mindset. As the inaugural performer at the Gay Times Intimate & Live series at the London Hippodrome last month, he addressed his audience as “a happy, confident gay man.” The moment, he said, “felt so empowering and so good.”

Preparing to kick off a European tour in Ireland Thursday, the singer said he’s learning to have more fun with his image, too. He peeled off his shirt for a sexy Gay Times photo shoot and headlined at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia.

Scott’s piano-driven melodies and inward-thinking persona have already been compared to another openly gay British crooner, Sam Smith. The two share a piano player, Reuben James, as well as a producer, Fraser T. Smith, and have struck up a friendship. “I love what he does. I love his music and his drive,” Scott said of the Grammy winner.

“[My album] is all about the fact that we’re one human race and we can’t help how we feel, we can’t help who we fall in love with. Just celebrate who you are and be happy with you are.” - Calum Scott

He’s hopeful a collaboration with the “Stay With Me” singer will one day be in his future, too. “Two gay guys doing a beautiful duet ― I think it would just be so powerful, you know. I think the blend of us together would really work,” he said. “We’ve always thought it would lovely to do a duet with two male voices [but] I suppose the best things happen when they’re unexpected. So we’ll see. I have my fingers crossed.”

Like Smith, Scott would ultimately like to “inspire bravery, strength and courage” among his fans, whether they identify as LGBTQ or not. If there’s an overriding message to be found on “Only Human,” it’s that “all will happen in your own time,” he said.Trans model Leyna Bloom posted on Twitter over the weekend to pursue her latest goal: She’s trying to be the first trans model of color ― or of any race ― to appear in a Victoria’s Secret fashion show.

And the tweet took off like wildfire; it currently has over 15,000 retweets.

Bloom has been professionally modeling since 2014, appearing in major runway shows and making history on magazine covers (she was featured in Vogue India last year).

But she told Yahoo Lifestyle that Victoria’s Secret was her “dream” company to work with.

“It’s always been a dream for me, like so many others, not just trans — POC, all women, and some men even,” she told the publication. “This is a platform that glorifies femininity. I always felt in my most natural state I am heavenly. For my trans sisters, regardless of color, this will be a moment for us all.”

Bloom’s campaign has continued to gather steam, with many supporters tweeting their well-wishes:

As for trans models, Bloom isn’t the first to make moves for the runway. In 2013, a Change.org petition asked Victoria’s Secret to make Carmen Carrera the first transgender model for the brand. Launched by a former “RuPaul’s Drag Race” contestant, Marco Regalado, the campaign hoped that Carrera’s appearance on the runway would open the brand’s doors to “ALL types of women.”

“To see a transgender model walk would show that trans women are to be taken seriously and that Angels are selected because of their character and talent,” he wrote. “As a brand, Victoria’s Secret should feel comfortable marketing towards ALL types of women.”

For Carrera’s part, she seemed open to the idea, but nothing ever came of it. Five years later, we still haven’t had a trans woman walk in the show. Perhaps Bloom’s endeavor will be more successful.

AdvertisementA fresh coat of paint, new parking signs and crowd barriers outside the private wing of London’s St. Mary’s Hospital can only mean one thing: The next royal baby will soon be making its big debut.

The no-parking signs are in effect from Monday through the end of the month, so Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, could give birth any day.

Her 4-year-old son, Prince George, and his little sister, Princess Charlotte, 2, were both born in the same wing of the hospital. So was her husband, Prince William.

The former Kate Middleton will be cared for by a medical team led by Dr. Guy Thorpe-Beeston and Dr. Alan Farthing, People reports. They were also in charge when baby Charlotte was born almost three years ago.

“They have had two very positive experiences at the Lindo Wing so it’s the No. 1 choice,” a source told Vanity Fair. “She knows the team and she feels like she’s in very safe hands.”

No one knows the gender of Baby Three, not even the babe’s parents, who opted to be surprised.

The baby will be fifth in line to inherit the crown after Charles, William, George and Charlotte (Prince Harry will move down to sixth place). It’s a historic birth for Charlotte, who won’t be bumped down the line regardless of the gender of her next sibling. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013, passed when Kate was pregnant with George, states that succession to the throne is now wholly based on birth order, not gender.

Reporters will be informed when Kate begins labor, and they’ll then be allowed to set up their cameras outside the hospital. Accommodations in the private wing are luxe, with a “yummy” daily menu, one mom who gave birth there told Us magazine.

Bookies are taking bets on the big day — and possible baby names. As of Monday, the top picks for girls with bookmaker William Hill were Mary (3-1), Alice (6-1) and Victoria (8-1), The Evening Standard reported. Choices for boys were generally running neck-and-neck for Albert, Arthur and Fred.

“This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone,” Christine Blanshard, medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, said Tuesday at a news conference.

Blanshard said the team of doctors worked to stabilize Skripal and her father to ensure proper blood circulation. She described how a nerve agent attacks the body, with symptoms that include sickness and hallucinations.

“We then needed to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients until they could create more enzymes to replace those affected by the poisoning,” Blanshard said.

Skripal’s father, Sergei V. Skripal, was taking longer to recover. Blanshard said she expects to discharge him from the hospital “in due course.”

The Russian embassy in the U.K. congratulated Skripal on her recovery, but said it needed proof that “what is being done to her is done on her own free will.”

We congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery. Yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will. — Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) April 10, 2018

The discovery of Skripal and her father slumped over on a park bench last month has sparked a diplomatic blowup between Russia and Western countries. The U.K., backed by many of its allies, was quick to blame Moscow for the attack. The nerve agent used to poison the Skripals, Novichok, was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1980s.

Russia forcefully denied any involvement in the poisoning, prompting the U.K. to expel 23 Russian diplomats. Two dozen more countries, including the U.S., Australia, Canada and a handful of European nations, followed suit and kicked out more than 100 diplomats. The Kremlin retaliated and carried out its own expulsions.A man in Ashoro, Japan, is being honored with an award that’s been a long time coming: Being recognized as the world’s oldest living male.

Masazo Nonaka, who was 112 years and 259 days as of April 10, has just officially been selected as the world’s oldest living male, according to Guinness World Records.

Nonaka replaces Francisco Nuñez Olivera of Spain, who was 113 when he died in January.

In his youth, Nonaka worked as a farmer and a lumberjack before running a hot springs inn that is still in the family.

He also raised two sons and three daughters with his wife, Hatsuno.

Nonaka’s granddaughter, Yuko Nonaka, said her grandfather credits his long life to sugar.

“He needs a wheelchair to move, but he is in good condition. He loves eating any kinds of sweets ― Japanese or Western style,” she said, according to The Telegraph. “He reads newspapers every day and often soaks in the hot springs.”

Nonaka had a sweet time accepting the age-old honor, mainly because he was served a cake, to which he responded, “Yum,” according to Guinness.

Kyodo via ReutersAs the world watches the thousands-strong demonstrations at Gaza’s border with Israel, images and videos that have emerged since the protests began have sparked fresh debate about Israel’s use of force against Palestinians.

The latest alarming video, making the rounds on Monday, appears to show a Palestinian man standing still on the Gaza side of the security fence that divides the territory from Israel. Behind the camera, Israeli soldiers can be heard discussing shooting the man. After the sound of a gunshot, he falls to the ground.

“Wow, what a video. Yes! Son of a bitch! What a video,” one of the voices cheers in Hebrew, according to a Reuters translation of the comments.

The video has been widely featured in news outlets in Israel and worldwide, with politicians across the Israeli political spectrum condemning it, the Times of Israel reported.

It was not initially clear when or where the video was taken, but it drew attention after 10 days of protests in Gaza, during which some 30 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces.

The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that the video appeared to have been taken months ago and on Tuesday confirmed that it was from December 2017, when other protests had erupted in Gaza, Haaretz reported. After a preliminary inquiry, the military cleared the shooter, saying he acted after other steps had been taken to warn the man away from the security fence. They said the man was shot in the leg.

“The sniper deserves an honor and the cameraman a demerit,” Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Tuesday at an event in northern Israel, according to the Times of Israel.

When the specifics of the video were still unclear, human rights groups said it showed just one instance among many of Israeli forces using undue lethal force against Palestinian protesters.

“Incidents such as the one in the video published [Monday] occurred hundreds of times over the past few weeks in the Gaza Strip, causing death and injuries — with the full support of policymakers and top military officials,” Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said in a statement.

Other images and videos have emerged over the last dozen days depicting Palestinians shot by the Israeli military during the current protests, driving a fierce discussion over the military’s response to unarmed demonstrators. One video appeared to show an unarmed protester being shot. Other photos captured a Palestinian journalist after he was shot while covering the unrest.

Warning: The photo below is graphic and may be disturbing to some readers.

Since March 30, tens of thousands of Palestinians have participated in protests along the fence that separates Gaza from Israel. Held under the name “The Great March of Return,” the protests are meant to last until Nakba Day on May 15, when Palestinians commemorate the displacement of their people during the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.

In addition to the at least 30 Palestinians who have been killed by the Israeli military, hundreds more have been wounded during the demonstrations. Israel’s response to the protests has drawn international concern, with the European Union stating Saturday that there were “serious questions about the proportionate use of force.” Human rights groups have called out the Israeli military’s use of gunfire against Palestinian demonstrators “who posed no imminent threat to life.”

On Sunday, the Israeli military said it was launching an investigation into its response to the protests, Haaretz reported.

In one of the first videos to emerge from the protests ― posted to YouTube on March 31 ― a young man was shown apparently carrying a tire and running away from the fence on Gaza’s border when he suddenly collapsed. The person shot and killed was 19-year-old Abdul Fattah Abdul Nabi, his family told The Washington Post.

“He had no gun, no Molotov, a tire. Does that harm the Israelis, a tire?” Abdul Nabi’s brother Mohamed, 22, told the Post. “He wasn’t going toward the Israeli side. He was running away.”

Over the past weekend, other images circulated on social media and in news outlets worldwide showing Palestinian journalist and photographer Yasser Murtaja wounded after being shot by Israeli forces in Friday’s demonstrations. He eventually died. In the photos, Murtaja can be seen lying on a stretcher, with the word “PRESS” written in large print across his vest.

The Israel military said it was looking into that incident. On Tuesday, Israel’s defense chief claimed that Murtaja was a paid member of Hamas ― the militant group that controls Gaza and that the U.S. considers a terrorist group ― but offered no proof. The media group that Murtaja co-founded, Ain Media, had recently received a grant from the U.S. government and had been strictly vetted, The Associated Press reported.The head of the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is supposed to be a bank watchdog, announced Monday: “I like banks.”

Former banker Joseph Otting told a gathering in Washington, D.C., of the Independent Community of Bankers of America that he intended to “improve our responsiveness to our customers, which are the banks,” Bloomberg reported.

He also assured his audience that the Trump administration is “very bank supportive.”

The head of the bankers’ gathering deemed Otting’s address “refreshing,” according to Bloomberg.

Otting is charged with keeping tabs on about 1,000 banks across the country to make sure they don’t pull the same stunts that triggered a worldwide financial crisis in 2008. The OCC helped changed laws in the wake of the crisis to more closely regulate banks.

Otting was working as a banking executive during the mounting subprime lending debacle years at U.S. Bancorp and OneWest Bank, where he was CEO. OneWest came under heavy criticism for how it handled foreclosures after the subprime crisis. Because of a federal finding of “deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices,” the bank operated under a federally supervised four-year consent order beginning in 2011 while Otting was CEO.

Rather than policing banks, Otting promised bankers at Monday’s meeting that he’ll be working to ease rules, including relaxing Bank Secrecy Act compliance by making anti-money-laundering regulations more flexible, and “de-centralizing” bank supervision, according to Bloomber.g

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) slammed Otting during his confirmation hearings last year. The Trump administration is “putting the banking industry back in charge of policing itself,” he tweeted. Otting “is yet another bank exec who profited off the financial crisis who is being rewarded by the Trump Administration.”WASHINGTON ― Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on Tuesday called out Republican leaders for their “lack of urgency or action” on combating sexual misconduct at job sites, asking her GOP counterpart on the committee that oversees workplace issues to hold a hearing on the matter.

Murray, the top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, made her request to the panel’s chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). She also reminded her colleagues that they have yet to pass a bill that would reform policies on sexual harassment at their own workplace, Capitol Hill.

Last month, all of the Senate’s female members ― from both parties ― signed a letter urging their leaders to take up the legislation, a version of which the House has already approved.

“I’m very proud that the female senators on both sides of the aisle here are taking this issue seriously,” Murray said at the start of the committee’s Tuesday hearing. “However, it has been really unfortunate to see a lack of urgency or action from Republican leaders here in Congress.”

“Members of this committee have yet to hear on when we will be able to hear from women and men, on how harassment has impacted their lives at their jobs and beyond,” she told Alexander. “I think scheduling this hearing will make it clear this is an issue this committee takes seriously and is focused on. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, you will work with us, so we can get that scheduled.”

Alexander did not directly respond to Murray’s request, instead asking her and Democratic leaders to not hold up President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

“That would be one way to deal with the urgency of the need for civil rights,” he said.

Alexander’s office did not immediately return a request for further comment on whether the hearing would occur.

Senate Democrats asked for the HELP hearing back in January, part of a number of proposed measures to reform sexual misconduct policies, catalyzed by the Me Too movement.

Lawmakers have introduced several bills, many with bipartisan support, to address aspects of workplace sexual harassment, such as banning legal mechanisms often used to silence accusers. But the measures have yet to advance.

The Senate’s bill to improve its own practices for handling sexual harassment claims has stalled, reportedly due to concerns from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over the extent to which lawmakers should foot the bill for settlement payments. McConnell’s office has denied the charge.

Murray has also sought to spotlight sexual harassment in lower-wage workplaces. Earlier this year, she requested information from leaders in the hotel, restaurant and retail industries, asking whether they have taken steps in response to the Me Too movement.

“Although we are seeing headlines about powerful and famous people being called to account for their actions, we are seeing far less action in industries outside of the spotlight,” she wrote. “Therefore, I hope and expect that you are taking steps to address concerns about misconduct in your industry and to ensure your members’ workplaces are free from harassment.”Marcia “Cia” Price is 37 years old and has more than $90,000 in outstanding student loan debt — more than what she originally owed. Like many indebted former students, Price has had her share of frustrations in trying to navigate the loan repayment thicket, especially during earlier days when she didn’t make a lot of money and needed help restructuring her loan.

She’s not alone. The U.S. government says a combined 43 million people owe more than $1.3 trillion in student loans. About 4.6 million people were in default at the end of last year.

But Price is unusual in one respect: As a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, she’s in a position to help.

Price, along with several other representatives in Virginia, sponsored legislation this year that establishes a state student loan ombudsman. The new office is intended to be an advocate for borrowers, helping them to ease their repayment burden by renegotiating loan terms, asking servicers for permission to delay payments, and helping borrowers transition into careers where loan forgiveness is an option. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed the legislation into law last week.

The state action to assist student borrowers comes even as the Trump administration has warned that regulating loan servicers is a federal responsibility.

Last month, the U.S. Department of Education published a notice in the Federal Register saying that “State regulation of the servicing of Direct Loans impedes uniquely Federal interests” and that “a requirement that Federal student loan servicers comply with 50 different State-level regulatory regimes would significantly undermine the purpose of the Direct Loan Program to establish a uniform, streamlined, and simplified lending program managed at the Federal level.”

Since 2015, at least five states have enacted a student loan “bill of rights” or created an ombudsman or something similar, according to Higher Ed Not Debt, a coalition of unions and other liberal groups seeking action on the student debt issue.

California’s law is the most sweeping, calling for special licensing of student loan servicers and tighter regulation. Several more states could follow Virginia in enacting bills this year. Virginia’s ombudsman will be able to resolve disputes and work with borrowers to understand their rights.

Washington became the first state this year to enact bill of rights legislation, which calls for an “advocate” and licensing of loan servicers. Connecticut (in 2015), California (2016), and Illinois and the District of Columbia (2017) have enacted similar laws.

“I have a personal interest in making sure that people with student loans in Virginia have an opportunity to pay back their loans and protect their and their family’s financial security,” said Price, who has a bachelor’s degree from Spelman College and a master’s from Howard University.

“Paying for education should not make someone go broke,” she said. “I have more than $90,000 in student loan debt. I know some of the struggles that go with it. I did experience some of the unfair practices of the student loan services.”

After college and graduate school, Price said, she got a clerical job in a dentist’s office and a community organizing post. Neither job paid much, but she kept up with her $75,000 in loans until a car accident landed her in the hospital and made it impossible for her to work for a time. Her loan servicing company agreed to allow her to postpone her loan payments, but she didn’t realize that the delay was adding to the total of what she owed.

She blames herself for not asking the right questions, but says that all she could think about in her pain and joblessness was putting payments off, not the repercussions.

An ombudsman, she thinks, would have explained her options better and perhaps come up with some less costly alternatives because he or she wouldn’t be “trying to make money off my call.”

Loan servicing industry representatives say that it’s not their fault that the rules and refinancing options on student loans are complicated. It’s the fault of the federal government, which makes most of the loans.

Winfield Crigler, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a trade association for student loan servicers, said her organization has no problem with “state ombudsmen as a trusted third party that the state can offer its residents.” Their problem, she said, is with bills that would set up borrowers “rights” that might differ from state to state. (The group recently sued the District of Columbia over its licensing and disclosure regulations for student loan servicers.)

Virginia recently defeated bill of rights legislation, which was separate from the ombudsman bill, but Price says she’ll be back next year with a similar measure that would also establish licensing criteria for student loan servicers.

The trade association argues that the federal government already regulates loan servicers, and that the problem is that many borrowers in danger of default don’t respond to the service companies’ attempts to offer them refinancing options and other payment plans.

In testimony to the Virginia Legislature, Crigler said: “Student loans are very complex already and SLSA is concerned that imposing multiple state licensing and regulatory requirements will create a patchwork of conflicting rules that will cause borrower confusion.”

Alexandria Wheeler, 28, of Hampton, Virginia, is already confused. She was among those who testified to the Legislature about her nightmare loan scenario. She suddenly found that her $20,000 balance had doubled to $40,000, even though she said she and her parents had been making interest payments. She said her loan servicer, Navient, hasn’t explained the increase.

“I just want the paperwork so I can match it up,” said Wheeler, who works as a community organizer for New Virginia Majority, a nonprofit where Price once worked. Price said the two are acquainted, but she did not ask Wheeler to testify.
