Taxes are due on April 17 this year, giving you a little extra time to get yours done.

Whatever you’re paying in taxes, there’s a good chance it’s at a higher rate than corporate America, John Oliver pointed out on Sunday’s “Last Week Tonight.”

Last year’s tax cuts didn’t change that. In fact, Oliver said, they made it worse.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new national security aide to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence stepped down on Sunday, only two days after being officially named to the job, after a behind-the-scenes White House argument hit the headlines, a White House official said.

The appointment of Jon Lerner to Pence’s team was one of the more short-lived personnel moves in a White House known for turbulent staff turnover and infighting, and the first to envelope the vice president, who works hard to stay out of the drama.

Pence’s office had announced on Friday that Jon Lerner, a senior aide to United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, would become Pence’s top adviser on foreign policy issues. By Sunday night, the vice president’s office had issued a second statement that Lerner had withdrawn.

The issue boiled over on Friday, when Pence and his senior staff were on an eight-hour flight to Peru to attend the Summit of the Americas.

President Donald Trump had been become upset, the White House official said, when he was told in error that Lerner was a so-called “Never Trumper” - a term that describes anti-Trump Republicans.

Lerner had backed Republican Senator Marco Rubio during the primary race to pick the party’s candidate ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Pence phoned Trump and cleared up the tension, the official said. But the short-lived drama became public on Sunday in a report by Axios which said that Trump had initially told his chief of staff John Kelly to ax the appointment and questioned why Pence would have made the pick.

Lerner then offered to withdraw on Sunday night “to minimize the amount of conflict and internal drama,” the White House official said, and Pence decided it was the best option.

Lerner will continue working for Haley, the official said.When Fox News anchor Shepard Smith reported that President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen has also represented his colleague Sean Hannity, he briefly alluded to the awkwardness of Monday’s big news story.

“Of course, for us, the elephant in the room at the moment is that Sean Hannity is said to have, according to court documents, been a third client of Michael Cohen,” Smith said.

Hannity was furious over last week’s news that the FBI had raided Cohen’s office and hotel room as part of an investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. He did not disclose at the time that he’d had his own legal dealings with Cohen.

Smith read Hannity’s statement to The Wall Street Journal on Monday acknowledging that he and Cohen “have been friends a long time” and that “I have sought legal advice from Michael.”

Smith promised his viewers he’d get to the bottom of the story right away, pointing out that “a lot of people” at the network know Hannity’s number. “We’ll get on that,” he added.

When Smith came back from commercial, he explained Hannity’s relationship with Cohen a little more:

“You may have heard a little while ago from court proceedings there were three people that Michael Cohen did legal work for. The President of the United States, one other and the third. The third is said to be Sean Hannity. He’s on the air, on the radio right now. We spoke with his publicist here at Fox News, who says that he says they have been friends a long time. He never denied he was his lawyer. That he did some legal work for him along the way. And that’s the extent of that.”

However, Hannity went on Twitter a short time later and denied that he ever retained Cohen as a lawyer.

Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 16, 2018

Hannity may not have issued the denial to purposely contradict Smith, but the two have had a rivalry.

Last month, Hannity ripped Smith for saying that people working on Fox News “opinion” programs say whatever they want and provide “entertainment,” not news.

The evening marked the country giant’s first public performance since she broke her wrist and injured her face in a November fall outside her home.

But when Underwood took the stage Sunday in Las Vegas, much of the speculation seemed to fade.

Country music was just happy to see her killing it on stage again.

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign this year has been paying the Beverly Hills lawyer handling his lawsuit against an adult film actress – complicating his supporters’ claims that the original $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels had nothing do with the 2016 election.

The campaign paid Charles Harder’s firm $25,000 on Jan. 4, and then $68,181.25 on Feb. 22, according to the campaign’s quarterly filing Sunday with the Federal Election Commission.

It is unclear how much of that, if any, is related to Trump’s continued efforts to keep Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, from discussing the affair she said they had in 2006. Neither Harder nor the Trump campaign responded to several requests for comment.

One Republican close to Trump said he can understand the logic of treating the original nondisclosure agreement Clifford signed one way and the efforts to enforce it the opposite way.

“I can see as how they could construe it as a re-election issue. And I can see how they would construe the NDA as not an election issue,” he said on the condition of anonymity. “But I’m not so sanguine about the believability of that.”

Paul Ryan, a lawyer for the group Common Cause, which has filed complaints against Trump and his campaign with the FEC and the Department of Justice, said the payments could have been for other work Harder has done for Trump, including an attempt to stop the publication of the book “Fire and Fury,” an unflattering portrait of the first year of Trump’s presidency.

Harder also represented Trump’s wife, Melania, in defamation lawsuits against a British tabloid and a Maryland blogger who published stories alleging that she had once been an escort. Those cases, though, were settled in Melania Trump’s favor in early 2017 – meaning it’s unlikely that Harder was still collecting bills for them a year later, Ryan said.

He said campaigns are prohibited from spending money that benefits a candidate personally, but that expenses that would not exist if the person were not a candidate or officeholder are generally allowable.

Paying a lawyer to block the release of an embarrassing book would likely be permitted under that standard, Ryan said.

As to the situation with Clifford, Ryan said he could also envision a scenario where continuing litigation against her is considered campaign-related even if the original payment to buy her silence is not.

“At the end of the day, we don’t know,” he said. “Who knows what this guy was doing for them?”

Michael Avenatti, Clifford’s lawyer who has accused Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen of violating campaign finance law with the $130,000 “hush agreement” just days before the election, said he did not want to speculate about the Trump campaign’s payments to Harder.

“It is too early to jump to conclusions as to the purpose of those payments,” he said. “They may well relate to a legal matter other than Ms. Clifford.”

Ryan said it was puzzling why someone who boasts about his wealth as frequently as Trump does would invite such questions by not simply paying Harder himself. “At the 35,000 foot-level, it’s a question of optics, of perceptions,” he said.We now know an acting gig for which Emilia Clarke is eminently unqualified: Wookiee impressionist.Former FBI Director James Comey gave a no-holds-barred interview on Sunday night in which he called Donald Trump “morally unfit to be president” and a liar who possibly obstructed justice.

Comey, speaking to ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, touched on many of the scandals that have plagued the Trump administration over the past 16 months, including the Russia dossier and the litany of sexual misconduct allegations leveled at the president.

“A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds,” Comey said.

Highlights from the interview include: Trump may be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. “I think it’s possible. I don’t know. These are more words I never thought I’d utter about a president of the United States, but it’s possible.”

The president “treats women like they’re pieces of meat.”

In regards to Trump asking Comey to drop his investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, there was “certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice.”

Comey said Trump was “of above average intelligence who’s tracking conversations and knows what’s going on.”

“I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president. I think he’s morally unfit to be president.”

He said Trump “will stain everyone around him. And the question is, how much stain is too much stain...”

Trump was obsessed with disproving allegations that he paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel room. Comey recalled the president asking “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?”

The interview comes just days before the release of his highly anticipated book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, which has already sold close to 200,000 copies.

As the interview continued, Comey appeared to have no fondness for the man who fired him last May.

“The challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him,” he told Stephanopoulos. “And the question is, how much stain is too much stain and how much stain eventually makes you unable to accomplish your goal of protecting the country and serving the country?”

The former FBI director said, however, he’d still be working for the government had he not been removed. “I was dreading it,” Comey said, noting he’d be “an unhappy F.B.I. director, but in a way proud of the organization and in my role in trying to protect it.”

“The challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him,” Comey said in the interview which aired Sunday. ABC News via Getty Images

Comey also recounted his conversation with Trump in which he said the president asked him to drop an investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has denied doing so and threatened to release “tapes” of the conversation to prove so.

Comey reiterated that he hoped such tapes existed and said the secretive nature of the meeting might imply Trump knew he was flouting convention. “If he didn’t know he was doing something improper, why did he kick out the attorney general and the vice president of the United States and the leaders of the intelligence community? I mean, why am I alone?”

“I’d be a crazy person to make it up,” he continued.

Stephanopoulos also asked if Comey believed the president obstructed justice, to which he replied: “Possibly.”

“I mean, it’s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend and ― and I’m just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor ― it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent.”

Among the more salacious topics during the interview focused on the infamous Steele dossier that was compiled by a former British spy and alleged that footage exists of Trump watching prostitutes urinating in a Moscow hotel suite. Comey informed Trump about the allegations in private before his inauguration several times, and he writes in his book that Trump was obsessed with disproving them.

On Sunday, he said he was unsure if the rumors were true, but said they left the president open to blackmail by the Russian government.

“I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the ― the ― current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013,” Comey said. “It’s possible, but I don’t know.”

Stephanopoulos also asked if he thought Russia had “something” on the president.

“I think it’s possible,” he said. “I don’t know. These are more words I never thought I’d utter about a president of the United States, but it’s possible.”

The interview prompted immediate reactions from Republican leadership.

“James Comey’s publicity tour reaffirms that his true higher loyalty is to himself,” Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. “The only thing worse than Comey’s history of misconduct is his willingness to say anything to sell books. He has no credibility and President Trump was right to follow through on the bipartisan calls for him to be fired.”

As the reviews on Comey’s tell-all began to pour in, Trump immediately fired back on Twitter, calling the man an “untruthful slimeball” and intimating that he should be jailed for his actions at the helm of the FBI. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said Comey would “be forever known as a disgraced partisan hack that broke his sacred trust with the president of the United States.”

Trump unleashed another wave of fury on Twitter early Sunday, just hours before the ABC interview was set to air, accusing the former FBI chief of pushing “many lies” and predicting Comey would go down as the “WORST FBI Director in history, by far!”

I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018

Comey responded to the tweets with a message of his own, saying his book was “about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others.”

He continued: “3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint.”Conan O’Brien seems energized enough without downing shots of espresso but when in Italy, do as the Italians do.

A federal judge on Monday denied a request to allow the president and his longtime attorney Michael Cohen a first crack at viewing the documents seized from Cohen in FBI raids last week, before prosecutors can sift through the haul. But she also said she wasn’t ready yet to rule on who would eventually get to decide what materials might stay confidential.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said she may appoint someone as an impartial “special master” to mediate any review of the documents, according to The New York Times. Cohen’s attorneys and those of the government can submit proposals for a special master by Tuesday. But she added that to address concerns about “fairness” raised by Trump and Cohen’s attorneys, “a special master might have a role here. Maybe not the complete role, but some role.“

Wood also ordered prosecutors to provide copies of the seized material to Cohen’s legal team when they are viewed and expressed her desire in “getting this moving,” according to Bloomberg. She said she trusted independent federal attorneys to sift through the material and determine what is admissible in court.

The FBI raided Cohen’s office, home and hotel room last week and seized a bevy of materials, including documents related to a hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump’s allies are also worried that the FBI may have obtained a “gold mine” of recordings Cohen made with associates close to the president.

Lawyers representing Trump and Cohen have tried to block prosecutors from sifting through any seized files, arguing that they are protected by attorney-client privilege. They had proposed allowing Cohen or an independent attorney to review them first.

“Those searches have been executed, and the evidence is locked down,” Joanna Hendon, a lawyer for Trump, said in court last week, according to The Times. “I’m not trying to delay. I’m just trying to ensure that it’s done scrupulously.”

Federal prosecutors have argued for a standard review of the seized material by a so-called “taint team” of independent lawyers, which is meant to filter out any documents that may be privileged. Once the team is finished, the remaining documents are passed on to attorneys working on the case.

The Hill notes such a move is established procedure meant to “protect the attorney-client privilege and to ensure that the investigation is not compromised,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Manual.

It’s unclear just yet what details may lie within the documents, but as The Times notes, they could provide insight into Trump’s decade-long relationship with Cohen. The attorney has been a trusted adviser and fixer who has helped Trump navigate a litany of issues both before and after the campaign.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that Cohen was known for his “proclivity to make tapes” of private conversations and store them digitally. It’s unclear if such tapes were seized, and if any involved the president himself.Statement from R. Lee Ermey's long time manager, Bill Rogin:

WASHINGTON — Over the most recent congressional recess, a conservative political group ran a campaign-style TV advertisement in Washington that is adding to the speculation that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has loftier political aspirations.

The ad features sweeping views of several national parks and a close-up of a smiling Zinke, and it calls on viewers to phone their senator in support of the interior secretary’s proposal for tackling the park system’s estimated $12 billion maintenance backlog.

“From sea to shining sea, they’re America’s national treasures,” says the narrator. “But for too long, Washington has neglected our national parks. Now, Donald Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke wants to change that.”

The American Economic Freedom Alliance, a secretive political nonprofit with ties to Vice President Mike Pence, paid for the ads. The group has a history of both supporting and pushing Republicans. The Indianapolis Star reported in March that the nonprofit ran more than $330,000 in ads applauding Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) for fighting to end tax credits for undocumented immigrants. Messer is one of three Republicans vying for a chance to take on Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) in November. And last year the organization ran television and digital ads aimed at persuading three Republican congressmen from New York to repeal an insurance tax that was part of Obamacare, Politico reported.

The nonprofit is registered to the same address in Alexandria, Virginia, as Republican media agency IMGE. Marty Obst, one of Pence’s senior advisers, is also a senior adviser at IMGE. He also appears to oversee the American Economic Freedom Alliance, according to a January Twitter post from the nonprofit’s research director, Matt St. Clair.

The Zinke ads ran on cable networks Fox News and MSNBC from March 26 to April 6, but only in the Washington area ― an odd choice, since district residents don’t have a voting representative in the U.S. Senate. The group paid $73,000 for a total of 75 spots, the majority of which aired only inside the Beltway, according to information HuffPost obtained via a media consultant.

As a nonprofit, the American Economic Freedom Alliance is not required to disclose where its donations come from.

Zinke has repeatedly vowed to address the ballooning maintenance backlog at national parks, which is estimated at $12 billion. The Trump administration’s 2019 budget request laid out a legislative proposal for a “Public Lands Infrastructure Fund” for park improvements using revenue from oil drilling and other energy development on public lands and in offshore waters. In March, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in both the House and Senate unveiled a bill based on the administration’s proposal to provide up to $18 billion.

Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, touts himself as a conservationist in the mold of President Theodore Roosevelt. But in his first year as chief steward of America’s natural resources, he has prioritized energy development over conservation.

Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, told HuffPost it is “unusual,” but not unheard of, for an outside group to buy expensive ads praising Cabinet officials. Along with promoting a Pence ally, Holman expects the ad was aimed at helping to “get Zinke’s name in the public sphere” ahead of a future candidacy.

Although he has recommended Trump roll back national monument designations in states including Utah, Oregon and California, Zinke has proposed the creation of a 130,000-acre monument in his home state of Montana. He also supports a ban on new mining in Paradise Valley, in southwestern Montana just north Yellowstone National Park ― both of which add to speculation that he may be setting up a run for governor or Senate.

During his tenure at the Department of the Interior, Zinke has on several occasions met with Republican donors and attended GOP fundraisers during taxpayer-funded trips, drawing accusations that he’s mixing work with politics. And the Des Moines Register reported earlier this month that a polling firm floated Zinke’s name among Iowa Republican voters to gauge his popularity for a possible presidential bid.

“I think he wants to be governor of Montana, then president of the United States,” Land Tawney, president and chief executive of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a Montana-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting public lands and preserving opportunities for hunting and fishing, told HuffPost in a recent interview.

Kate Kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a former interior official in the Obama administration, called the TV ads “really curious.”

“I kept waiting for the ‘Ryan Zinke for President’ logo to appear,” she told HuffPost via email. “The timing and targeting of the buy makes it hard to believe that it had any serious policy aims but was more about trying to salvage Zinke’s image using national parks as a backdrop.”

At a congressional appropriations hearing last week, Zinke said the administration’s budget proposal “calls for the largest investment in public lands infrastructure in American history” and that establishing a fund to rebuild parks was his “top priority.”

PolitiFact recently rated Zinke’s infrastructure claim as “false.” It noted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s $3 billion investment in the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s would amount to $53 billion today and “accounted for vastly more than the Trump proposal as a percentage of federal spending at the time.”

The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Attempts to reach the American Economic Freedom Alliance and Obst were unsuccessful.President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign this year continued big spending on lawyers, with more than 20 percent of all expenditures in the first quarter going to legal fees, according to documents filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission.

Trump’s campaign spent a total of $3.9 million through the end of March, with $834,000 going to eight law firms and the Trump Corp. for legal expenses, according to the documents. The Trump Corp. — owned by the president and run by sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. — collected $24,000.

Trump’s campaign is pouring money into lawyers amid the special counsel’s intensifying investigation into possible Kremlin collusion with the campaign and obstruction of justice, and entanglements with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and her fight to tell her story. The campaign has spent a total of some $4 million in legal fees since Trump took office, according to The Washington Post.

In 2018, more than $280,000 was paid to the law firm of Larocca, Hornik, Rosen, Greenberg & Blaha and another firm owned by Charles Harder, which represent Trump and his personal attorney Michael Cohen in the court fight with Daniels. She wants to invalidate a $130,000 agreement to keep her relationship with Trump secret. Harder represented Hulk Hogan in an invasion of privacy case against Gawker, which ended up bankrupting the media company.

An additional $348,000 was paid to the law firm of Jones Day, which is representing the campaign in special counsel Robert Mueller’s election probe and in congressional investigations.

The White House said last year, before the Daniels court battle began, that Trump would begin paying his own legal expenses in the Mueller probe, after the Republican National Committee shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for attorneys for him. It’s not clear whether Trump is actually paying his lawyers, considering the campaign’s high legal spending.

Trump also said then that he would set up a legal defense fund for members of his staff, but he was informed that could be a conflict of interest in case any personnel may be called to testify against him.

The campaign s pent nearly $150,000 at businesses owned by the president this year, including for lodging, catering and rent at properties that include the Trump International Hotel in Washington and Trump Tower in Manhattan.

A consulting company owned by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale was paid $1.7 million for digital and advertising services, according to the finance records.

Trump’s former personal aide, John McEntee, who was bounced out of the White House early last month amid an investigation reportedly for “serious financial crimes,” was paid $22,000 by the campaign in late March, CNN noted.

Cohen appeared in court Monday as part of a federal investigation into his business and financial dealings. The FBI raided his office last week, reportedly seizing documents related to payments he made to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, and another woman Trump has been accused of having a sexual relationship with in the past.

Clifford sat in on Cohen’s hearing with her lawyer Michael Avenatti on Monday.

In a court filing Monday morning, Cohen’s lawyers argued that Cohen should not be required to identify his clients. Cohen had at least 10 clients between 2017 and 2018, Reuters reported, and he did “traditional legal tasks” for three of them, including Trump, former Republican National Committee official Elliott Broidy, and a third who asked not to be named.

“The client is a publicly prominent individual,” Steve Ryan, one of Cohen’s lawyers, said before the judge directed him to name the client.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan said Cohen’s lawyers did not meet “the standard for an exception that client identity or even fee arrangements must be revealed,” reported the New York Daily News.

Hannity, a staunch Trump supporter, has bashed the FBI’s raid on Cohen’s office during his Fox News show, though he never mentioned his own legal dealings with the lawyer.

The host addressed the news on his radio show Monday, saying he had never officially retained Cohen as his attorney.

“Let me be very clear to the media,” Hannity said. “Michael never represented me in any matter. I never retained him in the traditional sense. ... I never received an invoice from Michael. I never paid legal fees to Michael.”

The radio host clarified that he had on occasion consulted with Cohen and asked for the lawyer’s opinion “about legal matters,” during which conversations he assumed there would be attorney-client confidentiality.

“I might have handed him 10 bucks, [to say] I definitely want your attorney-client privilege on this, something like that,” Hannity said.

Hannity continued to downplay his relationship with Cohen on Twitter.

Cohen appeared in court Monday to request Wood grant a temporary restraining order that would limit the prosecutors’ access to documents seized during last week’s FBI raid. Wood denied Cohen’s request, adding that a “taint team” or “special master” to review the documents first could have a role in the investigation.Jack White was the musical guest on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, but not all of his performances made it on air.

The critically acclaimed album was also Lamar’s third million-selling set in the U.S., according to Nielsen Music, after his 2015 album “To Pimp a Butterfly” and his 2012 album “good kid, m.A.A.d city.”

Additionally, the album was ranked No. 1 on Rolling Stone’s best albums of 2017 and won the Grammy for Best Rap Album in 2018.

CLARY via Getty ImagesTwitter users have taken a video Rihanna posted for her Fenty Beauty product Body Lava and re-created it with laugh-out-loud results.

To backtrack a little, Rihanna’s makeup line, Fenty Beauty, dropped a luminizer called Body Lava in March. The product gives skin a dewy shine and glow.

In debuting the Body Lava, Rihanna posted a video on her social media pages of her squeezing some out on her shoulder and sexily buffing it out with a brush.

People have since been getting, uh, creative in sharing their own versions of “body lava on a budget,” if you will.

Basically, people are slathering random products on their shoulders and using everything from their hands to brooms to “buff” the stuff in. Some are calling it the #RihannaChallenge. It’s weird and delightfully funny:

😂 it’s funny cause it’s true lmaooo!!!! 😂 sorry riri I laughed way to hard at this lol!!! pic.twitter.com/3HlEBNUSPF — Acondria💛 (@Acondria2) March 30, 2018

Rihanna hasn’t publicly addressed any of the videos, but she did “like” this mashup on Twitter, so odds are high that she has good humor about the whole thing.

AdvertisementMontana wildlife officials are puzzled by the carcass of wolflike animal they say a rancher shot and killed on his property near the town of Denton.

“The animal came within several hundred yards of the rancher’s livestock,” the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said Thursday. “He shot it and reported it as required by law. The animal was a young, non-lactating female and a canid, a member of the dog family, which includes dogs, foxes, coyotes and wolves.”

The animal did not appear to fit the profile of either a wolf or a domestic dog. In a video posted to social media, a spokesman said authorities suspect the animal is a wolf-dog hybrid, but can’t be sure yet.

The department has sent DNA samples out for testing at an Oregon lab, but it could be weeks to months before results come back.

“We have no idea what this was until we get a DNA report back,” department spokesman Bruce Auchly told the Great Falls Tribune.

On Saturday, enigmatic performance artist Zardulu retweeted a story about the creature. Zardulu has previously claimed responsibility for numerous viral videos and news stories, including a “toilet iguana” in Miami, a three-eyed fish found in Brooklyn and New York’s infamous “pizza rat.”

HuffPost asked Zardulu via Twitter if she had anything to do with the wolflike animal in Montana.

“If at first you don’t succeed, try try again,” she replied in a direct message, followed by a winky face.Maddie Poppe won “American Idol” Monday ― and also triumphed in romance.

Before she was named the champion in the rebooted singing competition, runner-up Caleb Lee Hutchinson announced that he and Poppe were an item.

“Well, Maddie is my pal and I’ve known her since the beginning of Hollywood week,” Hutchinson said. “And she actually happens to be my girlfriend.”

Bombshell.

Judge Katy Perry spun a few revolutions in her chair at the news, People reported.

The evening got even more cozy when the two performed Israel Kamakawiwo’ole’s version of “Over the Rainbow” and “What A Wonderful World” together, and received a surprise trip to a resort in Hawaii.

Before the results were announced, Hutchinson said he couldn’t lose. “When I looked over at Maddie I was like, ‘I win either way,’” he said in the clip at the top.

A woman told Dallas police R&B singer R. Kelly “knowingly and intentionally” infected her with a sexually transmitted disease during an eight-month relationship that began when she was 19.

The woman said in a criminal complaint filed April 9 that Kelly caused “serious bodily injury” to her in December, during a relationship in which he also gave her illegal drugs and alcohol, her lawyer, Lee Merritt, told HuffPost. The woman, who the lawyer didn’t identify by name, ended the relationship in February, when Kelly’s “predatory, controlling and abusive behavior” escalated, Merritt said.

During her relationship with the singer, “our client was the victim of several forms of criminal misconduct by Kelly, including, but not limited to, unlawful restraint, furnishing alcohol and illegal drugs to a minor, and aggravated assault (via the referenced intentional STD infection),” Merritt wrote in a press release. “These offenses occurred while our client was being groomed to join Kelly’s sex cult.”

Kelly, 51, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. A spokesperson told The Washington Post, which first reported the woman’s complaint, that the singer “categorically denies all claims and allegations.”

Merritt said the woman is preparing a federal civil lawsuit against Kelly. The singer “gradually introduced the cult to our client over the course of their relationship, culminating with an explanation that she would have to sign a contract and offer collateral information about herself and her family for Kelly’s protection,” he said.

Kelly’s stardom has been marked by dozens of sexual misconduct allegations dating back to 1994, when he allegedly married R&B singer Aaliyah when she was 15 and he was 27.

In 2008, Kelly was acquitted of child pornography charges after a video showed him allegedly having sex with and urinating on a 14-year-old girl. He has agreed to multiple out-of-court settlements with women who accused him of sexual assault, including one who said Kelly had sex with her when she was 15.

Last year, a BuzzFeed report alleged the singer holds multiple young women against their will in an abusive sex cult. Rolling Stone also reported that Kelly’s ex-girlfriend, radio DJ Kitti Jones, said he abused, sexually assaulted and starved her throughout their two-year relationship.

The woman who filed the Dallas complaint said that after she left Kelly, she contacted the family of Jocelyn Savage, a young woman whose parents say is being held against her will in Kelly’s sex cult. The woman told Savage’s parents she had contact with their daughter while she was dating Kelly, according to the Post.One of Donald Trump’s first obsessions in office was the size of his inauguration crowd.

Trump famously sent then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer into the press briefing room to slam media reports that he had drawn fewer spectators than President Barack Obama during his first inauguration in 2009.

In an interview with George Stephanopolous on Sunday night, former FBI director James Comey said the topic even came up at a private dinner he had with Trump that the president said not even then-chief-of-staff Reince Priebus knew about.

“It was him talking almost the entire time, which I’ve discovered is something he frequently does. And so it would be monologue in this direction, monologue in that direction, monologue in a different direction. And a constant series of assertions that ― about the inauguration crowd, about how great my inauguration speech was, about all the free media,” Comey said. “...On and on and on and on. Everyone agrees, everyone agrees, I did this, the ― I never assaulted these women, I never made fun of a reporter. And ― I’m sure you’re wondering what question did I ask that would prompt those? None, zero. I didn’t ask any questions that I recall.”

The dinner was an uncomfortable affair, but Comey was particularly struck by Trump’s tendency to lie.

“And then later in the same meal, near the end, he says, ‘Reince knows we’re having dinner, so follow-up with Reince.’ Just ― so one of those things is not true. One of those things is a lie, but it reminded me of the inauguration crowd thing. Right, that it’s ― his inauguration crowd was bigger than that Barack Obama’s first inauguration. That’s just not true. That’s not a perspective, that’s not a view, that’s just a lie. And ― and yet he would say it.”

Trump even told falsehoods about his inauguration crowd size in public.

“It looked like a million, a million and a half people,” Trump said during a speech at CIA headquarters shortly after the inauguration. He claimed his crowd “went all the way back to the Washington Monument.”

It did not.They couldn’t pin each other down.

Pro wrestlers John Cena and Nikki Bella on Sunday announced their split after six years as a couple ― so of course their planned May 5 wedding is off.

“While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another,” the pair said in a statement posted on social media. “We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.”

Their separation was a bit more private than their engagement, which happened on live TV after a WrestleMania 33 tag-team match in April 2017. The two had just finished victorious when Cena took a knee and popped the question.

And they sealed it with a kiss.

Only recently, “Blockers” star Cena, 40, told People: “I know that we will have a wonderful future together.”

And that means people are clawing at the Grammy winner wherever he goes. But if you want to get your mitts on Sheeran, you’re going to have to go through his bodyguard, Kevin Myers, first.

Sheeran hired security in 2015 after fans started “getting a little grabby.” Probably a good idea. And if you’re going to have a bodyguard, why not make it one who can entertain you after you’ve spent the day entertaining everyone else?

Myers started an Instagram account on April 7 to document his life as Sheeran’s muscle, and he is certainly entertaining. It doesn’t look like Myers gets to rub shoulders with celebrities very often. He’s usually in the background keeping a close eye on Sheeran, as the photos often hilariously show.

Always. Watching. A post shared by Kevin Myers (@securitykev) on Apr 8, 2018 at 1:41am PDT

The best thing about this account, though, is the goofy photos of he and Sheeran cheesing for the camera and photobombing one another. It looks like he’s not just Sheeran’s bodyguard; the two of them appear to be the best of friends.

Worth a follow.

A post shared by Kevin Myers (@securitykev) on Apr 7, 2018 at 10:20pm PDTMusical theater fans can expect “an unparalleled evening of seductive striptease” later this spring with the return of a wildly popular Broadway-meets-burlesque spectacular.

On June 17, more than 150 of New York’s most well-toned dancers will take to the stage of the Hammerstein Ballroom for “Broadway Bares: Game Night.” The 28th installment of the annual fundraiser promises to “put a sassy, seductive spin on games you know and love,” including “a pulsating poke at pinball” and “saucy virtual reality video games,” officials wrote in a press release.

Catch a behind-the-scenes peek at the show in the video above.

The 2018 edition will be co-directed by Nick Kenkel (“Catch Me If You Can,” “Half Time”) and choreographer, dancer and musician Laya Barak. Aaron Hamilton will serve as associate director.

“Broadway Bares” was first created in 1992 by Tony-winning “Kinky Boots” director Jerry Mitchell. Since then, the event has raised more than $17.4 million for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, a nonprofit group dedicated to AIDS-related causes across the U.S.

Previous installments of the show have ranged from 2012’s naughty fairy tale “Happy Endings” to 2017’s college-themed bacchanal, “Strip U.”

Check out some (slightly risqué) photos from “Broadway Bares: Game Night” below.Terry Crews knows just how damaging toxic masculinity can be.

The actor and activist participated in a discussion at Tina Brown’s ninth annual Women in the World Summit in New York on Saturday afternoon. Crews ― along with panelists Joanna Coles, chief operating officer at Hearst Magazines, and Lauren Duca, a journalist ― discussed the recent Me Too movement and how it’s affected cultural perceptions of sex, consent and gender roles.

True to form, Crews took a moment to point out how masculinity contributes to issues of sexual violence and gender inequality.

“Masculinity can be a cult,” Crews said. “And when I say ‘cult,’ it’s no different than David Koresh. It’s no different than Jim Jones.”

He said that men ― whether consciously or unconsciously ― rarely see women as “all the way human.”

“This is what you have to understand ― there is a humanity issue here,” he continued. “[Women are] like, ‘Why don’t you hear me? Why don’t you see my feelings?’ And [men are] like, ‘But you’re not all the way human. You’re here for me, you’re here for my deal.’ It’s real.”

Crews’ comments were met with applause from the crowd at Manhattan’s Lincoln Center Theater.

“I am guilty,” Crews added. “I believed, simply because I was a man, that I was more valuable than my wife and the other women in my life.”

As an example, Crews recalled when he used to play football and he and his teammates would go to strip clubs. They’d be having fun, Crews said, until the stripper began talking to them about her life outside of the club.

“Once she starts talking about that she has kids or she starts talking about anything in her life, it’s like, ‘Stop, stop, stop.’ Because [she’s] becoming a human before my eyes,” he said. “I don’t want you to be a human. I want you to be an object. I want you to be something pretty to look at. But as you talk, you’re making things too real for me.”Here’s some news that will capture the hearts of every fancy Asian, jungle Asian, mom, and pretty much anyone who appreciates hilarious standup.

Comedian Ali Wong is releasing a Netflix special on Mother’s Day, May 13, titled “Hard Knock Wife.”

To say we’re excited would be an understatement.

Wong, a mother of two, will tackle the ups and downs of motherhood, including the “challenges of breastfeeding, balancing family and career post pregnancy, and why all women deserve three years of paid maternity leave,” a press release on the special noted. We have no doubt she’ll keep it real.

The comedian stopped by “The Ellen Show” last week and touched on the topic of motherhood with host Ellen DeGeneres. Wong was asked whether she’ll have more kids. Unsurprisingly, she didn’t hold back.

″That’s my favorite mantra when it comes to motherhood: I have suffered enough,” Wong told the host. “Whenever I feel mom guilt, or pressure to be a better mom, or to cook salmon on a bed of quinoa for my kids, I just think to myself, ‘I have suffered enough.’”

We can only imagine how hilarious “Hard Knock Wife” is going to be.A major GOP donor is jumping ship and now he’s contributing to Democratic candidates in hopes of flipping the House of Representatives and/or the Senate in this year’s midterm elections.

Seth Klarman, the billionaire CEO of the Baupost Group who the Economist once dubbed “The Oracle of Boston,” called out Republicans for failing to keep President Donald Trump in check.

“The Republicans in Congress have failed to hold the president accountable and have abandoned their historic beliefs and values,” Klarman told the Boston Globe. “For the good of the country, the Democrats must take back one or both houses of Congress.”

Klarman, an independent who donated more than $7 million to GOP candidates during the presidency of Barack Obama, has now cut checks to Democrats in 56 House races and 22 Senate elections, the newspaper reported.

“I received a tax cut I neither need nor want. I’m choosing to invest it to fight the administration’s flawed policies and to elect Democrats to the Senate and House of Representatives,” Klarman said.

Klarman also donated $2 million to nonprofits backing core Democratic issues, including gun control and the environment, the Globe reported.

While Klarman contributed far more to Republicans in 2016, he actually backed Hillary Clinton in the presidential race, calling Trump “completely unqualified for the highest office in the land,” according to Reuters.

His views have not changed since the election.

Last year, Klarman described Trump as a “threat to democracy,” per audio obtained by New York magazine. He also warned against Trump’s protectionist agenda in a letter to his investors, saying such policies “not only don’t work, they actually leave society worse off,” The New York Times reported.

In the same letter, he sounded the alarm about the Trump-backed tax cuts that were ultimately enacted by the Republican-led Congress.

“The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,” Klarman wrote, noting that cuts in 2001 under President George W. Bush “fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits.”NASA has sent samples of human sperm to the International Space Station to study how fertilization could happen in space.

The mission, called Micro-11, rocketed frozen human sperm — and bull sperm for a comparison — to the space station early this month. The aim? NASA wants to know: “Do sperm squirm the same in space?”

Lack of gravity affects human sperm motility and fertility. During fertilization for mammals, the activated sperm swims to fuse with an egg, and it faces a vastly different environment depending on gravity.

Earlier studies for other types of sperm have pinpointed a number of issues in space.

Experiments with sperm from sea urchins and bulls have suggested that “activating movement happens more quickly in microgravity, while the steps leading up to fusion happen more slowly — or not at all,” NASA explained. “Delays or problems at this stage could prevent fertilization from happening in space.”

Astronauts on the space station will thaw the samples and add a chemical mixtures to activate the sperm. They’ll then record how well the sperm move in space. Samples will be sent back to a lab at the University of Kansas for further study.TONIGHT: If you work in the West Wing at the White House, you're probably banned from using your personal cell phone at the office. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/iG9EOyzax9

The icon brought out former bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams roughly 90 minutes into her two-hour set. Though the pair briefly reunited with Bey during her Super Bowl halftime show in 2013, fans on Saturday night were treated to a three-song medley featuring some of the group’s greatest hits including “Lose My Breath,” “Say My Name” and “Soldier.”

A post shared by BALMAIN (@balmain) on Apr 15, 2018 at 10:31am PDT

The reunion came soon after Bey had brought out husband Jay-Z to perform “Deja Vu.” After performing with Destiny’s Child, Beyonce performed “Get Me Bodied” and danced with sister Solange, who also joined for a cameo appearance.

The star was meant to perform at Coachella last April but postponed her performance for one year as she was pregnant with twins. She became the first black woman to headline the famed music festival ― in a performance that is being praised as one of Coachella’s and Beyoncé’s best ever. It was well worth the wait.President Donald Trump attacked James Comey in a series of tweets Sunday, claiming the former FBI director’s new book contains “many lies.”

Trump took aim at several allegations made in A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, Comey’s forthcoming tell-all book about his decades-long career in criminal justice. He accused Comey of writing “phony” memos about their interactions and ranted over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.

I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018

Trump’s tweets came hours before Comey’s highly anticipated interview with ABC News. In the interview, Comey called Trump “morally unfit” and said the president is vulnerable to Russian blackmail.

.

Comey’s interview with ABC News is just the first in a whirlwind media tour surrounding his new book, of which more than 200,000 copies have already been sold. On Thursday, he is expected to sit down with CNN’s Jake Tapper to give his first live interview since Trump fired him as head of the Russia probe in May.

“My book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others,” Comey tweeted Sunday. “I hope folks read the whole thing and find it useful.”

My book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others. 3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint. I hope folks read the whole thing and find it useful. — James Comey (@Comey) April 15, 2018

News reports containing passages from Comey’s new book, as well as clips from his upcoming interview with ABC News, set the internet ablaze last week. Comey wrote in his memoir that Trump was obsessed with disproving the so-called pee tape allegation from the infamous intelligence dossier about him.WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) attempted in an interview airing Sunday to frame his legacy on his own terms, brushing off the criticism that he facilitated President Donald Trump’s makeover of the Republican Party.

The speaker announced last week that he plans to retire at the end of his term to spend more time with his family. Ryan is finishing his career in Congress under Trump, a man he repeatedly criticized during the 2016 presidential campaign for racially charged, derogatory and vulgar statements and proposals but whose agenda he has helped enact.

NBC’ “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd asked Ryan about the criticism that he enabled the rise of Trump.

“Enabling ― So, so what did we do?” Ryan asked in the interview, which took place on Friday, according to a transcript provided by NBC News. He went on to spotlight what he sees as his own achievements ― such as establishing empowerment zones in poor communities, passing tax reform and spurring economic growth ― and said he hopes to accomplish more this year.

When pressed about Trump, Ryan said that they had agreed on an agenda, but wouldn’t say definitively whether they shared a vision for the GOP. “You’d have to ask him that,” Ryan said, adding that he and the president differed on policies for trade and some entitlement programs, but are “rolling in the same direction” on most things.

“Sure, no two people are going to agree on everything,” Ryan said. “We have different styles. We have different ideas. But it’s a big tent party. And we represent different corners of the tent.”

Todd read him a quote from former Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, who said of Ryan, “When people write the history of this era, it will be the triumph of Trumpism over Ryanism, and that’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.”

“I just don’t see it like that,” Ryan said.

The speaker also said that though it is Congress’ role to serve as a check on the executive branch if there is abuse of civil liberties or power, he didn’t see a need for one potential action: a bill that would bar the president from firing special counsel Robert Mueller. The Justice Department special counsel is investigating whether the Trump campaign worked with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election.

Trump sought to have Mueller fired in December, The New York Times reported last week. The president denied that report and said he is taking a cooperative approach to dealing with the special counsel.

Ryan said that he did not think a bill to protect Mueller, which a bipartisan group of senators are pushing, would be necessary because the White House was not going to fire him.
