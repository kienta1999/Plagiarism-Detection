Kylie Minogue’s 2018 just keeps getting better and better.

The Australian songstress will follow up the April release of her new album, “Golden,” with a headlining gig at Pride Island, New York City’s two-day LGBTQ music festival, in June.

The star-studded lineup for June 23 and 24 also includes Tove Lo, Lizzo, Big Freedia and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” champion Sasha Velour.

“With the success of last year’s Pride Island, we are thrilled to bring back our music festival in a two-day format,” Pride Island director Jose Ramos said in a news release. “Kylie Minogue, Tove Lo, Lizzo, and Big Freedia are perfect examples of the evolution of Dance on the Pier.”

Last year, NYC Pride organizers opted to expand one of their most storied events, the Dance on the Pier, into Pride Island, billed as a multi-day “cultural experience.” The inaugural 2017 event featured performances by Patti LaBelle, Years & Years and Nelly Furtado, among other artists.

This year’s Pride Island moves to Hudson River Park’s Pier 97 in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood.

Minogue will celebrate “Golden” with a series of five intimate club dates in London, Paris and Barcelona, among other European cities. Following her Pride Island performance, she’ll embark on her full-scale Golden Tour in September, playing arenas across the U.K. and Ireland.

Meanwhile, NYC Pride is shaping up to be a bigger and brighter celebration of the LGBTQ community than ever before. Last week, organizers unveiled the event’s “Defiantly Different” theme, which pays tribute to “the rallying cry of generations who laid the groundwork for equality, the next wave of creative thinkers prepared to score their own trails, and each distinctive individual in between.”Stephen Piscotty just hit a shot straight to the heart.

In his first game back from bereavement leave after the death of his 55-year-old mother, the Oakland A’s outfielder blasted a home run in his first at-bat Tuesday at Fenway Park in Boston.

He patted his heart and then looked skyward as he touched home plate for a quiet tribute to his mom, Gretchen, who had battled ALS. Piscotty, a Bay Area native, was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals to the A’s in December, enabling him to care for his mother at their Pleasanton, California, home. She died earlier this month.

All the feels.

In a new profile of Glover by Tad Friend in The New Yorker, the “Atlanta” creator spoke on how he convinced the network executives that use of the word would be important to his hit show’s integrity and authenticity.

The New Yorker profile shows the inner workings of Glover’s creative look on issues like race relations in America, but also delves into what black show runners have to deal with when it comes to explaining their content and comedy to often white executives and audiences.

Glover said FX initially told him not use the word in the pilot for “Atlanta,” and that their “compromise position” was they it could be used only in certain circumstances by a white character:

“Recalling the dispute, Glover exclaimed, ‘I’m black, making a very black show, and they’re telling me I can’t use the N-word! Only in a world run by white people would that happen.’”

Ultimately, one phone call with a “white translator” ― executive producer Paul Simms ― resolved the matter and convinced the network to allow for the word:

“It was a white executive producer, Paul Simms, who argued successfully for the authenticity of the show’s use of the word. Glover had brought in Simms, the elder statesman on “Girls” and “Flight of the Conchords,” to serve as what black creators call “the white translator.” “You need the translator for the three-minute call after the meeting,” [“Black-ish” creator Kenya] Barris explained. “It’s for when the execs call the white guy to say, ‘What exactly did Kenya mean there?,’ and to be reassured.” Since then, “Atlanta” has used the N-word unself-consciously, in a profusion of ways.

For context, the profile talks about shows like “Black-ish” and “The Carmichael Show” and how their usage of the word is often set up as an entire discussion piece, rather than in casual conversation like in “Atlanta:”

On African-American shows, racial anxiety often gets dramatized as a special episode about the N-word. On “Black-ish,” the Johnson family argued about its propriety, and Dre, the father, finally told his son—who’d been suspended from school for singing along to the word in Kanye West’s “Gold Digger”—to “hold off on saying it until you know the history of it, to make your own decision.” On “The Carmichael Show,” on NBC, a similar family debate ensued after a white friend of Jerrod’s greeted him with “My nigga!” Jerrod’s girlfriend, Maxine, said, “It’s the last word that so many black people heard as they were being hung from trees,” but Jerrod contended that “everyone should just use the word constantly, so much until it dilutes its power, it makes it meaningless.”

Glover argued that “no black people talk to each other like that, or need to. It’s all for white people.” According to the New Yorker profile, the audience for “Blackish” is about one-fifth black, whereas for “Atlanta” it’s about half black.

The number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States rose nearly 60 percent in 2017, according to a new report from the Anti-Defamation League, marking the largest single year increase the organization has ever recorded.

According to the report, published Tuesday, the ADL counted 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, a 57 percent increase over the year before.

It’s also the second highest tally the ADL has recorded since 1979, when the organization, which tracks anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, started conducting its annual count. Only 1994 saw more, with 2,066 anti-Semitic incidents.

“A confluence of events in 2017 led to a surge in attacks on our community – from bomb threats, cemetery desecrations, white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and children harassing children at school,” said ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt in a statement. “These incidents came at a time when we saw a rising climate of incivility, the emboldening of hate groups and widening divisions in society.”

The report breaks down anti-Semitic incidents into three categories: There were 1,015 incidents of harassment last year, a 41 percent increase over the prior year; 952 incidents of vandalism, an 86 percent increase; and 19 incidents of assault, a 47 percent decrease.

Anti-Defamation League

The most common place for these acts of hate was in schools. There were 457 anti-Semitic incidents at K-12 schools in America last year, a 94 percent increase from the 235 recorded at schools in 2016.

“The consistent increase of anti-Semitic incidents against students of all ages is deeply troubling,” Greenblatt said. “We know that students do not always report when they are being bullied, so for every incident that’s reported, it is likely there’s another that goes unreported.”

Another ADL report released last month detailed 204 incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses in 2017, a nearly 90 percent increase over the year before.

The most anti-Semitic incidents last year occurred in the first three months of 2017, as the country reeled from a particularly contentious presidential election. January, February and March saw 208, 273 and 273 incidents respectively.

There were 163 bomb threats made against Jewish institutions during those three months. A 19-year-old Israeli-American named Michael Ron David Kadar was arrested in Israel for making the bulk of those threats. It later emerged that Kadar, whom his mother described as autistic and suffering from a brain tumor, sold his bomb threat services on the dark web.

“Our goal in the Audit is not to count anti-Semites, but rather to document cases where Jews were targeted for assault, vandalism and harassment,” an ADL spokesman explained to HuffPost.

“Regardless of the motivation of any specific perpetrator, Jewish communities were repeatedly traumatized by these assaults on their institutions and threats to their safety. The bomb threats sowed fear and anxiety among Jews across the country.”

The report similarly states that the desecration of seven Jewish cemeteries in 2017 — most of which occurred at the beginning of the year — “contributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege.”

The ADL’s report adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to a rise in hate in America. A recent report, also from the ADL, found that white supremacists in the U.S. killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America. (Already in 2018, a neo-Nazi allegedly murdered a gay Jewish college student in California.)

Hate crimes rose about 5 percent in 2016, according to the latest FBI tally, marking the first time in over 10 years that the country has experienced consecutive annual increases in hate crimes.

Preliminary hate crime statistics for 2017 — collected by Brian Levin, a professor at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino — showed a 20 percent rise in hate crimes in 13 large American cities.

Earlier this month, the Southern Poverty Law Center released its annual “Year in Hate and Extremism” report, identifying 954 hate groups in the U.S. – an increase of 4 percent from 2016. The SPLC attributed this rise in hate groups, and a similar increase in 2016, to the rhetoric of President Donald Trump.

“President Trump in 2017 reflected what white supremacist groups want to see: a country where racism is sanctioned by the highest office, immigrants are given the boot and Muslims banned,” said Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project.

To the delight of racists and fascists across the country, Trump has on numerous occasions given political cover or tacit support to white nationalism. During the campaign, he was slow to disavow the support of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard and avowed anti-Semite. The president also tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton standing next to an apparent Star of David and a pile of cash. (This anti-Semitic meme originated on an alt-right message board on 8chan.)

Once in office, Trump issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that omitted any mention of anti-Semitism or Jews. He refused to condemn his supporters for making anti-Semitic threats against journalist Julia Ioffe. “I know nothing about it,” he said. “You’ll have to talk to them about that.” (Andrew Anglin, the anti-Semite behind the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer, told HuffPost that he interpreted Trump’s lack of condemnation as “an endorsement” for the threats against Ioffe.)

And after the violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August — which ended with a neo-Nazi allegedly driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer — Trump said there were “very fine people” on both sides of the rally.Warning: This post contains disturbing and graphic content.

A man in Wingate, North Carolina live-streamed his own killing on Monday, police said.

Prentis Robinson, 55, had been broadcasting a visit to the local police station on Facebook Live when he was shot multiple times on camera. He was reportedly just a block away from the station when the shooting occurred.

Police identified the suspected shooter as 65-year-old Douglas Colson and issued a warrant for his arrest, WSOC reported. He is wanted on a murder charge. At the time of publication, no arrests had been made.

Wingate police confirmed that Robinson captured the shooting on film, reported the Charlotte Observer. Police Chief Donnie Gay suggested Robinson, who used Facebook Live almost daily, may have been targeted because he’d outed the identities of suspected drug dealers in earlier broadcasts.

The clip of the shooting has since been taken down by Facebook, but multiple news outlets have shared photos and video from the live stream.

The video, captured using a selfie stick, shows Robinson visiting the Wingate Police Department on foot and speaking to Gay about a stolen cell phone. NBC News said Robinson had walked about a block from the station when he was shot.

Moments before the shooting, Robinson is repeatedly heard telling someone off-camera, “you on live.” A person, whose face cannot be seen, briefly appears on screen before several loud shots are heard, and Robinson appears to falls to the ground.

“OMG [what] just happened,” said a Facebook commenter immediately after the shooting, according to the Observer.

Robinson was later pronounced dead at the scene.

The attack prompted Wingate University and Wingate Elementary, both located nearby, to briefly go on lockdown, reported the Washington Post.

Citing police, the university identified the suspect as a black male carrying a carrying a long gun and wearing a windbreaker and Timberland boots.

Robinson, who played the guitar, used Facebook Live frequently to broadcast his musical performances. He also reportedly used the platform to call out illegal activity in his neighborhood, including drug dealing.Amy Schumer is loving married life.

The comedian and actress opened up about her surprise nuptials to chef Chris Fisher ― and her raunchy wedding vows ― during an interview Monday on her friend Nikki Glaser’s SiriusXM show.

“I’m a wife as hell. But it’s still like, a novelty,” Schumer said on “You Up With Nikki Glaser.” “Somebody went to sit next to [Chris] and he’s like, ‘My wife is sitting here,’ and then I got back and he was excited to tell me that he said that. I just have been really overusing it to a degree that’s insane. Like, when it’s completely uncalled for.”

Schumer also revealed parts of her X-rated vows, which she joked “sucked” and took only 20 minutes to write.

A post shared by @amyschumer on Feb 15, 2018 at 10:53am PST

“In my vows I go, ‘But I promise I’ll keep going down on you, even though everyone tells me I won’t,’” she joked. “And his were like, heckling me too. He was like, ‘The other day I lost a tennis match and you called me a fucking loser.’ It was all like, awful shit.”

Glaser, who attended the wedding, said she remembered Schumer saying, “You go, ‘You make me laugh, you make me smile, you make me feel loved, you make me food.’”

Despite the jokes, fellow guest Jennifer Lawrence said the wedding “was beautiful.”

“It was very sudden, but it was, I was sobbing the whole ― his vows were stunning,” Lawrence said in an interview with “Entertainment Tonight.” “It’s when two people really love each other and they really mean it, it shows, and it was a beautiful ceremony and an amazing time. I couldn’t be happier for them.”

A post shared by @amyschumer on Feb 15, 2018 at 8:53am PST

Though Schumer sounds happily married, the “I Feel Pretty” star told Glaser that there’s one thing that makes her “really sad” about not being single anymore.”

“This show is called ‘You Up,’ right?” Schumer said. “I don’t ever think I’ll get a text like that again. You know what I mean? And that made me really happy, but also really sad.”

AdvertisementAs of Tuesday, Marvel’s “Black Panther” has made $476.6 million domestically in just two weeks ― and it pulled in the second biggest 10-day total for a theatrical release, behind only “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

It has broken many other records, too: the highest-rated superhero film of all time on Rotten Tomatoes, the biggest opening for a black director ever, and the highest-grossing first week for a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.

Having now earned over $704 million worldwide, box-office experts predict it is “inevitable” that the film will surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few days.

Directed by Ryan Coogler and starring an almost entirely black cast, the movie has made headlines not only for its huge numbers and critical acclaim, but also for dispelling the myth that movies with black leads don’t have box-office pull with audiences of all backgrounds.

Indeed, it seems like every few years a film starring a predominantly black cast or directed by a black filmmaker smashes records. The story always becomes how improbable the success is, and how, perhaps, the movie in question will finally break down barriers and assumptions about the potential of black movies in Hollywood.

Of course, the scale of the success of “Black Panther” must be celebrated, but it shouldn’t be a surprise. In the past few years alone, movies starring and/or directed by black people have gone on to both critical acclaim and commercial success. “Hidden Figures,” starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monáe, was Fox’s second biggest domestic release in 2016 after “Deadpool” and made about $236 million worldwide.

The indie “Moonlight,” last year’s Best Picture Oscar winner, made $413,175 in just four theaters on its opening weekend. With “Get Out,” Jordan Peele made the highest-grossing debut for a writer-director based on an original screenplay, ever. And “Girls Trip” became the first film written, produced, directed by and starring black people to hit the $100 million mark at the box office.

This is all to say: The story that “Black Panther” marks some kind of Hollywood turning point is a non-story. One thing that can be said is that “Black Panther” does add to the conversation surrounding the international appeal of films with black stars. Just as Hollywood has propagated the myth that black movies don’t sell domestically, there’s a similar myth that they don’t sell in foreign markets, particularly in Asian countries like South Korea and China, which have fast become key to the global success of blockbuster movies.

There are those who theorize it’s impossible to promote so-called black films in Asian markets because they are, apparently, too “racist” to accept anything other than a white lead. This doesn’t jive with the fact that films with diverse leads have done incredibly well in China ― “The Fate of the Furious,” with its wildly diverse cast, became China’s second-highest-grossing film in 2017.

It still remains to be seen how “Black Panther” will do in the all-important Asian market of China. (It comes out there on March 9.) It has exceeded expectations elsewhere, making $41.2 million in the U.K. and $36 million in South Korea. With $2.5 million in Vietnam, the film had the fifth biggest opening weekend in industry history in that country, according to Variety.

So, then, is Hollywood finally ready to move past a very familiar narrative?

Miriam Bale, a film critic and senior programmer for the Indie Memphis Film Festival, thinks it probably isn’t, which makes the conversation around black films and the box office “frustrating.”

“The industry says: ‘Black films don’t perform well overseas,’ when that’s clearly not the case. Just as these dinosaur aspects of the industry make films for men, when women are buying tickets,” she told HuffPost.

“It’s too early to say, as far as numbers, but I think ‘Black Panther’s’ international success is going to be record-breaking and so harder to ignore,” Bale added. “And I think one reason for that success is how truly international that release was: premiering on so many continents at the same moment. The slow rollout doesn’t make as much sense anymore when word-of-mouth is international and 24-7.”

Indeed, the problem with the “black films don’t travel” myth is that it operates under the false assumption that black people do not exist in the rest of the world. Asian markets are huge, yes, but “Black Panther” was as much bolstered by numbers in South Korea and Vietnam as it was in countries with large populations of black people, like South Africa, Nigeria and Brazil, where it has even inspired black Brazilians to protest white elitism.

“Black Panther” proves that Hollywood must shift its ideas about what international success truly means. If representation is important to black people in the States, it is just as important (if not moreso) to those in countries abroad that have even less diversity in the media landscape. For example, Germany, where “Black Panther” is currently No. 1.

So the question isn’t whether the success of “Black Panther” will change the way Hollywood views and markets films with predominantly black casts. The question is: When will we stop asking this altogether? When will Hollywood support black-led films without caveats or concessions? Will “Black Panther” truly be the turning point we need?

Paul Dergarabedian, a media analyst at ComScore, believes that “great movies can travel anywhere in the world” and that “Black Panther” stands as “a lesson to anyone who believes a film may be limited in its appeal around the world due to the cultural background of its cast or specific point of view.”

This is an optimistic outlook. But whether it’s true remains to be seen.

Next month, Ava DuVernay’s “A Wrinkle In Time” will debut in theaters, as will the sequel to “Pacific Rim,” starring John Boyega. There’s little doubt that they will do well at the box office at home, and abroad. But the true question is ― will their success at home and worldwide come as a surprise as well?

This story has been updated to include a more recent statistic for the global box office earnings of “Hidden Figures.”As if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s upcoming nuptials weren’t exciting enough, Mel B just hinted that the Spice Girls are going to reunite and perform at the royal wedding on May 19.

The “America’s Got Talent” judge spilled the beans during an appearance on the talk show “The Real” on Tuesday. Co-host Loni Love quizzed the Spice Girl on whether she knew anyone attending the wedding, and Mel B nodded and said that she was going.

“Well, it was [the] five Spice Girls. Why am I so honest?” she said, as the co-hosts and crowd went wild over the news.

“So they invited all five Spice Girls to the royal wedding?” Love asked, and Mel B confirmed with a “yes.”

Despite acknowledging that the group was invited to the nuptials, the Spice Girl wouldn’t confirm what the invitation looked liked.

“See, now that’s getting too personal if I actually describe it,” she said, though she did add that it was a “proper” invitation.

“I’m not saying any more,” the singer jokingly yelled. “I’ve said enough!”

But she didn’t stop there.

“I do have a serious question, though, and maybe you can answer it, maybe not,” Love asked toward the end of the interview clip, while Mel B hilariously sipped tea (after spilling it all!). “Will the Spice Girls be performing at the reception?”

“Ah, swear I’m just like...” the singer slyly said with a smile, before throwing her notecards in the air.

“YES they are performing! Yes!” Love said, while fellow co-host Adrienne Houghton added, “[Mel B] didn’t say it ― we did!”

“I need to go ― I’m gonna be fired!” Mel B joked again.

Kensington Palace told HuffPost it had no comment on the matter, but it looks like Prince Harry has been a fan for years:

Previously, it was rumored that Ed Sheeran was going to perform at the reception, but his rep told HuffPost that wasn’t happening. The singer later denied the rumor himself at the Brit Awards last week.

“No one’s actually looked at my tour dates ― I’m in Ireland, I can’t do it,” Sheeran told the BBC at the award show. “I haven’t been asked either.”

For now, eyes will be on the Spice Girls and their reported reunion tour. The group recently got back together ― for the first time in years ― at Geri Horner’s house at the beginning of the month.

Their former band manager, Simon Fuller, was also there, which makes us think they’re up to something great.James Bennet, at left, meets with a group of New York Times employees in December. A source provided a video of the meeting to HuffPost. New York Times video

In December, New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet met with a group of Times employees to answer questions about his much-questioned opinion section. At the time, A.G. Sulzberger, now publisher of the Times, was conducting a tour of the company he was about to inherit, meeting with employees from different corners of the newspaper. The Q&A session with Bennet was apparently convened in a similar spirit of transparency and goodwill. But according to some Times staffers who were present, little clarity was offered by Bennet and even less goodwill was spread. One person who was there, still angry more than two months later, called Bennet’s answers “equivocal bullshit.”

In the meeting, a recording of which was recently viewed and transcribed by HuffPost, Bennet talked extensively about some of the choices he’d made since his hiring in 2016, the problems he’d encountered, the criticism he’d received both internally and externally, and his successes and failures.

It was as frank an explication as Bennet has given of how he conceives of the opinion section. Slaloming between contradictions, Bennet laid out an ideology of no ideology. The editorial page is beholden to no priors (except when it is). It proudly forswears the idea of right answers (except when it doesn’t). It is humanist and ecumenical but also of the belief, for instance, that some kinds of ethnic cleansing are worthy of debate.

“The world needs this from us right now,” Bennet told the dozen or so New York Times staffers in the room. “I don’t mean to sound pious, but it really is true that this is a crude and dangerously polarized time... And to simply assert that we know what the right answers are is not good for the democracy.”

Some answers, though, are evidently so “right” in Bennet’s view that they can simply be asserted. “I mean, I think we are pro-capitalism,” he said later in the meeting. “The New York Times is in favor of capitalism because it has been the greatest engine of, it’s been the greatest anti-poverty program and engine of progress that we’ve seen.”

Bennet’s ideology of no ideology admits to a few other caveats. In the meeting, he talked about how some issues are “settled law” and thus beyond debate, citing the evils of Nazism and the science of climate change. He also talked about which views are too “poisonous” to be given an airing in his pages, such as Richard Spencer’s white nationalism. But even then, perhaps uneasy with the idea of a value-neutral editorial page having any values at all, Bennet wobbled:

We talk a lot about the Richard Spencer test, you know: Would we publish Richard Spencer in the pages of The New York Times? The answer to that is no... But the reasons we wouldn’t right now are largely because the guy is — he represents a particularly poisonous point of view. And that isn’t having those kinds of consequences. You know, it’s not a, it’s not a giant movement.

Is it the poisonous point of view that disqualifies Spencer, or is it the supposedly narrow scope of his white nationalism and its lack of consequences? If Spencer’s ethnic cleansing program scored favorably in the next Gallup poll, would he then be worthy of op-ed space in The New York Times?

“We’ve published Vladimir Putin,” Bennet said. “Should we not allow Vladimir Putin into our pages? It’s hard to say. It’s hard to say that that would be doing a service to our readers. But as you can see, I mean, I struggle to articulate what those boundaries are.”

In an effort to elaborate on how he understands those boundaries, Bennet brought up an op-ed published about a year ago in which an Israeli settler called for Palestinian apartheid:

We had a big argument over a piece by a settler. And you know, pick your issue. For some people it’s climate change, for some people it’s trans rights, for others it’s a two-state solution and the fate of the Palestinians. In this case, it was the settler saying, look, the two-state solution is dead and [it’s] time to face reality, and here’s some alternative paths for what the future would look like. And we had a real debate about whether this piece was crossing a line, because was it denying personhood to the Palestinians? Was it an act of, kind of, hate speech in a sense? I felt strongly that we should publish the piece and we did, as did others. Because this particular viewpoint is hugely consequential. It actually is creating reality on the ground. To pretend that somehow we would be — either to think that we were legitimating that point of view by having it in our pages or to tell ourselves that we were somehow changing the reality by not allowing it into our pages seems to me to be deluded a little bit. And our readers need to hear it, like, unmediated, I think. They need to confront these arguments. And we published that piece, and we faced that.

To be clear, the “reality” that the column described, and that Bennet decided his audience needed to confront, is that “the presence of these Arab residents alone does not warrant a new country,” in the writer’s words. “Arabs can live in Israel, as other minorities do, with personal rights, not national rights.” One of the “alternative paths” offered was “an exchange of populations with Arab countries,” in which “Palestinians in Judea and Samaria would be offered generous compensation to emigrate voluntarily.”

The opinion section in general is a case study in how essentially liberal institutions are undermined by the tools of their own liberalism. Illiberalism seeps into the hollows created by seemingly high-minded values about debate and the marketplace of ideas. The settled science about climate gets quickly unsettled by a columnist like Bret Stephens, a Bennet hire, who smuggles climate denialism onto the page by couching it in progressive-sounding language about debate, certainty and ecumenicism.

The specter of Stephens hovered at the edges of the December meeting, even when he wasn’t being discussed directly. In an earlier meeting between Sulzberger and the same group of Times staffers (video of which was also viewed by HuffPost), someone asked about Stephens’ handling of climate change: “So when Bret Stephens is writing a column and there’s information in there about climate change, how does the editorial section handle that?” Sulzberger emphasized the need for columnists, who aren’t heavily edited, to “have everything buttoned up,” though he allowed that “we are not an organization that [has] fact-checkers.”

In the meeting with Bennet, an employee asked how he makes sure his writers aren’t misrepresenting facts. Bennet replied:

You know we do, I mean at a very basic level, we fact-check our work. So, there is a kind of layer there of having a — but the harder question is representation of fact. And that’s where we’re really, you know, are instilling rules of the road and kind of values for how we approach argumentation and hiring for people. And you know, the first-order value is intellectual honesty. And that means — and God knows we don’t succeed at this every day — but the goal is, you’re supposed to take on the hard arguments on the other side, not the easy arguments. Not the straw men, but the actual substantive, kind of toughest arguments and acknowledge when the other side has a point.

Bennet was unstinting in his praise of Stephens: “I know that there was a lot of — and I experienced it — a lot of criticism and concern about him. And you guys may disagree or there may be people who do, but I just think he’s an exceptional writer and thinker.”

This is one way of looking at Stephens’ work. Reading him might lead you to a different conclusion. After Stephens wrote his notorious April 2017 column in which he questioned established climate science in his sidelong way, he was forced to correct the only line containing any reference to actual science three days later.

And he was just getting started. The first quarter of Stephens’ Feb. 9 defense of Woody Allen consisted of his retelling an entirely unrelated story for no apparent reason other than to remind us that someone was wrong one time. He wrote that “if Allen is in fact a pedophile, he appears to have acted on his evil fantasies exactly once,” as if that were a mitigating factor. (“Compare that to Larry Nassar’s 265 identified victims,” Stephens wrote.) He adduced to his argument a court ruling that actually undermined his framing of the case as a matter of a grownup’s childhood memories.

In October, Stephens wrote about a reckoning that existed only because countless women had risked their livelihoods to expose a serial predator and alleged rapist, saying, “Of all of the dismaying and disgusting details of the Harvey Weinstein saga, none is more depressing than this: It has so few heroes.”

The criticism of Stephens hasn’t just come from outsiders. On Saturday, one of The New York Times’ star reporters, Mike Isaac, tweeted the following:

Isaac’s tweet has since been deleted. It’s not clear whether he deleted the tweet of his own volition or whether he was asked to do so by his editors. We do know, however, that Times opinion columnists enjoy a special set of privileges ― like speaking their minds on Twitter ― not extended to the general newsroom staff.

In any case, none of Stephens’ infelicities really matter if writing and thinking are valued primarily as exercises in provocation rather than persuasion. In the December meeting, Bennet described columnists as “people who are paid to have very, very strong convictions, and to believe that they’re right.” This creates what he called the “real moral hazards in the opinion environment in which we want to, say, we want to convene lots of voices from lots of point of view.”

In Bennet’s view, editorials — the unsigned pieces attributed to the Times editorial board as a whole — offer an antidote to morally or factually ambiguous pieces published on the opposite page. While the rest of the section is enacting a spirited performance of epistemological inquiry, the editorials get to carry the tablets down the mountain.

I would worry and personally be concerned about saying we’re indifferent to what the right answer is, right? We don’t just want to let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools of thought contend, and we’ll just provide the platform... What the editorials allow us to do, is to say on matters of real consequence, where for one reason or another, this institution has felt a kind of historic connection, the Times is going to come down.

There are right answers, sometimes, at least on matters of “real consequence.” This helps explain at least one recent bizarre move from the op-ed page. On Feb. 12, two days before the massacre in Parkland, Florida, Bennet’s section ran a piece titled “Background Checks Are Not the Answer to Gun Violence.” The author was John Lott, a man famous for distorting data to push the pro-gun agenda from which he makes his money. This would certainly seem like an astounding oversight from the paper of record.

On Feb. 17, however, a Times editorial included this paragraph: “In a speech last month, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions said undocumented immigrants are far more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, a claim he found in a paper by John Lott, the disreputable economist best known for misusing statistics to suit his own ideological ends. In this case, it appears Mr. Lott misread his own data, which came from Arizona and in fact showed the opposite of what he claimed: Undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens, as the vast majority of research on the topic has found.” (Links were present in the original text.)

This was, apparently, one of those matters of real consequence on which Bennet felt it was the Times’ duty to take a stance. And who better than the editorial page of The New York Times to counter the disinformation put out by the op-ed page of The New York Times.

If Bennet held his December meeting in an effort to win favor with staffers, it seems to have backfired, according to some people in the room.

“People were not satisfied with his answers,” one staffer who attended the meeting told HuffPost in a text message, “since his answers were equivocal bullshit that didn’t really address that the opinion section abuses fact and elevates white male conservative voices under the guise of ‘diversity of thought.’ And that he admits to making mistakes without any concern or even acknowledgement of what the consequences of those ‘mistakes’ actually are.”

As for what those consequences might be, the employee cited “erosion of trust in the rest of what the NYT does, people coming to conclusions based on incorrect facts and then never seeing the correction (if there is one), and choosing to pay money and give a platform to these white dudes instead of marginalized voices who wouldn’t otherwise get their story told (and marginalizing them even more by publishing their bad takes).” A Vanity Fair piece published on Monday quoted a senior newsroom figure who said, “The newsroom feels embarrassed.”

In a statement to HuffPost, a New York Times spokesperson said: “We prioritize communicating with our employees and providing open forums for them to hear updates and offer comments. Leaders throughout the organization, including James, have been doing that on a regular basis. We’re a large company and we don’t expect every employee to agree with every decision we make.”

Two months or so after this meeting, the scrutiny on Bennet’s op-ed page has only heightened. Staff editor Bari Weiss, also a Bennet hire, infuriated a number of newsroom-side staffers when she wrote a tweet referring to American-born Olympic ice skater Mirai Nagasu as an immigrant, only to double down when called out on it, delete the original tweet and lie about what she’d actually said. Around the same time, Bennet announced the hiring of a new columnist, Quinn Norton, only to fire her roughly seven hours later after Twitter users discovered she’d previously boasted about her friendships with neo-Nazis.

But none of this is at odds with the vision of the section as laid out in the meeting by Bennet. Provocations were made; liberal readers were riled. The world was just getting what it needed.

During an appearance on the new Netflix series “The Joel McHale Show,” Bell opened up about how she recently caught a nasty “bug” from her 3-year-old daughter, Delta.

“I did have anal worms two weeks ago,” she told McHale. “I swear to God. They’re called pinworms.”

Bell explained that it all started when she noticed that the carpets at her daughter’s preschool were missing. When she asked about them, the school said they were being cleaned because there was a pinworm outbreak.

Bell, not knowing what pinworms were, said she immediately Googled them and found out they were “so, so contagious.”

“Your kids get them because they put their hands in their mouth and they lay eggs,” she explained.

Bell said she had a feeling that her daughter caught pinworms when she noticed her scratching her butt.

“You have to monitor it and look in their poop and when you wipe their butt,” she said. “Sure enough I wiped and saw a little white worm.”

Soon enough, Bell also caught the little critters. When McHale asked Bell if it was painful, she said, “No, but it was very itchy.”Stringer . / Reuters

School shootings have shaped the experiences of a generation of younger Americans, a new survey shows. But there’s not a lot of evidence that living through so many massacres has changed young people’s views about gun control.

Young Americans worried about school shootings — and practiced how to survive them — more often than their parents and grandparents did, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds. Around a fifth of Americans under age 45 say that, growing up, they were at least somewhat worried about a mass shooting at their school. Just 7 percent of people 45 and older remember being similarly worried. Not a single person polled who was over the age of 65 said that, as a child, they practiced what to do in the event of a school shooting. Just 2 percent of those aged 45-64, and 12 percent of those aged 30-44, had practiced how to survive a shooting. But for adults under age 30, the figure rose to nearly one-third.

On average, people over age 65 said that the first mass shooting they could remember didn’t take place until they were 50 years old. People under age 30 said, on average, that they were 12.

Overall, more than 80 percent of Americans say they feel mass shootings have grown more common in the past decade. (Whether such shootings have actually become more common, or simply more deadly, appears to depend on exactly how they’re measured.)

What’s less clear is what effect this all might have on young Americans’ views about gun control. Several recent polls have found a sharp uptick in support for new gun control laws. But in many surveys, younger adults don’t appear especially likely to stand behind such efforts.

Adults under age 30 are more likely than older Americans to believe that Congress should take action to reduce shootings, according to another HuffPost/YouGov survey taken just after the massacre in Parkland, Florida, but they’re less likely to favor making gun laws stricter, or to count gun issues among their top priorities. A Marist poll found similar results, with 64 percent of 18-to-29-year-old voters favoring more stringent gun laws, compared to 71 percent among voters as a whole. Adults under 45 have virtually the same opinion of the National Rifle Association as do those age 45 and older, according to results from CNN and the polling firm SSRS.

None of those polls capture the views of those currently under the age of 18, who are only rarely surveyed.

“Now that you’ve had an entire generation of kids growing up around mass shootings, and the fact that they’re starting to be able to vote, explains how we’re going to have this change,” Parkland survivor David Hogg told ABC in an interview. “Kids are not going to accept this.”

It’s less clear to what extent their opinions, and enthusiasm for the issue, carries on to their peers. But there’s evidence to suggest that those currently in school are being more acutely exposed to the threat of school shootings than the generations before them.

In the decade between 2003 and 2013, the share of public schools conducting active shooter drills rose from about 47 percent to just above 70 percent, according to statistics reported by Vox.

A third of parents with children under 18 in the HuffPost/YouGov poll say they’ve talked to their children about the Florida shooting. Asked about those conversations, many said they’d encouraged their children to tell an adult if they saw another student acting strangely or making threats.

Parents also tried to offer advice on how to react in the event of a shooting. “Hide. Escape at the first possible safe moment. Do not try to stop the person. Be very quiet,” one woman said she’d suggested. Another woman said she’d told her child to “grab books and put [them in a] book bag and place in front of chest to act as a bulletproof vest.”

Some said they’d discussed opinions on policies, which ranged from a belief that armed teachers could have “truly protected their students” to a conviction that when it comes to a gun like an AR-15, “no “normal person needs that kind of weaponry.”

And others said they’d simply had to reassure their children.

“My 5-year-old wanted to know if he was going to have to fight a shooter at school,” one mother said.

Haspel now is all but assured to win confirmation in a vote before the full Senate that could come as early as Thursday.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, announced he would support Haspel on Tuesday, giving cover to several other of his Democratic colleagues who later said they would also vote to confirm President Donald Trump’s controversial nominee to lead the agency.

“I believe [Haspel] is someone who can and will stand up to the President if ordered to do something illegal or immoral—like a return to torture,” Warner said in a statement.

Shortly after Warner’s statement, moderate Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) ― who are facing tough re-election fights this year ― also said that they intended to support Haspel as CIA director.

In a letter to Warner on Monday, Haspel said that the CIA shouldn’t have undertaken its controversial enhanced interrogation program ― which included waterboarding ― because such methods “did damage to our officers and our standing in the world.” Haspel’s letter went further than her remarks in her confirmation hearing last week, in which she refused to say whether the torture program was immoral.

One surprise announcement regarding Haspel’s nomination on Tuesday came from Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), the freshman senator from deep red Alabama. Jones pointed to Haspel’s role in the George W. Bush-era interrogation program as a reason why he opposed her leading the CIA.

“There is a legal and moral responsibility that comes with operating in secrecy. Some of Ms. Haspel’s past actions and beliefs did not meet that standard. We must choose leaders that consistently embody our highest ideals, rather than our darkest moments,” Jones said in a statement.The New Jersey Senate has passed a bill that would allow cities to establish charitable funds to accept property taxes so homeowners could get around a new federal law by declaring them deductible charitable contributions.

The new federal tax law caps the deduction for all state and local income, property and other taxes at $10,000, which is well below the level that many property owners pay in high-tax states like New Jersey. The deduction was previously unlimited.

State officials have been debating since the federal tax law was passed in December about how to help their taxpayers not get dinged with bigger federal tax bills that will fall heaviest on certain states.

New Jersey’s Senate passed the measure, S1893, on a 28-9 vote Monday. It would allow municipalities to set up charitable funds for taxes. Local governments could give tax credits to residents who contribute to the fund, allowing them to offset almost all of their property tax bill — likely around 90 percent. Then residents would take a charity write-off for their property taxes on their federal income taxes.

California, Nebraska, Virginia and Washington state are considering similar “workaround” legislation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The New Jersey bill’s sponsor, Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), called it a “short-term measure to deal with how New Jersey taxpayers got their teeth kicked in” by Congress, the New Jersey Advance reported.

“Congress made the decision to favor some states over others,” Sarlo said at the hearing for the bill. “The net effect is the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act actually raises taxes for states like New Jersey.”

The state Assembly must pass the bill for it to become law. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has said he supports the measure. Murphy has called the federal tax law a “gut punch” to the middle class of his state.

Some lawmakers railed against the law, saying the Internal Revenue Service would never accept it. It’s uncertain that such a law would withstand a legal challenge by the IRS.

But if New Jersey and other states succeed with their federal tax workaround plans, the federal government could lose billions of dollars expected to come into the treasury from capping state deductions.

AdvertisementHe has been downgraded from SCI (sensitive compartmented information) access to Secret level, according to the publication.

All other White House aides working on high-level interim clearances also had their access downgraded, according to a memo reportedly sent to staffers on Friday. Earlier that same day, Trump said he would leave it up to his chief of staff, John Kelly, to decide what access Kushner should have.

“General Kelly respects Jared a lot and General Kelly will make that call,” Trump said at a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the time.

Kushner no longer receives the President’s Daily Brief, a top-secret roundup of global issues compiled by intelligence officials. His access to the highly classified intelligence briefing has been cut off in the past few weeks, sources told Reuters.

Kushner is reportedly accepting the decision and “will not ask for special permission” from the president, according to CNN.

Kusher has the vague title of senior adviser. Throughout his career at the White House, he has been assigned a wide-ranging portfolio on an array of highly sensitive issues ― solving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, keeping the U.S.-Mexico relationship afloat, and heading up diplomacy with China, for example.

“This action will definitely impact Kushner’s ability to cure the world of all ills but not necessarily prevent him from doing aspects of his job,” Mark Zaid, a lawyer who specializes in national security law told HuffPost in an email. One of the most significant effects of Kushner’s clearance downgrade is no longer having access to the President’s Daily Brief, according to Zaid.

Government officials who perform the type of high-level diplomacy Kushner is tasked with doing typically get access to highly sensitive raw data about the players involved in the negotiations. Without the highest-level security clearance, Kushner will have to get a “reduced and more limited version” of those background briefings, said Brad Moss, also a national security lawyer.

“It really undermines his ability to do the work he’s supposed to be doing and makes him into more of a figurehead,” Moss said.

Kushner will also lose access to the National Security Agency’s intercepted communications, Ned Price, a former White House and CIA official, wrote on Twitter.

“Whether or not he could’ve been successful before, he no longer can be an effective Middle East mediator,” Price wrote.

The government officials who typically hold Secret clearances are in charge of the “nuts and bolts” of running the national security apparatus, Moss said. They do things like submit paperwork so that the CIA can get resources and equipment to a particular area and make sure that policymakers have the relevant information to give a briefing.

Kushner’s colleagues have an incentive to block off Kushner’s access to highly classified information. If they aren’t careful, they could lose their own clearances — or even face criminal charges, said Moss.

Ultimately, Kushner’s ability to do his job will depend on how strictly people around him restrict his access to sensitive meetings, calls or documents, Zaid wrote.

Questions of security clearance for White House staff members were raised after the resignation of staff secretary Rob Porter, who was accused by his two ex-wives of mental, emotional and physical abuse. Top officials, including Kelly, allegedly knew of the complaints of abuse against Porter but still gave him temporary security clearance.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to answer questions regarding Kushner’s security clearance during a press briefing earlier Tuesday. Last week, Sanders said Kushner would continue the work he has been doing whether or not he has full security clearance.If you’re still swooning over that gorgeous estate in the Oscar-nominated “Call Me by Your Name,” you should know that it’s officially up for grabs.

Michael McCormack, 53, on Monday took up the post as Australia’s new deputy prime minister after the previous occupant, Barnaby Joyce, quit following weeks of controversy over his affair with a former staffer.

Congrats to Michael McCormack, new deputy PM, who wrote this in 1993 when I was eleven. pic.twitter.com/mlhi80W73k — Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch) February 25, 2018

Some LGBTQI rights activists have expressed concern over McCormack’s elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister.

While welcoming McCormack’s apologies, just.equal spokesman Rodney Croome called on him to “walk the talk” and support initiatives to help LGBTQI Australians overcome isolation, prejudice and suicide in parts of rural Australia.

“The apologies Mr. McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he has stepped in to, he needs to walk the talk,” Croome said in a statement.

“He needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.”

McCormack issued a fresh statement in August last year apologizing for the editorial. When he issued the August apology, he was small business minister and had ministerial responsibility for the same-sex marriage postal vote.

“I have grown and learnt not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique,” he said at the time.

Australian’s overwhelmingly voted yes in the national survey, and same-sex marriage was legalised in December last year.

McCormack replaces Barnaby Joyce, who made global headlines last year when he threatened to execute Johnny Depp’s dogs and more recently when he was forced to quit the role of deputy prime minister following weeks of controversy surrounding his extra-marital affair with a former staffer who is now pregnant.BEIJING (Reuters) ― China’s ruling Communist Party on Sunday set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely, with a proposal to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office.

Since taking office more than five years ago, Xi has overseen a radical shake-up of the party, including taking down top leaders once thought untouchable as part of his popular war on deep-rooted corruption.

Sunday’s announcement, carried by state news agency Xinhua, gave few details. It said the proposal had been made by the party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies. The proposal also covers the vice president position.

Xi, 64, is currently required by China’s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament opening on March 5.

There is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. He began his second term as head of the party and military in October at the end of a party congress held once every five years.

Zhang Lifan, a historian and political commentator, said the news was not unexpected, and it was hard to predict exactly how long Xi could stay on in power.

“In theory he could serve longer than Mugabe but in reality, no one is sure exactly what will happen,” Zhang said, referring to Zimbabwe’s former president whose four decades in office ended in November, after the army and his former political allies moved to force him out.

Though positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the People’s Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service,

“If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!,” wrote one Weibo user.

EMPEROR XI

Constitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament, which is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party - meaning the reform will not be blocked.

There has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms.

The October party congress ended without appointing a clear eventual successor for Xi.

However, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point, Xi could be given a party position that also enables him to stay on as long as he likes.

Xi is currently the party’s general secretary, but not chairman. China’s first three leaders after the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 all carried the title party chairman -Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since.

“Whether Xi ends up being Party Chairman or just remains Party Secretary doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether he holds onto power,” said Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University of China in Beijing.

“Titles don’t matter as much in China as they do in the West. Here what matters is whether you are the emperor,” he added. “In China, ordinary people already consider Xi Jinping to be the emperor.”

EYES ON VICE PRESIDENT

Mao, the founder of Communist China and still held in god-like awe by many Chinese, died while still Communist Party chairman in 1976, having never retired.

State media has also increasingly been using the term “lingxiu” to refer to Xi, which means “leader”. Distinct from the standard usage of “lingdao” for leader, “lingxiu” evokes grander, almost spiritual, connotations.

Mao, for example, was referred to as “lingxiu”, but Xi’s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, were not.

In a Sunday commentary on its WeChat account, state television said: “The people love the people’s ‘lingxiu’!”, above a picture of Xi being greeted by an adoring crowd in Sichuan province earlier this month.

The move to lift the presidential term limits is not unexpected. The party has been laying the groundwork for Xi not to have to go.

One of Xi’s closest political allies, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, stepped down from the party’s Standing Committee - the seven-man body that runs China - in October.

Aged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire. But he has been chosen as a parliament delegate this year and is likely to become vice president, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say.

The move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that would set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power too after he reaches what is normally considered retirement age.

The Central Committee also proposed other changes to the country’s constitution, including inserting “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” into the constitution, referring to Xi’s rather wordy guiding political thought that is already in the party constitution.

The constitution will further ensure that party control over the country is not in any doubt, too, strengthening existing clauses about the leading role of the Communist Party in China.

“The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics,” Xinhua cited one of the proposed new clauses as saying.
