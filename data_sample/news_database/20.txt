Teacher strikes are generating a healthy focus on how far public education funding has fallen over the past decade. The full explanation, however, goes beyond basic funding cuts. It involves systematic advantages in terms of funding, students and teachers for charter schools and voucher programs as compared to traditional public schools. Increasing public teacher salaries may end the current protests, but speaking as an expert in education law and policy, I believe it won’t touch the new normal in which public education is no longer many states’ first priority.

My forthcoming research shows that, from funding and management practices to teacher and student policies, states are giving charter schools and private schools a better deal than public schools. These better deals have fueled enormous growth in charter schools and voucher programsthat is now nearly impossible to unwind.

The most basic shift occurred between 2008 and 2012. Florida and North Carolina illustrate the nationwide trend. Each cut public education funding by 20 percent or more in three years. During the same period, North Carolina lifted its cap on new charter schools and quickly doubled its charter school spending. Florida similarly changed the rules for its voucher program and quadrupled its size.

Favorable funding practices

States also passed laws to offer charters and private schools more money for each student they took. Florida increased the value of each voucher by roughly US $2,000. Nevada went even further, passing legislation that would convert every single public education dollar into a voucher dollar. While the state Supreme Court later declared the program unconstitutional, it has not stopped other states like Arizona from pursuing similar programs.

Several states also began lifting income eligibility limits. Previously, states had provided vouchers only for low-income students. But new voucher programs made them available to wealthy students as well, even those who already had access to excellent public schools.

Charter schools benefited from similar advantages in some states. Ohio and New Jersey funneled charter school funding through school districts, but the states’ antiquated funding formulas and charter reimbursement rates force districts to send charter schools more per pupil than they receive from the state.

Pennsylvania has a similar scheme, but it has proven so lopsided that it expanded deficits in Philadelphia and nearly bankrupted the Chester School District. Chester was paying the local charter school roughly $40,000 per special education student, including for those students with relatively low-cost needs. Arizona took a simpler route. It shielded charter schools from the budget cuts it was imposing on traditional public schools.

Less oversight

Once they receive the money, charter schools and private schools receiving vouchers can spend it almost any way they want. Private schools operate just as they had before. And charter schools – though technically public schools – are exempt from typical financial oversight.

Laws require public schools to award contracts through a transparent process and prohibit public schools from entering contracts that pose conflicts of interest. Charters can award contracts to almost anyone they like – and on any terms they like. This includes awarding contracts to companies that have close financial ties with the charter. A person can start a purportedly nonprofit charter school and then have that charter purchase all of its services and supplies from a company owned by that same person. As a result, the person can turn a profit on staffing, facilities, technology and supplies. National Heritage Academies runs this exact type of business model in North Carolina and continues to grow its campuses.

The same activity could constitute fraud or criminality in a public school. Yet, state law permits it for charters. As Thomas Kelley’s analysisreveals, many of the charter schools that state law calls nonprofits would not qualify for that same label under federal law.

No checks on profiteering

Even well-meaning charter schools have been unable to stop this profit-taking. The Ohio Supreme Court, for instance, found that state law dictates that everything a private charter school company purchases with public dollars – from desks to computers – belongs to the private company, not the public. The same is true of buildings that charter schools lease. Charter school operators reap their largest profits through unreasonably high lease payments on buildings that the public will never own.

States also allow private schools and charters to treat students differently. While public schools must provide disadvantaged students with a host of special services, private schools take vouchers with almost no strings attached. And they are increasingly taking high-achieving middle-income and nondisabled students who cost less to educate and typically do not demand specialized services.

Charter schools’ advantages come in their ability to recruit students and cap enrollment. Public schools must serve everyone in their community. The clearest proof that charters don’t is in the data. For instance, Newark charter schools enroll less than half the percentage of special education students and English language learners as the Newark public schools. Newark charters also enroll significantly fewer low-income students. In North Carolina, charter schools are increasingly enrolling white students, while public schools increasingly enroll students of color. In Minneapolis, 80 percent of charters are racially isolated by race, socioeconomic status or both.

The most obvious advantage, however, is with teachers. Most states exempt charter schools from teacher certification requirements. Half exempt charters from complying with high-stakes teacher evaluation systems. More than three-quarters exempt charters from the teacher salary and collective bargaining rules. In short, states permit charters to hire teachers that would be deemed unqualified in a public school and pay them less.

The need for a structural shift

The current debate over school funding must move beyond teacher salaries and whether the books in public schools are tattered. Those conversations ignore the systematic policies that disadvantage public schools. Increasing public school teachers’ salaries alone won’t fix the problem. The public school teaching force has already shrunk. Class sizes have already risen. And the rules that advantage charter and private schools remain firmly in place.

Long-term solutions require a reexamination of these preferences. As a state constitutional matter, the law requires that states make public education their first priority. It is not enough to make education one of several competing priorities. And as a practical matter, states cannot continue to ask public schools to work with whatever is left over and then criticize them for doing a poor job. This cycle creates a circular justification for dismantling public education when states should be repairing it.*NSYNC member Lance Bass delivered an emotional speech on Monday as he joined former bandmates JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and Justin Timberlake to receive a (long-overdue) star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Bass spoke at length about his journey toward accepting himself as a gay man after the band broke up in 2002.

“Growing up in Mississippi and in a Southern Baptist church, in a town where everyone knows your business, I had a secret. I was gay,” Bass told the crowd. “At the time, I thought I’d never be able to tell anyone. ... I didn’t want to jeopardize the careers of these guys up here, much less the hundreds of amazing people who worked tirelessly to bring *NSYNC to the world.”

Check out Bass’ full speech in the video above. His comments about coming out start around the three-minute mark.

“So many nights on stage, I’d see so many young, gay fans singing their hearts out and I wanted so badly to let you know, I was you,” Bass added. “I just didn’t have the strength then. But I do today, and so let me say loud and proud to all my LGBT brothers and sisters, who embrace me and show me the way to be who I am, thank you so much.”

Bass also talked to HuffPost about his struggle to come out.

“The ’90s were a different time,” he said in an interview published Monday. “If you came out, if anyone knew you were gay, it was a disaster and people really flipped out. I felt like if anyone found out that I was gay, the record label would immediately drop us and the fans would hate us ― these were all the crazy things that went through my head as a teenager. So, I just trained myself into being a certain person and became that person.”

“I just thought if I even told just one single person it would get out, which it would have,” he said. “So that secret stayed with me and me only.”A group of conservative House members has drafted articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, multiple news organizations reported Monday.

The reported draft is the latest in an ongoing feud between Congress members allied with President Donald Trump and the Justice Department over its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Members of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives led by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), recently finalized the draft, The Washington Post reported.

Meadows called it “a last-resort option if the Department of Justice fails to respond” to congressional requests for documents pertaining to the Russia investigation and another federal inquiry into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.

A representative of Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The impeachment articles accuse Rosenstein of several transgressions, The Hill reported, including that he violated federal law by not immediately complying with a congressional subpoena to release documents regarding FBI surveillance during the 2016 presidential election.

The documents also accuse Rosenstein of “knowingly provided misleading statements related to his supervision of the initial Department of Justice investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged contacts with Russia,” according to The Hill.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who oversees the House Intelligence Committee, threatened to impeach Rosenstein, along with FBI Director Christopher Wray, earlier this month. “I can tell you that we’re not going to just hold in contempt. We will have a plan to hold in contempt and impeach,” Nunes said in an appearance on Fox.

Trump and a handful of vocal conservatives in Congress have long mistrusted Rosenstein over his role in the Russia investigation. The president reportedly considered firing Rosenstein last summer.

But an impeachment proceeding is unlikely to progress far. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the Speaker of the House, and other GOP leaders in the House have largely remained silent amid calls for Rosenstein’s impeachment or firing.

USA Today also noted that the last time a member of the executive branch other than a president was impeached by the House was in 1876, when Ulysses S. Grant’s secretary of war, William Belknap, was accused of taking kickbacks. He was acquitted in the Senate.This edited photograph of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Kevin Hart will stick with you for a while.

In Wolf’s first major interview since her polarizing roast of President Donald Trump, his administration, Congress and members of the media who cover them, Wolf told Terry Gross of NPR’s “Fresh Air” that she is proud she stayed true to herself and her brand of comedy and didn’t cater to the room.

“I wouldn’t change a single word that I said. I’m very happy with what I said, and I’m glad I stuck to my guns,” Wolf said in an interview set to air Tuesday.

“I don’t know, maybe I’m projecting this, but I think sometimes they look at a woman and they think ‘Oh, she’ll be nice,’ and if you’ve seen any of my comedy you know that I don’t – I’m not,” Wolf added.

“I’m very happy with what I said, and I’m glad I stuck to my guns.” - Michelle Wolf

Wolf’s fans applauded her on-point takedown of Washington’s most powerful players. She called out members of the administration for repeatedly lying and blamed journalists in the room for contributing to Trump’s rise to prominence.

The comic’s set prompted several conservatives and some high-profile members of the press to condemn her, in some cases calling on Wolf to publicly apologize. The president of the White House Correspondents’ Association released a statement amid the uproar, saying Wolf’s set was “not in the spirit” of the event’s mission. Trump fired off an inevitable incensed tweet about the event he didn’t attend, calling Wolf “filthy.”

Fellow comedians and several journalists rushed to Wolf’s defense. Wolf also defended jokes she made about White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Critics said she attacked Sanders’ physical appearance, but Wolf said the jokes focused on her behavior.

“I mean, if there is two people that I actually made fun of their looks on Saturday, it was Mitch McConnell and Chris Christie,” Wolf told Gross. “I made fun of Mitch McConnell’s neck and I did a small jab at Chris Christie’s weight, and no one is jumping to their defense.”

The comedian also said she thought Sanders seemed to be protesting the press throughout the night when the event was not televised.

“They were giving out awards, and everyone was standing to congratulate the people who were getting awards, and Sarah was sitting,” Wolf said. “I would say if this is about celebrating the media, she wasn’t there to celebrate the media.”

AdvertisementGreen Day’s seminal 2004 hit “American Idiot” could top the singles music chart in the United Kingdom this summer if an anti-President Donald Trump campaign continues to gain strength.

More than 14,000 have joined a Facebook page that calls on people to download the song between July 6 and July 12 ― days ahead of Trump’s visit, tentatively scheduled for July 13. The American rock band originally wrote “American Idiot” about former President George W. Bush.

If enough people buy the track or stream it online during that period, the old song may hit No. 1 in time for Trump’s visit to the U.K.

Check out the “American Idiot” music video here:

Organizers of the Facebook campaign described the effort as “a peaceful protest against a racist, misogynist, pussy-grabbing, elitist, healthcare-destroying, climate change-denying, bullshitting, backward, orange shitgibbon of an excuse for a man.”

Here a video detailing their protest:

Green Day has not yet commented on the campaign. But the group does have a history of bashing Trump.

The band changed the “American Idiot” song lyrics from “subliminal mind-fuck America” to “subliminal mind-Trump America” at the 2016 MTV Europe Music Awards. At the 2016 American Music Awards, the group added an extra line to the track “Bang Bang”: “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

In the January 2017 music video for “Troubled Times,” Green Day showed a Trump-like figure spewing divisive rhetoric to crowds:

And in November 2017, the group portrayed Trump as a zombie-like creature in the official clip for “Back in the USA.”If the #WHCD dinner did anything tonight, it made the chasm between journalists and those who don't trust us, even wider.

As the U.S. Supreme Court weighs whether business owners with religious objections should be allowed to refuse to serve LGBTQ customers, a majority of Americans — and a wide spectrum of religious denominations ― remain opposed to such faith-based service refusals.

Sixty percent of Americans oppose allowing a small-business owner in their state to refuse products or services to gay or lesbian people if doing so would violate the owner’s religious beliefs, according to the 2017 American Values Atlas, an annual survey from The Public Religion Research Institute. The survey of approximately 40,000 people in all 50 states, published on Tuesday, also found that Americans are increasingly supportive of LGBTQ rights almost three years since same-sex marriage was legalized across the United States.

Notably, most religious groups agreed that gay and lesbian people should not be discriminated against in the form of service-based refusals ― including black Protestants (65 percent), white mainline Protestants (60 percent), and white Catholics (59 percent). That objection was also strong among non-Christian groups, including Jews (70 percent) and Muslims (59 percent). Religiously-unaffiliated Americans, a growing demographic, strongly opposed the policy (72 percent).

The only groups that did believe that business owners should be allowed to refuse to serve gay or lesbian people on religious grounds were white evangelical Protestants and Mormons. Fifty-three percent of both groups sided with the religious business owners.

PRRI CEO Robert P. Jones said the survey results illustrate that most Americans think small businesses that are open to the public should serve all customers, regardless of the religious objections of the owners.

“White evangelical Protestants and Mormons — the only major religious groups who support these measures — are a clear minority, even among religious Americans,” Jones said in a statement. “While they may hold outsized political influence, combined they represent less than one in five Americans today.”

The Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case of a Colorado cake baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple in 2012. Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, an evangelical Christian, believes it is within his First Amendment rights to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. The couple, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, claim the baker is discriminating against them because of their sexual orientation.

President Donald Trump’s administration, which has formed close alliances with evangelical Christians, has issued an amicus brief in support of the baker.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case in late spring.

The Trump administration has also attempted to undercut federal protections for LGBTQ people. In October, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a directive telling executive branch agencies to accommodate religious liberty to the “greatest extent practicable and permitted by law.” Civil rights groups were alarmed by the move, saying that the language about religious liberty merely gave people with religious objections to same-sex relationships the “license to discriminate.”

According to the PRRI study, 70 percent of Americans were supportive of laws that would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing. This support was robust among both Christian and non-Christian religious groups, including Jews (80 percent), religiously-unaffiliated Americans (79 percent), white Catholics (74 percent), white mainline Protestants (71 percent), Mormons (69 percent), black Protestants (65 percent), and white evangelical Protestants (54 percent).

After the Supreme Court’s 2015 landmark decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, popular support increased dramatically, according to the PRRI study. In fact, the organization found that for the first time, a majority of all racial and ethnic groups now support same-sex marriage. Researchers documented double-digit increases in support among white (53 percent vs. 63 percent), black (41 percent vs. 52 percent), and Hispanic (51 percent vs. 61 percent) Americans between 2013 and 2017. Majorities of Asian-Pacific Islander Americans (72 percent) and Native Americans (56 percent) also expressed support for marriage equality.

Robyn Henderson-Espinoza, a queer, Latinx theologian based in Nashville, Tennessee, told HuffPost they believe that communities of color have become more comfortable talking about sexuality and same-sex desire.

“I think our communities of color are beginning to untangle the compulsory heteronormativity that has shaped our communities,” Henderson-Espinoza told HuffPost by email.

Most religious groups also support marriage equality, including white mainline Protestants (67 percent) and white Catholics (66 percent). Among non-Christian groups, the religiously unaffiliated (80 percent), Jews (77 percent), and a slim majority of Muslims (51 percent) supported same-sex marriage.

Support for marriage equality was lowest among white evangelical Protestants, with 34 percent supporting and 58 percent opposed. Mormons were also opposed to same-sex marriage, with 40 percent supporting it and 53 percent opposed.

However, change is apparent even among these groups. PRRI found that opposition to same-sex marriage dropped 13 percentage points among white evangelicals since 2013, and 15 percentage points among Mormons since 2014. Moreover, the study found that the younger generations within these conservative religious groups are becoming more supportive of same-sex marriage: Majorities of both young white evangelical Protestants and young Mormons now favor legalizing same-sex marriage (53 percent and 52 percent).

Leaders at Affirmation, an advocacy group for LGBTQ Mormons and their allies, said it was encouraged by the increasing acceptance shown by young Mormons.

“This trend of visibility among LGBT Mormons will only increase,” the group’s executive committee said in a statement.

Brandan Robertson, a queer Christian activist and senior pastor of California’s Missiongathering Christian Church, told HuffPost that younger evangelicals have grown up in a world where most of them know or know of LGBTQ people.

“Whether at work or school or seeing Adam Rippon on ‘Dancing With The Stars,’ it’s impossible to not see LGBT+ people and also see us as dignified, equal human beings,” Robertson wrote in an email.What do puppies, Mark Zuckerberg’s musings and a five-night family vacation in the Bahamas for the low, low price of $497 per person have in common?

Veteran NBC journalist Tom Brokaw has not followed what’s become a typical pattern for high-profile men facing allegations of predatory behavior: issue an apology (however problematic) and keep a low profile. Instead, after a woman who asked to remain anonymous and a former NBC anchor, Linda Vester, accused him of inappropriate behavior last week, Brokaw fired off a late-night, hyperbole-laced email to colleagues calling the allegations “a drive by shooting” and “a torrent of unsubstantiated criticism and attacks.”

But more surprising than the longtime anchor’s fervent denial of harassment is that at least 115 current and former colleagues have signed a letter of support, attesting to how Brokaw has treated them with “fairness and respect” and is “a man of tremendous decency and integrity” who helped many of them advance their careers.

This type of missive, which network heavyweights such as Rachel Maddow and Mika Brzezinski signed, derails a much-needed conversation about sexual harassment and assault that’s finally happening because of the Me Too movement. And it sets a harmful example for the many workplaces figuring out how to deal with predatory behavior.

Me Too has been an important corrective to the many false assumptions society holds about sexual assault. The cascade of famous men accused of sexual harassment or violence has exposed the fact that predators are multifaceted human beings. They can tout progressive politics on a national platform, act supportively toward colleagues and dote on their children, friends and partners and still be capable of masturbating in front of or groping women.

When a group of women who had worked with Al Franken during his run on “Saturday Night Live” and eight of his former female staffers came out with statements about how Franken, who resigned from the Senate in January after being accused of sexual misconduct, had always treated them with the “utmost respect,” media outlets quickly pointed out the faulty logic: “The number of women a man didn’t assault does not matter if there are others he did,” wrote Molly Roberts in The Washington Post. “There are plenty of people the Zodiac Killer did not murder.”

“When influential players in a workplace openly side with the accused, it becomes difficult for other employees with relevant information or other harassment allegations to come forward.”

Franken had at least admitted to and apologized for his predatory actions by the time his former colleagues rose to his defense. But Brokaw’s vehement denial of the allegations, which include groping and forcible kissing, means the letter supporting him sends a dangerous message: that his accusers are liars. The clear subtext of those three short paragraphs is that a man who has treated more than 100 people with fairness and respect in the workplace could not have sexually harassed a few women and that the accused’s reputation is more important than these women’s word. (Variety corroborated Vester’s account of sexual harassment with her journal entries from the 1990s and in conversations with two of her friends.) The majority of sexual harassment and assault victims don’t report their crimes for this very reason — fear that friends, family members, colleagues, HR departments or the legal system won’t believe them.

Paula Brantner, who runs a consulting company that offers sexual harassment workshops to nonprofits and businesses, said these kinds of written defenses replicate the exact power dynamic that prevents employees from coming forward with complaints. “The pressure to go along and not say anything about harassment is similar to the pressure to go along and sign a letter of support of someone powerful in a particular workplace,” she said. “People are going to think they have to pick sides.”

An unnamed NBC News staffer told Page Six that employees felt they had to add their names to a document defending a man who has worked at the network for more than 50 years and who co-anchored its flagship news program for 22 years. “We felt forced to sign the letter supporting Brokaw. We had no choice, particularly the lower level staffers,” the employee said, according to the Page Six. Variety reported that in a memo, the company instructed its on-air reporters to refer to the letter in any segments about Brokaw.

When influential players in a workplace openly side with the accused, it becomes difficult for other employees with relevant information or other harassment allegations to come forward.

“’You think, ‘Wow, 65 of my peers are going to hold that against me or think I’m lying,’” said Brantner. “It really sends a strong message about the futility of speaking out.”

At this point NBC has said it does not plan to internally investigate Brokaw’s behavior anyway, according to network sources who spoke to Page Six.

“Letters of support for employees accused of sexual harassment contribute to the legitimate fear individuals have of coming forward,” Rory Gerberg, a workplace consultant who specializes in sexual harassment training, told HuffPost via email. “If we want to be able to change #metoo, it’s essential employees avoid questioning or shaming the individual coming forward.”

A letter of support can also come back to haunt its signers, especially if it is issued before the allegations are properly investigated. Since Brokaw’s colleagues penned their written defense, a third woman has come forward, accusing him of forcibly kissing her in 1968. After the letter in support of Franken, six more women came forward to describe instances of groping and forcible kissing.

NBC morning show host Megyn Kelly, not usually known for her feminist views, recently warned Brokaw’s champions, “You don’t know what you don’t know.” After she and nine other women accused then–Fox News CEO Roger Ailes of sexual harassment in 2016, a few people who initially defended him later expressed their regret in interviews and on social media.WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has postponed the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the European Union and Mexico until June 1, and has reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil, the White House said on Monday.

The decisions came just hours before temporary exemptions from the tariffs on these countries were set to expire at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday.

In a statement, the White House said the details of the deals with Brazil, Argentina and Australia would be finalized shortly, and it did not disclose terms.

“The administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days. In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security,” the White House added.

A source familiar with the decision said there would be no further extensions beyond June 1 to stave off tariffs.

Trump on March 23 imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, but granted temporary exemptions to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the EU, Australia and Argentina. Trump has also granted a permanent exemption on steel tariffs to South Korea as part of a revision of a free trade pact that he sharply criticized.

Trump has invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China.

The tariffs, which have increased frictions with U.S. trading partners worldwide and have prompted several challenges before the World Trade Organization, are aimed at allowing the two U.S. metals industries to increase their capacity utilization rates above 80 percent for the first time in years.

Trump administration officials have said that in lieu of tariffs, steel- and aluminum-exporting countries would have to agree to quotas designed to achieve similar protections for U.S. producers.

EXEMPTION TERMS UNCLEAR

Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the country’s Trade Minister Steven Ciobo welcomed the tariff exemption, and said the country would continue to work with Washington to prevent dumping.

“The exemption reflects the fair and reciprocal trade relationship Australia shares with the United States and underpins the unbreakable friendship between our two great nations,” they said in a statement.

Australia’s sole steel producer Bluescope, which supplies locally made steel to its own factories in the United States, said it was pleased with the exemption.

“Now it’s time to refocus, and get back to business,” Managing Director Mark Vassella said in a statement.

South Korea earned its permanent exemption from steel tariffs by agreeing to quotas that will cut its steel shipments by about 30 percent from 2017 levels. Seoul is still subject to U.S. aluminum tariffs

Most Asian markets were closed for a holiday on Tuesday but on the London Metal Exchange, aluminum and steel-linked materials eased on prospects supply could be cheaper to come by.

The White House said the agreements reflect administration efforts “to reach fair outcomes with allies to protect our national security and address global challenges to the steel and aluminum industries.”

Todd Leebow, president of Majestic Steel USA, a Cleveland-based distributor of domestic steel products, said American steelmakers needed certainty that import protections won’t be eroded.

“We’re hopeful this extension moves us toward the most productive path for our domestic steel industry - the tariffs President Trump announced earlier this year and a quota system to limit the amount of imports flooding our country,” Leebow said in a statement.

The metals tariffs have caused some divisions within Trump’s Republican Party, with steel- and aluminum-consuming industries warning higher prices would hurt their competitiveness.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a pro-trade Republican from Texas, said he would work to ensure the tariffs “are narrow and targeted to protect our workers and job creators here at home.”

But Canada, Mexico and the European Union have all insisted they will not accept quotas to gain permanent exemptions from the U.S. tariffs.

The European Commission said the extension of the temporary exemption prolonged market uncertainty, which was already affecting business decisions.

“The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security,” it said in a statement.

A British government spokeswoman in Washington said the extension for the EU was “positive,” but the UK steel and aluminum industries needed safeguarding.

“We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.”

Negotiations over U.S. steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for Canada and Mexico have also become intertwined with intensified talks to reach an agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, and its industry is highly integrated with that of its southern neighbor, with raw materials and finished steel crisscrossing the Great Lakes region.

Any move by the United States to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would be a “very bad idea” guaranteed to disrupt trade between the two countries, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.

If the EU is subject to tariffs on the 6.4 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of the metals it exports annually to the United States, it has said it will set its own duties on 2.8 billion euros of U.S. exports of products ranging from makeup to motorcycles.Special counsel Robert Mueller hopes to ask President Donald Trump dozens of open-ended questions as part of his inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Many of those questions, which were published by The New York Times on Monday, focus on determining if Trump obstructed justice through his firings of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn, or his attempts to fire Mueller himself, among other events.

“What efforts were made to reach out to Mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon?” reads one of the queries supplied to the Times by an unnamed official separate from the president’s legal team. “What consideration and discussions did you have regarding terminating the special counsel in June of 2017?” another asks.

Read the full list here.

The questions shed light on what’s been a tight-lipped investigation and show Mueller is homing in on the president’s behavior in office. Some of the inquiries hope to shed light on Trump’s interactions, if there are any, with Russian officials or those connected to the Kremlin during the campaign.

Trump himself has publicly said he’d be willing to talk with Mueller and has vehemently denied there was any collusion with the Russians during the campaign. He said in January he was “looking forward” to speaking with the special counsel.

In response to the Times report, Trump on Tuesday lashed out at the investigation.

So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 1, 2018

It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 1, 2018

The president’s lawyers have cautioned against the interview and have sought to strictly limit the terms of any sit-down, worried that Trump could go off-script and end up making false statements. The Times noted that four people in the president’s orbit have already pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators.

The questions obtained by the Times are said to be the result of months of negotiations between the special counsel and Trump’s squadron of lawyers. The Times noted that the back and forth led to Mueller providing his ideal list to Trump’s former lead lawyer in the Russia inquiry, John Dowd, in March.

Dowd, who had urged Trump to reject any request for an interview in the investigation, was reportedly even more wary about a meeting after seeing the list. But the lawyer resigned later in March amid reports that his relationship with the president had frayed and that Trump planned to ignore his advice.

Dowd was replaced last week by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Trump has ramped up his criticism of the special counsel’s office in recent weeks following FBI raids at the home and offices of his longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen. “It’s a total witch-hunt. I’ve been saying it for a long time,” Trump said at the time.

The president, however, has since moved to distance himself from Cohen, saying on “Fox & Friends” last week that the lawyer handled only a “tiny, tiny little fraction” of his overall legal work.

Mueller’s list of questions also includes some involving Cohen’s business deals in Moscow, according to the Times.

Dickinson, who is among several women with civil lawsuits pending against Cosby, said she doesn’t understand why “a monster like that” could simply walk out of court the day he was found guilty.

“I’m still walking on eggshells,” she said. “I don’t understand why he was able to walk out of the courtroom and go home. Whereas any other sexual predator or convicted felon would’ve gone straight to jail, because the detectives told me he was going straight to jail.

WASHINGTON ― Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has come under withering criticism from President Donald Trump, said Tuesday he doesn’t believe there’s “any threat to the rule of law in America today” and praised Trump for issuing a proclamation commemorating Law Day and the separation of powers.

Rosenstein, at an event at the Newseum in Washington on Tuesday, said the Department of Justice is independent of “inappropriate political considerations” but not independent of the executive branch. He said decisions about individual prosecutions “have to be made without regard to politics.”

He said there is “no doubt” that the Justice Department is both complying with the rule of law and following the administration’s priorities. He declined to discuss his private interactions with Trump, who has regularly criticized Rosenstein publicly.

“I do not talk publicly about my communications with the president,” Rosenstein said, noting that there are DOJ rules about what is inappropriate to discuss with the White House. “I can assure you that we are faithful for those rules.”

Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from inquiries concerning Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation into the matter and any involvement of the Trump campaign.

At the event, Rosenstein spoke generally about how a special counsel operates, saying that a special counsel is “accountable” to the attorney general.

Asked whether the Justice Department was reconsidering its position that the president of the United States may not be charged, replied only that the department had taken that position.

“I just don’t have anything more to say about it,” Rosenstein said.

On Monday, The Washington Post and other news organizations reported that a group of Republican members of the House drafted articles of impeachment against him. A member of the executive branch other than the president has not been impeached since 1876.

Rosenstein commented on the draft, joking that the Hill “can’t even resist leaking their own drafts.” But he said the DOJ’s work would not be affected by threats.

“I can tell you that there have been people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time,” he said. “I think they should understand by now that the Department of Justice is not going to get extorted. We’re going to do what’s required by the rule of law, and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.”

Trump has described Rosenstein ― a longtime Republican he nominated ― as a Democrat and said Rosenstein is out to get him. Rosenstein wrote a memo that the White House pointed to as justification for firing FBI Director James Comey, in which Rosenstein critiqued Comey’s handling of the investigation into then–Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.President Donald Trump vocalized his support for the National Football League’s new rule that requires players to stand during the national anthem, telling Fox News that perhaps the players who refuse to abide “shouldn’t be in the country.”

The NFL approved the policy on Wednesday in a push to end kneeling during the anthem, which Colin Kaepernick began in 2016 football season as a silent protest in the face of rising racial violence and police brutality. The players not on board will have to stay in the locker room.

Trump praised the league for the new rule that would stop national anthem protests before they happen, saying NFL owners did the right thing.

“I don’t think people should be staying in locker rooms,” Trump told Fox News. “You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing. You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.”

Trump has derided players and team owners for the kneeling protests on multiple occasions, sparking a debate as to whether the protests were disrespectful of the U.S. military or an expression of First Amendment rights.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the controversy in a statement after the new rule was announced that “on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.”

At an Alabama rally in September, Trump called players who kneeled a “son of a bitch” and encouraged fans to boycott games when the protests occurred. The president has continued to bring up the issue and alluded to it while welcoming NASCAR Champion Martin Truex Jr. to the White House on Monday.

“And I will tell you one thing I know about NASCAR: They do indeed, Brian, stand for the playing of the national anthem, right?” Trump said on Monday. “They do indeed.”

Others from the Trump administration have praised the NFL’s rule change on Wednesday, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr.

Pence, who left an Indianapolis Colts game after players kneeled last year, posted a screenshot of the news and captioned it ”#winning” on Twitter. Trump Jr. posted a similar tweet on Wednesday captioning an AP article with “STILL NOT SICK OF #WINNING!!!!”

Despite the Trump administration’s celebrations on Twitter, however, the rule may not be the end of kneeling protests.

The NFL Player’s Association, which has supported the players’ right to protest, issued a release on Wednesday stating it would review the new rule and challenge any aspect inconsistent with its collective bargaining agreement.

“The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this ‘policy,’ the statement said. “NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.”

Other Twitter users have noted that the NFL is made up of predominantly black athletes, who could decide to boycott the ruling together.

“The NFL is about 70% black,” tweeted Dominque Hamilton, a former University of Missouri football player. “If united and didn’t take the field at all, it would upset a lot of people and a lot of executives.”Roseanne Barr has a message for people angry with her for staunchly supporting President Donald Trump.

“I don’t give a fuck,” the actress told Jimmy Fallon (who has his own history with Trump) on Monday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show.”

“I mean, everybody had to choose for themselves, according to their own conscience, who they felt was the lesser of two evils,” said Barr, whose successful “Roseanne” TV series reboot recently earned her a congratulatory telephone call from Trump himself.

“This is America, it’s a free country, and you know, when you weigh it all together, you know, I just felt like we needed a whole new thing. All the way. Bottom to top,” she added.

Barr, who over the weekend fantasized about becoming the prime minister of Israel, struck a similar tone in March, when late-night host Jimmy Kimmel asked why she voted for Trump in the 2016 election.

“I’m still the same, you all moved. You all went so fucking far out, you lost everything,” she replied. “You want Pence? You want Pence for the frickin’ president? Well, then zip that fucking lip.”

Competitive eater Matt “Megatoad” Stonie consumed 125 cupcakes in one sitting in a YouTube video he posted Monday.

The former Nathan’s hot dog-eating champ, ranked third by Major League Eating, showed off his voracious sweet tooth by Hoovering down more than 12,000 calories worth of bakery treats in 8 minutes and 55.15 seconds.

He ate the first 50 in about two minutes, and struggled from there. “I was stuck in the tornado of sugar,” he said in a viral video of the stunt:

Stonie noted that he has excelled in other sweet challenges, eating 85 MoonPies and 255 Peeps in minutes.

A doughnut-downing feat showed there were no holes in his glutton game. And now we know: He’s no cupcake when it comes to cupcakes.Virginia’s Republican-led legislature is on the verge of doing something that would’ve been almost unthinkable just a year ago: approving legislation that would use money from the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid to as many as 400,000 people.

That coverage expansion would come at a price for Democratic legislators, progressive activists and low-income Virginians, however. Any Medicaid expansion bill that makes it out of the General Assembly will carry with it new work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, a priority for the GOP at large and for President Donald Trump’s administration.

Democrats in the Virginia legislature have tried in vain for six years to persuade their GOP counterparts that accepting federal dollars to extend Medicaid coverage to poor adults is the right thing to do. Accepting a work-requirements policy that would create bureaucratic obstacles to eligible Virginians appears to be the compromise needed to win the bigger fight.

“Most of the Democrats in the Senate are prepared to accept the work requirement in order to get expansion passed,” said state Sen. Janet Howell (D), who represents parts of Fairfax and Arlington counties in Northern Virginia. “We have hundreds of thousands of Virginians who have no health insurance, largely because we in Virginia have a very stingy Medicaid program,” she said.

“My preference would be not to have a work requirement, but I don’t see any way to get expansion passed unless we have one,” Howell said.

Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has neither endorsed the work requirement nor rejected it, but he has said he won’t accept a budget from the General Assembly that doesn’t include Medicaid expansion.

The Medicaid expansion debate in Virginia spans back to 2013, when former Gov. Robert McDonnell (R) rejected Medicaid expansion. Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who served from 2014 until January, was unable to bring the GOP-led legislature around on the issue.

Then Northam won the gubernatorial election and Democrats gained 15 seats in the 100-member House of Delegates last November, altering the course of the debate and setting Medicaid expansion on a path to becoming a reality. The GOP now has a one-vote majority in both chambers of the legislature, and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) can cast tie-breaking votes in the 40-member Senate.

“Republicans were really stunned that they lost the 15 seats in the House of Delegates.” - John McGlennon, College of William and Mary

Virginia lawmakers are still working out the final form of the work requirement. The latest version, based on the policy enacted in Arkansas last month, would make a person’s Medicaid coverage contingent on them working at least 20 hours a month for the first three months. The minimum number of hours gradually increases, eventually reaching 80 hours a month after a year on the program. There are other means of meeting this requirement, including being enrolled in school or a job-training training program, or volunteering.

Anyone who fails to meet one of these standards for more than three months during a year losses their health coverage and has to wait until the following year to reapply.

There are numerous exceptions in the most recent version of the legislation, including for children, people over 55 years old, people with disabilities, people with “serious mental illness,” women who or are pregnant or have just given birth, those determined to be “medically frail” and people who are the primary caregivers for children or adults with disabilities.

The Virginia House passed two budgets this year that included a Medicaid expansion, with every House Democrat and 19 Republicans voting for the version that passed this month. While most GOP legislators still oppose Medicaid expansion, two Senate Republicans have broken ranks with their leadership and expressed support for it, giving the legislation enough votes to pass the upper chamber.

Sen. Emmett Hanger Jr., who represents portions of the Shenandoah Valley and has expressed support for Medicaid expansion in the past, last month became the first Republican in the upper chamber this year to come out in favor of the policy. Weeks later, Sen. Frank Wagner (R) of Virginia Beach joined him. Both senators cited a work requirement as a prerequisite for their support. House Republicans who voted for expansion with a work requirement pitch it as reforming Medicaid, not simply enlarging it.

The deal is all but done except for some of the details, said Sen. George Barker (D), whose Northern Virginia district covers parts of Fairfax and Prince WIlliam counties and part of Alexandria.

“I don’t think there are any obstacles that are presenting a problem,” said Barker. “I think that once we all sit down together ― and I’ve already talked to some of my Republican colleagues who are on board as well as some others who are on the fence right now ― I feel confident that we can reach agreement.”

The impasse over Medicaid expansion remains the primary reason the General Assembly hasn’t agreed on the state’s two-year budget.

Shifting Politics In The Old Dominion

The work requirement provides Republicans with political cover for changing their position on Medicaid expansion, said John McGlennon, a government professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg.

This newfound support for Medicaid expansion among some Republicans is the result of a mix of other factors, including the party’s poor showing during the House elections last year and specific regional issues, McGlennon said.

“Republicans were really stunned that they lost the 15 seats in the House of Delegates, and they recognize they had to probably do something,” he said. “They were getting a lot of pressure from the medical professionals in Southwest Virginia, where they’re closing hospitals and there’s no funding for clinics and doctors aren’t getting paid.”

As for the minority party in the House, McGlennon said, “The Democrats were willing to pass what the Republican Speaker was willing to swallow.”

And given the growing strength of the Democratic Party in Virginia, Democrats have reason to believe they can simply repeal the work requirement when they eventually take control of the legislature, McGlennon said.

The fact that Trump and Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year also is a factor, said Del. David Toscano, who represents the Charlottesville area and is the Democratic Leader in the House of Delegates. “Given that, you have to make the best of it,” he said.

In addition, those Republicans who now support Medicaid expansion also have come around to the Democratic arguments that expanding coverage, coupled with the infusion of federal money that comes with it, will be a boon for Virginia, Toscano said.

“People like the notion of Medicaid expansion because it’s going to help a lot of people get access to health care they wouldn’t otherwise have. So, for them, it is a moral imperative,” Toscano said. “But when you start looking at the numbers, it becomes an economic imperative for the budget because it allows us to do things with federal dollars that we could not previously do.”

Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of those newly eligible for Medicaid. The House-passed bill includes an assessment on Virginia hospitals that would cover the state’s share.

In addition, expanding Medicaid would enable Virginia to reduce spending on other programs that finance health care for uninsured people, freeing up more than $370 million the state can use for other priorities.

“That’s not chicken feed, and it gets used to pay for things like teacher raises,” Toscano said.

And if Virginia’s experience with Medicaid expansion matches that of other states, the incoming federal money would provide a boost to the economy. It could create about 30,000 jobs in the state, according to the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond-based think tank.

More Coverage, More Care

The Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid to be expanded to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person. But in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could refuse the Medicaid expansion, leaving uninsured millions the ACA would have covered.

Currently, childless adults who don’t have a disability can’t qualify for Medicaid in Virginia, no matter how poor they are.

Low-income parents are eligible if they make up to 38 percent of the poverty level, which is less than $4,600 a year. Pregnant women earning up to 205 percent of poverty ― about $25,000 ― can sign up for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Adults with disabilities are eligible for Medicaid if their incomes don’t exceed 80 percent of poverty, or about $9,700, and if their assets are worth less than $2,000.

In Virginia, the proposed expansion would provide coverage to almost 400,000 people, according to the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services.

“We’re really excited for people to get insurance so that they can get to the specialists they need to get the care that they need for their chronic disease,” said Paula Tomko, executive director of New Canton-based Central Virginia Health Services, which served about 43,000 patients at 16 locations last year.

Tomko said 32 percent of its patients, or 13,000 people, would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion.

“We see how much difference access to coverage can make in caring for a patient,” Tomko said.

A Bitter Pill

Adding a work requirement to the program, however, likely means fewer people will get help. Kentucky, which this year became the first state to impose such a requirement, estimates that its new work requirement, along with other policies, will reduce the Medicaid rolls by as many as 95,000 people, for example.

“The potential for loss of coverage is going to be significant,” said Cindy Mann, a partner at the consulting firm Manatt Health in Washington D.C., who oversaw the Medicaid program under President Barack Obama. The Obama administration refused to grant states’ requests for work requirements, arguing that limiting benefits to people who are working was illegal under Medicaid’s statutory mandate to provide health care.

The Trump administration opened the door to including a work requirement in January when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notified states it would consider approving such policies.

“Many of our patients that we’re talking about work one, if not two, jobs.” - Kay Crane, Piedmont Access to Health Services

Arkansas, Indiana and Kentucky have already received approval for work requirements. Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have also applied for them, and other states are sure to follow.

While Trump administration officials and Republicans at the state level tout work requirements as a means to lift low-income people out of poverty and improve their health, there is scant evidence to support these claims. The vast majority of Medicaid enrollees and people who’d be eligible in non-expansion states are working or in families with at least one worker.

“There’s really no indication that the problem is people not having sufficient motivation,” said Mann. “People may lack skill training, people may lack day care, they may lack transportation ― and there is no additional support available.”

The policy also unjustly tars low-income people as “slackers” who refuse to help themselves, said Kay Crane, CEO of Danville-based Piedmont Access to Health Services, which operates community health centers in Southside Virginia, near the North Carolina border.

“Unless you’re in their shoes and you understand their struggle, it’s real easy to sit back and say, ‘Oh, they ought to get a job,’” Crane said. “Many of our patients that we’re talking about work one, if not two, jobs just to put food on the table.” Forcing them to prove they’re working could merely tie them up in red tape, making it difficult even for people who qualify for Medicaid to get and keep it, she said.

Implementing and enforcing work requirements also is expensive for states. The version adopted by the Virginia House of Delegates, for instance, will cost the state $21.5 million over two years, according to data compiled by the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis.

But if this is what it takes to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Virginians gain access to health care, it’ll be worth it, Tomko said. “I would rather work through an onerous process for these folks to have access than not have it.”
