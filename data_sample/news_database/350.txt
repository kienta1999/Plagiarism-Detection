Andrew Anglin gives the Nazi salute in Rome. Andrew Anglin

There are lies. There are whoppers. And then there is what Andrew Anglin says.

Last Friday, Anglin, who publishes The Daily Stormer, the world’s biggest neo-Nazi website, told a federal court that he should not be held responsible for the anti-Semitic threats his followers hurled at a Jewish woman in Montana because he doesn’t believe the Holocaust happened.

Mishegoss!

By way of background, Anglin mounted this sordid defense in a case brought against him by Tanya Gersh, a real estate agent in Whitefish whom Anglin attacked on his website last winter after Gersh became embroiled in a property dispute with the mother of Richard Spencer, a leader of the “alt-right” white supremacist movement. Anglin published Gersh’s contact information, whipped his “Stormer Troll Army” of readers into a frenzy and sent them repeatedly after Gersh and her family.

For weeks, Anglin’s trolls bombarded Gersh with hateful, threatening messages. A sampling: “Ratfaced criminals who play with fire tend to get thrown in the oven”; “Day of the rope soon for your entire family”; “Six million are only the beginning.” The trolls sent Gersh images of herself being sprayed with a cloud of green gas and played her recordings of gunshots when she answered her phone. Anglin posted images of Gersh and her son superimposed over the gates of Auschwitz.

Last week, however, Anglin’s attorney Marc Randazza, told the court that his client should not be held responsible for any of the abuse he unleashed, in part because Anglin thinks the Holocaust (which did, in fact, happen) is a hoax.

“If Defendant is to be deemed responsible for the speech of third parties, that speech must be viewed through Defendant’s mindset,” wrote Randazza. “In that mindset, there are no gas chambers; there are no ovens; there are no mass killings of Jews. To the speaker, these are fictional metaphors, a ‘threat’ as true as a Star Wars fanatic sending Death Star-blowing-up-Vulcan imagery to a Star Trek fan. It may be hateful, but it is no true threat.”

The judge in the case is already irritated at Anglin’s claims that he lives overseas as a “stateless citizen” beyond the court’s jurisdiction — Anglin has so far suggested that he lives in Nigeria and Russia; on Wednesday, he submitted photos of passport stamps and a declaration swearing that he moved to Cambodia four days before Gersh filed her lawsuit. The judge recently told Randazza to “emphasize to Mr. Anglin there’s not going to be any game-playing here. Understood?”

No, apparently.

Randazza’s latest legal maneuver, which might be illegal in the 16 European countries where Holocaust denial is outlawed, is seemingly without precedent in the United States, according to Brian Levin, a criminologist and civil rights attorney who runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

It is also seemingly without merit.

True Threats

As Levin explained, Anglin’s subjective intent to threaten or cause harm is what matters when assessing a true threat, not his prejudiced refusal to believe in the Holocaust (which happens to be the best-documented genocide in history). What’s more, even fictional material can be construed as a threat, especially in a threatening context. “Let’s say someone sends a picture of Al Pacino in ‘Scarface’ killing somebody,” Levin said. “That might very well cause someone harm.”

In 2000, Levin represented Bonnie Jouhari, a Pennsylvania fair housing advocate, in a landmark case with similarities to the Gersh litigation. Jouhari was harassed and threatened by white supremacists after a neo-Nazi posted her picture, along with an image of her office being blown up and a message about how people like Jouhari should “beware, for in our day, they will be hung from the neck from the nearest tree or lamp post,” to his organization’s website. A court ordered the neo-Nazi to pay $1.1 million in damages.

Context mattered then, as it will now for Anglin, who has used his site to terrorize numerous people other than Gersh and routinely advocates for violence against various groups. He has written, for example, about “rounding up the entire Negro population of the United States, putting bullets in the backs of their heads and dumping them into an incinerator.” He has written about executing gay people by throwing them off rooftops. He has written about his desire “to see pieces of journalist brains splattered across walls.”

In private, Anglin’s speech is no different. “I actually do want to gas kikes,” he assured his website’s writers in a style guide obtained by HuffPost.

Members of the Daily Stormer community have taken violent exhortations to heart and murdered at least 15 people in the past few years. Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old who killed nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, was reportedly a commenter on the site. James Jackson, who traveled from Maryland to New York City last March to stab a black man to death with a sword, cited only one ideological influence after his arrest: The Daily Stormer.

Last week, Anglin even laughed about two of those murders on a podcast hosted by “crying Nazi” Christopher Cantwell, who brought an arsenal of guns to Charlottesville, Virginia, in August ahead of a deadly white supremacist rally.

“You do have that type of thing,” Anglin told Cantwell, chortling about a double homicide in Tampa, Florida, last May in which a member of the Stormer community who’d converted to Islam murdered two of his neo-Nazi roommates. A third neo-Nazi roommate escaped death but was later arrested for possessing explosives and bomb-making materials, and was sentenced to five years in prison earlier this month.

Given this context, whether Anglin believes in the Holocaust or not is moot. When he targeted Gersh, he urged his followers to physically confront her. ”[I]f you’re in the area, maybe you should stop by and tell her in person what you think of her actions,” he wrote. This recommendation echoes a more recent case in which Yousef al-Khattab posted a violent video to his Islamic organization’s website and encouraged readers to seek out Jewish leaders and “deal with them directly at their homes.” Al-Khattab also posted a photo and a map of a Jewish organization’s headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. He pleaded guilty to using the internet to put another in fear of death or injury, and in 2014 was sentenced to 2½ years in prison.

Anglin, unlike Al-Khattab, is not a Muslim extremist. He presents more like an American suburbanite, the sort of average white male from a privileged background who tends to fetch up in middle management rather than the middle of a race war. But his superficial white banality ― and that of the alt-right, at large ― masks an underlying fanaticism. The effectiveness of this camouflage owes to both society’s stereotypical assumptions about white men and the alt-right’s decision to discard swastika banners and jackboots in favor of American flags and khakis, which might also help explain why law enforcement would intervene in a case like al-Khattab’s but force Gersh to turn to the Southern Poverty Law Center to support a civil suit against Anglin.

But there’s no hiding the Holocaust denial that Randazza, who also represents far-right propagandist and conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, dropped into Anglin’s latest filing. American courts have a rule called “judicial notice” that addresses false assertions and allows one of the parties in the lawsuit to request that proven facts be introduced into evidence when those facts are not subject to reasonable dispute because they are generally known or cannot reasonably be questioned. This happens with dates, weather, location. It happens with historical events, too. To date, Gersh has not requested judicial notice.

Litigation As Propaganda?

Nevertheless, it is remarkable that Randazza, who did not respond to a request for comment, would go to the trouble of inserting the most offensive of anti-Semitic lies into the legal record.

“It’s not the argument that Floyd Abrams would have made,” Levin said, referring to the legendary First Amendment attorney. “This brief is not necessarily written for legal scholars as much as for Anglin’s extremist followers. ... He appears to be using this litigation as a soapbox for his bankrupt racist ideology as much as he is making a legal defense.”

Deborah Lipstadt, a professor of Jewish history at Emory University and a leading scholar on Holocaust denial, agrees. “It struck me as fodder for his followers. This is an argument they can use now in one of those message boards,” Lipstadt told HuffPost. “I find it really revolting in and of itself. I think it’s just outrageous. But the other reason I find it so revolting is that it’s a new weapon in the arsenal of these racists.”

Lipstadt literally wrote the book on Holocaust denial. For her trouble, she was sued for libel in England by David Irving, a racist sham historian and Holocaust denier who was able to put the truth about a genocide on trial thanks to English law, which assigns the burden of proof to the accused in libel cases. Irving lost in humiliating fashion. A movie was made about Lipstadt’s defense of history. She felt her court victory had sounded a death knell for what she calls “hardcore” Holocaust deniers, who insist that ― to paraphrase Randazza ― there were no gas chambers, no ovens, no mass killings of Jews.

But hardcore denial is making a comeback with the alt-right, according to Lipstadt, who sees the same interplay today between hate and delusional thinking that has always characterized Holocaust denial. The lunacy, however, is vastly more potent with the internet and social media, which give racists and fascists an unprecedented way to self-brainwash and radicalize others in echo chambers like The Daily Stormer. Online hate combined with a neo-Nazi-friendly administration ― Donald Trump has himself retweeted neo-Nazis, white supremacists and a member of the Daily Stormer community ― is deeply troubling to Lipstadt.

“I find it very, very frightening, and I don’t frighten easily,” she said. “The reach that they have that they never had before is mind-boggling. It’s something that we never imagined.”Chelsea Manning is officially on the ballot for the U.S. Senate race in Maryland.

Manning, a former Army private imprisoned for sharing classified government documents with WikiLeaks, tweeted a photo on Wednesday evening showing her displaying her filing paperwork.

The whistleblower, 30, announced her intention to run earlier this month and released her first campaign video on Sunday. Manning is one of five Democrats who have filed to run in the race, and will face off against incumbent Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the highest-ranking party member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“We don’t need more, or better leaders,” Manning says in the clip. “We need someone willing to fight. We need to stop asking them to give us our rights. They won’t support us, they won’t compromise.”Three days ago, Timothée Chalamet, who stars in the critically-acclaimed film “Call Me by Your Name,” posted on his official Instagram account that he was giving his salary from starring in the yet-to-be-released Woody Allen film, “A Rainy Day in New York,” to three nonprofit organizations. Other actors who have starred in Allen’s films have said recently that they are doing the same, but what was unusual about Chalamet’s statement was that unlike his colleagues, he did not criticize Allen or offer words of support to Allen’s estranged daughter Dylan Farrow, who has accused her father of sexual abuse (Allen has denied the allegations).

In the post, Chalamet said he was not able to comment on his decision to star in the film, or on Allen, because of “contractual obligations.”

A post shared by Timothée Chalamet (@tchalamet) on Jan 15, 2018 at 8:51pm PST

HuffPost obtained a copy of Chalamet’s contract from a source with access to it, and a review of the document reveals that Chalamet is under no contractual obligation to remain silent about his thoughts with respect to Allen, nor does it prevent him from offering support to Dylan Farrow, which raises the question of why he chose to make such a statement and why he is hesitant to comment on Allen.

Chalmet’s donation and Instagram post comes right before voting closes for the Screen Actors Guild Awards and ahead of nominations for the Academy Awards that will be announced on Tuesday. The SAG Awards are airing live Sunday, and voting for them closes Friday at 12 p.m. PST. Given that Chalamet posted his donation announcement on Tuesday, that gave him enough time to gain the attention of his fellow actors before they vote for the awards.

Two prominent actors who have won SAG awards in the past but aren’t in contention for this year’s awards, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, have accused Chalamet of attempting to play both sides of the game. They say it is an effort to appease SAG voters and members of the Academy who will be voting for Best Actor should Chalamet receive a nomination. By donating the money he is appeasing members who believe that Allen abused Farrow, but by not criticizing him explicitly he is avoiding the ire of members who don’t believe the accusations against Allen, including actor Alec Baldwin, who recently referred to actors who have denounced Allen as “unfair and sad.”

In an email to HuffPost, Chalamet’s representatives claimed that a clause in the standard SAG agreement (which is shown below) that was attached to Chalamet’s contract prevents him from speaking publicly. But that clause, according to two attorneys who reviewed it at HuffPost’s request, does nothing to prevent Chalamet from speaking publicly about accusations against Allen and from Chalamet offering a word of support to Farrow.

Further contradicting the assessment of Chalamet’s representatives is the fact that one of Chalamet’s co-stars in Allen’s latest film did speak out in support of Dylan Farrow.

Actress Rosario Dawson spoke candidly about the sexual assault she experienced as a child in a recent interview on the feminist podcast “Morado Lens.”

Discussing the movement to denounce sexual harassment in the workplace and beyond, the “Daredevil” star said she believes society is becoming more conscious and that younger people are more likely to feel that their voices matter. This is particularly important when creating change, Dawson added, since people who feel discounted in one aspect of their lives are often less likely to speak up when they’re discounted in other areas.

“I was raped and molested as a child, so for me the world was like that since I was a child,” she told hosts Cindy Rodriguez and Nathalie Farfan in the podcast episode, which was published Wednesday. “So when I saw it at the workplace, it wasn’t foreign to me. It was like, well, that even happens within family. It happens with people that are supposed to take care of you when you’re a child.”

Dawson said that although she’s spoken out against sexual harassment in the past, the issue is “insidious” and harassment is not a “binary, man/woman thing,” but about people abusing power.

The actress has been a vocal participant in the #MeToo online movement since it began last year and has supported Hollywood’s Time’s Up movement, launched to combat workplace harassment and inequality.

The 38-year-old actress also spoke to Morado Lens about her spiritual journey, including what changed after finding her 26-year-old cousin Vaneza Ines Vasquez unresponsive in her Los Angeles home in May. Vasquez was pronounced dead at the hospital.

“[When] my grandma died at 75, it put this really gloomy future ahead of us, like wow, we only have but so many years left if you live as long as Mima did,” she explained. “But when Vaneza died, it was like, oh my god, regardless of how well I’ve spent these years, I’ve already got 12 more years of life than Vaneza will ever have. And I think what it really did was give me back my gratitude.”

She continued: “Whenever my moment comes, I wanna know that it’s been a good life. I don’t wanna be marinated in the upset ― because I have a lot trauma and sadness to dwell on if I want to ― but there’s so much beauty and so many things to be grateful for. And I don’t want to waste my time not being dedicated to that.”

Dawson first broke her silence about her cousin’s death during an interview with the BUILD series in May.

“I’ve been dealing with a lot of loss lately and reconnecting with my family and my friends in a different way,” she said at the time. “I’m realizing how much I’ve pulled myself back, and I’ve been just really humbled by this opportunity tonight.”

AdvertisementA TV reboot of the 1990 comic horror film “Tremors” with Kevin Bacon hasn’t seen the light of day. But a trailer has.

Check out what appears to be a leaked preview for the series, which SyFy recently rejected, according to Deadline, despite a “fantastic pilot,” Bacon said in an Instagram post.

The clip is cheesy perfection — also the name of the town invaded once again by giant man-eating worms called graboids.

“I’ve been through all this before,” Bacon’s now grizzled hero, Valentine McKee, declares. “They don’t plan. They don’t strategize. They just kill.”

The show doesn’t seem earthshaking, but it looks like fun.

“Tremors” fans responded to his post with their hopes that the worm will turn for the project’s prospects.

In the meantime, there are plenty of sequels and a 2003 TV series to satisfy your hankering for graboids ― but they’re Bacon-free.I hold onto my kid’s art projects and report cards so that one day, many years from now, they can look at it fondly before tossing it all in the garbage can.Chilean sex abuse victims of a pedophile priest were stunned Thursday when Pope Francis accused them of slander.

The pope’s visit to Chile was supposed to begin a healing process between the Catholic Church and the victims of Rev. Fernando Karadima. Instead, Francis accused the victims of slandering a bishop they claimed had protected the priest, The Associated Press reported.

At least one of Karadima’s victims said Bishop Juan Barros watched while he was abused.

A number of parishioners have accused Karadima of sexually assaulting them when they were teens, beginning in the 1980s. In 2011, the church “sentenced” the cleric to a lifetime of penance and prayer for his sins. A judge also found charges against Karadima credible. But too much time had elapsed since the crimes, and the authorities were unable to file criminal charges against him.

Although victims and victims rights advocates have attacked Barros for allegedly covering up for Karadima, the Vatican has continued to embrace the controversial bishop. In 2015, Pope Francis appointed Barros to head the diocese of Osorno in south-central Chile.

“The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,” Francis told ADN radio before celebrating mass near the Chilean city of Iquique. “But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander. Is that clear?”

On Tuesday, the pope publicly apologized for sexual abuse involving the clergy. He said he felt “pained and ashamed” over the “irreparable damage” caused by the abuse, but he did not meet with Karadima’s victims.

The church is losing its influence in the nation, Reuters reported. A new poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell from 74 percent in 1995 to 45 percent last year.Catherine Zeta-Jones visits the Build Series in New York City on Jan. 18, 2018.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is defending her decision to portray real-life Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco in Lifetime’s TV movie “Cocaine Godmother.”

The Welsh actress addressed criticism over the role’s whitewashing in an interview with Entertainment Weekly published Thursday. Zeta-Jones argued that she herself doesn’t look Welsh, and noted that she’s played Hispanic characters before.

“This is just the way I see it, and people can take what they want from it: I am a Welsh actress, who doesn’t happen to look like what you think someone from Wales would look like,” she told EW. “I have my own language; I speak Welsh. And so, for me to wait for a role that is fit for the way I look physically, that is not a Welsh role, where I don’t use my accent ― I never use my accent. Have you ever heard me use my accent that I’m speaking with right now?”

Criticism over whitewashing, it should be noted, has less to do with nationality and appearance, and more to do with Hollywood’s pervasive habit of passing over actors of color and casting white actors in non-white roles. The issue is further complicated by the lack of multi-dimensional Latino lead roles in the industry. At any rate, true on-screen representation is not achieved by casting a white actress who can pass as what the industry believes Latinas look like (particularly when depictions of Latinos in film and TV often ignore the community’s incredible diversity).

Still, the 48-year-old star pointed to previous roles in which she portrayed Hispanic women while defending her portrayal of Blanco.

“This happens to be the third Hispanic I’ve played,” Zeta-Jones said. “I played the lead in ‘Zorro,’ and I screen-tested with six Hispanic women, and I got the role. I don’t know what to say. And I was a complete unknown at this point; it wasn’t because I had a name or box-office value. Four of the actresses are my contemporaries to this day.”

“I played a woman of Spanish descent in ‘Traffic’ as well,” she added. “I have to take [the roles] I believe I can embody. I can’t be the person to fight against a very big issue, and I won’t take on that role. There have been so many actors who have played ‘against type.’ That’s sort of what we do.”

However, the star did add that she is “all for diversity” and wants to see more people of color behind the camera.

Zeta-Jones has faced backlash for portraying Blanco, one of the most notable figures of the Medellin Cartel and a pioneer in the Miami-based cocaine trade. “Cocaine Godmother,” directed by Guillermo Navarro, depicts the rise and fall of the drug lord, who was killed in 2012 at age 69.

In the film’s trailer, Zeta-Jones portrays the ruthless Blanco with a thick accent. People have expressed their anger online about the casting choice.

Get ready for another big year for Laura Dern. Arriving in time to double as commentary about the power dynamics unfolding in Hollywood and beyond, “The Tale” concerns a successful journalist re-exploring the sexual triangle she had with two adult coaches at age 13. Some 40 years later, the affair she once considered loving and harmless assumes a harsher context. If I had to guess, this will be one of the most chattered-about movies at Sundance, both as a tour de force for Dern (and Ellen Burstyn, who plays her mother) and because of the #MeToo movement that’s prompted many to reconsider what constitutes consensual romance. “The Tale” marks the first fiction feature from Jennifer Fox, who directed the documentaries “Beirut: The Last Home Movie” and “My Reincarnation.” — MJCrew members Paula Podest and Carlos Ciufffardi kiss after being married by Pope Francis during the flight between Santiago and the northern city of Iquique on January 18, 2018.

Two flight attendants on Pope Francis’ papal plane were treated to first-class service on Thursday when the pope helped them officially tie the knot.

Francis spontaneously asked to conduct the wedding for Paula Podest and Carlos Ciufardi, flight attendants from Chile’s flagship carrier, LATAM. It was the first ever airborne papal wedding, The Associated Press reports.

The pope was on his way from Santiago to the northern Chilean city of Iquique when he met the couple, who have been together for more than 10 years and are civilly married, Crux reports. As they posed for snapshots with other crew members, Francis asked if the pair had been married in the church. When they said no, Francis, known for his off-the-cuff speeches and actions, reportedly replied, “Well, I’ll marry you.”

He asked to conduct the ceremony right then and there, and the shocked couple agreed. Francis apparently had a cardinal aboard the flight draft a wedding license, to ensure the marriage was properly done.

“He held our hands, blessed the rings, and he married us in the name of God,” Ciufardi told Crux.

Podest and Ciufardi told reporters on board the papal plane that they met while working for LATAM and were civilly married in 2010. They had planned a church wedding, but an earthquake apparently destroyed the building.

“What he said to us is very important: ‘This is the sacrament the world needs, the sacrament of marriage. Hopefully, this will motivate couples around the world to get married,’” Ciufardi said.

The Rev. James Martin, editor at large at the Catholic magazine America, told HuffPost that the impromptu wedding is a reminder of Francis’ pastoral concern for his flock.

“What message was the Pope sending? I don’t think it’s a message as much as a reminder that Pope Francis is, at heart, a priest,” Martin wrote in an email. “And a priest who is willing to take people where they are ― and when they are ready.”

The joyful wedding was something of a respite for the pope, whose weeklong trip to Chile and Peru has been fraught with tension. His time in Chile has been marred by protests and the burning of at nearly a dozen churches, as people voiced frustration with the church’s handling of the clergy sex abuse scandal in the country. Francis met and wept with survivors of abuse on Wednesday, and apologized for the damage caused by the church, the AP reports.

AdvertisementA windfall from the new federal tax law gives many states the flexibility to comprehensively rewrite their own tax codes, something not seen for decades.

Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a Republican, at the Utah Taxpayers Association 2018 Legislative Outlook Conference this month. On the heels of a sweeping rewrite of the nation’s tax laws signed into law in December, many states are considering big changes to state tax codes. Rick Bowmer, The Associated Press

The federal tax overhaul has caused a lot of angst in some state capitals, but leaders in many states also see a rare opportunity to substantially revamp state tax codes, many of which haven’t been significantly changed in years.

The opportunity comes because the 36 states that use the federal code as a starting point for their own personal income taxes are in a position to realize a generous windfall since the federal law eliminates many tax breaks that states might not adjust.

That unexpected extra money has given states the flexibility to rewrite their tax codes without creating as many losers — and the accompanying political hardship — as most tax revamps entail.

Lawmakers in Iowa, which last changed its overall tax structure in 1997, are looking at broad rate changes and other rewrites. Colorado has been looking at sweeping tax changes since at least 1984, mostly directed at sales taxes, but broader changes are getting a push this year from the federal rewrite. Idaho considered significant tax changes in 2015, but fell short, and now lawmakers and the governor are talking up those changes again. Big tax overhauls also are on the table in Michigan and Missouri.

And in New Mexico, GOP Gov. Susana Martinez this week said it’s time for her state to tackle “the big one” — comprehensive tax reform.

“Let’s finally tackle comprehensive tax reform this session,” she said in her state of the state address, seizing on tax reform in the wake of the federal overhaul, like a number of other governors.

But while many governors and legislators are looking to revamp tax codes in a big way, the temptation is not universal. While most Republican governors are at least looking at lowering taxes, some GOP legislators say they are hesitant due to uncertainty about revenue forecasts for the new tax law.

Some Democrats want to fund their own priorities but also are holding back due to worries about underfunded pensions, cuts to federal government programs such as Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income Americans, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other concerns.

But the issue that will be uppermost on lawmakers’ minds this legislative year is how to deal with tax and budget changes.

“For years, there have been quite a few states that have talked about a desire to create a more neutral and more pro-growth tax code, but have been limited by revenue availability,” said Jared Walczak of the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based tax analysis group. Now, with the federal overhaul signed by President Donald Trump in December, “there is an opportunity for states to consider serious tax reform.”

A majority of states will see a revenue increase if they do nothing, but their taxpayers also will pay more. That’s because the new federal law eliminated many tax breaks, meaning federal taxes are assessed on more income. The federal tax code, however, tried to help taxpayers out by also increasing the standard deduction, lowering their tax liability. If states use the income line from the federal form as a starting point, but don’t adjust the deductions underneath, state residents would pay more.

After the sweeping Reagan-era federal tax overhaul in 1986, many states that tied their state income taxes to the federal code changed their laws in 1987, in some cases due to a similar windfall or to align their tax brackets with the federal code. And just like federal tax laws, state codes have changed incrementally over the past three decades, so that neither resemble what they looked like in 1986. But sweeping tax overhauls in the states have been rare since then.

Kansas cut taxes drastically in 2012, counting on economic growth to make up the difference. But despite vast budget cuts, the state’s revenue never caught up, creating a roughly $300 million budget hole and prompting a backlash among residents and lawmakers.

North Carolina revamped its tax code in 2013, and, like the recent federal rewrite, lowered individual rates, cut corporate taxes, and doubled the individual standard deduction. Republicans leaders hailed the overhaul as the key to 300,000 new jobs in the state, but Democrats and liberals maintained that the job increases were due to a national wave of economic activity, not the state’s action.

This time around, in addition to wholesale rewrites, some states are weighing whether to use the newfound millions to augment their rainy day funds, give state taxpayers a break, or fund new or languishing priorities such as education, transportation and pensions.

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has proposed increasing the state’s rainy day fund to 8 percent of the general fund, due to better-than-expected state revenue and an estimated $300 million boost from the federal rewrite. But some in the Legislature want the money for highway construction instead.

Meg Wiehe, deputy director of the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning group, urged states to proceed cautiously, especially if they are looking at big, permanent, rate cuts. That’s because the federal rate changes and other modifications are temporary, and could disrupt states again when they expire in 2025.

‘A Comprehensive Look’

Today, as 2018 sessions begin in statehouses across the country and with budgets at the top of the to-do list, tax writers and analysts say the windfall from the federal rewrite already is playing an outsized role in those discussions. But any lucky break also creates competing constituencies.

For about a year, for example, Utah lawmakers have discussed how to change state taxes, which have not been changed significantly since 2008. Greg Hughes, the Republican speaker of the Utah House, estimated the state stands to gain between $75 million and $150 million this year due to the federal tax changes, which has given the state’s comprehensive overhaul effort new impetus.

Hughes tried last year to go for what he called the “big lift” of comprehensive tax reform, but he was stymied. He thinks the extra revenue gives more momentum to his efforts in 2018. But Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, also a Republican, said he wanted to wait for deeper analysis of the impact of the tax overhaul from state financial officials.

Iowa stands to gain $106 million next year and $138 million in 2020 from the federal tax changes if nothing is done to the state tax code, according to Iowa’s Department of Revenue. That’s about 2 percent of the state’s $7.3 billion budget.

“Our goal is to give that money back to Iowans and to do so as part of a plan to take a comprehensive look at taxes in Iowa,” said Iowa Senate President Jack Whitver, a Republican.

Whitver and other Republicans argue that revamping the state tax code and lowering tax rates would result in economic growth. But even in the best of cases, that growth can take years to materialize, and, Whitver says, the windfall from Washington could help tide the state over during the adjustment.

Wiehe noted that Iowa has wanted to lower tax rates for a long time. “They haven’t been able to figure it out,” she said. “Now, it’s pretty convenient to have a couple hundred million dollars so they can do what they want.”

In Idaho, State Tax Commissioner Ken Roberts told the Legislature to expect a net gain of $97.4 million in revenue this year if no changes to the state tax code are enacted.

Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter, a Republican, took a look at the estimated tax gain and pledged in his state of the state address this month to propose a plan that would blunt the increased levies on Idaho taxpayers. He said he would work to substantially retool the state tax code to conform with the federal one, but he left wiggle room to accept some of the new revenue for his priorities, which include beefing up the state’s reserves and putting funds into education and health care.

By leaving room for negotiation, Otter opened the door to a more complex rewrite of the state’s tax code, and Democrats jumped on Otter’s plan, calling for a refundable tax credit for larger families and an expansion of Medicaid.

Competing Priorities

In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, Jan. 8 called for an increase in the state’s personal exemption to offset the potential $1.5 billion in increased taxes that Michigan taxpayers would have to pay without action. That proposal opened the door to more comprehensive tax change proposals by both Republicans and Democrats.

“We are putting Michigan families first, by working to enact a simple and fair solution to fix the unintended consequences of the federal tax plan,” Snyder said in a statement, referring to the higher taxes the state will collect absent any tax law changes.

Snyder, a fiscal conservative, earlier had condemned the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible because it adds to the federal deficit. But Republican members of the Michigan Legislature already are clamoring for deeper cuts to state taxes, beyond Snyder’s simple solution to lower taxes just enough to make up for the federal windfall.

Arlan Meekhof, the Senate majority leader, and a fellow Republican, said Snyder’s plan was merely a “good start. I think there’s more we can do to put people’s money back in their pockets,” he told the Detroit News. Michigan’s last big tax change was a cut in corporate taxes in 2011.

Any time there’s extra money around, competition is fierce. In Maryland, for example, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has pledged to rewrite the state tax code to lower rates in an effort to blunt the $400 million in higher state taxes residents could otherwise expect.

But Democrats in the state Legislature, including Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., say some of the money should be kept in reserve to cover the costs of CHIP, the federal health insurance program for low-income children, or Medicaid.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) refused to comment during a Thursday morning interview with CNN on whether or not President Donald Trump described countries like Haiti, El Salvador and several African nations as “shithole countries” during a meeting last week, saying he wants to ensure he can keep the lines of communication with Trump open.

“I want to make sure that I can keep talking to the president,” Graham said. “I told him what I thought, and that’s more important to me than anything else.”

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who was among the lawmakers in the immigration meeting with Trump, confirmed what he called the president’s “hate-filled, vile and racist” comments last Friday. The president subsequently attacked Durbin on Twitter Monday, writing that the senator “totally misrepresented what was said.”

Along with Trump’s “shithole” remark and other happenings in the current administration, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Graham whether he thinks the president is racist.

Graham said that to Trump, the color of one’s skin “doesn’t matter, as long as you’re nice to him.”

“You could be dark as charcoal or lily white — it doesn’t matter, as long as you’re nice to him. You could be the pope and criticize him — it doesn’t matter, he’ll go after the pope. You could be Putin and say nice things, and he’ll like you,” said Graham.

Graham elaborated on this point, calling Trump a “street fighter” and that the president is just hitting back at his critics.

“It’s not the color of your skin that matters, it’s not the content of your character — it’s whether or not you show him respect and like him. And if he feels like you’re off-script, you don’t like him, he punches back. And as president of the United States, the only advice I can give [him] is that the street fight is over.”

This sort of commentary from Graham is fairly consistent with the senator’s recent appearance on “The View,” where he walked back his previous words about Trump.

Though Graham had once called Trump a “xenophobic, race-baiting religious bigot” during the presidential campaign, the senator now feels that isn’t the case.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― Lawmakers appeared a little closer Wednesday to passing yet another short-term spending bill to keep the government open, but as Senate Democrats looked increasingly likely to cave, conservatives in the House looked increasingly likely to fight ― or at least get some concessions. And depending on what demands GOP leaders give in to, those changes could still throw the Senate into chaos and the government into a shutdown.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) emerged from a meeting with Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) on Wednesday night saying House Republicans don’t yet have the votes to pass another short-term spending fix, called a continuing resolution (CR).

“At this point, if the vote were to happen today, there’s not the votes to fund it with Republican-only votes,” Meadows told reporters Wednesday night.

Still, Meadows said they were making “good progress,” and he expected leadership to have some accommodation for conservatives.

The Freedom Caucus is pushing for leadership to take the monthlong CR and add military funding for the rest of the year ― or, at least, to fund some parts of the military for a longer period of time. And if leadership can’t get that, conservatives sound open to supplying some votes if leadership puts on the floor a hard-line immigration bill sponsored by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and pushes to get it passed.

“I haven’t made that formal request,” Meadows said earlier in the day of giving the immigration bill a vote, “but certainly if they were to come and say they were going to pass the Goodlatte bill and put that on the floor tomorrow, I think a whole lot of my members would be willing to vote for that. Sure.”

Meadows said later Wednesday, after his meeting with McHenry, that conservatives wanted more than just a vote on that Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration bill, which would include approval of a border wall, a change in family reunification immigration and then end of the diversity visa lottery. But he was clear earlier that a commitment from GOP leaders to pass that bill would be a “strong influencing factor” in winning over Freedom Caucus votes for the CR.

House leadership is in a bind right now because, about two days before a government shutdown, they still don’t have the votes to pass this government funding bill. (When a reporter asked Meadows how many Republicans were against the current legislation, Meadows said he didn’t know leadership’s whip count, “I just know mine.”)

With current vacancies and GOP absences, Republicans look like they can lose only 21 votes and still pass the CR if every Democrat withholds their vote until Republicans put up a passing number.

“There’s certainly more noes and undecideds than 21 right now,” Meadows told HuffPost.

McHenry spent much of Wednesday trying to find the votes by meeting with members on and off the House floor. With Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) out for surgery, McHenry has been tasked with finding the votes for a fourth continuing resolution in a fiscal year that began in October.

That perpetual game of kick-the-can has already angered many defense hawks, with Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and Rob Wittman (R-Va.) voting against the CR at the end of December. Now McHenry is trying to keep the defense hawks in line yet again while also brokering a deal with conservatives that could imperil the legislation in the Senate.

Senate Democrats are already shaky about this current CR, but some have signaled they would support the measure to avoid a government shutdown. “I just don’t think there’s any way in the world that anyone should be talking about shutting down the government,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told reporters Wednesday.

That support might waver, however, if House Republicans begin attaching longer-term military funding to the bill in an effort to break the tie between defense and non-defense caps. Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested that, if House Republicans could send a bill with additional military funding to the Senate, it would be tough on the most vulnerable Democrats to oppose that bill, which in turn could force more Democrats to support it.

“I mean, really, does Joe Donnelly want the government to shut down because he wants amnesty for people who came to this country illegally?” Jordan said Wednesday, referring to the moderate Democratic senator from Indiana who supports deportation protections for immigrants who were brought here as children. “I don’t think so.”

There may be some truth to vulnerable Democrats feeling the pinch with a revised bill, but if House Republicans push too far, Senate Democrats won’t have too much trouble voting no and blaming it on Republicans, who control the House, Senate and White House.

At the same time, if Republicans were unable to advance any bill out of the House ― where only a simple majority is required to pass a bill ― it’d be fair to say a government shutdown is entirely the fault of Republicans.

That’s the balancing act facing GOP leaders. They want to pass the most Republican bill that Senate Democrats would approve while avoiding a showdown in which Democrats reject the legislation.

Democrats also have their own considerations. They don’t want to be blamed for a government shutdown over what wasn’t included in the bill.

Still, Democrats have repeatedly held off on a real battle with Republicans over DACA, and most Democrats apparently believe it’s unacceptable to continue pushing this immigration fight down the road.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that no one at the Democrats’ weekly lunch meeting wanted to support the current short-term spending bill. If that’s the case, we’re headed for a government shutdown anyway. It’s just difficult to see that sort of statement, for now, as anything but posturing.

Yes, Democrats want a DACA deal. No, they don’t want another CR. But a shutdown over a bill that is a government funding extension is a precedent Democrats would probably also like to avoid. And Republicans have their own interest in making sure a lapse in government funding doesn’t occur, particularly when they control all the levers of government.

The closer lawmakers actually get to midnight Friday, the more willingness there may be on either side to negotiate. With so little time and the universe of compromises narrowing, though, Congress could easily find itself in a government shutdown that no one really wanted and hardly anyone really expected.

The physician added that there was “no indication of any cognitive issues,” dismissing concerns about Trump’s mental fitness.

“The Late Show,” however, needed a second opinion. So, on Wednesday’s show, they called upon a motley crew capable of shrinking down to get a close look at the president’s innards: the brave explorers of the animated TV series “The Magic School Bus.”White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told a meeting of Democratic lawmakers that President Donald Trump’s campaign pledges to curb immigration ― including his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― were uninformed, and that such a structure was unlikely to happen in full, according to multiple media reports.

Kelly made the comments to members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday in a closed-door session that was first reported by The Washington Post. His comments were confirmed by Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), who was at the meeting.

“I can confirm that Chief of Staff Kelly said today that the President’s campaign was not fully informed about the wall he was promising to voters,” Gutiérrez said in a statement. “Kelly went on to say that many campaigns are not fully informed about every policy and that campaigning and governing are two different things and that governing is harder.”

Gutiérrez also went on to confirm reporting by The New York Times that Kelly took credit as the “one who tempered” Trump’s more extreme opinions on the wall and the viability of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, also known as DACA.

“Kelly took credit for educating the President on the wall and that a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea was no longer the conception of border security barriers supported today by the White House,” Gutiérrez said.

But Trump on Thursday dismissed reports he’d softened his stance, tweeting that the wall “has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it” and that it “will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico.”

During the meeting, Kelly said he was optimistic about the prospect of a DACA deal and that the president was “committed to a permanent solution,” according to the Post. Kelly later told reporters that he believed an agreement would “be worked out” by Congress.

The comments put one of Trump’s most senior aides at odds with the president’s recent statements continuing to stump his wall. Trump insisted that Mexico would still pay for the construction in an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, although he clarified that it would pay “indirectly” through the North American Free Trade Agreement.

“[Mexico] can pay for it indirectly through NAFTA,” Trump told the Journal. “We make a good deal on NAFTA, and, say, I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying.”WATCH HOW THIS SCHOOL IN PUERTO RICO REACTS TO THE POWER FINALLY COMING BACK ON After 112 days. [HuffPost]

BEFORE YOU GOActivists of color rallied in Washington on Wednesday to condemn President Donald Trump reportedly labeling Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries.”

Several organizations ― including UndocuBlack Network, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, National Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC), and the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC) ― held a press conference near the Supreme Court, protesting the “racist” comments, along with Trump’s stance on several immigration issues.

The activists also urged Congress to pass a so-called clean Dream Act before midnight on Friday, the deadline for keeping the government funded. A Dream Act would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to stay in the U.S., without adding to the bill border security measures and other immigration provisions sought by Trump.

Sam Yu, Communications Coordinator, for NAKASEC told HuffPost that it was important that communities of color come together as a united front on immigration.

“These issues aren’t just Black, or AAPI, or Latinx. Because of that, we must come together and stand with all of our communities, for none of us are free until all of us are free,” he said.

The activists were joined by others, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and California Senate leader Kevin de León (D), in speaking out against Trump’s opposition to protections for immigrants from several nations. The administration has terminated the temporary protected status programs for people from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Sudan.

TPS designation is typically given to countries that have conditions that would endanger nationals who return to them. But now, more than 200,000 people currently living in the U.S. have a matter of months to either leave or face deportation.

The activists called for a Dream Act that would address the plight of both these TPS holders and the almost 800,000 Dreamers who could face deportation if a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― which Trump has ended ― isn’t passed before March.

“As a member of UndocuBlack Network, we understand the importance of standing up for what is right, and I am here to fight against what was said regarding my home country of Haiti,” Guerline Jozef, president of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said at the press conference. “I represent the Haitian community, I represent the American community, and I represent the bridge between the two.”

She also said the protesters ”are here to stand on behalf of those who cannot stand for themselves and to demand that Congress pass the clean DREAM Act that includes protections for TPS holders.”

Jozef added: “Elected officials must put politics aside and look at the people affected by their political games. This is not a game, these are our lives!”

The protesters also called on Congress to keep the diversity lottery program and the family sponsorship program intact. Trump had announced in November that he was “starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery program.”

The president had blamed the lottery for the deadly truck attack in New York City that killed eight people and injured several others. The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, used the visa lottery program to legally emigrate from Uzbekistan in 2010, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed.

Trump has also pushed for an end to “chain migration,” a term immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing immigrants to sponsor their family members to join them in the U.S. Immigration activists have long rejected the term, labeling it “dehumanizing.”

The termination of the family-based system would undoubtedly affect communities of color, with the majority of Asian immigrants coming to the U.S. through this manner, reports show.

Jayapal said at the press conference that she hoped to maintain both the diversity lottery and family-based migration system, saying “we are not going to substitute one family’s pain for another family’s gain.”

She also expressed confidence that that a clean Dream Act would pass Congress.

“We are fighting hard for something that we are going to win, and the reason we’re going to win is because of Dreamers,” she said. “Dreamers are out in the street, telling their stories every single day, and making Americans understand that [they] are, in fact, part of our country and are here to stay, not to be used as a political football.”

She stressed that Democrats would not accede to compromises sought by Trump to pass a Dream Act. “We are not going to touch the family immigration system, and we are not going to touch the diversity visa program,” she said.

Yu told HuffPost that the groups will continue protesting and putting pressure on Congress.

Speaking to CBS News correspondent Major Garrett for the podcast “The Takeout,” attorney Ty Cobb said Trump “wants to put the matter to rest,” adding that there were currently “active discussions” about a possible meeting between the president and Mueller’s team.

The statement from Cobb came after the White House spent weeks dancing around the issue, with Trump repeatedly refusing to give a straight answer on whether he’d agree to an interview.

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump said last Wednesday as he lambasted the investigation as a “Democrat hoax.” Days before, Trump suggested that he would meet with Mueller if asked, then he immediately deflected the question.

Mueller has informed Trump’s legal team that he would likely seek an interview with the president for his investigation, The Washington Post reported.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that his campaign did not collude with Russia.

“For 11 months, they’ve had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government, and it has hurt our government,” Trump said during a news conference last week, referring to the probe. “It’s a Democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election.”

This week, former White House strategist Steve Bannon reportedly agreed to an interview with Mueller after he was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury. Bannon, who reportedly struck a deal with the special counsel, could be interviewed as early as this month, per NBC News.

On the “Takeout” podcast, Cobb said he expected Mueller’s investigation to conclude in the next four to six weeks. However, the attorney has been off the mark on this topic in the past, New York magazine noted. Cobb told Reuters last August that he’d be “embarrassed if this [probe] is still haunting the White House by Thanksgiving and worse if it’s still haunting him by year end.”The Trump administration is increasingly hauling asylum-seekers into criminal courts and slapping them with convictions for illegally crossing the border, instead of sending them to immigration judges to hear their claims, according to a new report from the nonprofit group Human Rights First.

While most people who enter the United States illegally are processed by civil immigration courts, crossing the border without authorization is a crime under federal law. The first offense is a misdemeanor, carrying a sentence of up to six months in jail. Getting caught again can lead to felony “illegal re-entry” charges, with sentences of up to 20 years, depending on the person’s criminal record. In practice, most people serve much shorter terms and are then deported.

Those prosecutions aren’t supposed to apply to asylum-seekers. When someone declares a fear of returning to their home country, those words are supposed to trigger a referral to an asylum officer to establish whether the claim is legitimate ― even if the person crosses illegally into the United States. Those claims are heard by the civil immigration system, not the criminal courts.

Those rules haven’t changed since Donald Trump was elected president, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection told HuffPost in an email.

“Every individual encountered who is a candidate for removal is asked if they have a fear of returning to their country,” the spokesman said. “CBP officers do not determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed.”

Last year, agents referred nearly 55,000 immigrants who said they feared returning to their home countries to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to CBP. That figure includes people arrested by Border Patrol as well as people who tried to cross through legal ports of entry.

But Human Rights First says the agency routinely violates that policy in practice. In a survey of 39 defense lawyers who handle such cases carried out by the group, 48 percent said asylum-seekers made up about half of their clients. All of the respondents said they had represented at least one asylum-seeker prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry.

Some lawyers said they had received Border Patrol arrest reports with the words “Credible Fear Claim” stamped on them. A “credible fear” interview is one of the first steps toward applying for asylum.

“This administration has been painting asylum-seekers and really all immigrants as criminals,” Olga Byrne, one of the report’s authors, told HuffPost. “And by referring people for prosecution ― including people who previously had no contact with the criminal justice system ― the administration is essentially creating the kinds of statistics they want to put out to the public, that immigrants are criminals.”

The HRF report ― which was based on observation of more than 700 prosecutions across eight federal courts from April 2017 to this month ― cites dozens of cases of people crossing into the U.S. to ask for humanitarian protection, only to find themselves in a group hearing facing expedited criminal charges instead.

One woman from Honduras said she fled death threats and asked for asylum, according to the report. A Mexican man said he feared returning to his home country because his sexual orientation exposed him to violence. A Venezuelan couple who said they faced threats from the government in their home country were charged with illegal entry and separated from their 15-year-old daughter in the process.

Since the advent of a 2005 program called “Operation Streamline,” immigration prosecutions have grown to swallow up a massive share of the federal criminal docket. Immigration prosecutions consistently accounted for about half of the federal criminal docket during the Obama administration.

The number of people prosecuted on illegal entry and re-entry charges has declined steadily since 2013, however. Last fiscal year, which began in October and included Trump’s first eight months in office, federal immigration prosecutions fell 14 percent compared to the year before, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Those numbers are dropping because illegal crossings themselves have plummeted to the lowest levels seen since the 1970s. A greater share of those who do cross into the United States are people who say they are fleeing the violence-plagued Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

Before Trump took office, it was not unknown for people to face prosecution for immigration violations. HuffPost observed at least three cases in October 2016 for a report about such prosecutions.

But the authors of the HRF report contend that the phenomenon is becoming more common under the Trump administration, which has criticized the asylum system and urged prosecutors to prioritize immigration prosecutions, even as illegal crossings drop.

In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued guidance to all 94 U.S. attorneys asking them to prosecute illegal re-entry charges more aggressively. (Anyone with a deportation on his or her record can be charged with illegal re-entry, even if the arrest occurs outside the U.S.-Mexico border region.)

Within three months, prosecutors in Tucson, Arizona, had already begun charging dozens of first-time crossers per day with illegal entry misdemeanors ― a practice the court had not seen in years. Prior to Sessions’ directive, prosecutors in the Tucson area had usually only filed criminal charges against people who had been caught crossing illegally in the past.

Sessions has also criticized U.S. asylum laws, claiming that Central American migrants game the system.
