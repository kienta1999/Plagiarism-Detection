A federal judge ruled Tuesday that six-term Colorado Rep. Doug Lamborn (R), who was thrown off the 2018 ballot last month over a signature-gathering violation, will be allowed to appear on the ballot after all.

The judge’s decision reverses last month’s state Supreme Court ruling that Lamborn should be removed from the ballot after officials discovered one of his petition-gatherers wasn’t a Colorado resident, which disqualified him from the June primary.

Lamborn campaign spokesman Dan Bayens released a statement saying the lawmaker is ready to “move on” from the signature controversy and continue his campaign.

“Consistent with Court rulings here in Colorado and around the country, the federal court agreed that the part of Colorado election law that requires petition collectors to be state residents is unconstitutional and unduly infringes on the First Amendment rights of voters and petition circulators,” Bayens said.By Nico Lang

The largest gayborhood in Los Angeles has declared May 23 “Stormy Daniels Day.”

In a ceremony at the adult entertainment store Chi Chi LaRue’s, West Hollywood Mayor John J. Duran handed Daniels the keys to the city of 34,000 residents, in addition to a city proclamation. WeHo officials recognized what Duran referred to as her “leadership in the #RESIST movement” in a press release sent to members of the media.

“In these politically tumultuous times, Stormy Daniels has proven herself to be a profile in courage by speaking truth to power even under threats to her safety and extreme intimidation,” the statement reads.

Daniels and Duran were both present at the Wednesday ceremony — as was Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti.

In her speech, she noted the city’s relevance to the LGBTQ community, who make up an estimated 46 percent of WeHo’s population. Daniels also paid tribute to her close friend, Keith Munyan, and his partner of five years, J.D. Barrale.

“As a woman with two wonderful gay dads, Keith and J.D., I feel especially at home here,” Daniels said. “The community of WeHo was founded more than three decades ago on the principle that everyone should be treated with fairness and dignity. This community has a history of standing up to bullies and speaking truth to power.

“I am elated,” Daniels continued. “Thank you to everyone.”

Daniels (née Stephanie Clifford) is suing President Donald Trump for defamation after the Commander-in-Chief denied an affair between the two, which allegedly took place in 2006. The adult film star has subsequently fought to void a confidentiality agreement signed just days before Trump won the 2016 presidential election.

Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, reportedly paid the 39-year-old entertainer $130,000 as part of that nondisclosure agreement.

Federal authorities are currently investigating whether that payoff constituted an in-kind donation to his campaign, which would breach campaign finance laws. The POTUS denies the payment was illegal (and the alleged affair), even despite an FBI raid on Cohen’s house last month.

Daniels’ lawyer said she would continue to fight until the truth comes to light.

“She is not packing up,” Avenatti told the West Hollywood crowd. “She’s not going home. She will be in for the long fight, back each and every day.”

The Wednesday ceremony was just the latest symbolic action WeHo officials have taken to counter the Trump administration. Its City Council passed a resolution in June 2017 calling on Congress to impeach the president, citing the “possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.”

West Hollywood has also reaffirmed its commitment to being a sanctuary city, opposing the administration’s enforcement of extreme immigration laws.

In 2016, Councilwoman Lindsey Horvath made national headlines after claiming the “violence and intimidation” that Trump represents are not welcome in the LGBTQ enclave. She noted in an open letter that the “people of West Hollywood have seen the devastation and destruction that hatred and hate speech can bring.”The life of a musician on the road can be tough when you’re in love. For Ben Hazlewood, the emotional challenge of being apart from his husband provided artistic inspiration.

The Australia-based singer-songwriter drew on his recent heartache for his latest single, “Months & Miles.” The video for the clip sees Hazlewood traipsing about the California desert in Gucci and Ralph Lauren-designed ensembles as images of his real-life hubby appear as “memories” throughout.

“Will you open up in June when the moonlight hits that water. Throw your arms around my neck before you disappear in August,” Hazlewood sings on the bluesy track, which had its Billboard debut last week. “All these months and all these miles are taking a toll on us. Come let me lay my bed next to you. So we never lie alone.”

“From a young age, I was really inspired by artists that spoke their minds and could capture an emotion through their music,” Hazlewood told HuffPost. He added the song “was written after a long stint away from my then-fiancé where the distance had got the better of me. I hope that [listeners] can use it as a soothing anthem for when they are missing the ones they love.”

"Many brave and strong people from the LGBTQ community dared to dream," singer-songwriter Ben Hazlewood said. "We must pay homage and respect to those who fought for so long for equality." Nikko LaMere

“Months & Miles” marks the start of a new musical chapter for Hazlewood, who first made a splash in 2006 on “New Zealand Idol,” followed by a 2012 stint on the debut season of “The Voice Australia.” It’s his first new tune since the 2017 EP, “Eos,” and will likely be a part of a forthcoming, full-length album, which is slated for a 2019 release.

Naming David Bowie, Freddie Mercury and Stevie Nicks as influences, Hazlewood has never shied away from expressing his authentic self through his music. The video for his 2017 single, “Darkest Hour,” comprised archival footage from LGBTQ rights demonstrations and milestones, including the aftermath of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida.

“I never saw it possible five years ago that I would be married,” he said. “Yet many brave and strong people from the LGBTQ community dared to dream, and we must pay homage and respect to those who fought for so long for equality.”The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will have his salary reduced following scrutiny over his $375,000 pay, which is nearly double what his predecessor earned.

Dr. Robert Redfield, who was selected to lead the agency in March, made the request after media outlets reported on his salary last week, prompting criticism from Senate Democrats and watchdog groups.

A government spokesperson confirmed the pay reduction to HuffPost on Tuesday but declined to say what Redfield’s new salary will be.

Redfield, who was a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the co-founder of the university’s Institute of Human Virology before joining the CDC, reportedly asked Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar for the pay reduction.

“Dr. Redfield has expressed to Secretary Azar that he does not wish to have his compensation become a distraction for the important work of the CDC,” an HHS official told HuffPost in an email.

“Therefore, consistent with Dr. Redfield’s request to the Secretary, Dr. Redfield’s compensation will be adjusted accordingly,” the official said.

In comparison, Azar, Redfield’s boss, earns $199,700 a year ― a figure that is set by law. Redfield’s predecessor, Brenda Fitzgerald, earned $197,000, The Washington Post reported.

Redfield benefited from a provision known as Title 42, which gives federal agencies the ability to offer higher-paying salaries when trying to fill specific scientific positions that the agencies are otherwise struggling to fill, according to The New York Times.

Former CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, left, was paid $197,300, while HHS Secretary Alex Azar, right, is currently paid $199,700. handouts

Sen. Patty Murray (Wash), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was among those questioning Redfield’s lucrative pay and why he benefited from the special provision.

“It is difficult to understand why someone with limited public health experience, particularly in a leadership role, is being disproportionately compensated for his work as compared to other accomplished scientists and public health leaders in comparable roles within the federal government,” Murray stated in a letter sent to Azar on Friday.

Murray asked that the HHS explain its reasoning for applying Title 42, and asked for evidence that the agency employed “extensive and exhaustive” search efforts in finding a CDC director before resorting to the use of the provision.

HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley defended Redfield’s hiring in a statement sent to HuffPost that said it had utilized “a rare opportunity to hire one of the world’s leading virologists.”Republican Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens refuses to resign, despite being embroiled in scandal. Handout/Reuters

Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson needs to convince Republican voters that even though he used to be a Democrat, he’s now a true conservative who is the best choice to be their nominee in November.

A super PAC is trying to help him out. Americas PAC put out a radio ad favorably comparing him to other Republicans who used to be Democrats.

But the spot is proving less than helpful because one of the politicians it highlights is Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, who is in the middle of sexual misconduct and ethics scandals.

Americas PAC head Tom Donelson told the Associated Press that the ad was made months ago and “should not have been sent to the stations.” He said the group sent a replacement spot to radio stations, but some still ran the old version.

The ad does not name Greitens, but it mentions the “governor of Missouri” and had audio of him saying, “All of those things made me a conservative not by birth but by conviction.”

“Like the governors of Missouri and West Virginia, Kevin Nicholson left the Democrat Party. Kevin Nicholson chose to be a conservative Republican,” the ad’s narrator says.

Because candidates are legally barred from coordinating with these outside groups, it also means they can’t stop a super PAC when it’s about to mess up.

“Sometimes we love the ads, and sometimes it’s not what we would have chosen,” Nicholson spokesman Brandon Moody said.

Greitens is certainly not someone Republicans are rushing to associate with these days. He faces a felony charge of invasion of privacy related to an extramarital affair he had with a woman.

His trial is set to begin May 14. He is accused of taking the woman to his basement, taping her up, blindfolding her and taking a partially nude photograph of her without her consent. He allegedly coerced her into a sexual act and threatened to release the photograph if she ever told anyone about him.

Greitens admitted to the affair but has denied the other allegations. He has refused to step down.

Additionally, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, said he believes Greitens committed a felony by illegally obtaining a donor list from a charity. The New York Times reported that Hawley declined to file charges and referred the matter to St. Louis’ circuit attorney.

In Wisconsin, Nicholson faces state Sen. Leah Vukmir in the Aug. 14 Republican primary. The winner will face Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the general election.

Americas PAC is primarily funded by conservative billionaire Richard Uihlein, who is based in Illinois. He is Nicholson’s biggest backer and is largely responsible for turning him into a contender for the Senate race. Following his usual strategy, Uihlein picked Nicholson early, then established and donated to super PACs to boost his candidacy.

Uihlein initially supported Greitens’ gubernatorial bid, and he’s now supporting Hawley a his race for U.S. Senate. Uihlein also backed GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama, who faced allegations of pursuing teenage girls years ago when he was many years older than them.Well, a new trailer for “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” the next film in Marvel Studios’ lineup, dropped on Tuesday ― and it just might be the antidote to your superhero-related woes.

The pint-size hero played by Paul Rudd was mysteriously absent from “Infinity War,” which scored the biggest box office opening of all time over the weekend, but he’s back with a new teammate, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly).

According to the official synopsis, the film begins after the events of “Captain America: Civil War” and before the chaos of “Infinity War,” so it seems we may find out exactly where the characters were ― maybe the Quantum Realm? ― when “Infinity War” hit us with that ending.

“Ant-Man the franchise is very light-hearted. It’s fun. It maybe even skews younger,” Christopher Markus, one of “Infinity War’s” screenwriters, told The Hollywood Reporter recently. “If we were to put Ant-Man in this extremely heavy movie, and then have to say to the guys who are making the Ant-Man movie, ‘Yeah, he went through hell, but now go ahead and have your little romp and we’ll pick it up afterwards,’ that’s why we have to really sort of manage your interconnections and go, ‘Let’s go and hold off so you can enjoy that without feeling a bad taste in your mouth.’”

The film stars Michael Douglas, Michael Peña, Bobby Cannavale and Judy Greer, as well as newcomers Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Hannah John-Kamen as the villain Ghost and Laurence Fishburne as Bill Foster ― a character who, in the comics, also takes on the names Black Goliath and Giant-Man. Peyton Reed, who helmed the first “Ant-Man” movie in 2015, returns as director.The internet has been fixated on Michelle Wolf's jokes at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner.

Believe it or not, other things have been happening the past few days besides Michelle Wolf’s comedy routine at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.

An endless number of tweets, reports, think pieces and punditry have dwelled on the comedian’s Saturday night act, focused primarily on whether she was too mean to members of President Donald Trump’s administration.

Representatives for the social media company reportedly reached out to Jackie Stokes, founder of cybersecurity consulting firm Spyglass Security, after she tweeted the accusation about a Facebook engineer on Sunday.

Facebook is investigating the claim “as a matter of urgency,” Alex Stamos, the company’s chief security officer, said in a statement to HuffPost on Tuesday.

“It’s important that people’s information is kept secure and private when they use Facebook,” Stamos said. “It’s why we have strict policy controls and technical restrictions so employees only access the data they need to do their jobs – for example to fix bugs, manage customer support issues or respond to valid legal requests. Employees who abuse these controls will be fired.”

Stokes claimed an unnamed Facebook security engineer may have used “privileged access” to track down women, citing what she said were screenshots of a Tinder conversation between the employee and an identified woman.

I’ve been made aware that a security engineer currently employed at Facebook is likely using privileged access to stalk women online.

Facebook initially confirmed the investigation in a statement to The Wrap. The company has a “zero-tolerance approach to abuse” and “improper behavior results in termination,” its statement said.

The alleged Tinder exchange Stokes shared doesn’t necessarily prove abuse, though she tweeted Sunday that there was more “evidence” that she had not released to the public.

Stokes declined to comment for this article.

The accusation comes amid mounting scrutiny over Facebook’s ability to protect its users’ data and privacy. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last month about his company’s handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which millions of Facebook users’ data were improperly shared with the political research firm.Kanye: I know Obama was heaven-sent,

“I want to move to Israel and run for prime minister, I do. I do have that fantasy. If God calls me, I’ll go, of course,” she said during a lengthy interview at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference in Manhattan on Sunday.

Her prime minister dream could segue into her other “fantasy of being an old Jewish lady living in the Jewish homeland. … I want to buy a farm there and maybe bring my family,” said the 65-year-old comedian.

For now, Barr is committed to finishing out the resurrected “Roseanne” and has signed on for another season. She was happy about the call from President Donald Trump congratulating her on the show’s success. “He’s really into ratings — like I am,” she quipped. She thanked him for deciding to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, adding: “It’s the first step toward peace in the world.”

Barr said she met Trump “several times when he was just a civilian ... just a show business person, and he’s always been very nice to me.”

She explained that she didn’t make her character Roseanne a Trump supporter because she was herself. “I had her become a Trump supporter because she’s a working-class person, and it is the working class that elected Donald Trump. So, in being true to that little demographic, I had to do it.”

Besides, no one else in the cast would do it. “They were, like, no way,” she said.

Barr launched her own goofy campaign for president in 2012, chronicled in the documentary “Roseanne for President.” Legalizing marijuana and bringing back the guillotine were platforms. “I am the only serious comedian in this race,” she insisted during the campaign.

She told People magazine in March that running for president again is “never off the table.” She added: “I’m going to keep running until I win.”WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas and six other Republican-governed states on Tuesday sued the Trump administration to try to end a program launched by Democratic former President Barack Obama that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.

The states filed suit in federal court in Texas in the latest twist in an ongoing policy and legal fight over the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Republican President Donald Trump already has tried to rescind.

Trump said in September he would terminate DACA and end its protections for immigrants sometimes called “Dreamers,” but gave the Republican-controlled Congress until March 6 to replace it. Policy differences between Trump and lawmakers in both parties led to Congress failing to act.

In the meantime, courts ruled that the program can stay in place for now, although new applications will not be accepted.

The program protects around 700,000 young adults, mostly Hispanics, from deportation and gives them work permits for two-year periods, after which they must re-apply.

Texas, joined by Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia, argued in the lawsuit that the Obama administration exceeded its authority by creating the program without congressional action.

“Our lawsuit is about the rule of law, not the wisdom of any particular immigration policy,” Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement.

“Texas has argued for years that the federal executive branch lacks the power to unilaterally grant unlawfully present aliens lawful presence and work authorization,” he added.

The lawsuit asks the judge to wind down DACA, which would prevent any new permits from being issued or renewed but would not cancel current permits.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera, who was appointed by Obama.“Queer Eye,” Netflix’s reboot of Bravo’s “Queer Eye For the Straight Guy,” is coming back for a second season as soon as next month.

The lawsuit, led by California, argues that President Donald Trump’s EPA violated the Clean Air Act and failed to follow its own regulations when it announced last month that it was scrapping national vehicle emissions standards aimed at cutting oil consumption, air pollution and carbon emissions.

“Trump is a one-man demolition derby on science and the Clean Air Act,” Gov. Jerry Brown said at a Tuesday press conference. Borrowing Trump’s name-calling penchant, Brown repeatedly referred to EPA chief Scott Pruitt as “Outlaw Pruitt.”

An EPA spokesperson said the agency wouldn’t comment on pending litigation.

This phalanx of states will defend the nation’s clean car standards to boost gas mileage and curb toxic air pollution. 🌎https://t.co/6t4sHygNT5 — Jerry Brown (@JerryBrownGov) May 1, 2018

The EPA announced last month that it intended to roll back the landmark Obama-era rule tightening vehicle fuel standards that automakers agreed to in 2012. That federal policy required vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon ― nearly double today’s standard ― by 2025. It was predicted to cause oil consumption to fall by 12 billion barrels, prevent 6 billion metric tons of planet-warming gases from ever entering the atmosphere and save consumers $3,200 to $5,700 in gasoline costs over a vehicle’s lifetime.

The EPA said in a 38-page finding last month that it was reconsidering how climate change would factor into such regulations, and said overturning the Obama-era standards would benefit Americans by lowering gas prices.

But California and 17 other states, plus Washington, D.C., object to the EPA’s view with the lawsuit. The plaintiffs represent about 140 million Americans and more than 40 percent of the U.S. car market, Brown and other officials emphasized at the press conference.

“Defend clean car standards,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra urged Pruitt. “Don’t tear them up.”

This lawsuit follows nine other suits California has filed against the EPA previously, Becerra said.It doesn’t take John Kelly calling Trump an idiot or Tillerson saying he’s a fucking moron for us to know what a complete an utter fool we have in the WH.

The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in Santa Monica, accuses Weinstein of causing Judd to lose a part in 1998 in the film “The Lord of the Rings” by making “baseless smears” against her.

The lawsuit, reviewed by Reuters, alleges that Weinstein “was retaliating against Ms. Judd for rejecting his sexual demands approximately one year earlier, when he cornered her in a hotel room under the guise of discussing business.”

“Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms. Judd’s reputation and limit her ability to find work,” the lawsuit added.

A representative for Weinstein issued a statement hours later saying the onetime film studio chieftain had “neither defamed Ms. Judd nor ever interfered with Ms. Judd’s career.”

Instead, the statement said, Weinstein “championed” Judd’s work and “repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies” - “Frida” in 2002 starring Salma Hayek, and “Crossing Over” with Harrison Ford in 2009. It also said he had “fought for Ms. Judd as his first choice for a lead role in “Good Will Hunting.”

The statement did not address Judd’s allegations that she was sexually harassed by Weinstein.

Judd was one of the first women in October 2017 to make an on-the-record allegation of sexual misconduct against Weinstein, which soon afterward evolved into the social media #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. The Oscar-winning producer has since been accused of sexual impropriety by more than 70 women.

He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Judd, a leading member of the “Time’s Up” movement against sexual harassment in the workplace, is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial.

Judd’s representative did not immediately return a call for comment.UPDATE: Aug. 2 — Claire Foy, the leading star of the hit Netflix series “The Crown,” said in an interview published last week that a report she had received back pay for her role as Queen Elizabeth II during the show’s first two seasons was “not quite correct.”

The Daily Mail, citing an anonymous source, reported in April that Foy received an additional $275,000 in back wages following news that she was paid less than her male co-star Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.

“I’ve never mentioned anything about it and neither have the producers,” Foy said in an interview with Al Arabiya. “The fact that that is ‘fact’ is — not quite correct.”

When reached for comment, Foy’s representative would neither confirm nor deny to HuffPost the earlier report that the actress had received additional compensation. Production company Left Bank Pictures and Netflix, which distributes the series, did not respond to requests for comment. Neither Foy nor Smith is returning for the series’ third season, which picks up its narrative several years later and will have older actors in the roles.

PREVIOUSLY:

Actress Claire Foy reportedly received a nice chunk of change after discovering she was earning less than her male co-star.

Foy, who won a Golden Globe last year for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in the hit Netflix series “The Crown,” was paid an additional $275,000 to plug the pay gap, The Daily Mail reported.

During an INTV conference panel last March, Netflix producers admitted that Foy was paid less than her British co-star Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip. Foy received an estimated $40,000 per episode. Smith’s rate was not revealed, but Foy’s back pay would indicate he received nearly $14,000 more for each of 20 episodes.

Producers also apologized for the pay disparity.

“Going forward, no one gets paid more than the queen,” Variety quoted Susan Mackie, creative director of Left Bank Pictures, after news of the gap emerged.

“We are absolutely united with the fight for fair pay, free of gender bias and for a rebalancing of the industry’s treatment of women in front of the camera and behind the scenes,” Left Bank Pictures said in a statement at the time.

Netflix tried to excuse the pay gap by citing Smith’s high-profile star stint on “Doctor Who.” However, Foy won critical and popular acclaim for her portrayal of the show’s main character. She was even lauded by the actual queen.

“She’s the queen, for God’s sake. It’s ridiculous,” Smith told Page Six recently at the Tribeca Film Festival. He told The Hollywood Reporter: “Claire is one of my best friends and I believe that we should be paid equally and fairly.”

Neither Foy nor Smith will return to “The Crown” for the third and fourth seasons because the story jumps ahead in time and different actors will be used.

Foy told Entertainment Weekly that it was a “bit odd” to find herself at the center of a story she “didn’t particularly ask for.” Yet during a panel discussion in Hollywood last weekend, she announced that she had the “most extraordinary revelation about myself and womankind.” She said it was “amazing that the conversations people are having now, people think we’ve always been able to have, but we haven’t.”

It’s possible to “be your own advocate,” Foy added. “You can make a point ... without it being you being ‘difficult.’ It can actually just be you supporting yourself.”Katie Couric at the premiere for her National Geographic series, “America Inside Out.” Bryan Bedder via Getty Images

You’ve seen Katie Couric on your TV as a morning show host and as an evening anchor dishing out the day’s news. Now the veteran journalist says she is eager to tell “the story behind the story.”

In her new National Geographic documentary series, “America Inside Out,” she does deep reporting on hot-button topics tearing the country apart.

“I wanted people to hear multiple points of view, and I also think because the new cycle is so fast and furious … we just see the headline. It whizzes by us,” Couric said. “The news cycle gives us very little room to step back and consider things.”

In the May 9 episode, titled “The Revolt,” she tackles gender and equality by speaking with gender specialists, talking with experts about bias and interviewing James Damore, a former Google employee who questioned the company’s diversity initiatives. She also sits down with actresses Viola Davis, Geena Davis and Elisabeth Moss to discuss inclusion in Hollywood.

Through it all, Couric explores how gender inequality, unconscious bias and sexual harassment are linked. What she learned surprised her.

“Women leave tech, for example, at a rate twice as high as men. Not because of work-life issues but because of toxic cultures,” she said.

Asked whether she’s hopeful for a future filled with advances in equality for women and people of color, she said, “I am, and I’m not.”

“I think one of the media’s responsibilities is to continue to put pressure on organizations to understand cultures and how you change cultures because the people who are in positions — the power — are invested in maintaining the status quo,” Couric continued. “And I think, unfortunately, the moves that are made are almost lip service and not systemic changes. You’ll see more organizations putting more women in leadership positions, but are they really, truly in leadership positions? Are they window dressing? I would love to see more transparency by companies and more accountability. I’d love to see some leaders put in place with tangible changes ― and track them. I just don’t know how much of that is really going on.”

Although there’s momentum with the Time’s Up and Me Too movements, she thinks more fundammental changes need to be made within organizations.

“As much the conversation has happened, I think there hasn’t been enough focus on how do we change things and move forward in the work environment and in terms of public policy?” she said. “That’s what I was hoping to do — how can we actually make real progress and change things not only for women but for all minorities to make workplaces more representative?”

In the six-episode series, Couric reports on other polarizing issues, including race, politics, technology and censorship ― all while trying to provide a deeper understanding for the audience.

“I had to look at a lot of information, big topics, and figure out how do I make this subject engaging, how do I illustrate it accurately and fairly and how do I make people feel?” Couric said. “And how do I make them care? And how do I make them walk away and say, ‘I never really thought about that.’ And then get them to think about it some more. It’s a big challenge. But otherwise, what’s the point?”TONIGHT: The White House is running very smoothly despite news that Trump's chief of staff called him an "idiot" and "unhinged." #LSSC pic.twitter.com/lXtHDqQiGGMueller's list of questions MUST include, "How will you solve the looming avocado shortage?" "Would you consider yourself a helicopter parent to Don Jr?" and "How many times have you watched Okja?"A New York doctor who served as President Donald Trump’s personal physician is alleging that Trump’s lawyer, bodyguard and an unidentified “large man” raided his office for medical records.

Dr. Harold Bornstein tells NBC News that the alleged raid took place in February 2017, just two days after Bornstein told The New York Times he had been prescribing the hair growth medicine Propecia for Trump for years.

Bornstein, a Manhattan-based doctor, told NBC that White House aide Keith Schiller, Trump’s longtime personal bodyguard; Alan Garten, Trump Organization chief legal officer and a third unidentified man raided his home. The trio showed up at Bornstein’s office without notice and took all the president’s medical records.

Bornstein said the incident left him feeling “raped, frightened and sad,” according to NBC News.

“They must have been here for 25 or 30 minutes. It created a lot of chaos,” Bornstein added.

Bornstein said he was never given a HIPAA release form signed by Trump. The confiscation of medical documents without a signed form is a violation of patient privacy law.

A source familiar with the incident told NBC News that then-White House doctor Ronny Jackson wrote a letter to Bornstein requesting the records, but it was unclear if there was a release form attached.

Bornstein said they took the original and only copy of Trump’s charts, including lab reports under the president’s name, as well as those under the pseudonyms the office used for Trump.

Adding insult to injury, the men told Bornstein to take a framed photo of him and Trump off the waiting room wall. It now lies under a stack of papers on Bornstein’s bookshelf.

At least one legal expert thinks the raid was “sort of a burglary” because medical records were taken without proper authorization.

Michael Zeldin, a former special assistant to Robert Mueller, told CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have informed Bornstein that he was changing doctors and needed copies of the medical records sent to the new doctor.

“He may have, under HIPAA or other things, an obligation to retain those files himself,” Zeldin said. “So, in a sense, it’s sort of a burglary. They just sort of took out this stuff without any sort of legal process that authorized them to do that. And it’s a little bit frightening.”

HuffPost reached out to the White House, which did not immediately respond.

But press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said removal of the medical records was “standard procedure” for a newly elected president, according to a tweet from Boston Globe reporter Matt Viser.

Meanwhile, Bornstein still doesn’t understand why Trump was so angry about the Propecia revelations. He added that he told the Times that Trump was also taking drugs for rosacea and cholesterol as well.

“I couldn’t believe anybody was making a big deal out of a drug to grow his hair that seemed to be so important,” Bornstein told NBC News. “And it certainly was not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take Propecia to grow their hair. What’s the matter with that?”Tracy Morgan recalled his drug-pushing past on “Conan” Monday.

“I sold crack, yeah, but I was a crack dealer with a heart of gold,” he told host Conan O’Brien. “I would sell them crack and then feel sorry for them.”

The former “Saturday Night Live” trouper said he would warn his customers that the stuff would kill them. “I always kept my heart in it,” he said.

Morgan, 49, has talked about his early years before and expressed remorse for turning to the drug trade as a youth. His new TBS show, “The Last O.G.,” provided a natural segue to discussing his personal history because he plays a drug dealer released from prison after 15 years.

In Monday’s chat, the comedian transitioned into what seemed to be a mix of shtick and reminiscing. And there were a few jaw-dropping remarks about his refusal to wear a condom as well.Louisiana’s top election official resigned Tuesday amid a lawsuit from one of his staffers accusing him of sexual harassment.

The announcement was a reversal for Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler (R), who previously refused to resign and said in March it would be “cowardly” to do so after the allegations were first made.

Dawn Ross, who was an assistant to Schedler but now works in the secretary of state’s office in a reduced role, filed a lawsuit in state court in February accusing him of engaging “in a pattern and practice of sexual harassment and retaliatory harassment” for nearly a decade. After hiring her as his executive secretary in 2011, she said in the suit, he made repeated passes at her, including coming to her home with love letters, cards and sex tapes. Ross also alleged that Schedler, a former president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, repeatedly implored her to join him for meals and trips.

Ross claims that Schedler retaliated when she rebuffed his advances by ordering that she stay out of his sight, sending her to work in a separate building and stripping her of all job responsibilities. She says she was even forbidden from eating with other employees so that she wouldn’t risk being seen by Schedler.

In March, Schedler, who has been secretary of state since 2010, said he would not resign but wouldn’t seek re-election in 2019. He said he had a consensual sexual relationship with Ross, which Ross denies, and that he would fight the allegations. But after calls for his resignation grew, Schedler resigned Tuesday.

″I leave office with a heavy heart knowing I have disappointed the people in my life who care for me the most. But I also have experienced from them the miraculous power of forgiveness and grace during the twilight of my career, and for that I am grateful,” he wrote in his resignation letter to Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who had called on him to step down. “I have been incredibly frustrated with the tabloid approach to an incredibly serious allegation and the necessity of following the advice of counsel not to try this publicly. I trust the judicial process will fairly consider all the facts when they can be properly presented in due time.”

Schedler, 68, who is married, said his resignation would take effect May 8.

Ross, who is in her 50s, was surprised by Schedler’s sudden resignation, according to Jill Craft, her attorney. Craft said Ross’s decision to keep numerous letters, cards and other messages Schedler allegedly sent her helped rebut what Schedler said publicly.

Craft provided HuffPost with a sampling of the cards Ross alleged Schedler sent her. On the front of one of the cards is a man standing under mistletoe with the word “yes.” On the other half of the card is a picture of the same man with the mistletoe over his groin that says “no.” “Well here’s another tradition that I bet you forgot and a very naughty one at that!” Schedler allegedly wrote in the card. “Something to moderate even the most boring of nights even after St. Nick is on his way! Make you hot into night!”

″It took a tremendous amount of courage for her to stand up, especially given that the defendant is a statewide elected official,” Craft said in an email. “Although he has claimed he had a ‘consensual’ relationship with Ms. Ross, not only does she vehemently deny that claim, but many of the written communications he sent her verify she repeatedly rebuffed his advances and told him ‘no.’”A gay Kentucky man who was denied a marriage license by Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis nearly three years ago has lost his bid to unseat her.

A 20-year employee of Rowan County’s property valuation office, Caudill got 54 percent of the 3,534 votes cast to Ermold’s 25 percent.

Ermold, an assistant professor of English at the University of Pikeville, responded to the loss in a series of tweets Tuesday. Saying he knew winning the primary and unseating Davis would be “a difficult task,” he nonetheless stressed his efforts to “reaffirm Rowan County as a diverse and welcoming community” had “only just begun.”

To all those who have worked so hard on this campaign, I want to thank you very much for your strong spirit and dedication. Every day of this campaign, I have been both honored and humbled to work alongside you. You are the heart and soul of democracy. I will always be grateful. — David Ermold (@DErmold) May 23, 2018

We knew from the beginning that we had a difficult task, and while our campaign is coming to a close, our work to reaffirm Rowan County as a diverse and welcoming community has only just begun. — David Ermold (@DErmold) May 23, 2018

Later, he thanked his supporters, noting, “Without you, we never could have gotten this far.”

Finally, I want to thank all of our supporters in Rowan County. Without you, we never could have gotten this far. Your concern for our county has made us a stronger community, a community that I am proud to be a part of. — David Ermold (@DErmold) May 23, 2018

Davis, who changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican in 2015, is seeking another term this fall. The Apostolic Christian made global headlines when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2015 marriage equality ruling, citing her religious beliefs. She was briefly jailed for contempt of court.

In December, Ermold told HuffPost that he sought the role of county clerk in hopes of uniting residents from both sides of the political aisle after Davis’s anti-marriage equality crusade became international news. He said he’d begun mulling a campaign more seriously last fall, after Davis accompanied Harry Mihet of evangelical Christian nonprofit Liberty Counsel on a nine-day trip to Romania with the aim of encouraging lawmakers to adopt legislation against same-sex marriage there.

Two years ago, Kim Davis denied David Ermold a marriage license because he was gay, despite it being legalized.

“If I’m going to point out something that’s wrong, then I want to be a part of the solution, too,” he said. “The people in our community are ready to move on, and they don’t want Kim Davis out there making announcements, going to other countries and dragging us through the dirt over and over and over again, and that’s what she keeps doing.”

Responding to news of Ermold’s primary loss, Davis told USA Today Wednesday, “The people have spoken, and they have spoken loudly.”Entertainment 'Avengers' Stars Laugh In The Face Of Twitter Trolls' 'Mean Tweets'

"Benedict Cumberbatch always looks like he's had an allergic reaction to bad shrimp."No longer is “Who bit Beyoncé?” the biggest mystery on the internet.

Former members of boy band *NSYNC reunited for a game of “Never Have I Ever” on Tuesday’s episode of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” — and Justin Timberlake pretty much revealed that he once hooked up with a Spice Girl.

But now everyone wants to know: Was it Melanie Brown (Scary), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Emma Bunton (Baby) or Victoria Beckham (Posh)?

For the segment, host Ellen DeGeneres asked the five former bandmates (who split in 2002) a series of questions — and told them to answer by holding up a paddle which had “I Have Never” written on one side and “I Have” on the other.

DeGeneres kicked off with a softball question about who’d hooked up with someone twice their age, before quizzing them on who had been romantically involved with a Spice Girl.

Timberlake deliberated about how to answer as his former bandmates — Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, JC Chasez and Chris Kirkpatrick — held up the “I Have Never” side of their paddles.

The “Man of the Woods” singer then reluctantly began to hold up the “I Have Never” side before DeGeneres firmly placed an “I Have” sign on his thigh, and he briefly flipped his own paddle to the “I Have” side too — to the delight of the audience.Facebook (FB) wants to help get you … into a long-term relationship. That’s according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who announced that his company will begin rolling out a new dating feature during the social network’s F8 developer conference on Tuesday.

The dating app, Zuckerberg said, is meant to help bring people together in long-lasting relationships, not random hookups. The CEO explained that the app was designed with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning. That’s incredibly important, especially when it comes to dating apps.

To get to the dating feature, you’ll simply tap the heart icon in the top right corner of your Facebook profile. Your dating profile will only show your first name, and will only be visible to other people on the dating service, so your Facebook friends won’t see your dating activity.

In the dating app, you’ll be able to see potential matches, as well as nearby events that match up with you personal interests. You can then tap an event to unlock it and see other dating app users who are interested in the event and start messaging with them.

Facebook says you can only send text in the messaging feature, and that it’s not connected to Messenger or WhatsApp. That’s a good move, since it would be pretty awkward to send a message meant for your potential bae to your Aunt Charlotte.

Online dating giant Match Group sells off sharply

Equally interesting will be how Match Group responds to Facebook’s move. The owner of a slew of dating apps including Match, Tinder and OkCupid, among others, Match Group is a leader when it comes to dating communities. But with more than 2 billion monthly users, Facebook could quickly become the leader in the dating market.

Investors seem to think so, as well, as Match Group’s (MTCH) sold off sharply after the news and was down about 19 percent in afternoon trading. IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), which is the majority owner of Match, was down 12 percent.

More from Dan:LONDON — Nat Whalley launched her startup after seeing two friends get made redundant at their jobs when they were pregnant.

“I thought, ‘That happened to my mum 30 years ago. I didn’t think it would happen to people our age today’, but it did,” she told HuffPost.

One of her friends, in her late 20s, had lost her job at a university. Questioning the legality of the move, Whalley — who has worked for activism groups 38 Degrees and Avaaz — used her campaigning knowhow to try to reverse the decision. She turned to online crowdfunding to help, pleading for donations to mount a court challenge.

“It was the threat of that alone that was enough for the university to offer my friend a new job, with all the benefits,” Whalley said. “The power of the crowd is something that I experienced then, and I knew there was something there.”

As employment issues at companies like Deliveroo and Uber increasingly hit the headlines, her startup, Organise, hopes to help workers take concerns from the office, shop floor or workshop all the way to the boardroom. It has 20,000 users on its online platform and has managed to make big companies like fashion chain River Island clarify their policies for staff.

“I don’t think there’s ever a right time to step out and do it,” the 28-year-old said of giving up a salaried job to start her company in the hope of revolutionizing the fight for workers’ rights.

Organise wants workers to “team up” with others in their company, or sympathetic supporters, and make their workplace better. Anyone can become a member of the website and start a campaign.

Users sign up and can find others in their company and in similar industries, and start petitions, open letters and surveys. Whalley monitors fledgling campaigns and can quickly spot those that begin to resonate. “If there’s energy behind it, it will grow on its own,” she said. Organise will also help successful campaigns to reach more people affected by the same issue, primarily through Facebook ads.

Whalley notes that despite concerns around workers’ rights blowing up, union membership in the U.K. is at an all-time low. She hopes Organise offers a digitally savvy alternative. “We’re giving people the tools to represent themselves,” she tells HuffPost. “The idea is, simply, that wherever people are at work, whatever the problem, there is something they can do.”

The startup now has a two-person staff. Lead campaigner Usman Mohammed, 27, joined Whalley to speak to HuffPost in their shared office space at a trendy tech incubator in Shoreditch, east London. “You look at union membership going off a cliff, workers’ rights being screwed, Brexit on the horizon,” Mohammed said. “This is the perfect moment for something like this.”

A selection of Organise’s membership also receive an email survey each week which constantly provides the startup with anonymous insights into different workplaces. Engagement, the pair say, is surprisingly high. And tips from the surveys can turn into campaigns affecting thousands of workers.

They’ve already heard from aggrieved workers at big names like Amazon, U.K. television channel ITV and River Island, where they found that workers claimed they were forced to lie that they were sick to swap shifts to go to essential appointments.

“It was funerals, picking up kids and hospital appointments that were the top three things people couldn’t attend because they weren’t allowed to swap shifts,” Mohammed said.

After initially hearing from two workers at the chain, they asked one to set up a petition and sent it out to workers through targeted Facebook ads. “Within a week, we had 400 workers sign it,” Whalley said. While users sign the petition with their name and email, the organization does not share personal information with companies.

The pair also used the survey data and personal accounts to compile the sort of report you might expect to see in a corporate boardroom, and sent it to family-owned River Island, which employs around 12,000 people in Britain.

“This was then on their radar,” Mohammed said. It turned out that workers were allowed to swap one shift a month — but managers were not telling employees.

River Island told Organise that it would reiterate its policy to all shop managers. The company declined to comment when contacted by HuffPost.

“Now we’ll go back to our 400 River Islanders and see if things have changed,” Mohammed added, saying that both he and Whalley have been frustrated at the slow pace of change in big companies.

Whalley thinks traditional unions need to better adapt to digital technology. “I think unions are going to have to start shifting their communications and be open about working in a slightly different way,” Whalley said, pointing to McDonald’s and the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union that represents some of its workers as an example. “The Bakers Union got two branches out on strike for the first time in history [over issues of pay and contracts which gave no guarantee of work], incredible — but there were so many workers across the country wanting to do the same, yet [the union] had no method of capturing them.”

“Which is how we ended up with such a big petition,” she said of an Organise campaign which includes over 2,000 McDonald’s workers from across the U.K. pushing the company on the same issues. “We are struggling to find a way of getting these workers into a union — for that particular union, you have to join on paper.”

“You have to print off two sheets and send them in ... who owns a printer?” Mohammed said.

“It is stuff you wouldn’t expect in the ’90s, potentially, let alone now,” Whalley said. “So for us, we think the unions will catch up with some of the tech and we can work in parallel with them too.”

While the startup invites comparisons with unions, Organise is not an official representative body and doesn’t pretend to be. Whalley says the focus is on providing the tools and direction to workers who can then represent themselves.

“We are a startup and there’s only two of us so we can be very nimble,” she says. “We use a set of tools that might be completely different in a year’s time. We’re both under 30 and come from digital backgrounds.”

This flexibility means they can support workers who don’t necessarily spend time with their peers in person, she added. “Our tools work if you don’t have an office, if you’re out riding on Deliveroo, or if you work from home because it’s cheaper for your firm to do that, I think it’s a lot more agile to run.”

Chris Benson, head of employment at U.K. law firm Leigh Day, said that in the fragmented modern workplace where employees are often vulnerable, platforms like Organise can be an effective tool. “While an online platform cannot replace the bargaining power and protection that can be offered by a well-resourced trade union,” he added, “they do have a place supporting the rights of those currently beyond the reach of traditional trade unions.”

New ideas being tested include a Facebook Messenger bot which guides people through a series of questions to identify legal problems around workplace safety or sexual harassment. It allows people to upload pictures and other proof of the problems they have faced, and presents questions in simple language rather than jargon.

The idea has yet to be tested live, but it has Whalley and Mohammed excited.

“We can find out if there’s a legal basis for claims relatively easily,” Whalley said. “But it’s all in non-intimidating language. There are emojis. You can upload photos. It’s just easier.”

Ultimately, they hope that campaigning in a fluid and personalized way will suit the fragmented, digitally focused nature of work today.

“We’re building a progressive force for change and we want to be across the private sector and the public sector,” Whalley said. “People don’t speak in the coffee room because there isn’t a coffee room anymore. Workplaces, how people work, the nature of work, is completely changing. So this is about building a community that reflects modern working.”

The rest of the approximately 150 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador continue waiting at the border to claim asylum in the U.S., said Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group that organized the caravan. But the entry of even a few members of the group into the U.S. is a triumph nonetheless, according to a Facebook post.

The caravan group has been camping out since Sunday near the San Ysidro port of entry between San Diego and Tijuana. Customs and Border Protection officials blocked the migrants’ entry into the U.S., claiming they first needed to process those already waiting at the U.S. crossing facility, which is filled to capacity.

The caravan’s arrival at the border is the culmination of a weeks-long odyssey for a group that at one point consisted of about 1,200 people, including children, who travel together as protection from kidnappers, muggers and rapists who prey on the immigration route. They gathered almost one month ago in southern Mexico, moving northward. Some dropped off along the way, but hundreds made it to Tijuana on Wednesday, announcing they planned to enter San Diego over the weekend.

President Donald Trump first drew attention to the caravan several weeks ago, when he slammed the migrants as a national security threat and deployed the National Guard to protect the border. He reignited the conversation Monday in a tweet, assailing U.S. immigration law:

The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 30, 2018

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned that anyone entering the U.S. illegally would be prosecuted. Claiming asylum out of fear of persecution in another country, however, is entirely legal. These caravans have been operating for a decade without much attention to help those escaping violence find safe haven in the U.S. or Mexico.

Still, the Department of Justice on Monday filed criminal charges against 11 suspected members of the caravan, alleging they illegally entered the U.S.

Meanwhile, the other migrants continue waiting, sleeping outdoors.President Donald Trump dubbed comedian Michelle Wolf “filthy” following her White House Correspondents’ Association dinner performance on Saturday. And for once, “Late Night” host Seth Meyers agrees.

“She is filthy and she is mean, which is what we love about her because those are wonderful qualities for comedians and terrible qualities for free world leaders,” Meyers said of his friend and “Late Night” alum on Monday.

Wolff’s new show “The Break” debuts on Netflix at the end of May, and Meyers said “you can be sure that it will be great” because Wolf wouldn’t waste time “trying to decide when it is or isn’t proper to make fun of people in power who lie to us on a daily basis.”
