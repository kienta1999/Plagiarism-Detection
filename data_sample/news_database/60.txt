Disney’s “Star Wars”-themed lands at its California and Florida resorts now have opening seasons.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge will open first at Disneyland in Anaheim in the summer of 2019, followed by a late autumn opening for the one at Disney’s Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.

The company also released new artwork for the village, which will be called Black Spire Outpost:

The 14-acre expansion will represent a location on a planet called Batuu, which the company previously called “a remote outpost on the galaxy’s edge that was once a busy crossroads along the old sub-lightspeed trade routes.”

Disney Imagineer Scott Trowbridge said last year it’s the kind of location that draws “the smugglers, the bounty hunters, the rogue adventurers looking to crew up, the people who don’t want to be found ― basically all the interesting people.”

Guests will be able to interact with characters, work to support either the Resistance or the First Order and develop a “reputation” within the Star Wars environment.

“An experience might begin on board the Millennium Falcon and follow you right out the door of the attraction and into the local watering hole,” Imagineer Asa Kalama said at a panel discussion last year.

There will be two major attractions. One is a Millennium Falcon ride in which guests will “pilot” Han Solo’s famed ship. The other is a ride in which the company said: “Visitors will find themselves in the middle of a tense battle between stormtroopers and Resistance fighters.”

There will also be “Star Wars” dining and ― of course ― retail options. In addition, the company is planning a “Star Wars”-themed hotel in Florida.Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, sharply responded to the suggestion that she was confused when she said that President Donald Trump’s administration would be imposing more sanctions on Russia.

“With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” the ambassador said in a statement to Fox News’ Dana Perino, who read the comment during her Tuesday show.

Haley was responding specifically to Trump’s newly appointed economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said earlier on Tuesday that the ambassador “got ahead of the curve” when she told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would announce additional sanctions on Russia for supporting Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.

“There might have been some momentary confusion about that,” Kudlow told reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, a day after reports surfaced that Trump had reversed his position on imposing sanctions. The reversal surprised fellow Republicans and seemed to clearly undermine Haley.

Kudlow walked back his comment in an interview with The New York Times, saying he was wrong to say Haley was confused.

“She was certainly not confused. I was wrong to say that — totally wrong,” he said. He added that Haley was not informed of a change in policy.

Daniels was ostensibly on the show to promote his new Hulu miniseries, “The Looming Tower.” But he appeared visibly stunned when Carrey sauntered onto the stage. The duo warmly embraced before performing a dance.

“Jeff had no idea you were coming out,” said O’Brien.Johnny Galecki’s character David made a much-anticipated return to the rebooted “Roseanne” Tuesday night, dragging his scruffy self back into the lives of Darlene (Sara Gilbert) and the rest of the Conner family.

But will he stay?

Galecki’s lone appearance this season ― he’s working on a little sitcom called “The Big Bang Theory” ― revealed that he was helping the underprivileged out of the country, according to outlets. That left his longtime love Darlene to move back in with mom Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) to raise their kids without him.

During his visit, he informed Darlene that he’s moving back to Lanford ― but he’s got a girlfriend named Blue. “While I have been picking up kids’ clothes, dealing with meltdowns, cleaning up vomit, you’re dating a crayon?!” Darlene remarks in perhaps the line of the night.

David explained that his do-gooder journey, which Darlene called “Deadbeats Without Borders,” was really just a way of dealing with his brother Mark’s death ― a plot point the show addressed due to the 2002 death of the actor who played Mark, Glenn Quinn.

Darlene and David sleep with each other, perking up talk of a reconciliation. However, Darlene later concludes that Darlene-David 2.0 isn’t happening.

David’s moving back to town anyway, so the door is open for an appearance in Season 2.

See you soon, David?

Some fans would be just fine with a more permanent arrangement.

The animal was discovered in time and survived.

An inspector for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said she was “left utterly disgusted” by the shocking case of cruelty that an unknown perpetrator is believed to have carried out overnight Monday in the town of Blackwood.

A passerby noticed the male hedgehog, who was unable to curl up due to its belly pointing outwards from the tree, on Tuesday.

“We have been left utterly disgusted by this shocking incident, with a poor hedgehog cruelly tied to a tree by a makeshift crucifix of shoelaces,” the inspector, Izzi Hignell, said in a written statement.

“This hedgehog will have suffered immeasurably by this horrendous ordeal, and was found with a series of injuries ― including facial problems, and a bleeding nose, mouth and leg,” Hignell said.President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Stormy Daniels’ claim that a man threatened her in order to silence her about an affair with Trump “a total con job.”

On Monday, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded him the prestigious honor in music for his album “DAMN,” calling it “a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life.”

In many ways, Lamar’s ability to paint a true picture of black life is what makes “DAMN.” — and the rest of his catalog — Pulitzer-worthy. The conceptual conflicts he dissects throughout the album — pride vs. humility, love vs. lust, fear vs. trust (mostly in God), individuality vs. conformity, and, as Lamar explores in the album’s conclusion, “me vs. me” — are easily recognizable. It’s hard for black folks not to relate to Lamar’s boisterous pride in his African ancestry, his crisis of faith, his fear of returning to poverty and his anger at racial inequality.

His ability to capture the essence of black life, at its most minute, is also what makes “DAMN.” a great piece of journalism. The album chronicles the black struggle in real time, which makes listening to a Lamar album as satisfying as reading the works of Ida B. Wells or James Baldwin. His music, like the best journalism, is rooted in the moment and grounded in historical significance — like “King Kunta,” an oxymoronic ode to his life as a wealthy black man in America. “DAMN.” is a comprehensive explanation of the black struggle today that deserves its spot in the history books because, like The New York Times’ and The New Yorker’s Pulitzer-winning reporting on sexual assault, Lamar is documenting the reality we live in.

“DAMN.” is really an oral history, undoubtedly on par with the late Zora Neale Hurston’s finally-to-be released Barracoon.

But because he’s not writing for news outlets or bound to regressive notions of journalistic objectivity, Lamar’s work achieves something most reporters can’t: It speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain. In an industry still dominated by the white gaze, Lamar isn’t required to let both sides have a voice. Instead, his music lifts the weight of black communities alone — a burden he confronts in “FEEL.”

I feel like the whole world want me to pray for ’em

But who the fuck prayin’ for me?



Overall, his combination of reflexive narrative writing and scathing critiques of police violence, poverty and crime in black communities confronts the stories that many media outlets overlook. In doing so, he highlights how the people in these communities manage to survive. Of course, some journalists have dedicated their careers to similar work. But where journalism often prefers to focus on the grittier, more violent aspects of black life, Lamar is free to show the joy, too. His music captures the complexities of what people are feeling at this very moment in America’s political history, and in laying out our fears, he also puts forward our hopes of overcoming them. He amplifies black self-worth.

If you play any Lamar album 40 years from now, it will give you the pulse of black struggle, of black life as it exists at this moment. Its rawness. Its unglamorous bits. Its hope. Its joy.Damon Scheleur / HuffPost

WICHITA, Kan. ― Three right-wing militiamen from rural Kansas were found guilty on Wednesday in a 2016 plot to slaughter Muslim refugees living in an apartment complex in Garden City.

Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were found guilty on charges of weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights. Wright was also found guilty on a charge of lying to the FBI. The defendants will face a potential life sentence when they come back to court in late June.

The jury decided the case after slightly less than a day of deliberations. The three defendants showed little outward emotion as the verdicts were read. Afterward, defense attorneys comforted the defendants’ family members, who did not wish to speak to members of the media.



In closing arguments, attorneys for the defendants had accused the FBI of overstepping and targeting the group because of rhetoric that, while hateful, was protected by the First Amendment.

The prosecution’s case depended largely on secret recordings made by Dan Day, an FBI informant who masqueraded as a militia member, infiltrating the three men’s group for months. An undercover officer working on behalf of the FBI had also met with Stein, posing as an arms dealer who shared the group’s anti-Muslim beliefs and was willing to build them a bomb.



Jurors heard recording after recording of the men expressing a murderous hatred of Muslims, who they called “cockroaches.”

“The fucking cockroaches in this country have to go, period,” said Stein, who went by the code name “Orkin Man” in text messages with other militia members. “They are the fucking problem in this country right now. They are the threat in this country right now.”

In another recording, the men could be heard mapping out targets on Google Earth, dropping a “pin” labeled “cockroaches” over areas they knew to have a high concentration of Muslims. They eventually settled on a main target: a Garden City apartment complex that’s home to many Somali Muslim immigrants and the mosque where they worship.

The prosecution presented evidence that the men had started to collect explosive materials. Per the recordings made by Day, their plan was to detonate bombs at the apartment complex in November 2016. They wanted the explosions to occur during Muslim prayer times when more potential victims would be there, “packed in like sardines,” as Stein put it. The bomb’s shock waves, he hoped, would make “Jello out of their insides.”

Defense attorneys had attempted to characterize such comments as mere bluster. But prosecutors pre-empted this line of argument, in part, by calling another militia member to the stand.

Brody Benson, part of the Kansas Security Forces militia, held anti-Muslim beliefs himself. “Fucking Islam,” he wrote in a Facebook post in June 2016. “I’m done. Kill them all. Bring on the DOJ.”

But Benson testified that when he heard Stein talk about his plan to kill Somali immigrants in Garden City, he knew Stein was for real.

“I actually thought it was not just talk — it was more of an actual action, action,” Benson said in testimony. “I had a gut feeling that what was just banter back and forth, ranting and everything else, was turning into something more serious and concrete.” “This isn’t a case about the thought police,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi said during closing arguments. “The defendants plotted to murder dozens of innocent men, women and children. They didn’t just talk. They’re not here because of their words.” In his final comments to the jury, Mattivi focused on a recording of a discussion the men had about what type of shrapnel to pack their bomb with to inflict the most damage. Stein suggested blades for drywall knives. Allen said ball bearings. “Anything that will kill and maim,” Wright said.

The men were enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump, who vilified Muslims during his presidential campaign and has continued to do so while in office. During the plotting, Stein reportedly referred to then-candidate Trump as “the Man.” The men had planned their attack for after the 2016 election, so as not to hurt Trump’s chances of winning. Delaying the attack until then would avoid giving “any ammunition” to their political opponents, Stein said.

Trump had frequently spoken out against Muslim refugees in the runup to the 2016 election. Kansas’ top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister, brushed aside a question from HuffPost about what effect the now-president’s words had.

“I can’t say whether his rhetoric impacted the case or not,” McAllister, a Trump nominee, said. He later added that this case wasn’t about the rhetoric the defendants used, but about the bomb plot they agreed to participate in.

“I don’t view this as a prosecution of speech at all. This was a prosecution of speech coupled with actions,” McAllister said. “Just because you have some words involved doesn’t mean this was about speech. This was about actions, and their speech was to some extent evidence of the actions they were taking.”

The Justice Department’s national press office sent out a press release on the case featuring a quote from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling the jury verdict a “significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes” and touting DOJ’s commitment to fighting both foreign and domestic terrorist threats.

“The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin. That’s not just illegal ― it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it,” Sessions said. “Law enforcement saved lives in this case.”

Madihha Ahussain of the group Muslim Advocates praised Wednesday’s verdict, but said Americans must not ignore the “greater context” in which the plan unfolded.

“We cannot dismiss the disgusting rhetoric of these militiamen as mere ‘locker room talk’ as the defendants’ counsel argued. The stakes are simply too high,” Ahussain said. “Anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to an unprecedented spike in hate violence and mosque attacks, intense radicalization of white supremacists, and a shocking disregard for the lives of American Muslims.”

“This must not become the norm for American discourse,” Ahussain continued. “We must not be divided by hate, but, rather, stand together as a united nation to defend our ideals, values, and beliefs.”Sitting in a traffic jam is bad enough. Watching someone speed by on the shoulder only makes it worse.

Then, something happens to change your mood.

WASHINGTON ― The Republican food stamp bill would cut benefit spending by billions of dollars by shrinking enrollment, but the bill’s author says nobody would actually be kicked off the program.

Instead, he says, anyone who stops receiving benefits after new “work requirements” take effect ― either because they couldn’t document 20 hours of work per week, or because they didn’t enroll in a training program ― will have simply chosen not to receive benefits anymore.

“If food stamps are not worth whatever the deal we put up ― the array of opportunities we have for them ― if it’s not worth that, then fine,” House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) told HuffPost on Wednesday. “We’re American. I’m not going to force food stamps on anybody.”

Conaway’s bill would impose work requirements that the Congressional Budget Office has said would reduce spending on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by $9 billion over 10 years, which amounts to a spending cut of about 1 or 2 percent. Democrats say roughly 1 million fewer Americans would receive benefits.

The bill would plow an additional $7 billion into a new training program that Conaway says would allow anyone to fulfill the work requirement if they can’t find a job. The proposal would mark a significant shift from current law, which imposes work requirements on a subset of SNAP recipients but doesn’t require states to provide slots in employment or training programs that fulfill the requirements.

“We don’t kick anybody off the program per se,” Conaway said on a radio program Monday. He has also said people would “self-select” to not receive benefits.

Democrats aren’t buying it.

“Let me be clear: This bill, as currently written, kicks people off the SNAP program,” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said Wednesday. “The Chairman may call them ‘self-selections,’ but let’s call this exercise what it is ― reducing SNAP rolls.”

The committee approved Conaway’s work requirements Wednesday as part of a broader “farm bill” that includes changes to an array of agribusiness welfare programs. With Democrats and conservative House Republicans opposed, the legislation seems unlikely to become law in its current form.

More than 40 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, making it one of the biggest safety net programs in the U.S., and since it’s relatively easy to qualify, it’s probably the most responsive to changes in economic need. Though it’s known as a “farm bill,” food stamp spending represents about 80 percent of the total cost of the legislation.

The work requirements would apply to SNAP recipients between 18 and 59 years old so long as they don’t have a disability or children younger than 6, whereas the strictest requirements under current law don’t apply to people in their 50s or any parents with minor children. The measure would require beneficiaries to document at least 20 weekly hours of work or qualifying activity every month.

“Many workers would likely lose benefits if they couldn’t provide the needed paperwork to show they were working, if their employer cut their hours below 20 hours per week, or if they were temporarily out of work — all realistic scenarios given the reality of low-wage work,” Brynne Keith-Jennings, a senior research analyst with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a blog post Tuesday.

If the policy had been in place in 2016, more than 9 million SNAP recipients would have been affected, according to the CBPP. Only 3.8 million adults met the criteria for the strictest work requirements under the law that was in place that year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Conaway spokeswoman Rachel Millard said the proposal would not necessarily require people to visit state offices in person. “They work with their case manager/vendor to explore a reporting avenue that works for them, and in most cases that is not in-person,” Millard said in an email.

Peterson said the $7 billion workforce provision would create “giant, untested bureaucracies at the state level.” Potentially millions of SNAP recipients would need to enroll in training. Current workforce programs serve fewer than 1 million.

The entire debate over work requirements for able-bodied adults is a racist dog whistle, Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.) said.

“The image of able-bodied men not working are African-American men in the minds ― not of everybody’s mind ― but there are unfortunately people out there who have this mental disposition,” Scott said at Wednesday’s hearing.

A HuffPost/YouGov poll earlier this year showed that most Americans wrongly believe most food stamp recipients are black.

U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson said Kobach had failed to comply with a 2016 preliminary injunction that blocked a Kansas law requiring people to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote. The decision affected roughly 18,000 people whose registrations were being held up, and Robinson told Kobach to make sure those voters were fully registered. Kobach assured her that he would and that he would send out postcards to any affected voter.

Kansans usually get a postcard before an election informing them of their polling place, and those who didn’t get them before an election would likely have been confused, the plaintiffs said at the trial.

More than a year and a half later, the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the voters who challenged the Kansas law, filed a motion to hold Kobach in contempt, saying he had failed to send out the postcards and update the county election manual to reflect Robinson’s 2016 order. In a contentious hearing, Kobach said his office had orally instructed county clerks to send out the postcards but could not force them to do anything. Robinson was furious, saying that Kobach had assured her in court that he would send out the postcards.

Robinson imposed sanctions on Kobach on Wednesday, saying he had to pay the ACLU for attorney fees and that “any further remedial measures” would be decided when she ruled on the merits of the case.

The plaintiffs, a handful of eligible voters unable to get on the rolls, argue that the Kansas law, which went into effect in 2013, violates a 1993 federal law called the National Voter Registration Act. The federal law requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer people the chance to register to vote and only allows them to ask for the minimum amount of information necessary to do so. Robinson’s 2016 preliminary injunction put the law on hold and she oversaw a bench trial in the case in March. A final ruling is expected later this year.

“Secretary Kobach likes to talk about the rule of law. Talk is cheap, and his actions speak louder than his words.” - Dale Ho, the ACLU’s top voting rights lawyer.

Kobach defends the law as necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting in the state, but he has produced just 129 instances in which noncitizens attempted to vote in Kansas. The ACLU says the law is extremely restrictive and unnecessary.

“The Secretary of State’s Office will be appealing this decision,” said a Kobach spokesperson after the contempt ruling. “Secretary Kobach has no additional comment at this time.”

Robinson’s Wednesday order was scathing, and was particularly directed to Kobach, who made the unusual choice to represent his own office at the trial. She said that Kobach, who is running for governor of Kansas, had made disingenuous arguments to the court and suggested that her 2016 order was dynamic and not law. She also said Kobach had a history of “noncompliance” and “disrespect” for the court in the case. Kobach, who ran President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission until it was disbanded in January, was fined $1,000 for making misleading statements to the court in the case last year.

“The judge found that Kris Kobach disobeyed the court’s orders by failing to provide registered voters with consistent information, that he willfully failed to ensure that county elections officials were properly trained, and that he has a ‘history of noncompliance and disrespect for the court’s decisions,’” Dale Ho, the ACLU’s top voting rights lawyer, who faced off against Kobach in court during the trial, said in a statement. “Secretary Kobach likes to talk about the rule of law. Talk is cheap, and his actions speak louder than his words.

Bryan Caskey, the state director of elections and a staffer in Kobach’s office, recently filed an affidavit in the case saying that he had instructed county election officials to send out the postcards and had orally done so before trial. Robinson said that was “too little, too late” to avoid a contempt finding. She noted that Kobach had maintained until the trial that he wasn’t obligated to send out the postcards. She said she didn’t find it credible that his staffer had orally instructed counties to send out the postcards before the trial.

Robinson also took Kobach to task for suggesting at the trial that it wasn’t his fault that his office didn’t ensure the postcards were sent out. She noted that he was the chief election official in the state and it was his responsibility to follow through on the orders of the court.

Kobach had said he complied with the court order because he sent out a separate notice from the court to the 18,000 affected voters ahead of the 2016 election informing them they could vote.

Robinson also criticized Kobach for failing to update the county’s election manual to reflect the fact that people applying to vote at the DMV don’t have to prove their citizenship. Caskey testified he was “too busy” to update the document in 2016 and Kobach’s office recently took it offline.A British comedy series took on both race and religion in a sketch about a white churchgoer who seeks help and encounters Jesus.

On Tuesday, the Southwest plane had to make an emergency landing after an engine explosion caused a window to break. One passenger, later identified as Jennifer Riordan, was reportedly sucked toward the broken window. She was hospitalized after landing and later confirmed dead.

Following the emergency landing, a passenger named Marty Martinez posted photos and videos of the ordeal on Facebook. Former flight attendant and travel talk show host Bobby Laurie tweeted one of Martinez’s photos to share an important message about oxygen masks.

“PEOPLE: Listen to your flight attendants! ALMOST EVERYONE in this photo from @ SouthwestAir # SWA1380 today is wearing their mask WRONG. Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE & MOUTH,” he tweeted.

Other flight attendants made similar comments on Martinez’s Facebook post. Indeed, the instruction of cover your nose and mouth is part of Southwest’s safety demonstration script.

Laurie told HuffPost it’s important that passengers follow this instruction to maintain consciousness in the event that an aircraft cabin loses pressure.

Why You Need An Oxygen Mask

“The oxygen mask is meant to cover your nose and your mouth so that during a decompression ― either rapid or explosive, which is what it sounds like happened on Southwest ― you’re getting enough oxygen while the airplane dives down to a level in which you can breathe without the oxygen mask,” Laurie said.

Rapid or explosive decompression refers to incidents when an aircraft experiences an unplanned drop in cabin pressure at a dangerous rate. While there is a high enough percentage of oxygen in the air at flying altitudes (it remains around 21 percent until about 70,000 feet), the lack of air pressure makes it harder to get enough oxygen with each breath.

An oxygen mask helps plane passengers get the oxygen they need in a low-cabin pressure situation.

What Happens If You Don’t Use Your Mask Properly

Passengers who don’t get the oxygen they need are at risk of passing out from hypoxia. This is a condition in which low amounts of oxygen in the body’s tissues can rapidly lead to symptoms like dizziness, vision problems, mental confusion, and even unconsciousness, brain damage and death.

If you don’t use your oxygen mask properly ― by not covering your nose, for instance ― you increase your risk of hypoxia, Laurie explained. “Having it only cover your mouth is kind of like scuba diving in the air,” he added. “You have to remind yourself to breathe through your mouth in order to get enough oxygen until the plane gets down to that level at which you don’t need the mask.”

“Having it only cover your mouth is kind of like scuba diving in the air.”

Southwest declined HuffPost’s request for comment, but in the case of Tuesday’s incident, reports indicate that the broken window caused the cabin to violently depressurize.

“We’ve heard about the passenger being sucked toward the window. All the air gets sucked out of the airplane. So if you have your mouth or nose open, the air is being sucked out, and you won’t be able to breathe because all the air is going away from you,” Laurie told HuffPost. “That’s why you need to wear the mask over your nose and mouth.”

The risk of hypoxia is also why safety demonstrations instruct passengers to secure their own oxygen masks before helping others. “You can pass out from a deprivation of oxygen. Your vision becomes blurry and your judgment becomes cloudy,” he added. “So you won’t be able or conscious to help someone else if you don’t put your mask on first.”

Misconceptions About Oxygen Masks

After tweeting his oxygen mask PSA, Laurie noticed people commenting that the masks don’t look big enough to actually cover a passenger’s nose and mouth.

“People don’t realize the mask isn’t stiff or solid. It’s not like a solid cup. It’s actually made out of a flexible plastic material,” he said. “Think of it like a stress ball ― if you were to squeeze the mask, it would elongate to cover your nose and mouth. It doesn’t look like people did that. It looks like they covered their chin and mouth.”

The former flight attendant said he can understand why two people sitting next to each other might secure their masks incorrectly because they’d likely look at each other for confirmation or guidance. But the photo he tweeted told a different story.

“When I saw that picture, what really blew me away is that not only were the two people next to each other doing it wrong, but people behind them did it too,” said Laurie. “It’s like: ‘Where were you during the safety demo? Where’s your safety information card?’”

“Also, if you look you’ll see the instructions are also printed ON the oxygen mask. You get it in all three places,” he added.

Another Way Passengers Are Getting It Wrong

Laurie said oxygen masks aren’t the only thing passengers are getting wrong in emergency situations.

“Another thing that I think gets lost a lot is that when it comes to the evacuation of an airplane and you have to use the emergency slide, a lot of folks straight away go and grab their luggage. Something is wrong with the plane and you need to get off and everyone is like, ‘oh let me grab my bag!’” he said. “What people don’t realize is your bag could puncture the slide. The slide is like a balloon, and if you puncture the slide, you’re trapped on the plane.”

The Problem With Safety Demos

This lack of understanding around airplane safety is, according to Laurie, part of a larger problem in commercial air travel today: People aren’t paying attention to safety demos.

“It’s very hard to get passengers’ attention,” he said. “A lot of airlines have even recognized that and started doing upbeat safety demos and videos. Virgin America has that dance video. Delta did that one with Deltalina. Southwest is known for flight attendants that do jokes and standup comedy and sing and dance during their demos.”

“Everyone’s trying to get your attention because more and more people are tuned out, especially since the use of cellphones has been permitted during taxi,” he added.

Laurie said he’s glad people have taken note of his tweet about oxygen mask usage and hopes people will pay more attention to practical safety measures when flying.

AdvertisementEarlier in the week, Hannity was outed in court as the “mystery” client of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen, who is currently at the center of a federal investigation. On Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” Noah said he was riled by Hannity’s casual attempt to “minimize his connection to Michael Cohen like it means nothing, especially when every other day of the year he’s the guy who can bake a conspiracy cake out of nothing more than an egg and the word ‘Hillary.’”LIBERAL, Kan. — Kay Burtzloff, a 61-year-old small-business owner who’s lived in this area for nearly 20 years, likes to joke that she’s one of Liberal’s only liberals. The county, after all, went to Donald Trump by more than 30 points, and in the runup to the 2016 election, Burtzloff decided against putting a Hillary Clinton sticker on her car, fearing vandals. Tensions were high, she said.

It’s a conservative place for sure, but also a diverse one. For years, immigrant workers — from Vietnam, Mexico and eventually Somalia — have moved to this flat stretch of prairie and farmland on the Oklahoma border to work at the meatpacking plants. For the most part, people got along, Burtzloff said, but something changed when Trump entered the political scene.

“I will be the first to tell you I do not fear getting killed by a Muslim,” Burtzloff said. “I fear getting killed by an angry white guy. That is much more likely to happen.”

It’s here in a trailer in this town of 20,000 people that three white men — fueled by a steady diet of anti-Muslim online memes and conspiracy theories, and captivated by presidential candidate Trump, who proposed a Muslim ban and proclaimed that “Islam hates us” — appeared to discuss a plot to massacre Somali Muslim immigrants who lived and worked nearby.

Patrick Stein, 49, Curtis Allen, 50, and Gavin Wright, 52, are accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex that housed many Somalis and its on-site mosque. The three are believed to have gathered fertilizer to make a bomb while they added to their arsenal of weapons and ammunition. But the FBI says it foiled their plans with arrests four weeks before the 2016 election. The men have been in jail ever since.

Their trial began last month. They face up to life in prison if convicted on charges involving weapons of mass destruction and civil rights violations.

Evidence presented in the trial painted a picture of an all-American brand of homegrown terrorism: angry white men radicalized by Islamophobic memes and fake online news articles whose path to violent extremism was accelerated by a divisive election cycle and a candidate who sounded like them.

For the last five weeks, the defendants have shuffled into a federal courthouse in Wichita shackled at the ankles. They’ve listened day in and day out as their own attorneys called them “knuckleheads” whose talk of mass murdering Muslims was just bluster. And they’ve heard prosecutors portray them as sinister would-be terrorists.

Closing arguments took place on Tuesday in the case. A nearly all-white jury is expected to deliver a verdict at any time.

Jurors were played hours of tapes made by an FBI informant who had masqueraded as a militiaman, recording the three defendants as they discussed plans and spewed genocidal hatred of Muslims.

“The Crusaders,” as they called themselves, splintered off from a larger Kansas militia group whose members testified that they thought the three men were too extreme. In the recordings, the men followed a familiar script of Islamophobia.

First there are the conspiracy theories. In one recording they referred to “civilization jihad,” the paranoid idea that American Muslims are secretly conspiring to take over the U.S.

Most Muslims aren’t going to behead people, one of the men said in the recording. Instead, “they sit back and fuck their brains out. Four kids per fucking man per year,” he added, referring to the idea that Muslims are trying to grow the size of their population as quickly as possible. “Their objective is to breed us out of existence.”

Another familiar part of the Islamophobic script was taking Islamic scriptures out of context. In another recording, the jury heard one of the men talk about “taqiyya,” an obscure Islamic concept that white supremacists have willfully misinterpreted to accuse Muslims of lying to non-Muslims in their quest to take over the world.

Because of taqiyya, one of the militiamen explained, Muslims can “deceive and lie. They can go out and drink at the bar, just like you and I, and then the son of a bitch would cut your throat.”

Ultimately, the recordings capture the three men in an ideological frenzy: America was on a crash course with the so-called Muslim world, and they had to prepare for what they called “Crusades 2.0.”

All of these outlandish lies and distortions about Muslims and Islam were abundant online, and a scroll through the three men’s social media profiles showed they devoured this propaganda with abandon — retweeting, liking, sharing and posting.

And they started to hear the messages of these anti-Muslim memes echoed in Trump’s stump speeches, possibly taking inspiration from their favorite candidate’s soundbites.

On the campaign trail, Trump often told the same widely discredited story of how an American general ― over a century ago ― dipped bullets in pig’s blood to kill Muslims (most of whom don’t eat pork). The three men talked openly of dipping their bullets in pig’s blood.

When Trump justified his Muslim ban by citing a discredited poll, Stein shared a meme on Twitter based on that same poll.

Muslims were “cockroaches,” according to recordings of the three men. “You have to kill all of them. They keep coming back,” Stein said. “You have to exterminate them all.”

The men mapped out Muslim targets on Google Earth, dropping “pins” on a map of Garden City, Kansas, a slightly larger town an hour and a half drive north of Liberal. Each pin was labeled “cockroaches.”

According to testimony in the trial, as Trump warned Americans of Somali refugees being terrorists in disguise — “the great Trojan horse of all time” — the men decided on their main target: a Garden City apartment complex home to many Somali Muslims, and the mosque where they prayed.

The men were conscious that this planned massacre might somehow hurt Trump’s chances at becoming president, according to prosecutors, so they scheduled the attack for the day after the election: Nov. 9. This act of terrorism, they said, would “wake people up.”

They started gathering materials for bombs. They did drive-by surveillance of the apartment building they wanted to target. They planned to blow it up as people were praying in the building’s mosque when, as Stein put it, the Muslims were “packed in like sardines.” The shock wave from the bombs, he said, would make “Jello out of their insides.”

The FBI Laboratory’s Explosives Unit constructed and set off a 300-pound car bomb using fertilizer to show the damage that the bomb the Crusaders were allegedly building could have caused. FBI

The men met with an undercover officer, who they thought was a like-minded arms dealer. Stein grew to trust him.

“We must win this battle because I refuse to go down in history as the generation who lost the best country on the planet,” Stein wrote in an encrypted text to the undercover officer. Stein said he was ready to “take out as many of those bastards as I possibly can till my last breath.”

The three defendants haven’t really denied that they engaged in hateful anti-Muslim talk, which their attorneys have dismissed as blowing off steam, “locker room talk,” as one attorney put it. So instead they’ve been leaning on an entrapment defense, arguing that the plan never would have been possible without the federal government’s involvement.

The defense has argued that the three men were manipulated by fake news but that ultimately all their talk of killing Muslims amounted to angry rants and that they never would’ve carried out their plot had it not been for the FBI’s meddling.

Although Stein, Wright and Allen would ultimately bear responsibility for their alleged terrorist plot, there’s a growing body of evidence showing how Trump might be radicalizing his followers.

Anti-Muslim hate crimes rose dramatically in America in 2015 and 2016, according to FBI statistics, rising to levels not seen since 9/11. Experts have attributed this rise to the divisive election and the hostile rhetoric of Trump.

A recent study found that 83 percent of “hate violence” incidents aimed at South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Middle Eastern and Arab communities in U.S. from November 2016 to November 2017 were anti-Muslim in nature. One in five perpetrators of these violent hate crimes, the study noted, “invoked President Trump’s name, his administration’s policies, or his campaign slogans” during the attacks.

Last month, authorities arrested three militia group members in Illinois for the 2017 bombing of a Minnesota mosque. They were Trump fans. One of the men admired Trump so much that he submitted a detailed bid to build the president’s wall on the Mexican border.

Alexandre Bissonette, the Canadian man convicted of killing six men inside a Quebec mosque in January 2017, searched Trump-related content online over 800 times in the month leading up to his act of terror, prosecutors revealed during a sentencing hearing this week.

Bissonnette told police he was upset over Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s message of welcome to refugees after Trump implemented his ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries.

A conviction in Kansas this week isn’t a sure thing. “Even if they’re not convicted, I’m not convinced I want them in my community,” said Burtzloff, the Liberal businesswoman.

She rented out a storage unit to one of the three militiamen, where FBI agents found a notepad scribbled over with the names of chemicals needed for bombs. She also once owned the trailer park where another of the men kept his trailer, and where FBI agents found nearly 2,000 pounds of ammunition.

That trailer, and the other trailer in Liberal where the men allegedly hatched their plan, have both since been moved, their contents carried away by federal agents. Among the evidence collected was a manifesto the men had started.

“This is a call to action by all Americans,” they wrote. “Please do not just sit idle until we lose this once great nation.”

Killing Muslim refugees, their manifesto suggested, would make America great again.

Stein, the alleged ringleader of the group, once told the undercover agent by text that he worried about leaving a country that “is nothing resembling what I grew up in to my kids and grandkids.” When the agent pointed out the attack would kill children, Stein replied that he did not care. He thought an attack would help save America.

“We are dedicated patriots with love of country that doesn’t end,” Stein wrote, “and we are willing to die for this country if that is what it takes to get it back.”

The 39-year-old says she doesn’t want to reveal the gender just yet.

Danes and Dancy were married in 2009, after meeting on the set of the 2006 film “Evening.”

On falling in love with Dancy, Danes told Marie Claire last year how it happened: “I was very recently single, and I had never been single before, so we were just friends for a while. [Hugh and I] met in Rhode Island when it was at its most audaciously beautiful, in the fall. And there was one day when we were bicycling by the water and it was sparkly and idyllic, and I just had this dumb epiphany, like, I’m really just happy.”

The duo have a five-year-old son, Cyrus, and Danes has been very candid about her feelings on motherhood:

“Being a mom is incredibly challenging. But, we still feel a pressure to talk about it in very romantic terms,” she told Harper’s Bazaar UK in October 2014.Netflix had a relatively underwhelming month of new shows this April, especially in comparison to March.

The only show that seemed to fully enter the cultural zeitgeist was “Lost in Space,” which largely earned middling or lackluster critical reviews. A couple of foreign imports that previously aired overseas ― “Charité” and “The Letdown” ― are fine, but ultimately not must-watches. “Fastest Car” is great for car enthusiasts, but doesn’t have much to offer for those who aren’t.

The only truly great new show is also only “new” if you squint your eyes. “Chef’s Table: Pastry” is the first season of the “Chef’s Table” series to focus solely on dessert creators. I’m counting it as a new show in this new show roundup even though Netflix categorizes it as just another season of the original series. Still, the “Chef’s Table” series is now a well-oiled machine and so it shouldn’t surprise viewers that these new episodes are so compelling.

In any case, April was pretty underwhelming. March was jam-packed with quality new shows like “Collateral” and “Wild Wild Country,” the latter of which even got a “Saturday Night Live” parody! Even returning projects like “Love,” “Jessica Jones” and “A Series of Unfortunate Events” were truly great in March. What happened?!

You could basically take a break from Netflix these last few weeks and not miss much. And nobody wants that. It’s still cold in much of the country somehow. Snow is still falling on America in areas that shouldn’t be getting snow. A solid Netflix lineup to sate our bottomless well of binge-watching capacity would have been greatly appreciated.

1. “Chef’s Table: Pastry”

"Chef's Table: Pastry" on Netflix. Charles Panian/Netflix

Release Date: April 13, 2018

Premise: A continuation of the popular “Chef’s Table” series that solely focuses on people who are very good at making desserts. “Chef’s Table” episodes always have a compelling blend of biographical information about the highlighted creators interspersed with plentiful shots of beautiful food.

As a former New Yorker, I was excited to watch the profile of Milk Bar Bakery’s creator, Christina Tosi. I’d walked by her stores’ pink neon “milk” signs many a time and was compelled to stop in fairly often.

Runtime: Four episodes of approx. 45 minutes.

Here’s the trailer ...

2. “Lost in Space”

"Lost in Space" on Netflix. Netflix

Release Date: April 13, 2018

Premise: A family of space colonizers crash-land on a mysterious planet and then have to figure out how to survive. A reboot of the zany show from the 1960s that’s far more grounded than its inspiration. Even though that ground is a strange planet.

This is perhaps the most popular show Netflix released this month. “Lost in Space” ultimately didn’t live up to its high expectations though. This is still a very solid show with truly beautiful special effects and backdrops. But despite the wild premise and the inherently interesting setting, this reboot is somehow still pretty boring.

Runtime: 10 episodes of approx. 60 minutes.

Here’s the trailer...

3. “Charité”

"Charité" on Netflix. Netflix

Release Date: April 19, 2018

Premise: A woman living in late 19th-century Berlin tries to become a doctor, then a heavily male-dominated profession. As she works as a nurse in the reputable Charité hospital, she slowly befriends the talented doctors working there and learns firsthand how to treat the illnesses of the day.

This is a German show from 2017, one of several Netflix has recently imported` and marked as a U.S. Netflix Original. It seems to have been received overseas — lead actress Alicia von Rittberg won a Bambi Award for Best Actress for her work in this series. Honestly, I’d never heard of the Bambi Awards before reading up on this show, but apparently those are the oldest media awards in Germany and fairly prestigious. If you’re wondering, the name is a reference to the famous deer. Congrats to von Rittberg!

Runtime: Six episodes of approx. 50 minutes.

Here’s the trailer...

4. “The Letdown”

"The Letdown" on Netflix. Netflix

Release Date: April 21, 2018

Premise: This is a comedy from Australia that focuses on the struggles that befall a new mother. It’s a story that doesn’t often get told in such depth, let alone with such solid comedic writing.

When it aired on Australia’s ABC channel (not related to the American ABC) in late 2017, “The Letdown” earned quite a bit of praise for its mix of relatable storylines with funny moments. This said, it’s both not the funniest nor most authentic-feeling show out there, but it’s still worth checking out if the subject matter appeals to you specifically.

Runtime: Seven episodes of approx. 30 minutes.

Here’s an extended clip...

5. “Fastest Car”

"Fastest Car" on Netflix. Netflix

Release Date: April 6, 2018

Premise: Teams try to rework forgotten old cars so that they can go faster than expensive new ones. The show definitely has plenty of fancy and wacky cars going real fast. But “Fastest Car” also spends much time telling the human stories of the people behind the cars.

For car enthusiasts, this is definitely a worthwhile watch. It’s probably not broad in scope enough to have truly mass appeal though.

Runtime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes.Danielle Bregoli, known for her “cash me ousside” catchphrase and rebellious behavior on a 2016 episode of “Dr. Phil,” is moving up in the world.

The 15-year-old viral phenom, aka Bhad Bhabie, was nominated Tuesday for a Billboard Music Award in the Top Rap Female Artist category. She’s squaring off against industry giants Cardi B and Nicki Minaj to win the darn thing.

“By being nominated, I already won,” she tells TMZ in the video below.

Bregoli says a Cardi B victory is a fait accompli and that the “Bodak Yellow” singer is more deserving than Minaj.

“Cardi actually says stuff,” Bregoli says. “Nicki just has attitude.”

Since rocketing to infamy on “Dr. Phil,” Bregoli has pursued a rap career as Bhad Bhabie. The Atlantic Records-signed performer launched a national tour this month and reportedly has a reality show in the works.

After a YouTube video for her single “These Heaux” gathered tens of millions of views, she followed up in October with “Hi Bich.” That debuted at No. 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 ― the highest premiere that week, Billboard reported.

And now she’s mentioned in the same category as Cardi B and Nicki Minaj.

“Holy shit,” she said on Twitter.Fox News host Sean Hannity’s legal claim is getting torn to pieces on his own network.

On Monday, Hannity was revealed as the “mystery client” of Michael Cohen, the personal attorney to President Donald Trump who is now embroiled in a federal investigation.

Hannity claimed he never hired Cohen but also insisted he had a right to privacy in his conversations with him under attorney-client privilege.

Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano, a former judge, isn’t buying it.

“I love him and, you know, I’ve worked with him for 20 years,” Napolitano said Tuesday. “He can’t have it both ways.”

He told “Outnumbered Overtime” host Harris Faulkner:

“If he was a client, then his confidential communications to Mr. Cohen are privileged. If Mr. Cohen was never his lawyer, then nothing that he said to Mr. Cohen is privileged.”

Hannity had also claimed he “may have” paid Cohen $10 to get that privilege, a strategy that is often used as a plot device on shows such as “Breaking Bad.”

But Napolitano said it doesn’t work that way in the real world.

“I must tell you that that is a myth,” Napolitano said. “The attorney-client privilege requires a formal relationship reduced to writing for a specific legal purpose,”

“So anything that is there regarding Sean Hannity can be revealed?” Faulkner asked.

“In my view, yes,” Napolitano said.The final “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” trailer dropped on Wednesday (see below), and its mysterious surfing scene has us stoked.

It’s on for just a moment, but it looks totally rad.

A very large creature rides the wave beneath the surface, while a human catches the swell from above. This probably won’t end with high-fives and beers on the beach.

The preview continues building suspense toward the dinosaur franchise’s June 22 bow. Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) return to the now-abandoned island to rescue dinosaurs, including the missing raptor Blue, before a volcano goes boom. There’s a conspiracy afoot that could set back evolution, so the stakes are high, according to Universal’s YouTube description. And it appears some souped-up prehistoric beasts are going to commit mayhem in civilization.

Now, what about that wave?

Don’t worry. YouTube channel Bad Lip Reading has got your back.

In a clip shared online Tuesday, Bad Lip Reading dubbed over key parts of Saturday’s ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, England, to put its own amusing spin on the service.

Check out the full bit above.A lawyer representing relatives of an unarmed black man killed in a hail of police bullets in a California Walmart parking lot accuses officers of profiling, stalking and unjustifiably shooting him.

Diante “Butchie” Yarber, 26, who had been driving his cousin and friends to a Walmart in Barstow, died when police fired what witnesses told The Guardian sounded like more than 30 bullets. A passenger was seriously wounded.

“They saw a car full of black people sitting in front of a Walmart, and they decided that was suspicious,” Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Yarber’s family, told the paper. “They just began pouring bullets … It’s irresponsible. It’s dangerous. It’s mind-boggling, the use of force.” He said Yarber was hit “an estimated two dozen times.”

The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said Barstow officers opened fire after the driver of a black Mustang, wanted for questioning in a recent crime involving a stolen vehicle, suddenly reversed in a getaway attempt, crashed into two patrol cars and “accelerated toward the officers.” Police had been sent to the Walmart lot to investigate “a call of a suspicious vehicle,” the sheriff said in a statement.

Officers involved in the April 5 shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave, police said.

Dale Galipo, an attorney representing Marian Tafoya, 23, a back seat passenger seriously wounded in the shooting, said officers weren’t in the path of the Mustang, so they had no justification to open fire.

Video footage of the car after the shooting shows what appear to be many bullet holes. There’s also minor damage to the front bumper and driver’s side fender, but it’s unclear whether that happened prior to the incident:

Yarber’s aunt, Aleta Yarber, said the car belonged to her son, who was a passenger in the vehicle, and hadn’t been reported stolen. She said her son “has not been able to say much of anything” since the shooting, because “it was very traumatizing.”

Yarber was a “loving, caring and a friendly person,” said Samantha Robledo, who has a 7-year-old daughter named Naliyah with Yarber. “Our relationship was like no other,” she told HuffPost. Yarber also has daughters ages 9 and 1.

Yarber’s sister, Ruby Hawkins, told The Guardian that police frequently targeted her brother.

“They are the biggest criminals. They are bullies with badges … I don’t know how you can fear for your life with a person that is moving away from you,” she said.

Merritt, the family’s lawyer, wrote on Facebook that the shooting was ” the worse case of excessive and unnecessary force I have seen in my career.”

“The Yarber family deserves answers in the form of transparency by the Barstow Police Department,” he said. “Body, dash and surveillance video must be turned over to my office immediately. The San Bernardino County district attorney must throughly investigate and zealously prosecute the gunman involved.”
