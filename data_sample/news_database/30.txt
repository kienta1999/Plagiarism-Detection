Running phenomenon Caster Semenya of South Africa and some other top females runners will likely have to reduce their body’s natural testosterone levels under new rules to continue to compete in top international races.

The new rules issued Thursday by the International Association of Athletics Federations set strict limits on testosterone levels for women and “intersex” athletes in women’s races. They represent a continuing struggle over how to create fair competition amid increased sensitivity and understanding about what constitutes gender in the “binary” sports establishment.

Just as the rules were announced, a leading IAAF scientist said he predicts a third “intersex” category could be established in the next five to 10 years in international competition.

For now, beginning in November, the blood testosterone level must be 5 nanomoles per liter for a continuous period of at least six months for an athlete to compete in a women’s event under the new IAAF track rules. The new levels, down from 10 nmol/L, will apply to all athletes with a “difference of sexual development” designation and will include only female or “intersex” athletes, not athletes designated as male, who would be barred from women’s competition. The levels will apply to athletes competing in international women’s events from 400 meters to the mile.

The IAAF had defended its decision by saying the typical range among elite female athletes is 0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L, according to NPR.

If athletes the IAAF refers to as “hyperandrogenous women” don’t lower their testosterone to the new levels, they will only be allowed to compete with men or intersex athletes under the new rules, in longer events or in lower profile, non-international races.

The IAAF’s new regulations are an attempt to avoid battles over gender by sticking to the basic math of hormone blood levels, specifically testosterone. High levels of endogenous testosterone can significantly enhance sporting performance.

“The revised rules are not about cheating. They are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe said in a statement Thursday.

“Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications for our competition ― men’s events and women’s events. This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone ... provides significant performance advantages in female athletes.”

The IAAF statement said that the new regulations are “in no way intended as any kind of judgement on or questioning of the sex or the gender identity of any athlete.”

A court suspended testosterone levels set by IAAF in 2011 until the organization could prove high levels of the hormone provided an unfair edge in competition, which the IAAF says it has now done. The levels were criticized at the time as specifically targeted at Semenya, whose victories appeared to be hurt by the lowered levels. Her wins increased again when the new testosterone levels were suspended in 2015.

But Dr. Stephane Bermon, head of IAFF’s health and science department, told The Guardian that the testosterone issue affects many female athletes, not just Semenya. “It is not just the one or two people you hear about in the media,” Berman said. “In elite female athletics the number of intersex athletes is 140 times more than what you might find in the normal female population.”

Bermon, who foresees an intersex competitive category in the future, insisted that restricting competition based on testosterone is fair — and does not penalize a natural gift.

“The reason why we have separate male and female categories is that otherwise females would never win any medals,” Bermon said. “Testosterone is the most important factor in explaining the difference. We are talking about females competing with levels similar to males.”

Semenya, 27, who won Olympic gold in the women’s 800-meter races at London 2012 and Rio 2016, didn’t immediately respond to the announcement of the new regulations, but last year she called IAAF’s study of athletes and testosterone levels “nonsense.” She also had an angry tweet Thursday:

Semenya was ordered to undergo gender testing in 2009, the year she won the 800-meter at the World Championships in Berlin at the age of 18. The results were never publicly released, and she was cleared to compete again the following year. She complained then she had been subjected to “unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being” that “infringed on not only my rights as an athlete but also my fundamental and human rights.”Here ya go, nerds!

Netflix turned “Stranger Things” fans’ emotions upside down Friday when it announced that the third season is now in production by releasing a behind-the-scenes teaser.

The video shows the series’ established stars and a few newcomers sitting down for a table read.

It also features fan-favorite Erica, played by Priah Ferguson, who we can expect to get a bigger role in the series.

Joining the cast for season three are a few notable and exciting names joining the cast including Cary Elwes Of “The Princess Bride” fame, Jake Busey who slayed an electric violin performance in “Starship Troopers” and Maya Hawke, the daughter of actors Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.

According to a release, Hawke will play an “alternative girl” named Robin. She’s described as being bored with her “mundane life” and “gets more than she bargained for when she uncovers a dark secret in Hawkins.”

Temple University announced on Friday afternoon that the school is rescinding Bill Cosby’s honorary degree after the comedian was found guilty in his sexual assault retrial.

“In 1991, based on his career achievements, Temple awarded an honorary degree to William Cosby. Yesterday, Dr. Cosby was found guilty by a jury of the felony of aggravated sexual assault,” a statement from the university reads. “Today the Temple University Board of Trustees has accepted the recommendation of the University to rescind the honorary degree.”

Cosby, 80, was found guilty on Thursday on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault by a jury in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The comedian was retried on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault over Andrea Constand’s accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2004. Constand, 44, was a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University, where Cosby was a trustee and major donor at the time.

“Today’s decision provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect to Bill Cosby’s honorary degree,” Temple University spokesman Ray Betzner told the Philadelphia Inquirer after the verdict was handed down on Thursday.

Temple University forced Cosby to resign from his position on the board of trustees in 2014, and his name was removed from all buildings and scholarships at the school.

Several organizations, including Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, revoked Cosby’s honorary titles after dozens of women accused him of sexual assault and rape. More than 60 women have accused the veteran entertainer of sexual assault, with many saying he drugged and raped them.

AdvertisementA conservative Michigan group filed a lawsuit this week to block a November ballot initiative that would create an independent commission to handle redistricting in the state.

The group Citizens Protecting Michigan’s Constitution and two Michigan voters filed the suit in the state’s Court of Appeals. The lawsuit takes aim at an upcoming redistricting initiative that the group Voters Not Politicians has already succeeded in getting on the November ballot

If approved by Michigan voters, the measure would transfer redistricting power from lawmakers to a 13-member independent commission composed of four Democrats, four Republicans and five independents. The ballot proposal, which was launched with a single Facebook post from a Michigan woman, has attracted considerable attention as different groups and activists are pushing to rein in partisan gerrymandering across the country. An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found that gerrymandering in Michigan is responsible for an additional two to three additional GOP seats in Congress.

The plaintiffs argue that proposal cannot be approved through a ballot initiative because it amounts to a “general revision” of the state’s Constitution, not an amendment. Such a revision, the group says, can only be accomplished through a state constitutional convention.

“The multitude of changes the VNP Proposal works to the Constitution—including the transfer, limitation, or expansion of powers in all three branches of government—are too disruptive to the original constitutional structures and underpinnings of government to be accomplished by the amendment process,” the group wrote in a Wednesday court filing. “The scale and impact of the VNP Proposal is simply too great for its contents to be summarized for their presentation to voters in the voting booth or petitioner-signers passing a signature gatherer on a public sidewalk.”

Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson (R) and the Michigan Board of State Canvassers are named as defendants in the suit. Citizens Protecting Michigan’s Constitution has separately asked the board to reject the petitions to get the measure on the ballot if the court doesn’t issue a ruling by Sept. 6, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Jim Lancaster, an attorney for Voters Not Politicians, the group pushing the reform proposal, disputed that the proposal amounted to a broad revision of the Michigan Constitution.

“Our proposal affects only one aspect of state government: redistricting. It does not interfere with or modify any other aspect of state government,” he said in a statement.Oklahoma teachers rally at the state Capitol on April 2, demanding that legislators restore funding for education.

Yes, the teacher strikes that have swept states such as Arizona, West Virginia and Kentucky in recent months are a matter of substandard labor conditions. Teachers involved in the protests are seeking higher wages, better classroom funding and improved work conditions.

But underneath the outward fight for these workplace improvements, a more indirect fight for women’s equality is also driving the strikes, say some leaders involved with the walkouts.

An overwhelming majority of teachers are women, and leaders who have participated in the walkouts say they believe many of the reasons they have been forced to protest ― low pay, declining resources, lack of respect from legislators ― might be a function of their gender. It’s no coincidence either that the walkouts are coming at a time when women have been driving conversations about workplace conditions with campaigns like the Me Too movement.

“I think it is absolutely no accident this is happening to an industry, to a field, that is predominantly women. An industry that is seen as serving children, which is ‘women’s work,’” said Dawn Penich-Thacker, a spokeswoman for Save Our Schools Arizona, an education advocacy group that has been involved with the protests. “There’s that societal expectation of, like, you don’t need to be compensated, you don’t need to be regarded as a skilled professional, you’re doing this because it’s in your genes, this is what you do.”

In 2015, public school teachers, on average, made about $1,092 per week, compared with the higher weekly wages earned by all college graduates of $1,416, according to an analysis from the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Because the research compares teachers with all college graduates, the pay gap likely differs from what it would be if educators were compared with other graduates working in the public sector, and the gap varies vastly by state. But the analysis does show how much the gap has grown over the years.

Over the past several decades, the weekly wages of teachers have fallen drastically compared with those of other college-educated professional workers. In 1994, the weekly wages of teachers were about 2 percent lower than those of college-educated professional workers, but by 2015, this gap had increased to over 11 percent.

“When a field is associated with women and a task has traditionally been associated with women, whoever is making the decisions about pay seems to have a harder time thinking people deserve more money.” - Paula England, a professor of sociology at New York University

While there has overall been a downward trend in public sector job growth, gender may explain some of what’s going on for educators.

Paula England, a professor of sociology at New York University, has found that female-filled professions tend to pay lower than other professions that require the same amount of skill and training. She has also found that jobs centered around caregiving tend to pay less than jobs requiring comparable experience. These jobs tend to face a “cultural devaluation” because society is used to the idea of mothers caring for children for free, said England.

“When a field is associated with women and a task has traditionally been associated with women, whoever is making the decisions about pay seems to have a harder time thinking people deserve more money,” she said.

The teacher strikes have largely been in conservative states, where school systems have been starved of resources, though they also took hold this week in Colorado, a state with a Democratic governor.

In West Virginia, teachers went on strike for almost two weeks in late February over low teacher pay, a severe teacher shortage and low levels of school funding. In Kentucky, teachers staged a quasi-strike in late March, after legislators voted to overhaul the state’s pension system in a way that introduces more uncertainty to teachers’ retirement plans. In Oklahoma, teachers shut down schools for nearly two weeks this month over declining classroom resources. In Arizona, teachers walked off the job this week, demanding increased levels of school funding and pay bumps. And in Colorado, thousands of teachers protested this week over low levels of school funding and poor teacher pay.

For Lydia Coffey, a former teacher who protested in Kentucky and is now running for a state House seat, the protests have everything to do with womanhood. Coffey, who has a master’s degree and retired in 2010 after almost 30 years of teaching, never made $50,000. She connects the teacher protests to a rise in female voices addressing politics, amid the Me Too movement and massive women’s marches.

“I think that it’s almost like they don’t think we’re smart enough to see what’s happening to us.” - Lydia Coffey, retired teacher who's now running for a Kentucky state House seat

“I think women are just tired of feeling like we’re second class. We’re tired of white men in power telling all of us what to do,” Coffey said.

She recalls protesting with mostly women, many of whom were worried about what would happen to their livelihood amid the pension changes. She recalls the distinct condescension in the voices of legislators ― mostly men ― who didn’t take the concerns of educators seriously.

“We’re tired of being put under somebody’s thumb that doesn’t have a clue what it’s like,” Coffey recalled of the experience. “I think that it’s almost like they don’t think we’re smart enough to see what’s happening to us.”

Penich-Thacker isn’t a full-time K-12 classroom teacher ― she works with college students during the year and high school kids over the summer. But she is a woman. And to be a woman in 2018 is to understand what it’s like to have to repeatedly respond to disrespect with a smile and nod, before finally having enough, she said.The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.

Chance the Rapper clarified Friday that he does not support Donald Trump after the president praised him for his support.

It all began Wednesday when rapper Kanye West went on a Twitter rant expressing his support for Trump, causing an immediate backlash from critics who argue Trump doesn’t actually care all that much about the plight of black Americans.

“So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of color,” John Legend texted West, in an exchange West later shared on Twitter.

Chance, who like West was raised in Chicago, posted a tweet in defense of his friend, saying not all black people are Democrats.

Black people don’t have to be democrats. — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) April 25, 2018

Chance likely did not expect Trump to then thank him for what the president perceived as support.

“Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott, they really get it,” Trump said in a Friday morning tweet.

Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history). — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 27, 2018

In his response to Trump, Chance didn’t mince words. He posted a statement on Twitter titled “My fault yo” and said he made a mistake in the way he went about defending West.

My fault yo pic.twitter.com/TIWhG8o1ST — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) April 27, 2018

“Unfortunately, my attempt to support Kanye is being used to discredit my brothers and sisters in the movement and I can’t sit by and let that happen either,” Chance said.

So does he support Trump? Hell no.

“I’d never support anyone who has made a career out of hatred, racism and discrimination. I’d never support someone who’d talk about Chicago as if it’s a hell on earth and then take steps to make life harder here for the most disenfranchised among us. I understand why people are disappointed with my words, but I was raised to believe actions speak louder than words,” he said.

AdvertisementFolks had a field day Thursday after it was revealed that President Donald Trump would visit the United Kingdom on Friday, July 13.

The Friday the 13th date, which some superstitious people consider to be one of the unluckiest days in the calendar, prompted plenty of amusing comments.

“Either somebody really didn’t think this through... or they really did,” wrote one tweeter. “I don’t like superstition but I do enjoy irony,” added another.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to Germany on Thursday, just before Chancellor Angela Merkel was due in Washington for talks on Berlin’s desire that Trump preserve the international nuclear agreement with Iran.

The Senate voted 56-42 to confirm Richard Grenell, largely along party lines, filling a position that had been vacant since January 2017. Trump nominated Grenell for the position last September.

Grenell, who has been strongly critical of the nuclear agreement, is a Republican foreign policy writer and commentator who was an aide to Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, when Bolton was former Republican President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Trump nominated Grenell for the Berlin post last September.

Merkel’s visit comes just after French President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington, calling on the United States not to abandon the nuclear agreement. Separately, Western envoys said on Wednesday that Britain, France and Germany were nearing a package that seeks to persuade Trump to save the pact.

Most Senate Democrats voted against Grenell, citing issues including his history of making statements insulting to women politicians on the Internet and during cable television appearances.

“Will he insult, via his Twitter account, the female chancellor of Germany? I don’t know. I hope not,” Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a Senate speech opposing Grenell.

When asked about such comments during his confirmation hearing, Grenell said he was trying to be funny, not insulting, and would not have made such statements while serving as a U.S. official.

Republican supporters of Grenell dismissed such concerns as political partisanship by Democrats.

Grenell’s confirmation made him the highest-ranking openly gay official in the Trump administration.

AdvertisementA business partner of U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in investigations, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

Evgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant who is known as the Taxi King, will avoid jail time and will assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, the newspaper report said, citing a person briefed on the matter.

The New York State Attorney General’s Office said in a press release that Freidman had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge on Tuesday in an Albany, New York, courtroom, but it made no mention of whether he was cooperating with prosecutors.

Freidman has been Cohen’s partner in the taxi business for years, even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage taxi medallions, the New York Times said.

Freidman, when asked by Reuters about the report, declined in a text message to answer any questions about cooperating with prosecutors or the terms of his agreement.

“This is me taking responsibility for my actions! ... Michael is a dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That’s it! ...I hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of!” Freidman said by text.

Freidman’s lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to comment on the Times report.

Freidman had been accused of failing to pay more than $5 million in taxes and five other criminal counts each carrying maximum prison sentences of up to 25 years. In pleading guilty to a single count of criminal tax fraud, Freidman will be sentenced to five years’ probation, the attorney general’s office said.

A spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump’s presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.Adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, departs federal court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 16, 2018. Lucas Jackson / Reuters

April 27 (Reuters) - Adult-film star Stormy Daniels’ lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, will be put on pause for 90 days, the federal judge in the case ordered on Friday, saying that Cohen’s constitutional rights could be endangered if the lawsuit proceeds while he is under criminal investigation.

“The court finds that there is a large potential factual overlap between the civil and criminal proceedings that would heavily implicate Mr Cohen’s Fifth Amendment rights,” District Judge James Otero wrote in the order, referring to the Constitution’s protection against self-incrimination.

Cohen has admitted paying $130,000 to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, to secure her silence about having sex with Trump, which he denies. Cohen said the payment was legal, and Daniels has sued to end her nondisclosure agreement.

Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti promptly pledged to fight the stay, writing on Twitter he would file an immediate appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California, which could ultimately lead the Supreme Court to have to weigh in.

Cohen said earlier this week he would invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to answer questions in the lawsuit after the FBI raided his home, office and hotel room two weeks ago.

The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that no individual can be “compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.”

Daniels had countered that the lawsuit should proceed, with Cohen invoking the amendment only for specific questions that might lead to self-incrimination.

But Otero wrote that approach could lead to Cohen not answering any questions, rendering a deposition useless.Amy Schumer attends the premiere of "I Feel Pretty." Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images

It’s been a rough few days for Amy Schumer.

The “I Feel Pretty” star revealed on Friday that she’s been hospitalized due to a “horrible” kidney infection over the past week. The comedian jokingly shared some “sexy as hell” photos on Instagram from her five-day hospital stay, making sure to thank husband Chris Fischer, sister Kim Caramele and sister-in-law Molly Fischer for their support.

“Here’s what I’ve been up to this week. I was hospitalized for 5 days with a horrible kidney infection,” she wrote in the post. “I want to give a big thank you to the doctors, the bad ass nurses also my husband who’s name is, i want to say, Chris? and my sisters Kimby and mol who have been by my side the whole time.”

A post shared by @amyschumer on Apr 27, 2018 at 8:39am PDT

Schumer was meant to appear at the London premiere of her new film “I Feel Pretty,” but decided to stay stateside on doctor’s orders. The newlywed went on to apologize to fans for skipping the event.

“I’m really disappointed selfishly to miss this trip because I love London and Europe in general and all the great people (food) there,” she wrote. “But I need to put my health first.”

“It’s sweet and fun and you will walk out feeling better,” she added of her new movie. “Which is something I hope to feel soon too.”

In one photo, Fischer, whom Schumer wed in February in a surprise ceremony, holds her hand as she lies in a hospital bed.

The two tied the knot in front of 80 friends and family members, including celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence, Chelsea Handler and Larry David, days after going public with their relationship. They were first linked in November.

Schumer recently revealed her favorite part about being married, besides the fact that her new husband is a celebrated chef, of course.

“The best part is just having a partner and being like ‘I got a team,’” Schumer said in an interview with E! News. “It was just me and [my dog] Tatiana and now it’s cool, you got someone to go through life with together that you love and you want to be partnered up with.”

The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general has opened “new reviews” into Administrator Scott Pruitt’s alleged ethical lapses, including his $50 per night condo rental, according to letters sent Friday to two top Democrats.

This is the first time the agency’s watchdog is officially investigating Pruitt’s housing arrangement, the scandal that triggered the avalanche of corruption accusations and prompted calls for Pruitt’s resignation.

In letters to Reps. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins said his office “received requests from multiple members of Congress” and would both broaden existing investigations and open “new reviews.”

“Some of these matters will be reviewed as part of previously announced and still ongoing OIG [Office of Inspector General] reviews,” Elkins wrote. “Some will be the impetus for new reviews.”

The EPA declined to comment.

The notice came in response to an April 3 letter Beyer and Lieu sent the watchdog, requesting that his office “consider possible waste or fraud associated with the decision to lay this cost at the taxpayer’s feet, rather than charge Administrator Pruitt personally.”

It’s unclear how many total investigations the EPA chief is facing. But the number of open federal investigations into Pruitt’s activities winnowed down to nine last week after the Government Accountability Office concluded that the agency’s decision to spend $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth broke two laws.

The inspector general in January began auditing the administrator’s costly flights to his home state of Oklahoma. The watchdog twice expanded the probe to cover a wider time window to include Pruitt’s trip to Morocco in December. The office is also looking into Pruitt’s team of round-the-clock bodyguards, whom the agency paid to join the administrator on family trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl.

The inspector general’s separate investigation into five-figure raises granted to two long-time aides from Oklahoma who joined Pruitt at the EPA became a flashpoint Thursday in the administrator’s nearly six hours of testimony before two House committees. Pruitt admitted he knew about the salary hikes ― contradicting statements made in a high-profile Fox News interview earlier this month ― and noted that the watchdog’s preliminary report found Ryan Jackson, Pruitt’s chief of staff, authorized the increases.

Both the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are investigating Pruitt’s spending.

The new inspector general reports come days after Bloomberg reported the White House had begun urging GOP lawmakers to temper their defenses of Pruitt, signaling that President Donald Trump’s support may be waning.

At least five Republican members of Congress and 170 Democrats have called for Pruitt’s resignation. Even Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Pruitt’s long-time friend and political patron, initially distanced himself from the administrator this week, stating he would support a hearing before the powerful Senate Environment and Public Works Committee into the EPA chief’s ethics accusations. However, the senator walked back the statement Friday, issuing a new statement in support of Pruitt and blasting Democrats for “mudslinging.”The singer Halsey has been incredibly open with fans about her endometriosis diagnosis and her struggles with the disorder.

She said during an appearance on the TV show “The Doctors” on Thursday that she’s going to freeze her eggs, because of the fertility problems that can accompany endometriosis.

“When I tell people that, they’re like, ‘You’re 23, why do you need to do that? Why do you need to freeze your eggs?’” she said, explaining: “Doing an ovarian reserve is important to me because I’m fortunate enough to have that as an option, but I need to be aggressive about protecting my fertility, about protecting myself.”

The “Bad At Love” singer said it was difficult to finally get a diagnosis explaining why she had been in so much pain. It typically takes women an average of seven years to put a name to the disease.

“The thing with endometriosis is that it comes down to that doctors can tend to minimize the female experience when it comes to dealing with it,” Halsey said. “My whole life, my mother had always told me, ‘Women in our family just have really bad periods.’ It was just something she thought she was cursed to deal with and I was cursed to deal with, and that was just a part of my life.”

Halsey first revealed her endometriosis battle in January 2016, telling fans who also are experiencing the condition that she knows “how excruciatingly painful it can be and how discouraging the disease can be.” She underwent surgery in 2017.

A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey) on Jan 6, 2017 at 6:21pm PST

As she said on “The Doctors,” having a reproductive illness like endometriosis is sometimes “frustrating because it can really make you feel like less of a woman.”

“There’s a lot of times when you’re sitting at home and you just feel so terrible about yourself,” Halsey said. “You’re sick, you don’t feel sexy, you don’t feel proud, you don’t feel like there’s much hope.”

She added “that hopefully I can have a bright future and achieve the things that I want to achieve by doing the ovarian reserve.”Gimme, gimme, gimme an ABBA reunion after more than 35 years.

The legendary pop group announced on Friday that they are set to release two new songs for the first time since disbanding in 1982.

The Swedish hitmakers, which include Björn Ulvaeus, Agnetha Fältskog, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, previously revealed that they were working on a virtual ABBA experience. This project was apparently so successful the quartet has decided to make music together once again.

“The decision to go ahead with the exciting ABBA avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio,” they wrote in a statement. “So we did. And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!”

A post shared by @abbaofficial on Apr 27, 2018 at 4:11am PDT

The group only revealed the name of one of the new songs, “I Still Have Faith In You,” which will be performed by their “digital selves” in a two-hour TV special produced by NBC and BBC airing in December.

“We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good,” they added.

ABBA partnered with famed British manager and “American Idol” creator Simon Fuller in 2016 to announce a digital experience for a new generation of fans that would utilize “previously unimagined” technology, like virtual reality.

“We’re inspired by the limitless possibilities of what the future holds and are loving being a part of creating something new and dramatic here – a time machine that captures the essence of who we were. And are,” ABBA’s Benny Andersson said at the time, according to The Guardian.

So, “The Late Late Show” host James Corden took the actors on a stars tour through Tinseltown in a funny bit that aired Thursday.

One of the sights was a coffee shop. Corden informed the pampered A-listers that it’s where their assistants go when they are instructed to fetch coffee.

The bus also passed a brunch place with people “waiting in line.”

“What does that mean?” Chris Pratt asked in a brilliant dig at celebrity privilege.

When Michael Grandage was tapped to direct the Broadway adaptation of “Frozen,” he felt the feminist message found in Disney’s 2013 megahit movie could be expanded, given how pivotal the years since its release have been for women’s rights.

The Prince Charming-free story of Princess Anna and Queen Elsa, loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen, “is now being acted out in real life,” the Tony and Olivier Award winner told HuffPost.

“The female empowerment narrative at the center of it is something that’s clearly gaining energy in the world today,” Grandage said. “That tells you how forward-thinking [writer and co-director Jennifer Lee, who also wrote the musical’s book] is. The world kind of caught up with the piece.”

To be fair, Grandage’s version, which opened March 22 at New York’s St. James Theatre, maintains the themes of its source material. Nearly all of the film’s beloved scenes — from a glittering coronation ball to a swirling blizzard to a snowman’s summery pipe dream — are recreated in dazzling three-dimensional detail.

Many of the show’s most memorable moments, however, are those in which Grandage and stars Patti Murin (Anna) and Caissie Levy (Elsa) are allowed to venture furthest from the film’s now well-trodden plot. Of course, there would be no “Frozen” without “Let It Go,” performed here by Levy with show-stopping vigor. For Broadway, composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez have delved even deeper into Elsa’s inner turmoil with “Monster,” one of 12 new songs that Levy has described as “a badass, Kelly Clarkson emo ballad.”

Watch Caissie Levy perform “Monster” below.

“Monster,” which appears in the show’s second half, acts as a sort of “Let It Go” counterpoint, but also sees Elsa going into unprecedented emotional territory for a Disney princess: contemplating suicide.

“For me, when I was offered ‘Frozen,’ it was ‘Monster’ that gave the show real gravity, actually,” Grandage said. “There’s an incredibly dark heart at the center of the song. Elsa talks to her dead parents … she charts whether she would help the chaos she’s created by taking her own life and leaving this world.”

“Monster” would, however, go through a number of incarnations before “Frozen” hit Broadway. When Grandage began working with Levy to stage the number during the show’s out-of-town tryout in Denver, he and designer Christopher Oram had Elsa dressed in a “nightdress-negligee” inspired by Lady Macbeth (yes, really). By the end of the scene, Elsa is captured by Prince Hans (John Riddle) and his guards and transported back to the fictional kingdom of Arendelle, but the impact was underwhelming at best.

Christopher Oram's original costume sketch for "Monster" was a “nightdress-negligee” inspired by Lady Macbeth. Christopher Oram

“We watched it in Denver, and something just felt very wrong with the resolution,” Grandage recalled. For Broadway, the director and stars completely reconceived the scene so that Elsa’s journey felt more deliberate, keeping it in line with the show’s overriding message of self-empowerment.

Now, Grandage said, “Elsa entraps the men coming into her ice palace. Rather than them imprisoning her, she imprisons them … and when she releases them, she decides to give herself up rather than be captured, in order to strategize and move herself forward from what she’s told us in the song.”

The revamped interpretation of the scene, of course, required a new costume, so Oram opted to take another Disney departure by dressing Elsa in a bejeweled bodice and pants to “mirror the new axis of empowerment that came out of the song,” Grandage said. This time, the inspiration was less Lady Macbeth, more Joan of Arc.

The new "Monster" costume is a "type of armor that’s also feminine" and a nod to Joan of Arc, director Michael Grandage said. Christopher Oram/Disney

“It’s a type of armor that’s also feminine,” Grandage said. “It takes Elsa’s story on from the original movie.” Given that most of the movie’s creative team also lent their talents to the Broadway show, the director is hopeful that the costume will find its way into “Frozen 2,” currently slated for a 2019 release. “We, as the Broadway show, are sort of joyously anchored between the two films. The development of Elsa in a pantsuit is something that they’ll take on, I hope.”

“I hope that, most particularly, young girls — who make up the vast amount of our audience — are going to watch this piece and be inspired by the journey within ‘Monster,’” he added.

While reviews of the show have been mixed, Levy’s performance in particular has generated ample buzz. One thing Grandage won’t do, however, is try to predict how “Frozen” will fare May 1, when the nominations for the 2018 Tony Awards will be announced.

“It’s been a very, very interesting year with a lot of extraordinary performances emerging, so that’s not something that’s helpful for me to do,” the director, who is currently at work on the revivals of John Logan’s “Red” and Martin McDonagh’s “The Lieutenant of Inishmore” in London, said. Ultimately, he hopes the lengths he and the team have taken to strengthen its feminist message through “Frozen” and other scenes will be impactful in other ways.Hannibal Buress, pictured last year, mentioned Cosby’s reputation for drugging and assaulting women during his comedy act in 2014. That led to the media questioning Cosby’s behavior — and accusers coming forward. Photo: FilmMagic/FilmMagic

Bill Cosby’s sexual assault retrial ended Thursday with his conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. This has been a long time coming for the victim in this case, Andrea Constand, who said the comedian, now 80, assaulted her 14 years ago, and a small victory for the many other women who claim they were also drugged and victimized by Cosby as far back as the 1960s.

“Bill Cosby has the f**king smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,” Buress said. “‘Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the ’80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.’ Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches. I don’t curse onstage. But yeah, you’re a rapist.”

Buress’s comedy bit about Cosby from 2014:

Buress continued, “I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch ‘Cosby Show’ reruns. If you don’t know about it, trust me. When you leave here, Google ‘Bill Cosby rape.’ That s*** has more results than ‘Hannibal Buress.’”

Footage of his act went viral, and people finally stopped to really consider what had been a well-circulated rumor in the entertainment industry. It took on a life outside of social media with news organizations starting to report on it, including CBS News with “Who is Hannibal Buress, and why did he call Bill Cosby a ‘rapist’?” a month later. More important, brave women started speaking out — and didn’t stop. So many women — dozens — accused him of the same thing.

Soon, Cosby, who had a family comedy in the works, lost that show amid the widespread backlash, (finally) pulled the plug on his own comedy tour, and soon found himself at the center of legal action. Constand’s is the only criminal case so far, but other accusers have filed civil suits. He also filed civil suits of his own. While the accusations against Harvey Weinstein last year are credited for birthing the #MeToo movement, the women accusing Cosby had their own even before that. Five of Cosby’s other accusers testified against him in this retrial — including model and TV personality Janice Dickinson, who is perhaps the best known of the bunch — which took place less than a year after another jury deadlocked on the charges.

Buress spoke about being pulled into the Cosby narrative in 2015. “You can’t predict s*** like that,” he told GQ. When the interviewer brought up his being a “feminist hero,” he replied, “People are going to put on you whatever they want to put on you. It is conflicting, because people think I’m like this amazing guy or something. I’m a decent guy.”

Not everything about it was good. A special he was doing with Comedy Central was delayed due to the controversy, but the show went on to air soon after.

In 2016, during a Netflix panel discussion, Buress said it was a weird surprise that his joke had had such an impact. “I was doing a joke in my show, and that shouldn’t influence public opinion. I don’t know if it should go that far. It’s weird to me that a joke did that.” He also noted that there was more to his routine than Cosby jokes. “I do a lot of other s***,” he said. “It’s weird that it happened like that. I was calling a bunch of other comedians rapists, and that was the only one people took seriously. That’s just one joke people took and really ran with it.”

Buress has gone on to have more success in recent years, but fellow comedian Patton Oswalt said Cosby had nothing to do with it. “Hannibal was doing fine without that [Cosby controversy],” he said at the same panel. “He’d be sitting here now if that had not happened. … That’s just incidental to where he was going anyway.”While Buress’s act isn’t focused on Cosby jokes, he did crack another one that got some headlines in 2015. At Justin Bieber’s 2015 Comedy Central roast, he said, “I hate your music more than Bill Cosby hates my comedy.”Buress hasn’t yet spoken out about Cosby’s conviction, for which the disgraced comedian faces up to 10 years in prison for each of the three counts, despite Yahoo’s request for comment via his legal rep. Seems likely he’s saving it for his standup.State Sen. Patrick Colbeck, a Republican, is vying to be Michigan's next governor. Colbeck for Governor/Facebook

A Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan is facing backlash after voicing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about American Muslims on Michigan’s Senate floor, but some of his GOP colleagues seem determined to sidestep the debacle.

Patrick Colbeck, a second-term state senator, is doubling down on comments he made Thursday in the Michigan Senate alleging that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group with roots in Egypt, is waging “civilization jihad” in the United States ― which has been debunked as a conspiracy theory. He also repeated unfounded speculation that Abdul El-Sayed, a Muslim American doctor running for the Democratic nomination, has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Muslim Brotherhood has influence throughout the Middle East. U.S. foreign policy and counterterrorism officials have been highly critical of the organization and its ideology but have generally not viewed it as a threat to national security. However, advocates for American Muslims have long insisted that conspiracy theories about the Muslim Brotherhood are promoted to foster mistrust of legitimate Islamic organizations working to advance their communities’ interests.

Colbeck claims that the Muslim Brotherhood has ties to the Muslim Student Association, a student-run religious group that El-Sayed participated in at the University of Michigan. The MSA, which has chapters across the U.S., seeks to empower Muslim students and foster religious community on colleges campuses.

On Friday, Colbeck, who is not showing much support in polls, said in a statement that he was being attacked by Democrats and “their allies in the media” for suggesting El-Sayed “has ties to an organization that seeks to eliminate and destroy Western Civilization from within.”

Colbeck said of his Senate floor speech, “My statement was not anti-Muslim any more than associating someone with the Westboro Baptist Church would be seen as anti-Christian.”

Michigan Democrats issued condemnations of Colbeck’s remarks. State Sen. David Knezek called Colbeck a “coward” and a “bully,” describing his behavior as “a cheap rip-off of Joseph McCarthy.” State Rep. Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn, a Democrat from a district with a large Arab-American population, called for Colbeck’s resignation.

El-Sayed’s team said Republican leaders haven’t done enough to reject Colbeck’s conspiracy theories.

A spokesperson for the Donald Trump–endorsed Republican front-runner in the race, state Attorney General Bill Schuette, said he “took an oath to defend the Constitution and enforce the laws of the state of Michigan, and he believes that all people must be treated with dignity and respect.”

His representatives did not reply to a request for a more direct response to Colbeck’s allegations.

Dr. Jim Hines, another GOP candidate, apologized in a statement “for any disrespect that Senator Colbeck has caused.” Hines said, “No one, regardless of their faith, should be discriminated against.”

Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who is also seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Adam Joseph, the communications director for El-Sayed’s campaign, said his team is not satisfied with Schuette’s and Calley’s responses. Joseph is calling on both men to “clearly and unequivocally denounce” Colbeck’s statements.

“Anything short of this is a clear kowtow to racism and hatred for political gain,” Joseph said. “In their silence, they have yet to prove themselves any different from Colbeck — and they should be ashamed.”

President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at a campaign-style event in Washington, Michigan, on Saturday. HuffPost’s requests for comment from his campaign team were not returned.

State GOP spokeswoman Sarah Anderson insisted that Colbeck’s remarks on Thursday were not made on behalf of the party. “The party isn’t interested in peddling any conspiracy theories,” she told The Detroit News.

One of Colbeck’s biggest supporters, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), is listed as an endorser of Colbeck’s campaign on the candidate’s website. Cruz has also peddled theories that the Muslim Brotherhood is intent on “destroying the West.”

Requests for comment from Cruz were also not answered.

Colbeck has touted support from Fox News host Sean Hannity. But Hannity has attempted to distance himself from the candidate, telling BuzzFeed News that an endorsement was never formalized and that he doesn’t support Colbeck’s views.

El-Sayed said he wasn’t surprised by the allegations against him.

Actress Alexis Bledel revealed that the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” cast has pitched a third movie and that she would “love” if it came to fruition.

“The Handmaid’s Tale” star appeared on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Thursday and told the host that she “hopes it comes together.”

“We don’t get to see each other a lot because everybody’s work or family and everything, but when everybody is in town we do, and we just pitched a third movie and I hope it comes together. It would be so great,” the actress said.

Namely, it looks nothing like the two-time World Cup winner.

But Chastain is being a good sport about the bronze not-so-likeness that the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame dedicated to her on Monday, which some Twitter wags suggested bears more of a resemblance to actors Mickey Rooney or Gary Busey:

“It’s not the most flattering,” Chastain said, somewhat diplomatically, at the presentation, adding it was “nice.”

On Tuesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Chastain revealed “something struck me as odd” when she took a close look at the plaque. But it was “not a big deal” and she “didn’t want to make a scene,” she said.

It had been “a good laugh” and provided a “great day of laughter,” Chastain added to host Jimmy Kimmel, who’d likened the portrait to one of a powerlifter ― which she laughingly agreed with.

Following the online mockery, Kevin O’Brien, president of the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, revealed that the plaque would be replaced. “We’re going to redo it,” he told The Mercury News. “We weren’t happy with the rendering. It was not a great job.”

In Carrey’s new painting, shared to Twitter on Thursday, Trump engages Macron in a humiliating handshake, while holding his fingers in a mocking V sign above Macron’s head.

“Later there would be wedgies and wet willies in the Rose Garden,” Carrey captioned the image. “Macron, it seemed, was willing to suffer anything to keep the planet safe.”

The first part of Macron’s state visit saw him exchange numerous hugs, kisses and handshakes with Trump, who labeled Macron “perfect.”

During Macron’s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, however, the French president delivered veiled criticism of Trump’s contempt for the environment.

Last week, Carrey shared this piece in tribute to the Toronto van attack victims:The Bill Cosby verdict is a victory for all victims of sexual assault ― a group that’s not used to getting justice from the legal system.

It was incredibly emotional to watch his accusers collapse in tears after the trial and to hear one of them tell reporters in a choked-up voice, “I feel like I’m dreaming. Can you pinch me?” The more than 60 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct expressed relief to the media, and many people touted the verdict as a milestone on Twitter.

“We did it. We won. We beat Goliath,” Heidi Thomas, who accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her in 1984, said on CNN.

There are many, many reasons to celebrate this verdict. Most sexual assault victims have terrible experiences with the legal system. Police and prosecutors often judge or dismiss them, and in the few cases that make it to trial, the defense often retraumatizes, shames and attacks the victims on the witness stand.

Conviction rates for these crimes are notoriously low, and it’s more than likely that at the end of a long, painful process, the jury will side with the defendant. The Cosby verdict, along with the conviction of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar for sexually assaulting over 260 women and girls, sends a very important and high-profile message: that judges and jurors may start believing victims.

“We did it. We won. We beat Goliath.” - Heidi Thomas, who accused Cosby of sexual assault

While that message is extremely important in encouraging more survivors to come forward, this victory should be put in perspective. The legal system is still stacked against victims, and a high-profile guilty verdict is not enough to shift a legal culture that treats complainants as if they were the ones on trial.

Cosby’s sexual assault case was unique. A first trial ended in a mistrial 10 months ago, which means jurors in the retrial already knew about the lawsuit and were likely aware of the wave of sexual predators the Me Too movement has exposed. The judge allowed testimony from five other women who accused the comedian of sexual assault — an anomaly for most cases — which buttressed complainant Andrea Constand’s allegations and establish that the criminal behavior was part of a pattern.

The prosecutors were able to present the jury with Cosby’s testimony from a 2005 civil case, in which he admitted that his sexual encounter with Constand existed in a gray area “somewhere between permission and rejection.”

Most sexual violence crimes lack evidence and public attention. Most lawyers call them the most difficult cases to prosecute because they so often lack physical proof ― victims often don’t have injuries or DNA evidence from rape kits ― and there are rarely any witnesses. These trials are often dubbed “he said, she said,” since they boil down to one person’s account of events against another’s. Most judges and jurors are predisposed to believe the defendant. Many victims instead choose to settle their cases in civil court or don’t report their assaults at all.

Despite the national dialogue on sexual violence that the Me Too movement has sparked, the public holds deeply entrenched stereotypes about sexual assault victims that are very difficult to reverse. Many people think survivors should be blamed for their assaults, based on what they wore, how much they had to drink or how they acted. The cultural expectation is that credible victims should follow a script: Fight, flee and immediately report the abuse. However, experts on violence against women say that isn’t typical behavior.

These myths — which are constantly reinforced in movies, television shows and music — aren’t just something the general public believes; police, lawyers, judges and jurors have internalized them, and those are the very people responsible for deciding if a case makes it to court and whether the accused goes to prison.

The criminal justice system holds such backward views when it come to sexual assault that marital rape is still partly legal in eight states. Police regularly throw out rape reports without investigating them, and prosecutors often mishandle sex assault cases because they think that victims who delay reporting their assault or who speak with a flat affect about their abuse must be lying.

These biases regularly come out in courtrooms. A Canadian judge recently asked an alleged rape victim, “Why couldn’t you just keep your knees together?” The judge who sentenced Brock Turner to only six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious 23-year-old woman behind a dumpster in 2016 said he worried about how a prison sentence might affect Turner, who was a successful athlete.

“Prosecutors need a jury pool trained in the reality of what sexual violence is, and then at the end of the day, they also need judges who receive this training,” said Gretchen Hunt, the head of the office of victims advocacy for the Kentucky attorney general’s office. “There’s very little work specifically being done on training judges on sexual assault as a group.”

Jurors often make their decisions based on myths they believe about victims, which are reinforced by the defense. (One of Cosby’s lawyers called Constand a “con artist” who was after his money. Another said of fellow accuser Janice Dickinson, “It sounds as though she slept with every single man on the planet.”)

Kaarin Long, an an assistant attorney in Ramsey County, Minnesota, said that having the right jurors in a trial is crucial to a case’s success but that the jury selection process doesn’t give her much control over who makes the cut. “Sometimes I get a group of 12 people who are open to hearing the evidence and the state’s point of view,” she said. “[But] I had a trial a couple of months ago where I felt like we almost had no one at all.”
