President Donald Trump intends to nominate Robert Wilkie to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. Wilkie has been serving as the acting secretary since the president fired David Shulkin, the previous head of the VA.

Trump made the announcement at a summit on prison reform at the White House on Friday morning. He admitted that his decision was a surprise and that he had not yet told Wilkie, who was sitting in the audience.

“I’ll be informing him in a little while. He doesn’t know this yet that we’re going to be putting his name up for nomination to be secretary of the Veterans Administration,” Trump said.

Wilkie then stood up and shook the president’s hand.

Trump also didn’t give advanced notice to outside veterans groups.

“We didn’t know in advance, but we wish him well through the confirmation process, and look forward to working with him for the betterment of our nation’s wounded, ill and injured veterans and their families,” Joe Davis, spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said of Wilkie.

The American Legion also said it didn’t know about the nomination although it wasn’t surprised. Denise Rohan, the head of the group, said in a statement that she welcomed the news that Trump had settled upon a nominee, but she didn’t weigh in directly on Wilkie.

In his previous job at the Pentagon as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Wilkie played a key role in the administration’s ban on transgender service members. He recommended to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that transgender people be allowed to serve only if they do so “in their biological sex.” Mattis later made similar recommendations to Trump.

Matt Thorn, the spokesman for OutServe-SLDN, said the network of LGBTQ military personnel will be pressing senators to ask Wilkie about his views on LGBTQ issues.

“Unfortunately, the VA still bars surgery for transgender veterans, which is unacceptable and must be corrected,” Thorn said. “I hope that we can ascertain more information from Mr. Wilkie during his confirmation hearing. We must have a secretary that is inclusive of all veterans and values the commitment this country has made to ensuring they receive proper and speedy care.”

Trump had previously nominated White House doctor Ronny Jackson for the role, but Jackson withdrew from consideration last month after questions arose about his conduct in the medical office. Former colleagues accused him of overprescribing medications and being “abusive” toward employees.

Trump personally liked Jackson, and he had picked him to be secretary without fully vetting him. Even before allegations about the doctor’s personal behavior popped up, senators and veterans groups questioned Jackson’s nomination because he has no experience managing a bureaucracy as big and complicated as the VA.

There is currently a lawsuit challenging Wilkie’s role as acting secretary. VoteVets, a progressive veterans advocacy group, and Democracy Forward Foundation, a nonprofit legal organization, argue that Trump illegally bypassed the order of succession when he chose Wilkie, who came over from the Defense Department.

They contend that Thomas Bowman, who was Shulkin’s deputy, should have been named the acting secretary.

“Robert Wilkie never had hearings to examine his views of veterans’ care or how he envisions the VA working,” said Will Fischer, director of government relations for VoteVets. “This flies in the face of the entire system of checks and balances that federal statutes and our Constitution call for.”

VoteVets also argues that, legally, Wilkie can no longer serve as acting secretary once he is nominated to fill the role permanently.

The heads of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and ranking member Jon Tester (D-Mont.), both said they had a strong working relationship with Wilkie and looked forward to hearing more from him on his plans. Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, praised the pick and said he believed Wilkie would be an “effective” secretary.

The story has been updated with additional reactions to the news.Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, said she is willing to give back the $130,000 she received from Donald Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen in October 2016.

In exchange, Clifford wants to end the deal she made with Cohen not to discuss a relationship she says she had with Trump starting in July 2006 and lasting nearly a year. The White House has denied there was an affair.

In a story first reported by The New York Times, Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said he sent a letter to Cohen on Monday promising that his client would wire the money to an account of Trump’s choosing by Friday.

Avenatti said Cohen has until noon on Tuesday to respond to the offer, which, if accepted, would deem Clifford’s silence as “null and void” once she returned the cash.

Under the terms of the deal Avenatti is proposing, his client would then be allowed to speak openly about her alleged relationship with Trump as well as publish any text messages, photos or videos related to the president that she may have in her possession, according to CNN.

In addition, Avenatti wants Trump and the shell company that Cohen used to pay Clifford to not make any attempt to block the airing of a “60 Minutes” interview that she taped last week.

“As we have always said, this is about a search for the truth and the ability of Ms. Clifford to tell the American people what really happened so they can make their own determination,’’ Avenatti said in a statement. “Our offer proves this out.”

The Times points out that Avenatti’s offer puts Trump and Cohen in a bind: If they reject it, it could “be seen as effectively acknowledging the existence of a continuing effort to keep Ms. Clifford silent about an affair that Mr. Cohen and the president say did not happen.” Cohen announced last month that he paid Clifford $130,000 in October, but insisted the money was his own.

“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Cohen told the newspaper. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”

Cohen has not explained why he made the payment to Clifford, but the actress said his discussion of it invalidates their agreement and she now believes she is free “to tell her story.”Directors Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler arrive at the premiere of DuVernay's "A Wrinkle In Time" at El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 26, 2018, in Los Angeles.

Ava DuVernay’s highly anticipated “A Wrinkle in Time” opened last Thursday in what would be a record-breaking weekend, marking the first time the top two films at the box office were both movies directed by black filmmakers with budgets of over $100 million.

Ryan Coogler, whose film “Black Panther” took the No. 1 spot to DuVernay’s No. 2 film this weekend, was one of the first to congratulate DuVernay and acknowledge her influence.

“Ava is the past, present and future,” Coogler wrote Friday at espnW, calling DuVernay his “big sister” and discussing how she’s inspired him.

“Ava DuVernay is someone who makes the impossible look easy,” he wrote. “I met her in 2013, but she’s one of those people who you feel like you’ve always known.”

The “Creed” and “Fruitvale Station” director described his friend’s achievements and noted how she has been a pioneer for onscreen representation.

DuVernay “makes the most distant dreams and ideas a reality” through her work in shows like “Queen Sugar,” Coogler wrote. DuVernay created that series in 2016, two years before inclusion riders became part of the national conversation, as Coogler points out. “Queen Sugar” has been lauded for its nuanced representation of black families.Anna Golladay, who terms herself a "cradle United Methodist," lost her job as a licensed local pastor in Tennessee for officiating at a lesbian wedding.

The firing of a Tennessee pastor by the United Methodist Church after leaders discovered she performed a lesbian wedding has spotlighted divisions within America’s third-largest religious denomination over its stance on homosexuality.

Congregants were deeply upset when they heard the news, according to Rev. Gary Ihfe, lead pastor of both churches.

“Words were shouted, tears were shed, hugs were given, and prayers were said,” Ihfe wrote in a March 5 Facebook post. “I am so sorry for the pain that is being felt by many of our families who feel as though they have come under attack.”

Golladay said her congregations have been “irreparably harmed” by the decision.

“The pain doled out by The United Methodist Church must stop,” she wrote in a blog post. “The continued minimization of our queer friends is not acceptable and should boil up in us a level of outrage that we can no longer control.”

Disagreements about that approach toward homosexuality have caused deep ruptures within the denomination. Some factions of the American church are in favor of allowing same-sex marriages and accepting gay clergy members, but many UMC leaders from Africa and Asia oppose those moves.

St. Marks and St. Elmo are part of the Reconciling Ministries Network, a U.S.-based organization that works for the inclusion of LGBTQ people in the UMC.

UMC bishops are currently reviewing suggestions on how to keep the church united despite its disagreements over sexuality. The bishops will present their final recommendation to the denomination’s top decision-making body, the General Conference, in February 2019.

Jan Lawrence, the network’s executive director, criticized the firing of Golladay while the church is still debating its approach toward homosexuality.

“This action was unnecessary, and deprived two churches of a beloved pastor without any input from the congregations,” Lawrence said in a statement. “Actions taken against clergy and licensed local pastors during this period, while the Council of Bishops is working on their recommendation to the church, serve only to cause harm.”

In her blog post, Golladay said that she began serving at St. Marks in 2016 and at St. Elmo’s in 2017. Golladay was appointed to these churches as a licensed local pastor, which means she was technically not ordained in the UMC. Instead, she was permitted to preach, conduct worship and perform other duties of a pastor at those specific congregations.

Golladay said that the two women whose wedding she performed are members of one of her churches. One of them has been part of it for many years, “giving her whole self to ensure the success of the community,” Golladay said.

Rev. Randy Martin, superintendent for the UMC’s Scenic South District, confirmed to HuffPost that he was sent a photo from the wedding and a copy of the women’s marriage license.

Martin turned the issue over to the local district committee on ministry, a church body tasked with reviewing the certification of licensed pastors.

“Anna made the decision to violate her oath to abide by the Discipline,” Martin told HuffPost in an email. “The District Committee on Ministry upheld their responsibility to hold clergy accountable” by revoking her credentials.

Barry Condra, a gay congregant who has been a member of St. Elmo’s for 15 years, told the United Methodist News Service his first instinct when he heard about Golladay’s dismissal was to “just run and leave the church.”

He decided to stay to help counsel newer members who had been “hurt and wounded yet again from organized religion.”

Golladay noted in her blog post that the UMC expects pastors to introduce congregants to Jesus and to care for them through the joys and challenges of life, from baptisms to funerals. But, she said, the church restricts pastors from caring for LGBTQ members during one of the most pivotal moments of their lives ― their weddings.Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee say that they have completed interviews for their investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russians and that they have found no evidence of such scheming, according to multiple reports.

“We have found no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians,” they told reporters Monday.

The Republican members of the committee concluded that although Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government did take action to interfere in the election, it did not do so with the intention of aiding Trump. This contradicts earlier findings from U.S. intelligence agencies.

Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said a full report is forthcoming.

“Once the Committee’s final report is issued, we hope our findings and recommendations will be useful for improving security and integrity for the 2018 midterm elections,” he said in a statement.

Democrats on the Republican-controlled committee will likely issue a competing report, CNN reported.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, told reporters last month that there is “ample evidence” of Trump’s campaign colluding with Russia. He blasted the committee’s Republican majority for ending the investigation.

“The Majority was not willing to to pursue the facts wherever they would lead, would prove afraid to compel witnesses like [former White House chief strategist] Steve Bannon, [former White House communications director] Hope Hicks, [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., [former campaign manager] Corey Lewandowski and so many others to answer questions relevant to our investigation,” Schiff said in a scathing response.

However, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), the lawmaker leading the committee’s probe, told reporters that the worst the investigation uncovered involved “perhaps some bad judgment, inappropriate meetings, inappropriate judgment at taking meetings.”

Two other committees ― the Senate Intelligence and Senate Judiciary Committees ― are pursuing their own probes into the matter. Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is continuing a third investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election.

President Trump welcomed the release on Twitter:A tale as old as time: beauty and the “Glee” star.

Emma Watson is reportedly dating actor and musician Chord Overstreet, multiple news outlets confirm.

The pair haven’t addressed their reported relationship ― the “Harry Potter” star is famously private about her personal life ― but the two were spotted holding hands on a walk together in Los Angeles on Thursday.

“They have been dating for a little bit now, but it’s still pretty new,” a source told People, adding that the pair met through mutual friends. “They might seem like an odd match but they actually have very similar personalities.”

While the romance may seem to have come out of nowhere, the two been photographed at the same events over the past couple weeks.

Overstreet and Watson were pictured leaving the Vanity Fair party together with friends after the Oscars earlier this month, and attended a Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats concert in February.

Overstreet, 29, is best known for his role as Sam Evans on the musical comedy series, in which he starred for five seasons before the final episode in 2015. Since then, he’s gone on to release his own music, recently debuting his new single, “Hold On.”

Watson, 27, split from ex-boyfriend, tech manager William ‘Mack’ Knight, in 2017. She previously dated Matthew Janney, describing that breakup as so “horrendous” that she took a week-long vow of silence after the split.

She’s struggled since then to keep her dating life out of the public eye.

“I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways,” Watson told Vanity Fair in 2017. “I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”

AdvertisementOne year and nine months after Omar Mateen opened fire inside a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 and wounding dozens, his widow will stand trial on federal terrorism charges.

Noor Salman, 31, is charged with aiding and abetting Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization, and obstruction of justice. She has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she could face life in prison. Jury selection began earlier this month, and opening statements are slated for Wednesday.

The trial is being held in downtown Orlando at the Middle District of Florida courthouse, just two miles from Pulse nightclub, where the crime occurred. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. U.S. District Judge Paul Byron, who is presiding over the case, denied Salman’s request for a change of venue.

During jury selection, it was evident just how broadly the community has been affected by the tragedy. On the second day, almost half the potential jurors questioned said they knew someone affected ― a fact that was not, in itself, disqualifying so long as jurors maintained they could stay impartial.

Salman, who was born and raised in California, is the only person charged in the case. Her husband, Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the rampage and was shot dead by police at the scene. She was arrested in January 2017 and has been held in jail ever since. Her son, now 5, is living with his maternal grandmother in California. Salman is allowed to call him from jail every day.

To prove the aiding and abetting charge, federal prosecutors must show not only that Salman knew about her husband’s plan to orchestrate a mass shooting, but also that she helped him carry it out. They are expected to argue that she helped scout potential locations for the crime, knew Mateen was headed to Pulse on the night in question, concocted a cover story to tell his family and lied to the FBI.

Her defense team maintains that Salman, a stay-at-home mother with a young child, did not know about her husband’s deadly scheme. They say that far from being Mateen’s partner in crime, she was another one of his victims, severely physically and emotionally abused by him for years.

Salman has said that her husband physically assaulted her while she was pregnant, strangled her, forced her to have sex against her will, spied on her, threatened to kill her and controlled most of her daily activities.

Her lawyers claim Mateen did not allow her to get a driver’s license and allotted her an allowance of $20 a week, controlling her finances and isolating her from the community.

“In my expert opinion, Noor Salman is a severely abused woman who was in realistic fear for her life,” wrote Jacquelyn Campbell, an expert in domestic violence who evaluated Salman, in a court document.

Adding credibility to Salman’s claims, Mateen’s first wife has also described a similarly violent marriage to the mass shooter.

Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the defense team faces an uphill battle, especially considering the trial is being held in the community where the shooting took place.

“You’ve got to realize that the Department of Justice is batting a thousand when it comes to ISIS-related trials,” he said. Salman’s lawyers, Linda Moreno and Charles Swift, are both seasoned defense attorneys with extensive experience working terrorism cases, he added.

It will be important for jurors to distinguish Salman’s actions from her husband’s, said Mia Bloom, a terrorism expert at Georgia State University. “The jury has a challenging time ahead of them,” she said.

A central piece of evidence is an alleged confession that Salman gave to FBI agents, which was not audio- or video-recorded.

Over the course of an 18-hour interview, conducted in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Salman gave three conflicting statements. In the last one, she said that she knew her husband was going to open fire on Pulse, and saw him looking at the club’s website on his computer the night before the attack. She also said she and Mateen visited Pulse together a week earlier, driving around the venue slowly with the windows down.

But newly released evidence raises serious questions about the accuracy of her statements. According to GPS records and video footage, Salman did not visit Pulse the week before the shooting, as she said she did. Neither did her husband. And his computer showed no record of ever accessing Pulse’s website.

The defense plans to have a false confession expert testify at the trial.

They also plan to introduce evidence to show that Mateen visited other venues in the hours prior to the Pulse shooting, suggesting that the gay nightclub was not his first choice ― and that Salman could not have reasonably predicted where her husband was headed.

According to cell phone tower data and phone evidence, on the night of June 11, 2016, an armed Mateen drove to Disney Springs and Epcot, before googling “downtown orlando nightclubs.” He allegedly scouted another club, called EVE Orlando, before finally ending up at Pulse. Salman’s defense team contends that the sites Mateen visited earlier in the night had tighter security, which made them more difficult targets.

Prosecutors are also expected to argue that Salman helped Mateen hide his deadly plans from his family by concocting a cover story.

The shooting occurred during Ramadan, and Mateen’s mother believed her son would come over for dinner that night. Prosecutors claim Salman texted her husband and instructed him to tell his mother he was out with “Nemo,” a friend of his. Salman’s lawyers counter that she was simply repeating the instructions Mateen gave her about what to say to his mother if she called.

Prosecutors may also try to prove that Salman knew about her husband’s planned attack because of the unusual financial activity that took place in the weeks before it. Mateen bought her a diamond ring, earrings and lingerie from Victoria’s Secret, and added her as the death beneficiary of his bank account. Her defense team says that Mateen explained the extra money to his wife by saying he had been accepted into a police training program, and would soon be making a higher salary.

Salman was “afraid to either question or contradict his actions,” her attorneys wrote in a court filing. They will likely argue that Salman’s behavior on the night of the massacre does not align with that of a wife looped into her husband’s murderous plans.

After Mateen left around 5 p.m. she went to Applebee’s with her 3-year-old son, and then bought her husband a Father’s Day card and a T-shirt with the slogan ’World’s Greatest Dad,” on it. She also called her family in California to let them know she’d be making a trip to see them later in the summer. When her uncle asked if Mateen would be joining her, she said yes.

When Mateen failed to return home that night, Salman texted him to ask where he was. “Do you see what’s happening?” he replied. “No?” she responded. Mateen’s final text to her simply read: “I love you, babe.”

Salman’s family plans to attend the trial, said Ahmed Bedier, the president of United Voices of America, a Florida nonprofit that encourages minority groups to engage in civic life. He said he was worried that jurors may feel community pressure to convict Salman because of the desire to hold someone ― anyone ― accountable for such a traumatic event.

“I want to make sure that she is not scapegoated for something she didn’t do,” he said.

The trial is anticipated to last at least three weeks.Oprah Winfrey isn’t playing President Donald Trump’s insult game.

In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly attacked the actress and talk show maven. He called Winfrey “very insecure” in a tweet last month and over the weekend he promised to make a possible presidential run “painful” for her.

“I would love to beat Oprah,” Trump said during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night. “I know her weakness.”

Not surprisingly, Winfrey took the high road on Sunday when CNN’s Van Jones asked what she would say in response to Trump’s comments.

“I wouldn’t,” Winfrey replied. “I would only speak if I felt that I could be heard.”

"I would only speak if I felt that I could be heard," @Oprah tells @VanJones68 after he asks her what she would say if she had 10 minutes with President Trump #VanJonesShow https://t.co/N7u4pDAaqc pic.twitter.com/tfOrAS9B9F — CNN (@CNN) March 12, 2018

Winfrey’s powerful speech at the Golden Globe Awards earlier this year drew both acclaim and calls for her to run for president against Trump in 2020. However, she has since said she hasn’t heard from God on the issue.

“(I)f God actually wanted me to run, wouldn’t God kind of tell me?” Winfrey said on “60 Minutes Overtime.” “And I haven’t heard that.”

While not a candidate herself, Winfrey did offer some advice for whoever does run:She won the pageant, now she wants to fight a bigger battle.

A Vietnamese singer who won a transgender beauty pageant on Friday promised to use her elevated profile to fight for equality.

Nguyen Huong Giang was declared Miss International Queen Pageant 2018 Friday night in Pattaya, Thailand, surpassing 27 other finalists.

The transgender beauty contest has been around since 2004, but the 26-year-old Nguyen was the first contestant from Vietnam.

Nguyen, in the pageant’s Q&A portion, made it clear she would be an activist during her reign.

“I will fight for equality for transgender people,” she said, according to Agence France-Presse. “Everyone wants to be happy, and so do transgender people. We all want a good life where we are treated like everyone else and not discriminated against.”

Although the competition was fierce, contestants from countries that don’t prioritize transgender rights appreciated the opportunity to connect with other trans women.

“This is my first international experience of coming to a pageant where it is really a big exposure to all my trans sisters all over the world,” Nitasha Biswas, from India, told AFP.

Nguyen won $14,377 and several prizes along with her crown.

Her win comes at a time when Vietnam’s government is considering legally recognizing gender changes, according to Yahoo! New U.K.

Nguyen’s crowning at the pageant is expected to help boost the measure.“I’ve got an idea: we could do a thing about the size of Kate’s fingers being all the same size”.

The ice dancers, who brought home two bronze medals from the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, previously told HuffPost that they see parallels between their art and BTS’s.

“Music is one of those things, like sports, that doesn’t have a language. And so people are really appreciating what they do with their music,” Alex told HuffPost. “And I think we connect to that, because with our skating, even though we’ve always been different, we always try to make sure that we’re as good as we possibly can be.”

Alex also added that seeing Asians kill it in the entertainment industry means a lot to him, since he’s grown up during a time in which Asians are often not represented in that field.The Trump administration will propose a new rule Friday that would block federal funds to any organization that provides or even shares space with an abortion provider ― a domestic version of the so-called “Global Gag Rule” the president reinstated and expanded last year.

The move would notably strip Title X funding from Planned Parenthood, which provides birth control, STI testing and treatment, and cancer screenings to more than one-third of the federal family planning program’s 4 million low-income patients. Planned Parenthood decried the move particularly in light of the news that billionaire Bill Gates said he had to explain to President Donald Trump ― twice ― the difference between HIV and HPV.

“This is a far-reaching attack and attempt to take away women’s basic rights and reproductive rights, period,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, said in a call with reporters Friday. “I would posit that a president who it’s clear does not know the difference between HIV and HPV should not be interfering in the doctor-patient relationship.”

“This is a far-reaching attack and attempt to take away women’s basic rights and reproductive rights, period.” - Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood

Anti-abortion advocates have been pushing Trump since the beginning of his term to fulfill his campaign promise to defund Planned Parenthood, especially since Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried and failed to do so. A coalition of conservative groups sent the administration a letter on May 1 urging them to take this step.

“The pro-life grassroots are furious with the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to stop taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. “We urge the Trump administration to act swiftly to revise the Title X regulations, stopping the flow of Title X dollars to abortion centers.”

Federal law already prohibits public funds from being used to pay for abortions. Women who seek abortions at Planned Parenthood or other providers must cover the cost of the procedure themselves unless their insurance plan covers it. Trump’s proposed rule would strip funds used for birth control and STD testing from organizations like Planned Parenthood and roll back a requirement that providers who receive federal subsidies for family planning services offer women information about the full range of reproductive health options, including abortion.

Progressives are pushing back. Earlier this week, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and 40 other senators sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services warning of the “devastating impact” of the proposed rule on communities of color, the uninsured, and low-income women in particular; over a hundred members of the House penned a similar letter.

“This ‘gag rule’ would bar patients from receiving information to support their ability to make informed decisions about their own reproductive health,” the senators wrote.

The rule will be subject to a public comment period after it’s proposed, and reproductive rights groups are likely to challenge it in court.ABC will not air a completed episode of “Black-ish” that includes a family debate about whether NFL players should kneel during the national anthem, according to reports.

The network shelved the sitcom installment indefinitely over the proverbial “creative differences,” Variety noted.

“One of the things that has always made ‘Black-ish’ so special is how it deftly examines delicate social issues in a way that simultaneously entertains and educates,” an ABC spokesperson told the show business publication on Friday. “However, on this episode there were creative differences we were unable to resolve.”

Showrunner Kenya Barris echoed the network’s explanation. “Given our creative differences, neither ABC nor I were happy with the direction of the episode and mutually agreed not to air it,” he said in a statement to the New York Times.

Maybe next time, Dad.

Mason Pryor acknowledged he “bombed” during his standup comedy routine on Fox’s “Showtime at the Apollo” recently. (Watch it above.)

A flat routine about President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin generated a torrent of boos. The 30-year-old comic told the crowd to “have some respect,” and he walked off mid-set.

“I bombed when I shouldn’t have,” he said backstage. “I wasn’t funny.”

Host Steve Harvey, a standup pro, encouraged Pryor to return to the stage for some type of closure on Thursday’s show. Pryor took the advice and did, with a quick hit on the split between his dad and mother, Geraldine Mason, that got some laughs.

But boos erupted again, Harvey explained on his iHeartRadio show. According to the host, Pryor told a woman in the audience in his return to the stage, “Shut up, B,” and later picked up and dry-humped the tree stump that performers traditionally rub for luck ― and nearly dropped it.

Despite the rough night, Pryor received some encouragement from fans on Facebook after what he called his first big-time gig.

Air travel is a delicate balance: You never want to overdo it when you’re packing, but you also don’t want to forget anything important.

HuffPost spoke to a few flight attendants to find out their must-have carry-on items for flying, whether for work or pleasure. Keep scrolling to find out what essentials they can’t get on a plane without.

Selfie Stick

“One of my favorite gadgets these days is my Yoozon selfie stick. On most of my trips I’m alone, discovering and capturing amazing photographs for my Instagram. The Yoozon selfie stick is also a tripod and has a wireless remote built into its compact design. It fits into my back pocket and has really improved my travel photography.” ― Jay Robert, flight attendant and creator of Fly Guy

Moisturizer

“Flying dries you out like a raisin. I need to be better about drinking more water, but I do rely heavily on moisturizer and apply it at least two times a day.” ― Melissa, a flight attendant with American Airlines

Airborne

“I always have Airborne with me, especially during flu season, so we, as flight attendants, can stay healthy and continue delivering excellent customer service.” ― Angelina Perez, a flight attendant with Delta

Swimsuit

“I’m such a beach girl, the thought of being caught anywhere near a body of water without a bathing suit would be torturous!” ― Melissa

Lip Balm

“If there’s one thing that would drive me crazy if I forgot to bring it and that is always on the pocket of my service waistcoat, it’s Chapstick. My lips get ridiculously dry up there, and having a Chapstick in hand has become sort of my second nature.” ― Lucas Manente, a flight attendant with a major carrier

Bullet Journal

“One item I travel with is my bullet journal. For those unfamiliar, a bullet journal is a life organizer meant to document the past and help you organize the present and future. As a flight attendant, constant travel can sometimes remove you from being grounded from your life at home. My bullet journal, with the pictures of my wife and son, to-do lists and pages highlighting my plans and goals, helps keep me tethered to my family and my life and responsibilities at home. In this day and age there are many travel essentials; however, [there are] very few things that can’t easily be replaced. Be sure to take a piece of home with you so no matter where you are in the world, home is not far.” ― Vinnie De Jesus, a flight attendant with Delta

Personal Wi-Fi Hotspot

“My fly life takes me across six continents, and staying connected to my friends, family and social media followers was my biggest challenge when overseas. Fortunately for me, I discovered Teppy, a pocked-sized personal Wi-Fi hotspot from TEP Wireless that lets me keep all my devices connected in over 100 countries, with unlimited internet for a price that’s less than the cost of hotel Wi-Fi. With Teppy I’m able to wander more confidently in foreign cities using maps, finding and learning about sights and ordering my transport. Their support is amazing. I dropped my device in Istanbul and it broke. Two days later a new device was at my hotel. What I like most is it only charges me on the days I use the device.” ― Jay Robert

Book

“During my down time on a long flight, I love to get into a good story.” ― Melissa

Jacket

“Something I always think to carry with me both as a flight attendant and a passenger is a light jacket or pullover. We all know re-routes and life happen, so when you find yourself somewhere you weren’t expecting to be, or if weather surprises you at least you know you have some comfort. The same can be applied for onboard the aircraft, especially as a passenger.” ― Shane Meadow, a flight attendant with Delta

Extra Shoes

“I’d say most flight attendants always travel with an extra pair of shoes. At my own airline, flight attendants are required to wear 2-inch heels through the airport. But once you’re on the plane for 10-plus hours, 2-inch pumps just won’t cut the mustard. So, many flight attendants bring flat, comfortable shoes for working, or what we like to call ‘in-flights.’ So you’ve got your ‘airport’ or ‘terminal’ shoes (we also wear these during boarding and deplaning), then you have your ‘in-flights,’ which we’ll put on after take-off and before service. I also know of some flight attendants that always travel with fold-able flip-flops, you know, just in case their flights get re-routed to a beach somewhere!” ― Kelly Kincaid, flight attendant with a major carrier and creator of Jetlagged Comic

Phone

“Flight attendants always will have their phones on them. As a contract corporate flight attendant, my phone is absolutely essential. I keep my catering and restock lists, passenger details, photos of boarding setups, and Google handy for all moments. Ops and the pilots also need to be able to contact me at all times. Commercial flight attendants also will always have their phones on them and never leave home without it.” ― Kara Mulder, a contract corporate flight attendant and creator of The Flight Attendant Life

Exercise Clothes

“I like to carry workout clothes and shoes. Gotta stay healthy and fit! We always have some sort of gym at a layover hotel, and if we don’t, I’ll go for a run.” ― MelissaHere’s Disney’s Space Mountain as few riders have ever seen it.

Check it out in the clip above.A public park space in Baltimore that once honored two Confederate Army generals has been renamed for civil rights icon Harriet Tubman.

Hundreds of people, including city officials and Tubman family members, gathered in Wyman Park Dell for the ceremony on Saturday, held on the 105th anniversary of her death, The Baltimore Sun reported.

“We stand on the shoulders of this great woman,” Ernestine Jones-Williams, a 71-year-old descendant of the abolitionist leader who spoke on behalf of the family, said. “We are overwhelmed. Overwhelmed. Thank you, and God bless you.”

The site, now named Harriet Tubman Grove, features a barren pedestal that once held bronze statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson on horseback. Mayor Catherine Pugh’s administration ordered the removal of all four of the city’s Confederate monuments in August following the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. It’s unclear when or if the three other former Confederate memorial sites will be rededicated.

Ciara Harris, chief of staff to Baltimore Recreation and Parks Director Reginald Moore, said the space now dedicated to Tubman has become a gathering place for “city residents of all backgrounds” since the Confederate monument’s removal, according to the Sun.

“Harriet Tubman Grove will provide the city an opportunity to correct historic injustice to a Maryland native,” Harris said. “Our city is properly recognizing an African-American hero.”

Twitter suspended several popular accounts on Friday in a major crackdown on “tweetdeckers,” a secret network of accounts that make tweets go viral by retweeting the same content in exchange for money.

The company suspended several notably large accounts in Friday’s cleanup, including @GirlPosts, @Dory, @CommonWhiteGirl, @SoDamnTrue and @memeprovider. Some of these accounts, which mostly tweeted jokes and memes, had millions of followers.

Twitter users celebrated the sweep, accusing the accounts of stealing other people’s tweets or jokes without crediting the original creator.

While many of these accounts amassed impressively large followings, tweetdeckers or tweetdeck parody accounts, as they have come to be known, violate Twitter’s terms of service.

Tweetdeckers were named after TweetDeck, the Twitter-owned app that allows users to monitor tweets and post to several accounts at once. They convened in secret TweetDeck groups, known as decks, according to a BuzzFeed investigation.

Tweetdeckers capitalized on their large followings and tight-knit networks by selling their retweets to people who want to go viral. Individuals or brands would pay the owner of a tweetdeck group to have their network retweet their content a certain amount of times in order gain access to the tweetdeckers’ audience, BuzzFeed reported.

Twitter, however, explicitly bans users from selling, purchasing or attempting to “artificially inflate account interactions” including followers, retweets and likes. On Friday, the company apparently made good on their promise to permanently suspend accounts who violate that rule.

A spokesperson for Twitter told HuffPost on Saturday that the sweep was a part of a broader company effort to fight spam on the platform. Last month, Twitter announced it would be making changes to TweetDeck and restricted people from using the app to retweet the same tweet across multiple accounts.

“Keeping Twitter safe and free from spam is a top priority for us,” the company said in a February blog post. “One of the most common spam violations we see is the use of multiple accounts and the Twitter developer platform to attempt to artificially amplify or inflate the prominence of certain Tweets.”

Tweetdeckers are finally going down and I couldn’t be more thrilled — Matt Allaire (@AllaireMatt) March 10, 2018

While Twitter was focused on limiting spam, Twitter users who create their own original content were frustrated that these tweetdecker accounts were promoting stolen tweets and making money off of it.

James Breakwell, a popular comedy writer who goes by the Twitter name @XplodingUnicorn, said tweetdeckers have previously tweeted content stolen from him, though he said it hasn’t happened in a while.

“I finally got big enough that they couldn’t do it without getting caught,” he told HuffPost, adding that tweet stealers “mostly prey on small accounts that can’t stick up for themselves.”

Breakwell, who became famous for his hilarious musings about being a father of four, has just over 1 million followers.

One tweetdecker who goes by @broebong admitted to BuzzFeed in January that the tweets these accounts share are “stolen like 90 percent of the time.

“I’m just doing it because it’s easy money and it makes people happy in the end,” @broebong told the news site. “People will pay to have their stuff promoted to my audience and it’s just extra money that I can put to savings.”

As of Saturday afternoon, @broebong’s account appeared to be suspended too.One of President Donald Trump’s top spokesmen on Sunday all but confirmed that the White House would not include universal background checks in its proposal for reducing gun violence.

Less than two weeks ago, at a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers at the White House, Trump expressed support for the idea.

White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah shied away from an embrace of that position during an appearance Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” His backtracking was consistent with Wall Street Journal reporting from Saturday and what many skeptics had predicted.

Host Jon Karl reminded Shah of what Trump had said at the Feb. 28 meeting ― in particular, the president’s support for universal background checks.

“I was in the room when he was negotiating with congressional leaders,” Karl said. “He … made it very clear that he favors universal background checks on all gun purchases.”

Karl then asked it that would be part of the administration’s legislative recommendations to Congress

“Well, improving the background check system is going to be a big component of…” Shah said, before Karl interrupted him.

“He didn’t say improving, he said making them universal,” Karl said.

“I understand, but I’m saying improving background checks from the ‘Fix NICS’ legislation” would be part of the proposal, as well as other measures, Shah said.

NICS is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is already in place. “Fix NICS” is a bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to bolster the system by improving the flow of information into it from states and various federal agencies.

In the wake of last month’s mass shooting at a Florida high school, the bill has widespread support. But what it calls for is far less ambitious than universal background checks. That provision would extend NICS so that it includes private sales, such as those that often occur at gun shows.

At the White House meeting, Trump surprised many of his allies by saying he supported a universal background check proposal that Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) had tried and failed to pass in 2013.

Opposition by nearly all Republicans and a handful of Democrats left the bill a few votes short of the 60 it needed to pass the Senate.



Other administration officials have previously walked back Trump’s comments at last month’s session with lawmakers. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said just two days later that Trump did “not necessarily” support universal background checks.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made an eyebrow-raising statement Friday, when he told CNN anchor Chris Cuomo that the president of the United States can be found guilty of obstructing justice.

Asked explicitly whether any president can obstruct justice, Giuliani replied: “He can.”

The statement reverses a claim made by John Dowd, a now-former lawyer for President Donald Trump, who told Axios in December that the president cannot obstruct justice.

“[H]e is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution’s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,” Dowd told the outlet at the time.

Giuliani joined Trump’s legal team about one month after Dowd announced his resignation in late March.

Legal experts have debated the merits of Dowd’s argument. Many disagree with it ― including Giuliani, at least for the moment.

The debate is increasingly relevant as Trump’s team seems to be taking an increasingly confrontational approach to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe that may include positing that the president simply cannot be charged with any of the crimes being investigated.

Mueller is reportedly zeroing in on a few key issues, including possible obstruction.

Mueller’s appointment was triggered by Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, Giuliani told Cuomo on Friday. The former mayor also said, “The president has complete discretion to fire anybody he wants.”

But he stressed that there was “zero evidence” to justify the investigation in the first place.

In an interview on May 11, 2017, Trump conceded he had considered the “Russia thing” when he decided to fire Comey, prompting questions over whether obstruction charges could apply.Anti-abortion advocates rally in Dublin on March 10. Jesselyn Cook/HuffPost

DUBLIN ― As people around the world gather this week to celebrate women’s rights, the issue holds a special significance for those in Ireland. Irish citizens will soon head to the polls in a nationwide referendum on abortion, which their constitution has effectively outlawed for decades.

The country’s eighth amendment recognizes the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn child, and criminalizes abortion with up to 14 years in prison. A pregnancy can only be legally terminated if multiple doctors determine that it poses a serious risk to the mother’s life. With no exceptions for cases of rape, incest or fetal abnormality, Ireland has one of the world’s most restrictive laws on abortion.

Voters will decide in late May whether to repeal the eighth amendment, giving the legislature the opportunity to propose a new policy that could allow women to have abortions up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. Recent polls suggest stark divisions in public opinion across the country.

The friction is palpable in the streets of Dublin, which are decorated in colorful referendum-related posters and filled with campaigners on both sides of the issue. Within 48 hours, the Irish capital’s Parnell Square hosted two large rallies: a march to “repeal the eighth” on Thursday evening, and another to “save” it on Saturday afternoon.

“It’s a historic time for people in Ireland to have a say in what is a critical issue,” said Colm O’Gorman, the director of Amnesty International Ireland, who marched alongside thousands of repeal advocates at the rally on International Women’s Day.

“Over the last number of years in particular, we’ve seen a great increase in public expressions of ― but also a lot of research evidence to show ― that there is very strong support across the country and all demographics for very progressive change in this area,” O’Gorman said.

“We’re now at a point where I think Irish society appreciates and understands that the eighth amendment doesn’t prevent abortions; rather, it prevents safe and legal abortions from happening here in Ireland ― which, as a result, causes really grave violations of women’s reproductive rights as well as untold trauma and suffering.”

It’s become common for Irish women to attempt to terminate their pregnancies by using abortion pills that have been smuggled into the country, or by traveling abroad to have the procedures legally. An estimated 10 to 12 women journey to countries like England and Wales for abortions every day.

For Bernadette, a repeal advocate living in Dublin, flying to the U.K. for an abortion felt like the only viable option when she experienced a crisis pregnancy at age 30.

“I love traveling, I love the airport, I love planes, but it felt like there was a knot in my stomach,” she recalled of her trip to Birmingham. “The whole time, I was thinking, ‘I can change my mind if I want to,’ but I just knew it was the right decision for me.”

She said the procedure initially left her feeling “like a criminal in [her] own country,” because of the “shame and a stigma” surrounding the issue. She is now an active canvasser for the repeal campaign.

The debate has become increasingly contentious since the eighth amendment was enacted in 1983, and tensions are mounting as the referendum approaches. Opposing camps are blasting emphatically different messages, chanting phrases like “Hear our voices, respect our choices!” and “Two, four, six, eight, we appreciate the eighth!” But they project a common theme: The need to protect Irish women’s rights.

“I’m here to show people that being a feminist doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re pro-choice; in fact, there are huge amounts of feminists that are pro-life,” said 19-year-old demonstrator Roisin Ni Fhloinn, who considers herself to be among “a vocal minority” of anti-abortion university students.

“It’s very important that we highlight the fact that women ― predominantly unborn women ― are targeted by abortion in a lot of countries. Both men and women are equal and they deserve equal rights, as does the unborn child,” the teen added. A passing elderly woman cheerfully interrupted her to offer a quick word of encouragement.

“Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world to be pregnant and give birth in, and I’m very proud of that as a young Irish woman,” said Ni Fhloinn. “We need to stand up and fight for those who can’t fight for themselves.”

Protesters at the sunny Saturday anti-abortion rally, who far outnumbered those at the pro-choice rally on Thursday, expressed deep disappointment at how the Irish media has covered their cause.

“I’m here today because I want to acknowledge the fact that a lot of us women are actually pro-life, contrary to what the media tries to portray. I think they try to portray that you cannot be pro-life and a feminist, and that’s just not true,” said 29-year-old Fatima Gunninghameed.

“Having done a lot of campaigning, I think that this referendum is a great chance for us to reaffirm our position as a pro-life nation,” she added. “I really, really hope that not just Ireland, but the whole world can move to re-sanctify the value of human life, because a lot of things in the world today are really degrading to human life, and I wish that would be reversed.”

To Aoife Mullan, a 27-year-old pro-choice artist from Dublin, the fight for human rights is equally important, but entirely different in nature. She has campaigned against the eighth amendment “since Savita.”

Savita Halappanavar was an Indian dentist who immigrated to Ireland. She died in 2012 as a result of complications from a miscarriage that she experienced 17 weeks into her pregnancy. Medical professionals had denied her repeated pleas for an abortion.

“I was in college at the time [of Halappanavar’s death], and I just couldn’t understand how a woman had died just because of the state. I still can’t understand it ― it’s unfathomable,” said Mullen. “Everyone was quite shocked, and I think quite embarrassed about how it reflected on the nation internationally. But that’s a good thing, because that highlights how the Catholic Church still has a grasp on the nation.”

Repeal supporters gather at the end of the march. Jesselyn Cook/HuffPost

Ireland’s Catholic Church has publicly urged its followers to vote against loosening restrictions on access to abortion, but many anti-abortion advocates argue that the matter is one of human rights, not religion.

“It’s a moral issue, it’s an ethical issue, but we don’t call it a religious issue. I just see it as a right and wrong issue, I don’t see it as sinful,” said Mairead Hughes, a coordinator with the secular organization Cherish All The Children Equally who describes the looming referendum as “a pivotal moment.”

“People are fired up for this ― they feel like it’s their last shot,” she said. “If the eighth amendment is removed, we have no legal protection, and that is deeply worrying.”

With an 11-week countdown to the vote, it’s still too soon to tell what will happen. But advocates on both sides agree that the referendum has elevated a crucial dialogue about the rights of Irish women.

“Women are telling their stories, and that’s changed the nature of the conversation,” said O’Gorman. “It’s a huge moment for Ireland.”

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that referendum voters would decide whether to repeal the eighth amendment in favor of legislation that would allow women to have abortions up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. While the referendum vote is on whether to repeal the amendment, it is the legislature that would then be responsible for crafting a new law on women’s reproductive rights.
