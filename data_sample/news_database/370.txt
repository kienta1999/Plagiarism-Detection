WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump upheld U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal on Friday by granting Tehran relief from U.S. sanctions but aides said it would be the last time he would do so.

A senior administration official said Trump wants the 2015 Iran deal strengthened with a follow-on agreement in 120 days or the United States will unilaterally withdraw from the international pact.

Trump had privately chafed at having to once again waive sanctions on a country he sees as a rising threat in the Middle East. The agreement was reached during Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency.

While Trump approved a sanctions waiver, the Treasury Department decided to impose new, targeted sanctions against 14 Iranian entities and individuals.

The decision was to be announced in a statement issued by the White House a day after Trump engaged in lengthy discussions with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and others about the deal.

Trump has argued behind the scenes that the nuclear deal makes the United States look weak, a senior U.S. official said. The argument for staying in, the official said, was to allow time to toughen the terms of the agreements.

A decision to withhold a waiver would have effectively ended the deal that limits Iran‚Äôs nuclear program. The 2015 agreement between the United States and Iran also was signed by China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union, and these countries would have been unlikely to join the United States in reimposing sanctions.

Two senior Trump administration officials told Reuters on Wednesday that the president, a Republican, had privately expressed reluctance to heed the advice of top advisers recommending he not reimpose the suspended sanctions.

Trump has argued that Obama, a Democrat, negotiated a bad deal for the United States in agreeing to the nuclear accord.

Hailed by Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal lifted economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program.

PRESSURE FROM EUROPE

Trump had come under heavy pressure from European allies to issue the sanctions waiver.

Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. It has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it but will ‚Äúshred‚Äù the deal if Washington pulls out.

The U.S. Congress requires the president to decide periodically whether to certify Iran‚Äôs compliance with the deal and issue a waiver to allow U.S sanctions to remain suspended.

Trump in October chose not to certify compliance and warned he might ultimately terminate the accord. He accused Iran of ‚Äúnot living up to the spirit‚Äù of the agreement even though the International Atomic Energy Agency says Tehran is complying.

Hard-liners on Iran in the U.S. Congress have called for the reimposition of the suspended sanctions and an end to the nuclear deal, while some liberal Democrats want to pass legislation that would make it harder for Trump to pull Washington out without congressional consent.

Trump and his top advisers have been negotiating with U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill to try to change sanctions legislation so that he does not face a deadline on whether to recertify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal every 90 days.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker has been working on amending a U.S. law to include ‚Äútrigger points‚Äù that if crossed by Iran would automatically bring back U.S. sanctions.

Britain, France and Germany called on Trump on Thursday to uphold the pact. French President Emmanuel Macron stressed to Trump in a telephone call on Thursday the importance of abiding by the deal.When God put Jesus in Mary's womb, He knew He would be from Nazareth. And He knew that Nathanael would proclaim, "Nazareth?!? Can anything good come from there?". Moreover, when Jesus chose to walk through Samaria, He knew of the hatred, strife and anger between the Jews and the Samaritans. He knew that the Jews thought them to be heretics, inferior human beings and wholly unworthy of the Love of God. Finally, when Saul was converted to Paul on the road to Damascus and sent to the Gentiles, God knew that the Jewish people did not believe them to be worthy of salvation or relationship with Him. And for preaching this, He knew Paul would be killed.

We see over and over again that neighborhoods, countries, and even people groups are shitholes to political and religious leaders but to Jesus, these are only places and people in need of radical inclusion into the family of God. Fortunately, Presidents did not form the children of Haiti, El Salvador and Cameroon in their mothers' wombs. The forefathers of the United States are not the Fathers of Creation. And so the description that God spoke when He formed humanity for the first time, "VERY GOOD" is still true for my brothers and sisters who hold residence in Honduras and Morocco. Trump is not God and the United States is not Heaven. The Constitution is not the Holy Bible. And that is where our value, dignity, and worthy were decided.

The United States can make laws but it cannot confer value on humanity, nor can it take it away. Senators, Representatives and elected officials can disagree with Trump, but if they root their argument in a plaque on the Statue of Liberty then their words are not strong enough to break the binds of racial and economic oppression and white supremacy. The only power that destroys the dividing walls of hostility is the resurrection of Jesus and an uncomparable, uncompromising invitation to Holy Family of God.

May followers of Jesus embrace their positions of power and influence and leverage them for the flourishing of all people and the reflection of the Kingdom of God; and the destruction of any power that would come against it through generosity, sacrificial love, and prayerful, compassionate resistance. From the pulpit to the pew and from park benches to boardrooms would the Good News of Jesus be proclaimed that there are no shitholes in this world and every person is made in the image of God to flourish, work, rule and create. It does not matter what those with earthly wealth and power do or say, because their power is no match for the power of God.‚ÄúLast Man Standing‚Äù is coming back.

The Tim Allen-led comedy was officially picked up by Fox for a seventh season, roughly a year after it was canceled by ABC. Allen will return as conservative Christian family man Mike Baxter, while co-stars Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Jordan Masterson, Christoph Sanders and Nancy Travis have also signed on.

In a Friday statement cited by Deadline and The Hollywood Reporter, Allen said he ‚Äúdid a fist pump so hard I threw my back out‚Äù after learning the news.

‚ÄúTeam LMS was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure audiences will be curious to see what we look like after all these years. Oh, has it only been one year? Well, just goes to show you ‚Äî a lot can happen in a year.‚Äù

A number of entertainment outlets expressed surprise at the news, especially since it came just one day after Fox announced that it was canceling ‚ÄúThe Mick‚Äù and the critically beloved ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine.‚Äù

Previously, Allen had criticized ABC‚Äôs decision to ax ‚ÄúLast Man Standing‚Äù last year when the show continued to enjoy solid ratings. At the time, many fans believed his political views prompted the network to scrap the show. The right-leaning star attended President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, and once compared being a conservative in Hollywood to 1930s Germany.

AdvertisementIt‚Äôs not even two weeks into 2018 and already it feels like two months.

It started on Jan. 5 with the early release of the bombshell book Fire and Fury, in which author Michael Wolff chronicled the turbulent relationships within the Trump administration. White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller appeared on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState Of The Union‚Äù on Jan. 7 to put out the flames, but instead fueled the dumpster fire to rage even more furiously.

But sorry, there‚Äôs no more time to discuss that, because just days later on Jan. 11, President Trump referred to African nations as ‚Äúshithole countries,‚Äù according to multiple sources, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin who was present in the president‚Äôs meeting and directly confirmed the comment.

Suffice it to say that 2018 has gotten off to a rough start. To alleviate this, HuffPost Comedy asked the Twittersphere to describe the year thus far using song lyrics.

"There's three things men always talk about: women, sports and cars."

So says a laser-etched piece of ‚Äúquality beech wood‚Äù you can order from Amazon for $19.99. The quote is attributed to Mario Lopez, a man most widely known for his ability to sit on chairs backwards as A.C. Slater on Saved By the Bell.

This quote is not particularly insightful, nor it is eloquent. It is, however, a popular distillation of the modern American male. The name for this archetype has evolved over the years, from the ‚Äúman‚Äôs man‚Äù to the ‚Äúguy‚Äôs guy‚Äù to the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù. These terms are interchangeable, and they purport to define all forms of culturally acceptable masculinity.

These labels run counter to, apparently, ‚Äúpajama boys‚Äù. At least according to former Special Assistant to President Trump and Nazi-affiliate Sebastian Gorka. Last December, he declared that the ‚Äúera of the pajama boy is over January 20th, and the alpha males are back.‚Äù By ‚Äúalpha males‚Äù, we can take Gorka to mean Nazis, white nationalists, war hawks, killers et. al.. And this shows the inherent problem of the ‚Äúman‚Äôs man‚Äù and why we need to kill it‚Äîit‚Äôs stitched, helplessly so, to dominance.

The pajama statement was Gorka‚Äôs way of summarizing what he perceived were military failures by the Obama administration. Gorka equates manliness with military intervention. His basic thesis being that ‚Äúmen kill,‚Äù and non-men or ‚Äúpajama boys‚Äù do not. According to Gorka, Obama chose not to invade Syria because he wasn‚Äôt manly enough to do so.

The term unfurled by Gorka, ‚Äúpajama boy‚Äù, originated in 2013 when President Obama tweeted an ad for the Affordable Care Act. The ad showed a young man clad in a flannel onesie sipping from a mug with an accompanying message stating: ‚ÄúWear pajamas. Drink hot chocolate. Talk about getting health insurance.‚Äù

Right wing commentators and all around manly men tore into the ad claiming it further perpetuated the infantilization of the American male. Rich Lowry of the National Review wrote a piece for Politico in which called the ad‚Äôs subject an ‚Äúinsufferable man-child‚Äù who ‚Äúis probably reading The Bell Jar and looking forward to a hearty Christmas meal of stuffed tofurkey.‚Äù

So reading Sylvia Plath and not eating meat are obvious negatives; they are decidedly unmanly character traits. Real men eat flesh, and real men don‚Äôt read classic American novels or drink hot chocolate, or wear pajamas.

Though what it means to be a ‚Äúman‚Äù has become more malleable over the last few decades, the idea of the ‚Äúman‚Äôs man‚Äù and the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù has stayed rather static. If you picture an alpha male in your head, he‚Äôs probably a large guy brimming with confidence; he may have a beard or be holding and axe or standing next to a truck or something, or maybe he‚Äôs wearing a suit and his chin is tilted just a little too high, or maybe he‚Äôs a chap of another knit entirely ‚Äîthe aesthetics and quirks aren‚Äôt the issue here; it‚Äôs about much more than that. The alpha male approach traverses all social spheres. Adherence to this archetype is predominantly defined by a continual exhibition of power‚Äîthat‚Äôs the problem.

The specimens in question, the men‚Äôs men as it were, perfectly exude all of the qualities we have decided, as a culture, a man should have and hold. And this super-glue-like adherence to this archetype has pushed the gender the wrong direction. U.S. culture has long fetishized male simplicity and dominance, with a particular focus on nurturing the libidinal impulses therein‚Äîand it has done a lot of damage: 89 percent of homicides committed the United States are committed by males. A study conducted by the DOJ between 1990 and 2010 found that 99 percent of people arrested for rape were male. The FBI‚Äôs numbers for 2015 found that 79.7 percent of violent crimes were committed by men.

Now someone may slide in here and point out that males have been the primary perpetrators of violent crimes throughout nearly every society for centuries. This is true. And, it‚Äôs precisely the reason why males should be pushed by society to be more dynamic, compassionate and empathetic beings.

Existing as a powerful, brute who only successfully converses on athletics, machines and the opposite sex, should be viewed as a sad, trivial existence. But it's still considered the pinnacle in many ways. Chauvinism is admired in many circles, and it's considered manly to be simple and powerful and to assert that power over others. Indulging in this power is the easy path‚Äîit's the default setting, it‚Äôs a fixed trajectory, it's animalistic. It's a surrendering to popular culture and to base impulses.

The last thing men need is a shot of steroids to the ids and egos of the worst offenders. And yet, for decades upon decades being a monster was not only an acceptable social path for the modern American male, it was encouraged.

Trump said his vile comments on women were "locker room talk", asserting that this is how all men speak to one another in a locker room. The "boys will be boys" excuse has been used for decades around the world to excuse violence and frame sexual assault as the logical and unavoidable result of having a penis.

The idea that men can't help it is profoundly insulting and stupefyingly mythological in nature.

Do we (men) not possess cerebral cortexes imbued with the power of self-control?

What our society needs is more superego, more balance, more humility and far less systematic manliness.

As we examine the seemingly never-ending wave of sexual assault allegations that are knocking handfuls of powerful men off their perches each day, as we read about the numerous hazing-related deaths at fraternities, as we come to accept the fact that our country elected a man who bragged about grabbing women by the genitals without consent, we have to acknowledge that toxic masculinity is a systemic problem.

Society‚Äôs bolstering of this myopic brand of manliness does not excuse the behavior of abusers and blowhards; they are human beings who made decisions. But the alpha-friendly atmosphere that helped foster and hide these hideous acts needs to be dismantled. For this to be a full on cultural reckoning, we need to look beyond the individuals to the system that nourished their behavior.

We need to destroy the idea of the alpha male and all it‚Äôs associated labels, and replace it with something far simpler and broader. There's really no reason to involve gender at all: be a good person. The qualities associated with gender are almost entirely a social construction; there‚Äôs no reason for them to exist. We can be reductive here: be responsible, be gracious, be generous, be compassionate, be empathetic, be caring, be kind.

This is not to say that men should be prohibited from ever acting in traditionally masculine ways, or from enjoying cars and motorcycles and whiskey and axes and football and whatever else, it simply means that those aspects of perceived masculinity should not define, in totality, what is means to be a ‚Äúman.‚Äù Being a ‚Äúman‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt mean anything; personhood should trump all categorizations of gender.

Adhering to gender norms should not be factored in to the good person index. By narrowing things by gender, we have created an atmosphere that punishes those who defy convention. There is no doubt that much of the hate and discrimination exhibited towards the LGBTQ+ community stems from our adherence to these strict, archaic laws of gender.

Men are encouraged to be generic, powerful, dominant beings; sensitivity and empathy are muted background singers.

The alpha male has brought an immense amount of war, and abuse, and death, and destruction.

It‚Äôs time we ended him.Certain parts of the world are made up of ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù whose citizens are undeserving of a chance for a better life in America, President Donald Trump claimed Thursday during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers. Although many saw those crass remarks as a clear window into the president‚Äôs bigoted worldview, Trump‚Äôs supporters rushed to his defense in an effort to distract from the simple reality at the heart of this latest White House scandal: The president of the United States is a racist man pursuing a racist immigration agenda.

Let‚Äôs take a look at these arguments and why they‚Äôre so bad.

Trump was talking like a liquored-up barfly, so it‚Äôs fine.

‚ÄúThis is how the forgotten men and women in America talk at the bar,‚Äù said Fox News commentator and perpetual disappointment to his parents Jesse Watters. ‚ÄúThis is how Trump relates to people. If you‚Äôre at a bar, and you‚Äôre from Wisconsin, and you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre bringing in a bunch of Haiti people, or El Salvadorians, or people from Niger.‚Äô This is how some people talk.‚Äù

Other supporters likened Trump‚Äôs comments to locker room banter ‚Äï we‚Äôve heard that before ‚Äï or even ‚Äúkitchen table‚Äù talk, suggesting the president was just mimicking conversations that happen in some corners of the U.S. every day.

That‚Äôs no doubt true. But historically, American presidents have been held to a higher standard than racist uncles or drunks at the bar. Typically they‚Äôve been better qualified to lead a nation, too. And while it would be foolish to pretend some of these sorts of people aren‚Äôt among Trump‚Äôs base, that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else has to shut up and go along when the president tries to write national policy with ink tainted by their ideology.

Trump was right: Some of these countries are ‚Äúshitholes‚Äù!

A number of conservative pundits leapt to this explanation, arguing that if nations like Haiti and El Salvador were doing well, people wouldn‚Äôt be coming to the U.S. in the first place.

Option A: El Salvador isn't a "shithole," so they don't need 17 years of Temporary Protected Status, and migrants from there should be sent home immediately. Option B: El Salvador is, in fact, a "shithole." https://t.co/sea1sKoY8K ‚Äî Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) January 11, 2018

We‚Äôll get this out of the way quickly: Calling a country or continent a ‚Äúshithole‚Äù is deeply offensive, entirely unproductive and seemingly counter to core American values grounded in compassion and inclusivity.

Beyond all that, the dismissive jab also conveniently skirts any deeper consideration of the many uncomfortable reasons why those nations are in bad shape today. It has everything to do with a centuries-long history of racism, exploitation and aggressive Western incursion, noted journalist Jonathan Katz, who recently wrote a book about Haiti.

‚ÄúRacists have needed Haiti to be poor since it was founded,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThey pushed for its poverty. They have celebrated its poverty. They have tried to profit from its poverty. They wanted it to be a shithole. And they still do.‚Äù

Check out his whole thread below.

Lot of folks, from the alt-right to @RichLowry, think they‚Äôre making a great argument in the president‚Äôs defense tonight by noting that Haiti and El Salvador are, in fact, poor.



But they‚Äôre just revealing their own racism. Here‚Äôs why: ‚Äî Jonathan M. Katz (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018

Because what they are showing is that they ASSUME that Haiti is just naturally poor, that it‚Äôs an inherent state borne of the corruption of the people there, in all senses of the word.



And let‚Äôs just say out loud why that is: It‚Äôs because Haitians are black. ‚Äî Jonathan M. Katz (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018

Trump was calling out nationality, not race.

When Trump said he wanted fewer immigrants coming to the U.S. from Haiti, El Salvador or the entire continent of Africa, and more from places like Norway, he was saying exactly that and nothing more, his supporters argue. MAGA types were out in force on social media Friday noting that words like ‚ÄúHaitian‚Äù or ‚ÄúSalvadoran‚Äù describe a nationality, not a race, and therefore any derogatory statements Trump had made toward them couldn‚Äôt be inherently racist.

Why might Trump, a man with a long history of racially insensitive and racist comments, be so quick to write off millions of black and brown people while showing preference for white ones? Who‚Äôs to say?

Trump‚Äôs words sound icky, but his point is actually good!

It can be hard to extract concrete policy proposals out of the president‚Äôs off-the-cuff remarks, so we‚Äôll leave that task to his loyal translators. Trump‚Äôs message was obvious to White House spokesman Raj Shah: Trump supports ‚Äúmerit-based immigration,‚Äù as opposed to a system that weighs family connections or country of origin.

‚ÄúPresident Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation,‚Äù Shah said in a statement.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) felt similarly, wrapping an endorsement of merit-based immigration into a mealy-mouthed rebuke of the president.

Although there is evidence that a family-based system of immigration provides a number of benefits to the U.S., that‚Äôs really beside the point: Trump didn‚Äôt argue for a policy that gives preference to doctors or other high-skilled workers. He said give me more Norwegians and fewer people of color.

It was a surprisingly transparent presentation of Trump‚Äôs broader immigration agenda, which would disproportionately affect non-white people in a number of other ways, from the large proportion of Africans who benefit from the diversity visa lottery to Americans and legal permanent residents, often Latino and Asian, who want to sponsor family members to come to the U.S.

Other presidents were foul-mouthed racists, so what‚Äôs the big deal?

In some circles, Trump‚Äôs apparent utterance of the word ‚Äúshit‚Äù was the actual issue here. Setting the bar for our current president at Richard Nixon, a notorious anti-Semite and racist, or other similarly controversial presidents from a half-century ago seems like a bad idea.

If the President saying "shithole countries" bothers you, don't ever listen to the JFK, LBJ, or Nixon tapes of your ears will explode. #PearlClutching ‚Äî Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) January 11, 2018

Trump didn‚Äôt actually say it.

The president attempted to do a little damage control on Friday, saying that he‚Äôd used ‚Äútough‚Äù language during the Oval Office meeting, though perhaps not the word ‚Äúshithole.‚Äù

The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018

Trump later claimed he ‚Äúnever said anything derogatory about Haitians‚Äù and got some cover from Republican Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.) and David Perdue (Ga.), who released a joint statement saying, ‚ÄúWe do not recall the President saying these comments specifically.‚Äù

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) had a clearer recollection:

‚Ä≥[Trump] went on and started to describe the immigration from Africa that was being protected in this bipartisan measure. That‚Äôs where he used these vile and vulgar comments, calling the nations they come from ‚Äòshitholes‚Äô ‚Äï the exact word used by the president not just once, but repeatedly.‚Äù

But a newer, dumber explanation emerged over the new few days: Trump had actually said ‚Äúshithouse,‚Äù not ‚Äúshithole,‚Äù sources said, and according to their retelling, the difference was significant.

Why are some Trump allies arguing that POTUS said "shithouse" rather than "shithole"? Some Rs say "shithouse countries" refers to poor countries w/no plumbing -- places where u have to walk out to the shithouse -- and therefore the phrase is NOT racist. ‚Äî Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) January 16, 2018

Most normal people don‚Äôt say ‚Äúshithouse‚Äù ‚Äï and certainly not in reference to entire regions of the world. Still, Trump could have said it.

AdvertisementTASTING TABLE

I can vividly remember the first time I felt fear and frustration around food. I was 10 years old, I had just learned about Weight Watchers, and I had found a book containing all of their point counts in my living room. People had made subtle and not-so-subtle comments about my body and weight from when I was around seven or eight, and even though I was young, they didn‚Äôt go over my head.

That morning, instead of just filling up a bowl with cereal and regular milk, I grabbed a measuring cup, and measured out an amount of Rice Krispies and skim milk that was far less than what any 10-year-old should have been eating. I wrote down the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù for that meal in a journal.

A few hours later, I found out that we would be going to a family member‚Äôs house for lunch, and we would be having pizza. I instantly felt anxious because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt fit into the points that I was allowing myself that day. Instead of allowing myself to enjoy some hot pizza with gooey cheese like most kids would, I was focused on the anxiety it was giving me. My scared, shame-ridden 10-year-old self never imagined that nearly 11 years later, I‚Äôd be recovering from an eating disorder and beating food guilt everyday.

For many people in recovery from eating disorders, a crucial part of the recovery process is conquering fear foods. A fear food is pretty much what it sounds like, a food that someone is afraid of. Someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced an eating disorder, might think, ‚ÄúHow could someone be afraid of a food?‚Äù but the anxiety is very real for those living with eating disorders.

Fear foods typically trigger intense guilt and shame for people in eating disorder recovery. Even just the prospect of eating a fear food can cause a spike in anxiety. For some people, fear foods are specific foods, like ice cream or pizza, and for other people, fear foods are entire categories of food, like fats or carbohydrates.

After over a year in recovery, I‚Äôm in a pretty strong place. However, I still struggle with food guilt, and I still have some fear foods. One of the food categories that gives me the most anxiety is fast food.

I‚Äôm gluten intolerant, and most fast food restaurants don‚Äôt have gluten free options, so for most of my eating disorder and the beginnings of my recovery, I had a convenient ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù for avoiding fast food. This past summer, Shake Shack started carrying gluten free buns, so that excuse was no longer valid.

Over the summer, I ate at Shake Shack a few times, however, the anxiety surrounding fast food has still stuck around. Something I‚Äôve learned in my recovery is that challenging a fear once doesn‚Äôt mean it will automatically stop being a fear. Fears, especially fear foods, have to be challenged until they‚Äôre normalized, until they‚Äôre able to exist as a normal part of your life.

So, when my new friend Sammi, who I met through the eating disorder recovery community on Instagram, wanted to meet up for lunch earlier this week, I decided that once again challenging my fear of Shake Shack would be fitting.

As I walked from the subway to the restaurant, I could already feel my anxiety brewing. While practicing some deep breathing, I opened the door and found Sammi. We got in line to order our food, and my anxiety increased.

Several thoughts were running around in my head from, ‚ÄúEating that is bad‚Äù to ‚ÄúAre you really going to order that?‚Äù to ‚ÄúDo you think you need that much food?‚Äù Those disordered thoughts, coupled with the triggers I‚Äôve been feeling lately due to New Year‚Äôs diet talk made me scared to order what I really wanted, not what my eating disorder wanted.

However, I decided to find the strength to push past that fear, and instead do the opposite of what my brain was telling me. As the cashier called me up to order, I asked for a double bacon cheeseburger on a gluten free bun with a chocolate shake. For most people, the act of ordering the food they want seems trivial, but for me, it was a huge win.

One of the hardest things about conquering fear foods is that it really isn‚Äôt even about the food. Eating the food is the easiest part. It‚Äôs about the feelings around the food. It‚Äôs about the unshakeable anxiety that latches onto you and makes you believe that the food is the enemy. It‚Äôs about realizing that controlling your food intake isn‚Äôt going to solve anything, and it will actually make you feel worse. It‚Äôs about letting go of dangerous coping mechanisms that you‚Äôve been using for years. It‚Äôs about digging deeper and realizing that while you may truly be afraid of that particular food, the fear runs much deeper than the act of eating.

As Sammi and I shared our recovery stories with each other, we simultaneously ate our burgers, and I realized that I wasn‚Äôt even feeling the immense anxiety I had felt just 10 minutes before. Just the simple act of sharing a meal with someone who has experienced the same struggles was enough to ease my fear, and provide the kind of support that I needed to challenge my fear.

When I bit into my juicy burger, I was able to enjoy my meal and appreciate the taste of the salty cheese and savory bacon, instead of solely feeling guilt and anxiety. I found love for the feeling of the melty cheese coating my tongue. While I drank my shake, I paid attention to how amazing the thick, cold, sweet drink made my taste buds feel, instead of trying to calculate calories in my head. I was actively choosing to fight my fears effectively, rather than giving in to the deadly disorder that ruled my life and stole my happiness for far too long.

Something to note is that this one occasion of enjoying a burger and shake isn‚Äôt the end of that fear food, and while I didn‚Äôt experience negative feelings while I was eating, I did experience some guilt and shame once I got home. When these feelings have been ingrained in your brain for over a decade, it takes more than a few instances of challenging them to eliminate the anxiety. The difference is that now, instead of reverting to old, disordered behaviors, I choose to use more effective coping skills like making art and allowing myself to experience the feelings, as opposed to pushing them away.

Each instance of choosing to use healthy coping skills over giving into my unhealthy urges brings me one moment closer to kicking my eating disorder to the curb for good. While I still have a lot of work to do in recovery, enjoying this meal was an awesome step. Here‚Äôs to continuing to fight my fears, redefining my thoughts about my body, and regaining my life, one bite at a time.President Donald Trump is a racist. This is a straightforward statement of fact. It was true in 1973, when the Justice Department sued the company run by him and his father for discriminating against black potential tenants; and it was true in 1989, when Trump took out a racist ad in New York City newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in the case of the Central Park Five; and it was true on Thursday, when Trump referred to African nations and Haiti as ‚Äúshithole‚Äù countries and wondered why the U.S. couldn‚Äôt get more immigrants from countries like Norway.

But news organizations, whose nominal business is putting true things on the page, don‚Äôt like calling racist things racist. They prefer euphemism, distance, coyness. A racist slur becomes a ‚Äúracially tinged‚Äù or ‚Äúracially charged‚Äù remark, as if race itself were anything but the product of racism. One would think Trump is too oafish and explicit for the old damping genteelism of the media. One would be wrong. With a few notable exceptions ‚Äî CNN‚Äôs newscasts in particular, where Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper were refreshingly explicit ‚Äî the media fell back on its traditional circumlocutions.

A few examples from news stories that either didn‚Äôt use ‚Äúracist‚Äù at all or used it only when ascribing the characterization to someone else and not as a statement of fact:

The New York Times: ‚Äúdisparaging,‚Äù ‚Äúracially tinged,‚Äù ‚Äúvulgar.‚Äù

The Wall Street Journal: ‚Äúcrude remark,‚Äù ‚Äúvulgar comments.‚Äù

BuzzFeed: ‚Äúdistasteful,‚Äù ‚Äúthe statement,‚Äù ‚Äúintense criticism that his remarks were racist,‚Äù ‚Äúderogatory.‚Äù

AdvertisementWhen an internet commenter told Janice Dean not to show her legs on air because they were ‚Äútoo fat,‚Äù the Fox News meteorologist refused to let anyone rain on her parade.

A woman named ‚ÄúJoAnn‚Äù posted a message on Dean‚Äôs Facebook page asking the weather woman to ‚Äùstop allowing Fox to dress you in those short skirts. They are not flattering on you.‚Äù

The commenter added that she loved Dean‚Äôs ‚Äô80s-style hair, but ‚Äúyour legs are distracting every time you walk on screen.‚Äù

The 47-year-old Dean has been with Fox News since 2004 and said she usually ignores abusive comments like this. But something about this one struck a nerve.

‚ÄúIt got my back up, if there is one way to put it,‚Äù she told Inside Edition. ‚ÄúMaybe because it touched a part of me that has always been insecure about a certain body part.‚Äù

Dean responded to the commenter on Monday, in a manner more politely than most people would:

Hi JoAnn, Fox doesn‚Äôt dress me. I dress myself. I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt like my legs. I‚Äôm grateful I have them to walk with. You‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt look like the typical person on TV, and I‚Äôm proud to be a size 10. Imagine that! You can always turn the channel if you‚Äôre offended by my huge legs. Hope you don‚Äôt mind. I may share your post with everyone on my FB page. All the best, Janice

In a column for the Fox News website, Dean also explained why the critique hurt her feelings.

‚ÄúI have had Multiple sclerosis (MS) for more than 10 years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄùMy big legs have always been a sore spot for me ‚Äï but now more than ever I am proud of them. Because with MS, I could lose my ability to walk literally any day. So I‚Äôve learned to be proud of my legs, and am grateful for them every day of my life.‚Äù

Although Dean admits she‚Äôs ‚Äúalways been conscious about what body part I‚Äôd like to change,‚Äù she hopes to send a message to the next generation of women.

Actor Rob Lowe isn‚Äôt having it.

After actress Bella Thorne complained about the closure of a Southern California freeway in the wake of massive mudslides that killed at least 17 people, Lowe let loose, telling Thorne her ‚Äúattitude is why people hate celebrities.‚Äù

Thorne, who starred in the TV series ‚ÄúMy Own Worst Enemy,‚Äù tweeted her gripe about the U.S. Highway 101 closure on Wednesday. Miles of the freeway were shut down as crews worked to clear mud and other debris that swept through the Montecito area of Santa Barbara County on Tuesday. Seventeen people, including three children, were killed, and as many as 43 others were missing.

‚ÄúFuck u 101 to santa barbra [sic]. I‚Äôm missing my boyfriends first date on his tour:(((‚Äù the 20-year-old actress wrote in a tweet she later deleted.

Lowe posted a screenshot of Thorne‚Äôs tweet to his Instagram account. In the caption, he wrote:

‚ÄúThis attitude is why people hate celebrities/Hollywood. Bella, I‚Äôm sorry you were inconvenienced. We will try to move out our dead quicker.‚Äù

A post shared by Rob Lowe (@robloweofficial) on Jan 11, 2018 at 2:23pm PST

Thorne seemed to tune in to reality on Thursday, tweeting:

‚ÄúFuck just caught up on some news had no idea why the 101 was shut down...get home to your family safe.‚Äù

Fuck just caught up on some news had no idea why the 101 was shut down...get home to your family safe ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äî bella thorne (@bellathorne) January 11, 2018

Lowe said on Instagram Thursday that some of his friends are among the missing.

‚ÄúMore terrible stories of loss today. Friends missing, some gone forever. Pray for Montecito and know: EVERY day could be your last. Embrace that,‚Äù he wrote.

Advertisement‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù the president asked, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the exchange.

New York, she replied.

Trump was unsatisfied and asked again, the officials said. Referring to the president‚Äôs hometown, she offered that she, too, was from Manhattan. But that‚Äôs not what the president was after.

He wanted to know where ‚Äúyour people‚Äù are from, according to the officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the nature of the internal discussions.

After the analyst revealed that her parents are Korean, Trump turned to an adviser in the room and seemed to suggest her ethnicity should determine her career path, asking why the ‚Äúpretty Korean lady‚Äù isn‚Äôt negotiating with North Korea on his administration‚Äôs behalf, the officials said.The New Yorker is taking on President Donald Trump after he asked why the U.S. would welcome immigrants from ‚Äúshithole‚Äù places like Haiti and African countries during a bipartisan Oval Office meeting on Thursday.

‚ÄúIn the Hole,‚Äù by artist Anthony Russo, responds to the president‚Äôs comment, which has been decried as racist by the United Nations, with a stark illustration for the magazine‚Äôs cover in its Jan. 22 issue.

On Thursday, Trump sparked widespread criticism after he reportedly questioned why the U.S. should restore protections for immigrants from Haiti and parts of Africa.

‚ÄúWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?‚Äù the president said, sources told The Washington Post. ‚ÄúWe should have more people from places like Norway,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúHe said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,‚Äù Durbin said.

The White House did not deny the president‚Äôs phrasing in a statement issued Thursday. Trump strongly denied the derogatory remark against Haiti over Twitter the next day, but neither he nor the White House mentioned his attitude toward African nations.

Lawmakers were in the Oval Office to discuss a plan to help ‚ÄúDreamers,‚Äù the undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children who are nicknamed after the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that protected them from deportation.

Each week, LGBT HealthLink, a program of CenterLink, and researcher and blogger Corey Prachniak-Rinc√≥n bring you a round-up of some of the biggest LGBTQ wellness stories from the past seven days. For more LGBTQ Wellness, visit a page dedicated to the topic here.

Patients Okay Being Asked LGBT Status

Researchers called for better data collection on LGBT people receiving medical care to help fill gaps in our knowledge on health disparities and provide better care. The authors refute common provider concerns about patients being offended by being asked their sexual orientation or gender identity, pointing to myriad studies that have shown patients do not mind being asked.

Advancing Queer Visibility in Public Health

LGBT HealthLink reported on the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association in Atlanta, where the theme was ‚ÄúClimate Changes Health.‚Äù While the sessions on LGBT health disparities were very well attended, the article recommends increasing their visibility at this and other public health conferences, to combat the marginalization the community still faces.

Sexual Fluidity and Mental Health

Researchers found that fluidity of sexual orientation identity was associated with negative mental health outcomes in transgender men and cisgender women, and was associated with more problems that fluidity in sexual attractions. Additionally, transgender men were more likely than cisgender people to experience such fluidity in sexual orientation identity, putting them at risk.

Birth Certificate Changes Prove Popular

Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that transgender people in Oregon are already using a law that took effect on January 2nd that makes it easier to change one‚Äôs gender marker on their birth certificate. A transgender woman who updated her certificate noted the need to have it match her true gender to be able to access insurance, gain employment, and avoid discrimination.

Skyping Your Way to Safer Sex

A Seattle-based study tested using telehealth (such as meeting a physician by videoconference) to administer PrEP, the HIV prevention treatment, and found such a system to be a feasible and promising means of increasing uptake of PrEP in hard-to-reach communities. Researchers also found that more work was needed to ensure patients are not lost during follow-up.

State Officials: LGBT Folks a Priority Population

The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials released an infographic on how states should be tackling tobacco-related disparities. One of their recommendations: identifying LGBT people (along with people of color and others) as priority populations. The infographic shows the need to tailor interventions and integrate them with services accessible by those populations.

How Harassment Impacts Health

Researchers found that LGBT students in California were more likely to smoke, ‚Äúvape,‚Äù and drink than were their non-LGBT peers; moreover, gender- or sexuality-based harassment was associated with higher odds of using these substances. The results suggest that reducing LGBT-related harassment in schools could help reduce smoking and drinking disparities.

Palm Springs Welcomes All-LGBT Council

The Guardian reported on the country‚Äôs first all-LGBT government, as the city of Palm Springs seats its new Council in which all members identify as members of the LGBT community. The new councilmembers said that their identities were not even an issue in the queer-friendly city; instead, they focused their campaigns on key topics like homelessness and policing.

Chronic Disease and Sexual Orientation

A study examined chronic disease disparities among sexual minorities and found that how sexual orientation was measured (like by behavior versus how one self-identifies) was an important factor in making sure all the disparities were discovered. They found disparities in areas like asthma, arthritis, and chronic bronchitis among certain subgroups of queer men and women.

Gaps Found in Homelessness Research

A study reviewed research on homelessness among LGBT adults and found that many cities that perform ‚Äúcounts‚Äù of the number of people experiencing homelessness do not ask about sexual orientation (much less gender identity); surveys may also undercount LGBT people who want to remain hidden from services and services, out of fear of discrimination. The study also explores the causes and potential solutions to LGBT homelessness disparities.

Exploring Queer, Trans, and Latinx Identities

Wear Your Voice published an essay on ‚Äúwhat it means to be a queer and trans person in a Latinx family,‚Äù such as the psychological toll that coming out can entail and the risk queer youth face of ending up homeless. The author shares suggestions for what individuals and families can do to make for more welcoming and safe environments for LGBT kids.

In October, writer Moira Donegan created a Google doc. This particular document, a spreadsheet made after the first wave of public allegations against Harvey Weinstein hit, allowed women in media and publishing to anonymously record allegations of ‚Äúshittiness‚Äù against men in their industries. The list was live for only a few hours, but in that time more than 70 men were named, alongside descriptions of misconduct that ranged from sending creepy messages to committing multiple violent assaults.

The ‚ÄúShitty Media Men‚Äù list was endlessly dissected over the following weeks. Who started it? Who participated in it? Was it irresponsible? Were the allegations listed even true? Was the list itself indicative of a brewing witch hunt? Was the reaction to the list indicative of a coming backlash? We became so preoccupied with the sheer existence of the list that we downplayed what its mounting cache of claims revealed: that the media industry has a pretty serious sexual harassment problem.

This week, this ‚ÄúShitty Media Men‚Äù debate took a turn when it became widely rumored that Harper‚Äôs Magazine was planning to name the creator of the list in a cover story written by controversial author Katie Roiphe. So, despite fears for her own safety and an ‚ÄúI am Spartacus‚Äù movement started by other women on the internet to protect her identity, Donegan decided to out herself in a piece for The Cut.

In October, I made a google document. My life has been strange and sometimes frightening ever since. I wrote about it for @TheCut. https://t.co/wj8vkvawL4 ‚Äî Moira Donegan (@MoiraDonegan) January 11, 2018

The resulting essay is a beautifully constructed explanation of not only when the spreadsheet was conceived of and how startlingly fast it spread, but also of why Donegan created it in the first place.

‚ÄúThe hope was to create an alternate avenue to report this kind of behavior and warn others without fear of retaliation,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúToo often, for someone looking to report an incident or to make habitual behavior stop, all the available options are bad ones.‚Äù

It‚Äôs this point that is perhaps most salient; something that has been lost in our collective rush to talk about the document and the identity of the young woman behind it, rather than the forces that drove her to create it. The story of the ‚ÄúShitty Media Men‚Äù list has been cast as a narrative about one radical act carried out by one radical young woman. In reality, it‚Äôs a story about broken systems and structures ‚Äï ones that have failed the most vulnerable among us so frequently that individuals feel they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.

The structural problems media companies face are diffuse. Employees often aren‚Äôt empowered to report incidents of harassment to their managers without fear of retaliation, and managers often aren‚Äôt empowered to elevate the issue if it is reported to them. Companies may fail to lay out clear zero-tolerance policies. Human resources departments, if they exist at all, are tasked with protecting employees while simultaneously protecting their company from liability ‚Äï tasks that can be at odds. Underlying it all is a deeply rooted history of sexism, built into the very foundation of the industry.

As author Rebecca Traister put it, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúrot at the core of our power structures that makes it harder for women to do work because the whole thing is tipped toward men.‚Äù

This rot exists in non-media industries as well. Broadly speaking, when women (and gender nonconforming people and men) experience harassment or assault in a professional setting, the channels for recourse are limited and often unappealing. This helps explain why the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) predicts that 75 percent of workplace harassment incidents are never reported.

Going to your company‚Äôs HR department ‚Äï or, in some cases, to the police ‚Äï often requires a painstaking and detailed reliving of your initial trauma. Your story is guaranteed to be poked and prodded and picked apart in ways that can be deeply painful. In situations that involve potential criminal charges and life-altering consequences, this makes sense ‚Äï but it is deeply painful all the same. If you‚Äôre a woman, you might also face familiar questions, all meant to hold your narrative up to an imaginary model of perfect victimhood: What were you wearing? How forcefully did you say no? Are you sure he meant it that way? Were you drinking? Did you agree to be alone with him in that office? In that room? In that bar? Did you communicate with him after the incident? Why did you send that email? Why did you send that tweet? Why did you text that emoji?

And after all of this is done, it‚Äôs quite possible that the person you say has harassed or assaulted you will face few consequences. You might face some form of retaliation, as 75 percent of people who spoke up about workplace misconduct said they did in a 2003 EEOC study, or you may simply be left to work alongside your alleged harasser until you decide to leave your job.

Look no further than the recent reporting on Vice to find a glaring example in the media industry of how HR can spectacularly fail in its role as employee advocate. ‚ÄúAs women, we get harassed everywhere and we don‚Äôt feel compelled to report it because it‚Äôs not considered a reportable offense,‚Äù said one former employee, who was told that she would continue to face sexual harassment in her career ‚Äúbecause she was an attractive woman.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre expected to put up with it; it‚Äôs the cost of doing business.‚Äù It is an irony not lost on those of us in the industry that even as media companies publish reporting on this reckoning, they have often failed to create a safe environment for their own employees.

In the weeks after the ‚ÄúShitty Media Men‚Äù list began circulating, I began speaking to women who worked for companies that had HR departments ‚Äï women who reported their alleged harassment through the proper channels and ended up feeling utterly failed by their workplaces. Like the then 27-year-old research assistant whose boss regularly commented on her appearance and said he never would have hired her if he had known she wore glasses so much. She was told by HR that her boss was just ‚Äútrying to help‚Äù her. Or the then 23-year-old basketball coach who told me that her colleagues and supervisor would touch her and openly talk about ‚Äúwhat they wanted to do to‚Äù her, but was told by HR that it was simply a ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù situation. Both of these women ended up leaving their jobs and changing career paths. They are far from unique.

Once you‚Äôve lived through one failed attempt at reporting sexual misconduct, you‚Äôre unlikely to even try to report similar incidents in the future. It‚Äôs this assumption of inaction that creates whisper networks ‚Äï those word-of-mouth chains by which women warn each other off shitty men.

‚ÄúWe needed the 'Shitty Media Men' list for a straightforward reason: There are a lot of shitty men in media and few effective ways to avoid them.‚Äù

Donegan took a ‚Äúwhisper network‚Äù and made it concrete, widening its access and laying it bare. Media power brokers ‚Äï top editors, influential reporters ‚Äï didn‚Äôt take notice when women shared stories about the predatory colleagues that they encountered at happy hours and in offices and on Twitter. Their whispers were quiet and invisible, as whispers are. When those whispers were written down, even in a forum that explicitly labeled them as rumors and (by Donegan‚Äôs account, intentionally) ‚Äúhad no enforcement mechanisms‚Äù by which to levy consequences, the powerful finally took notice. After all, typing is louder than whispering.

The weekend after the ‚ÄúShitty Media Men‚Äù list was published, I sat in a room of women and talked about it. One woman, a writer I admire, compared the list to emergency medical care. If a patient is in danger of bleeding out, a medical team will do whatever it can to stop it. The work is messy and often imperfect, and sometimes there are losses. But it‚Äôs necessary.

Perhaps that‚Äôs where we are in this reckoning ‚Äï doing the imperfect, messy work of trying to stop bleeding that‚Äôs been going on for decades.Democrats were quick to denounce President Donald Trump after reports that he referred to Haiti and some African nations as ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù while discussing immigration reform with lawmakers at the White House.

Most Republicans, on the other hand, were notably silent on the president‚Äôs shockingly vulgar remark, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and GOP chair Ronna McDaniel.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called Trump‚Äôs comments ‚Äúvery unfortunate‚Äù and Sen. Marco Rubio posted a long Twitter thread about the many ways Haitians have made an impact in the U.S.

But by Friday morning, long after Trump reportedly asked, ‚ÄúWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here,‚Äù most GOP lawmakers had still not said anything publicly about the president‚Äôs racially charged remark. He was said to have made the comment when lawmakers pressed to restore protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and multiple African nations.

In a series of early morning tweets, Trump denied using such language, while continuing to denigrate some nations. But Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ‚Äï who was in the room at the time ‚Äï swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact ‚Äúsaid these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.‚Äù

Under the immigration plan being discussed, the U.S. ‚Äúwould be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly,‚Äù Trump tweeted. He added that ‚Äúlanguage used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used.‚Äù

At least one GOP congressman even used the moment to attack Democrats. ‚ÄúThe rhetoric coming from leaders in both parties does nothing to advance the kind of reforms that are best for America,‚Äù Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) tweeted on Thursday, without specifying what was said by Democrats that was as offensive as Trump‚Äôs remarks. HuffPost‚Äôs requests for comment from Davis‚Äô office were not returned.

Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.), who both attended Thursday‚Äôs meeting, said in a joint statement Friday that they didn‚Äôt recall Trump ‚Äúsaying these comments specifically.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest,‚Äù they said.

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) ‚Äî who also attended the meeting ‚Äî confirmed that reporting of Trump‚Äôs remarks was ‚Äúbasically accurate.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe ought not to disparage any other nation, frankly,‚Äù Scott told The Post and Courier newspaper on Friday. ‚ÄúThinking about the success of America. It is the melting pot. It‚Äôs the ability to weave together multiple communities together for one nation.‚Äù

Here are the other Republicans who spoke out against Trump for his reported remark:

Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah)

Rep. Mia Love was one of the first Republicans in Congress to issue an official statement demanding the president apologize. Love made history in 2014, when she became the first Haitian-American woman and first black Republican woman elected to Congress.

‚ÄúThis behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation,‚Äù Love, whose parents immigrated from Haiti to the U.S., said in a statement Thursday.

‚ÄúMy parents came from one of those countries but proudly took the oath of allegiance to the United States and took on the responsibilities of everything that being a citizen comes with,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThey never took a thing from our federal government.‚Äù

Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.)

Rep. Carlos Curbelo took a softer approach, tweeting his support for individuals under temporary protected status and asking the White House to explain the context behind Trump‚Äôs comment.

The men and women who have status under the TPS program are among the most humble and hard working in our country. They improve quality of life in our communities and many Americans depend on them to support family life. ‚Äî Rep. Carlos Curbelo (@RepCurbelo) January 11, 2018

Under no circumstances is it acceptable to degrade, denigrate, or dehumanize #TPS immigrants. The White House must immediately explain the situation and leave no doubt regarding what was said and in what context. ‚Äî Rep. Carlos Curbelo (@RepCurbelo) January 11, 2018

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.)

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen took to her local media to air frustrations with Trump‚Äôs comments. She tweeted: ‚ÄúThe president calling #Haiti a ‚Äòshithole country‚Äô ignores the contributions thousands of Haitians made to our #SoFla community and nation.‚Äù

She later told CBS Miami that ‚Äúno country deserves to be called a ‚Äôshithole.‚Äù Speaking to WSVN 7 news, Ros-Lehtinen said that Trump ‚Äúneeds to understand that lives are at stake when he makes such reckless comments.‚Äù According to her tweets, she invoked an inscription on the Statue of Liberty: ‚Äù‚ÄòGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,‚Äô not ‚Äògo back to your shithole.‚Äô‚Äù

She told Univision 23 Miami, a Spanish-language news channel, that Trump‚Äôs comments on Haiti ‚Äúdo not reflect our country.‚Äù

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)

Without denouncing Trump‚Äôs insult, Sen. Orrin Hatch called for the White House to explain what Trump meant with his remark.

HATCH: ‚ÄúI look forward to getting a more detailed explanation regarding the President‚Äôs comments. Part of what makes America so special is that we welcome the best and brightest in the world, regardless of their country of origin.‚Äù #utpol ‚Äî Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) January 11, 2018

Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.)

Rep. Mike Coffman issued a statement late Thursday celebrating the accomplishments of Colorado‚Äôs diverse immigrant communities, ‚Äúfrom El Salvador to Ethiopia.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe President could learn a thing or two from them,‚Äù Coffman said.

Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.)

Rep. Erik Paulsen called Trump‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúcompletely inappropriate‚Äù and said the White House should issue an apology.

It is completely inappropriate for the President to refer to other countries in the manner in which he reportedly did, especially given the circumstances and disasters that led many TPS immigrants to seek refuge and shelter in the US ‚Äî Rep. Erik Paulsen (@RepErikPaulsen) January 12, 2018

The White House didn‚Äôt deny Trump‚Äôs remark. Instead, the administration said in a statement that Trump is focused on ‚ÄúAmerican people.‚Äù

‚ÄúCertain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,‚Äù White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement, according to CBS News.

The president ‚Äúwill always reject temporary, weak and dangerous stopgap measures that threaten the lives of hardworking Americans, and undercut immigrants who seek a better life in the United States through a legal pathway,‚Äù Shah added.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)

Sen. Jeff Flake on Friday tweeted his displeasure with Trump‚Äôs choice of words.

The words used by the President, as related to me directly following the meeting by those in attendance, were not ‚Äútough,‚Äù they were abhorrent and repulsive. ‚Äî Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) January 12, 2018

Though the president may have been trying to be ‚Äútough,‚Äù his comment was instead ‚Äúabhorrent and repulsive,‚Äù Flake said.

Former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele

Michael Steele, a conservative pundit who frequently appears on cable news, harshly rebuked Trump on Friday, saying the ‚Äúevidence is incontrovertible‚Äù that the president is racist.

Fmr. RNC chair Michael Steele says Trump is racist.



‚ÄúYeah, I do. At this point the evidence is incontrovertible. It‚Äôs right there."pic.twitter.com/fpqZnO5xvb ‚Äî JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) January 12, 2018

‚ÄúThere are a whole lot of folks like Donald Trump,‚Äù Steele said on MSNBC. ‚ÄúWhite folks in this country who have a problem with the browning of America. When they talk about [wanting] their country back, they are talking about a country that was very safely white, less brown and less committed to that browning process.‚Äù

This article has been updated to include additional Republicans commenting on Trump‚Äôs remarks, and Durbin‚Äôs assertion that Trump used those specific words.
