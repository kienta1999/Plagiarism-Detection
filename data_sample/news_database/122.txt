The lead singer of Imagine Dragons made a very visible plea for LGBTQ equality this weekend when he waved a rainbow flag during a concert in Brazil.

Dan Reynolds offered the inclusive gesture as he and his bandmates were performing at the Lollapalooza Brazil festival in São Paulo on Saturday. At one point during the performance, he draped the flag across his bare chest.

Images of Reynolds’ pro-LGBTQ statement were captured for posterity on social media.

On Tuesday, Reynolds shared a photo of himself holding the flag on Twitter, along with a poignant message asking fans to “fully embrace and support” LGBTQ people.

celebrate our diversity. embrace our LGBTQ youth. to “accept” does not simply mean to “love” - it means you give true validity and fully embrace and support diverse sexual orientations and do not see ones sexuality as “incorrect” or “sinful”. love is an empty word otherwise. pic.twitter.com/ACaIZyNrX0 — Dan Reynolds (@DanReynolds) March 28, 2018

Reynolds’ decision to speak out in defense of LGBTQ rights in Brazil was fitting. While São Paulo boasts what is believed to be the world’s largest annual Pride celebration and same-sex marriage is legal in Brazil, queer people still face widespread discrimination across the nation.

In January, local advocates Grupo Gay de Bahia published new research finding that at least 445 Brazilians died as victims of anti-LGBTQ crimes in 2017, a 30 percent increase over the previous year.

Reynolds, who identifies as straight, has emerged as an outspoken advocate of LGBTQ rights in recent years. Last year, the co-writer of some of Imagine Dragons’ biggest hits, including “Radioactive” and “Demons,” was honored with the Trevor Project’s Hero Award for his advocacy work on behalf of the queer community.

The 30-year-old Las Vegas native is profiled in a forthcoming HBO documentary, “Believer,” which explores his efforts to reconcile his support of LGBTQ causes with his Mormon upbringing.

“Even though my faith isn’t always the strongest and my beliefs are more of my own, the world typically thinks of me as a Mormon, so I feel like I’m an activist for bigotry in some way,” he told Billboard in 2017. “One of those ways is that Mormons believe the doctrine is if you are gay and acting upon it, that is sinful. That is a very dangerous and hurtful and hateful thing to preach and to teach our children.”President Donald Trump’s TV star-run administration has hired former Disney Channel actress Caroline Sunshine as a White House press assistant.

Sunshine, 22, is best known for a role with Zendaya in the Disney series “Shake It Up,” which followed the lives of teenage backup dancers during its run from 2010 to 2013.

That Trump’s White House would hire another staffer with TV experience isn’t surprising. The president, who spent years as a reality TV star, recently named John Bolton ― former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. turned Fox News analyst ― as his new national security adviser.

Still, many people on social media had comments about Sunshine’s appointment:

In a sign the White House’s hard-line stance against climate science may be shifting public debate, independent voters have grown more doubtful of scientists’ warnings about climate change over the past year, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.

Between 2017 and 2018, the percentage of independents who understand greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change fell 8 percentage points to 62 percent, while the share of those who believe the effects of global warming have already begun dipped 7 points to 60 percent.

Sixty-five percent understand that most scientists believe global warming is occurring, down from 71 percent in 2017.

Fewer respondents said they worry a great deal or a fair amount about global warming, down 5 points from last year to 62 percent. But the 45 percent who said global warming poses a serious threat in their lifetimes stayed steady between 2017 and 2018.

Public opinion has seesawed slightly over the years, but the long-term trend is overwhelmingly toward the scientific consensus that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans understand that scientific evidence shows the Earth’s temperatures rising, and 64 percent acknowledge that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are the cause.

The results echo 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication, which found 69 percent know global warming is happening and 52 percent understand humans are triggering it.

A partisan breakdown of the Gallup results. Gallup

Still, the shift, recorded during a week of telephone surveys earlier this month of 1,041 adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, mirrors surging climate denialism among Republicans. Just 35 percent of Republicans understand that humans cause global warming, down from 40 percent in 2017, while 34 percent said the effects of climate change have already started, 7 points less than the previous year.

The findings come just months after historic hurricanes wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas, and California’s largest wildfire on record killed 18 people and scorched more than 280,000 acres of land. Yet the disasters, which scientists said were made worse by warming global temperatures, seem to have stoked further debate over the causes of climate change and the policies to address it.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly mocked climate science over the past year, suggesting winter weather disproved long-term warming trends, as his administration gutted funding for climate programs and slashed the few regulations in place to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican Party, the only major political party in the developed world to make rejecting climate science a platform issue, has doubled down on the issue as megadonors such as the fossil fuel magnate Koch brothers and the right-wing billionaire Mercers have increased their political spending.

A chart from Gallup shows the overall upward trend in public understanding of climate change. Gallup

The political debate over climate change, propagated by years of Big Tobacco-style misinformation campaigns funded by the fossil fuel industry, does not mirror the scientific debate. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that human-caused emissions are enshrouding the planet in heat-trapping gases, and a research review published in November 2016 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.

Perhaps in part because Trump has proved such an agitational avatar for climate denialism, Democrats’ political opinions on global warming trended overwhelmingly toward the scientific consensus. Just 4 percent believed warnings of global warming have been exaggerated, down from 10 percent in 2017. The number of Democrats who said humans caused global warming inched up 2 points to 89 percent, and 82 percent said the effects of climate change have already begun, up from 73 percent the previous year. The share of Democrats who said most scientists believe global warming is occurring stayed steady at 86 percent.

That suggests Democrats could run on much more aggressive climate policies, particularly in primary battles. The party, however, has failed to rally around a national strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The two most significant pieces of climate legislation introduced in Congress this year have embraced conservative approaches and gave exemptions to major polluters. Even in liberal states under Democratic control, climate policy has proved hard to pass, as the failure of Washington state’s proposed statewide carbon tax showed.Count Oscar-winning screenwriter James Ivory among those dissatisfied with the lack of male nudity in “Call Me by Your Name.”

Ivory discusses his original screenplay for the acclaimed romantic drama, which was based on André Aciman’s 2007 novel, in a lengthy interview in The Guardian. In it, he seemed to agree with a number of critics who called out the film for presenting a sanitized version of a same-sex relationship.

The screenwriter, who is openly gay, told The Guardian’s Ryan Gilbey that his script called for Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) to appear naked. Both Chalamet and Hammer had no-frontal-nudity clauses written into their contracts, however, which overruled Ivory’s original specifications.

Still, he reserved his criticisms for director Luca Guadagnino, who has said that explicit nudity was “absolutely irrelevant” to his vision for the film.

“When Luca says he never thought of putting nudity in, that is totally untrue,” Ivory said Tuesday. “He sat in this very room where I am sitting now, talking about how he would do it, so when he says that it was a conscious aesthetic decision not to ― well, that’s just bullshit.”

“When people are wandering around before or after making love, and they’re decorously covered with sheets, it’s always seemed phony to me,” he added. “I never liked doing that. And I don’t do it, as you know.”

He went on to compare “Call Me by Your Name” unfavorably to 1987′s “Maurice,” which he directed. Based on E.M. Forster’s posthumously published novel, the movie starred Rupert Graves and James Wilby as gay lovers in early 20th century England.

After one of the film’s love scenes, Ivory said, Graves and Wilby “get up and you certainly see everything there is to be seen. To me, that’s a more natural way of doing things than to hide them, or to do what Luca did, which is to pan the camera out of the window toward some trees. Well…”

While Ivory took home the Oscar for Adapted Screenplay for his “Call Me by Your Name” script last month, he’s been outspoken about his frustrations with the film’s lack of nudity on more than one occasion.

In October, he blamed the movie’s modesty on the “American attitude” of its stars and creators in an interview with Variety.

“Nobody seems to care that much, or be shocked, about a totally naked woman. It’s the men,” he said. “This is something that must be so deeply cultural that one should ask: ‘Why?’”John Oliver takes addiction seriously, but the industry offering to cure it is a joke, he said on “Last Week Tonight” Sunday.

The HBO host called the $35 billion rehab business “dangerously unregulated,” cracking that even O.J. Simpson could open a sober-living facility “which would obviously be called the Juice Cleanse.”

One absurdity that stood out to Oliver is the high profits reportedly reaped from centers conducting urine tests ― which led The New York Times to deem urine “liquid gold.”

“Peeing liquid gold sounds like the symptom of an STD you can only contract from fucking C-3PO,” Oliver said.Conservative pundit and HLN host S.E. Cupp urged first lady Melania Trump on Tuesday to leave her husband for the humiliation she’s had to endure as women come forward alleging they’ve had affairs with President Donald Trump.

Earlier this week, adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, provided details of her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump in a highly anticipated interview with “60 Minutes.” Daniels is currently suing the president over the validity of a nondisclosure agreement she says she was bullied into signing to conceal their relationship. Ex-Playboy playmate Karen McDougal has also come forward in recent weeks alleging she had an affair with Trump in 2006.

The affairs, which the president denies, allegedly occurred when Melania was pregnant and after she gave birth to their son, Barron.

During her show, Cupp likened Melania’s current situation to the one former Democratic presidential nominee and first lady Hillary Clinton dealt with during the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton’s alleged infidelities were making headlines.

“While feminists trotted [Hillary Clinton] out as a role model for strong women, all I saw was a woman who was humiliated time and again,” Cupp said of Clinton’s decision not to leave her husband.

“Melania may not have a political career to consider, but as first lady, she is an inherently important figure in American politics, and women are watching ― particularly young women,” Cupp continued. “Melania should do for this generation of girls what Hillary Clinton did not do for mine and leave her jerk of a husband.”

Offred is pretty busy in the second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

Hulu released a new trailer for its hit series Wednesday afternoon and the minute-and-a-half clip reveals a lot about what’s to come for our favorite characters. The trailer begins with Offred (Elisabeth Moss) sitting in the back of a truck, thinking to herself: “Is this what freedom looks like? What will happen when I get out? There probably is no out. Gilead is within you.”

It looks as though Offred has escaped the grips of Commander Fred (Joseph Fiennes) and his evil wife, Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), possibly with the help of her lover, Nick (Max Minghella).

If that wasn’t enough of a plot twist, the trailer is a mashup of scenes including Ofglen (Alexis Bedel) working in a chemical wasteland and Moira (Samira Wiley) rioting presumably somewhere in Canada where she took refuge last season.

(I bet there are more real people in this picture, than in the NRA.) pic.twitter.com/8rYLZLX2SKA new documentary is exploring a period in Martin Luther King Jr.’s life that seldom gets attention: his final three years.

“King in the Wilderness,” directed by Peter Kunhardt, highlights the acute struggle and opposition the civil rights icon faced when the energy from his famed “I Have A Dream” speech settled and he began to expand his message of peace and nonviolence beyond the Southern states.

In an exclusive clip from the documentary, which premieres on HBO on April 2 at 8 p.m. EST, Andrew Young, former executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, talks about King facing the complex issues that plagued African-Americans in Western and Northern states, and how different they were than in the South.

“The issues in Watts [Los Angeles] and in the North were far more complex than black and white as they had been in the South,” Young says in the clip. “He was dealing with racism, but he was dealing with racism that was complicated by unemployment and unprepared migrants moving from the South to the North. And I realize we were in a different movement.”

Cleveland Sellars, former program director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, also notes in the clip that though poverty, lack of job opportunity and police brutality existed in these areas, folks “responded with whatever weapons they could find.”

On Monday, before the film’s premiere at Riverside Church in New York City ― where King gave his controversial yet powerful speech condemning the Vietnam War in April 1967 ― author Charles Blow told HuffPost that black people residing outside of the South felt “left behind.”

“The progress of the last 10 years had been the Civil Rights Bill and the Voting Rights Bill,” Blow said. “It had helped the people in the South, but it had done nothing for the people in the North and West.”

“Imagine yourself in Chicago, living in a slum, and you see all of this activity in the South and all of a sudden, they get progress. And they’re starting, probably, from a further place behind, but you see they’re moving forward... and you see your oppression is not changing,” he said. “So there was a real kinda ― I think the actual success in the South helped to stir up the riots in the North, because it said ‘Where is our progress?’”“They didn’t have to kill him like that,” Thompson said. “They didn’t have to shoot him this many times. Why didn’t you just shoot him in the arm, shoot him in the leg, send the dogs, send a Taser. Why? Why? Y’all didn’t have to do that.”

Clark’s family has hired attorney Benjamin Crump to represent them. Crump has also represented the families of victims from other high-profile police shootings, including those of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.

Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin is the latest to depart President Donald Trump’s turbulent White House.

The president announced Shulkin’s termination in a post on Twitter on Wednesday and said he intends to replace him with Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, the presidential physician. Undersecretary of Defense Robert Wilkie will serve as acting director of the department until a new secretary is confirmed.

In a statement following the decision, Shulkin said Trump “should have a cabinet member that he is comfortable with.”

“I have worked to keep our nation’s Veterans first in everything I did,” he said. “I want you to know that I will always fight for you no matter where I go.”

I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2018

Trump appointed Shulkin in January 2017 despite previously signaling plans to completely shake up and overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Shulkin, a physician and former hospital executive, previously served in the Obama administration as the undersecretary of veterans affairs, and he experienced initial success running the agency with the support of veterans groups and bipartisan committees.

Shulkin was the subject of an investigation by his department’s inspector general in February and was found to have committed ethics violations on a trip to Europe last summer. His extravagant 10-day trip to London and Copenhagen was planned under the guise of business travel but included only 3½ working days while costing the VA at least $122,334, the report found.

Trump’s displeasure with Shulkin may have had more to do with the fact that the secretary had found himself increasingly at odds with conservative administration officials, who have long pushed for increased privatization of veterans’ health care options.

Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy, has been the White House physician since 2013 and served under three different presidents.

While he briefly came under fire in January for a controversial media briefing on Trump’s health, he has received widespread praise from White House staff in several administrations. Responding to the controversy, former advisers to President Barack Obama called Jackson a “phenomenal doctor” and a “saint and patriot.”

Trump himself has long touted Jackson’s ability and nominated him for a promotion just last week.

“Admiral Jackson is highly trained and qualified and as a service member himself, he has seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation for the debt our great country owes them,” Trump said in a statement announcing his nomination on Wednesday.

However, Jackson appears to have no significant management record. The White House provided reporters with background information about Jackson that touts his expertise in medicine, but there’s little to suggest that would be a likely nominee to run the sprawling Veterans Affairs Department ― a place known for bureaucratic mismanagement.

VoteVets, a progressive organization representing veterans affairs, said it was troubled with the lack of information surrounding Jackson’s ability to lead.

“Other than a total lack of awareness of where he stands on any issue, we are also concerned that he has never managed an agency like the VA,” Will Fischer, VoteVet’s director of government relations, said in a statement. “Now is not the time for people who need training wheels.”

A political moderate, Shulkin favored a more measured approach that involved introducing private care options only to offset long waiting times at veterans hospitals and only with the department’s approval.

Shulkin appeared to think that the investigation into his trip spending was an effort by opponents in the administration “to undermine the department from within.”

Shulkin is the latest in a string of departures from the Trump administration. On March 22, Trump announced by tweet that national security adviser H.R. McMaster would be replaced by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. According to a March 22 Politico report citing two top administration officials, the decision surprised White House chief of staff John Kelly, who had been preparing to ax McMaster at the same time as Carson and Shulkin.WICHITA, Kan. ― Three anti-Muslim militia members, on trial for plotting to slaughter Somali refugees in southwest Kansas, have adopted a defense strategy that could’ve been culled directly from President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed: suggesting that a biased FBI conspired against them in the lead-up to the 2016 election due to their political beliefs.

Curtis Allen, Patrick Stein and Gavin Wright are on trial in connection with their arrest in a FBI domestic terrorism sting just weeks before the 2016 election. Their defense attorneys, in turn, are putting the FBI on trial ― accusing the nation’s premier law enforcement agency of improperly targeting the three men due to their conservative ideology.

It’s common for defense attorneys to suggest their clients were wrongfully singled out by biased law enforcement officials. And to be sure, there’s nothing wrong with healthy skepticism about law enforcement and the FBI.

But the situation here is striking: A U.S. president has taken pains to undermine the FBI (declaring that the bureau’s reputation is “in Tatters—worst in History!”), and defense attorneys for accused terrorists are seeking to capitalize on that reality. This is happening as the president is trying to neuter a special counsel probe that’s already resulted in multiple charges against and guilty pleas from a variety of his associates. The government, meanwhile, will have to deal with jurors primed to believe a conspiracy theory fundamentally at odds with the facts ― namely, that the FBI is a hotbed of liberalism that worked behind the scenes to somehow try to stop Trump’s election.

Supporters of the FBI have long expressed concern about the effects of Trump’s attacks in federal courtrooms. Former Attorney General Eric Holder warned that the “long-term negative collateral consequences are substantial” and worried that Trump’s attacks on the FBI would sow doubts among jurors. Thomas O’Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association, told HuffPost that such attacks “clearly trickle down to the person, the agent, the analyst, the FBI employee on the street, in the field offices.”

The trickle-down effect was on display during jury selection and opening arguments in Wichita last week, as potential jurors echoed complaints about the FBI voiced by Trump and conservative media figures like Sean Hannity.

One potential juror expressed concerns about honesty and corruption at the top levels of the FBI. Another in the jury pool had concerns about former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe ― both Republicans ― and said he personally questioned the stability and integrity of the organization. A third person said he thinks many Americans are concerned about the decisions being made at the top of the FBI, and a fourth potential juror said he’d grown up wanting to be an FBI agent, but he now believes top bureau officials have engaged in wrongdoing. Yet another potential juror, a concealed carry supporter, said he held a negative view of the FBI due to recent events.

Those potential jurors with concerns about the FBI’s prior leadership said they would be able to distinguish between the bureau’s leadership and the work of the agents in the field. No prominent FBI detractors during jury selection made it into the final jury. But their airing of their views on the FBI illustrated a new challenge for federal prosecutors in the Trump era.



In most criminal trials, prosecutors would likely be happy to have conservatives on a jury, since they’re more likely to be strong supporters of law enforcement. But now, with fewer than one-third of Trump voters saying they have even a “fair amount” of trust in the FBI, conservative jurors are more of a gamble ― especially in a case that involves Islam, guns and immigration.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi, the Kansas-based federal prosecutor leading the case, told one set of jurors that “the FBI is kind of a hot-button issue right now” as he questioned jurors about their views on the bureau.

In opening arguments before a nearly all-white jury, defense attorneys argued that their clients were unfairly targeted by a biased FBI. Richard Federico, a federal public defender who previously represented Guantanamo detainees when he was a JAG Corps officer, skillfully weaved a narrative for jurors suggesting his client was a victim of a government conspiracy.

Federico said it was the FBI that plotted and conspired and targeted the defendants, hoping to make an example of them because of their political beliefs.

“Curtis Allen sits before you today because of what he thought, because of what he said, and because of who he associated with,” Federico said.

In a turn of phrase reminiscent of Trump, Federico said the defendants’ discussion of killing Muslim “cockroaches” amounted to “locker room talk.”

HuffPost will have continuing coverage of the trial from Wichita this week.

The magazine publisher is the latest high-profile name to announce it is quitting the social media platform in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Elon Musk, Will Ferrell and Cher have said in recent days they’re deactivating their Facebook accounts.

Cooper Hefner, the son of Playboy’s late founder Hugh Hefner and the company’s chief creative officer, said early Wednesday on Twitter that the publication was “stepping away” from Facebook:

We are stepping away from Facebook pic.twitter.com/4yFIdk2eDE — Cooper Hefner (@cooperhefner) March 28, 2018

Hefner said Facebook’s “content guidelines and corporate policies” contradict Playboy’s values, but the publication had “tried to craft” its voice for the platform, “which in our opinion continues to be sexually repressive.”

But after “learning of the recent meddling in a free U.S. election” involving data on Facebook users ― “more than 25 million of which are Playboy fans” ― Hefner said it was “clear to us that we must leave the platform.”

“Playboy has always stood for personal freedom and the celebration of sex,” Playboy Enterprises Inc. said in a further statement. “Today we take another step in that ongoing fight.” The company said it would be “deactivating the Playboy accounts that Playboy Enterprises manages directly.”

Playboy’s main verified Facebook account appeared to have been deleted as of early Wednesday. Other verified Playboy accounts — including those for Romania, Philippines, Germany, Mexico and Brazil — remained live.

Elon Musk pulled the official Facebook pages for his companies, SpaceX and Tesla, as well as his own personal page on Friday.

In a Facebook post Tuesday, comedy star Will Ferrell said he’d delete his account “in 72 hours” because he was “very disturbed to hear about Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of millions of Facebook users’ information in order to undermine our democracy and infringe on our citizens’ privacy.”

“In this day and age, with misinformation running rampant, it’s important that we protect the truth, as well as those who work to bring it to light,” Ferrell added. “I can no longer, in good conscience, use the services of a company that allowed the spread of propaganda and directly aimed it at those most vulnerable.”

ESPN’s Jemele Hill has just been named the recipient of the National Association of Black Journalists’ highest honor ― the 2018 Journalist of the Year.

In a statement released on Monday, NABJ praised Hill for addressing national, social and cultural issues on her platform, including racism, police brutality and the national anthem protests staged by scores of NFL players.

Hill was subjected to widespread backlash last year when she criticized President Donald Trump in a series of Twitter posts, including one that called him a “white supremacist.” In another, she termed him the “most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime.”

Hill, who was then co-hosting ESPN’s SportsCenter program at 6 p.m. ET, was reprimanded by the cable network. A short time later she was suspended for two weeks after a “second violation” of ESPN’s social media standards that involved tweets concerned Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones.

During that time, NABJ showed public support for Hill. Many celebrities and athletes also rallied to her side, using the hashtag #IStandWithJemele.

“It would be a serious understatement to call this recognition from NABJ special,” Hill said of her award. “This organization has been a second family for me, both personally and professionally.”

She said she was “humbled to be honored by an organization whose values not only match my own journalistically but has tirelessly dedicated itself to developing and nurturing journalists like me. This is the biggest accomplishment of my career.”

Hill is currently a commentator and columnist for ESPN’s The Undefeated.

“Jemele Hill is a gem. She exhibits strength, grace, and doggedness,” NABJ President Sarah Glover said. “NABJ appreciates the courage and steadfastness Jemele has demonstrated as a journalist and commentator speaking truth to power.”President Donald Trump’s struggle to find lawyers to represent him is well documented.

“Working knowledge of social media, especially Twitter is a plus, as is a better than average knowledge of the adult film industry and a collection of Playboy magazines from 1985-2010,” the ad notes.

“Prior appearances on Fox News” would also be “a huge plus.”

Applicants “must be prepared to work with a client who is very forceful and opinionated about his defense” and who “is his own best counsel,” the listing adds. “Basically your job boils down to keeping him from testifying under oath and hoping the rest comes out in the wash.”

It’s unclear who created the ad. They did not respond immediately to HuffPost’s request for comment. The listing has, however, been well-received on Twitter:

OMG! This Craigslist ad for Trump's new lead attorney is an example of epic trolling! 😂😂😂 https://t.co/YHN9YXrQqq — Eric Rosswood (@LGBT_Activist) March 27, 2018Republican Rep. Charlie Dent on Stormy Daniels scandal: The less President Trump says about it the better https://t.co/i3CzszGste https://t.co/VOCN8l4zW4 — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) March 28, 2018

A Republican lawmaker called out evangelical supporters of President Donald Trump who are turning a blind eye to the growing number of scandals coming out of the White House.

“I don’t know how many in the evangelical community can reconcile some of their positions at this moment,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Penn.) said Tuesday on CNN.

CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Dent what he thought would happen if “the shoe were on the other foot” and President Barack Obama was embroiled in a scandal similar to Trump’s alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels.

“They’d be waving a bloody shirt,” Dent said. “It’d be a human rights violation had it been the shoe on the other foot.”

He also said that if a Democratic president had been conciliatory toward Russia “as Republicans, we’d be screaming from morning to night.”

Dent then brought up his party’s response to Bill Clinton’s sex scandal in the 1990s.

“A lot of folks were pretty darn alarmed and outraged and had a strong voice about it, saying ‘character counts,’” he said. “Now that the shoe’s on the other foot, a lot of those same folks are pretty damn silent.”

Dent, one of a growing number of Republicans not seeking re-election in November, said the coming midterm vote will be a referendum on Trump and his conduct as president.

UPDATE: April 2 ― The Jones County School District superintendent said the school investigated the claims and could not find any evidence of the allegations.

Jones County School District Superintendent Tommy Parker told WDAM TV that it appears the incident was fabricated.

“Based on what we found, we found absolutely no evidence that there is any proof what so ever that his allegations of having his hair cut at school exist,” Parker told the station.

Parker said he reviewed surveillance footage from a camera outside the principal’s office, and said “there is no video evidence that he was at or near the school office at any time.”

A mother in Jones County, Mississippi, is accusing the principal of her son’s school of cutting the boy’s long hair against his will.

Lattrice Averette told WDAM TV that the principal at North Jones Elementary School cut her 11-year-old son’s hair on Monday, in the process undermining his expression of cultural identity.

The boy, T.J. White, told his mom that he was called to the office without being informed why. Once there, the principal allegedly removed portions of his hair that were hanging over his face.

Averette said her son’s guidance counselor had earlier objected to his locs covering his face and told him to do something about it.

“She came to his classroom and saw that he still had his hair in his face later on that day,” the mother told local station WJTV. “She told him to go to the office, and she walked him to the office where they had him sit down. The office ... the school counselor held his shoulders as the principal, he says, cut his hair.”

Then T.J. was ordered to pick up his shorn locs, which he took home to show his mother, according to her Facebook post.

Averette is livid about what happened, so much so that she has now withdrawn her son from the school.

“I was highly upset,” she told WDAM TV. “I needed something to be done, and I wanted some justice for my son. He is autistic, suffers from ADHD and post-traumatic stress because of this school. I needed some help. Since that time, I have been to the police department. I have pressed charges with the justice court against the school’s principal as well as the school’s counselor. I have been to the superintendent’s office and I’m waiting for them to complete their investigation.”

Tommy Parker, superintendent for the Jones County School District, told WJTV that he is investigating the incident, but that security footage doesn’t show the boy going into the principal’s office on Monday.The cast of "The Office." NBC via Getty Images

Everybody stay calm: John Krasinski wants “The Office” to return as a Christmas special.

The actor weighed in on the beloved NBC series’ revival, which the network is reportedly eyeing for the 2018-2019 television season. Krasinski, who starred as Jim Halpert for nine seasons, says he’s all for reuniting.

“I think the U.K. thing that I always have pitched and wanted to do is that Christmas special thing, where we do a Christmas special this year and then two years from now, or three years from now, we do another one,” he told IndieWire. “I love that idea coming back finding out where everybody is. I would totally be down for that.”

He added: “It’s one of those things where I’m sure people don’t believe me when I say I would totally do it, because the truth is I would totally do it.”

The original U.K. series upon which “The Office” is based aired two Christmas specials as a de facto finale in 2003. Recently revived series like “Gilmore Girls” have also opted for seasonally-themed installments, while others, including “Will & Grace” and “Twin Peaks,” have aired full seasons.

Krasinski, who’s on a press tour with wife Emily Blunt for his new movie, “A Quiet Place,” is more keen to do a one-off special, instead of rebooting the series for an entirely new run.

“I don’t think anybody in our show sees that we didn’t end it the way we wanted to end it. We’re one of the very lucky shows that got to end when we wanted to, how we wanted to,” he said. “So I don’t know how it exciting it would be to do a run of the show, ’cause you don’t want to retread old things and have people not be as excited about it as they are now.”

But his resistance to committing to a full season has nothing to with his former cast members, who he still has a soft spot for.

“I remember talking to other people on TV shows and they were like, ‘Fifth season, right? That’s when you all started hating each other?’ and I was like, ‘No, was that when you started hating each other?’ and they were like, ‘Hell yeah, fifth season and I was like nope,’” Krasinski said. “Right until the end, we were a family, we were emotionally connected, we all cried our eyes out on the last day.

His partner in crime, Jenna Fischer, who played his love interest Pam, is also ready and willing to get back in business.

AdvertisementSay what you will about Donald Glover, but the man makes time for Deadpool.

This weekend, FX announced that its sister network FXX wouldn’t be moving forward with an animated “Deadpool” series Glover had been working on. On Wednesday, Glover addressed the matter via Twitter.

for the record: i wasnt too busy to work on deadpool. — donald (@donaldglover) March 28, 2018

Glover was working on the series about the foulmouthed Marvel antihero with his younger brother Stephen. The two also work together on FX’s “Atlanta.”

“Due to creative differences, FX, Donald Glover, Stephen Glover and Marvel Television have agreed to part ways on Marvel’s Deadpool animated series,” FX said Saturday in a statement.

It was reported that no scripts may have been delivered for the show. At least one report speculated that “‘Deadpool’ may have been a casualty of Donald Glover’s packed schedule.”

Glover himself weighed in on Wednesday, tweeting a mock script ― evidently written sometime in the past two days, since it mentions the Beyonce Bite ― where Deadpool addresses the issue in typically self-referential, fourth-wall-demolishing fashion.

Some of the world’s biggest banks continue to lend money to support the dirtiest fossil fuels, despite global commitments to tackle climate change, according to a report published Wednesday, which picks out U.S. and Canadian banks as the worst offenders.

Every year a group of nonprofits ― including the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network and Oil Change International ― releases the Banking on Climate Change report, which grades 36 of the largest banks in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan and China on their financing of “extreme” fossil fuel companies and projects.

These firms are defined as those that profit off the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels: They extract tar sands, Arctic and ultra deepwater oil, and liquified natural gas. They mine coal and produce coal-fired power.

The environmental groups analyze how much money the banks have pumped into the top 30 companies operating in each category of extreme fossil fuels and grade them from A to F in each category based on an analysis of the banks’ publicly available policies on fossil fuels.

This is the ninth annual report, and the news is not good, especially when it comes to U.S. and Canadian banks.

“The first year after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, was a year of progress. 2017 was a year of backsliding,” the report said.

Financing for extreme fossil fuels by the big banks increased 11 percent, from $104 billion in 2016 to $115 billion in 2017, according to the report. Three of them ― Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) and JPMorgan Chase ― were identified as the “biggest backsliders,” meaning they showed the greatest increases in such financing. All three tout their commitments to clean energy and environmental protection.

But “every single dollar that these banks provide for the expansion of the fossil fuel industry is a dollar going to increase the climate crisis,” said Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of Oil Change International.

U.S. and Canadian dominance in extreme fossil fuel financing may have political roots, suggested Alison Kirsch, climate and energy research coordinator at Rainforest Action Network. “Banks [in these countries] might be emboldened by the political leaders that are pro fossil fuels,” she said.

Tar sands received by far the biggest increase, reaching nearly $47 billion in bank financing in 2017 ― a hike of 111 percent on the previous year. The report identified RBC, TD and JPMorgan Chase as the key financial institutions injecting cash into tar sands projects. Those include the embattled Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia, Canada, which indigenous groups are protesting.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) saw $45 billion in bank financing, with Morgan Stanley identified as one of the top lenders. LNG is often pitched by advocates as a weapon in the climate change fight, because it can have lower emissions than coal and oil. However, the fuel is predominantly made up omethane, a very potent greenhouse gas, and it doesn’t take much methane to leak during operations to give LNG a bigger carbon footprint than other fossil fuels.

When it comes to coal, Chinese banks remain the top funders, while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank lead the pack among Western lenders, according to the report.

“Coal financing has essentially stagnated,” Kirsch said. But she added that wasn’t good enough. Financing for coal should be dropping “towards a phase-out goal of zero,” she said.

The upward tick in extreme fossil fuel financing runs counter to indications that global reliance on fossil fuels may have peaked. The cost of renewables like solar and wind energy has plummeted, and energy storage is burgeoning with the world’s largest lithium ion battery coming online in Australia late last year. Countries such as the U.K., China and France and states including California have all announced plans to move away from combustion engines and embrace electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, hundreds of coal plants are shuttering as they become economically unviable. “It’s still far from game over for the fossil fuel industry, but the game has drastically changed,” the report said.

There is some good news from the report, said Kirsch, who praised some banks in Europe for “really bold policy movement.” In particular, she pointed to the French bank BNP Paribas, which last year pledged to stop financing shale and oil sands projects.

“The financial sector overall is not blind to the weakness of the oil and gas industry ... but we’re just not seeing the action on policies come quick enough,” Kirsch added. She called on banks to take the immediate first step of stopping the financing of fossil fuel expansion.

Banks cannot shirk their role in fighting climate change, said Catherine Howarth of U.K.-based nonprofit ShareAction. “The financing decisions of banks are utterly critical to climate outcomes and to the pace of decarbonization in the global economy. Bank boards should be held accountable on the financing of high carbon projects,” she said.

For their part, several big banks contacted by HuffPost insisted that they are committed to clean energy. Deutsche Bank referred to its 2016 commitment to no longer finance new coal mining or coal-fired plant construction or expansion.

A TD spokeswoman said the bank had committed to provide some $77.5 billion in financing for low-carbon initiatives by 2030. “TD is taking clear steps to help accelerate the development of a low-carbon economy, while recognizing the importance of responsibly developing conventional energy, vital to North America’s economic strength and security,” she said.

A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said that the bank “is committed to mobilizing capital to scale up clean energy” and noted that it has provided more than $30 billion in clean energy financing and investment since 2016. She also said Goldman Sachs applies “enhanced due diligence” to coal investments, which includes looking at companies’ environmental track records, evaluating ecological impacts, and considering local community and human rights.

RBC and Morgan Stanley did not immediately reply to requests for comment. JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas declined to comment.

It wasn’t long before people spotted something strange in the photo:

The former mayor ― who serves as cybersecurity adviser to President Donald Trump ― can’t quite seem to figure out how to wear his AirPods, or the wireless earbuds made by Apple.

The AirPods are designed to point forward and down at an angle, fitting the natural shape of the ear, and wearing them was described by Recode in 2016 as “so easy to wear you’ll forget you have them on.”

But they weren’t so easy for Giuliani, as Twitter users were quick to point out:

The core four of Katie Holmes, James Van Der Beek, Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams have returned to Capeside for Entertainment Weekly, along with supporting cast members Busy Philipps, Kerr Smith, Meredith Monroe and Mary Beth Peil.

The outlet has released five commemorative covers to celebrate the landmark series’ 20th anniversary: one with the four leads together, and the others featuring them individually ― save for Williams, who shares hers with real-life BFF Philipps, a Season 5 arrival.

“I think we’ve all sort of seen each other over the years, but not everybody all together,” Holmes, who played Joey, told the magazine. “And never for long enough.”

Creator Kevin Williamson added: “I run into James and Josh, Katie, Michelle, and I just get a big smile on my face. It’s just a very, very special time in my life.”

“Dawson’s Creek” aired for six seasons on The WB before signing off for good in 2003 with a bawl-your-eyes-out finale that killed off Williams’ character, Jen Lindley ― so much for that revival, folks.

The series defined the network and propelled a new wave of storytelling about young adults that continues to have an impact on pop culture. Williamson went on to create shows like “The Vampire Diaries,” while writer and executive producer Greg Berlanti brought hit shows like “Riverdale,” “Supergirl” and “The Flash” to TV, as well as directed the new movie “Love, Simon.”

Van Der Beek, who played the titular Dawson, recalled his early days on the set: “I remember loving the script. I remember thinking everybody was amazing and all the actors were perfectly cast.”

“I think it would have been weird to have any expectation that it would blow up the way that it did,” he added.

Williams, who has since been nominated for four Academy Awards, had a theory about the show’s enduring appeal.

“I loved that we were able to get in there in those formative years for people. That’s why people, I think, are so connected to it,” she said. “When something affects you while you were growing up, it kind of stays in there forever.”

Despite the way the series ended and the actors’ busy schedules, fans have been clamoring for more “Dawson’s Creek.” The cast has repeatedly shot down the idea ― Van Der Beek said last year that the show’s theme song still makes him want to “go hide under the table.”

For her part, Holmes said in a 2015 interview with Ocean Drive magazine that “some things are better when it stays the way it was.”

“I would love to get together with everybody, [but] I’m not sure a reunion would be as fulfilling as what we all want it to be,” she said, but added: “I’m game for anything.”

Monica Lewinsky is asking for people to “consume news with compassion.”

The former White House intern turned activist made a rare appearance at a conference for the International Association of Privacy Professionals in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Lewinsky called for compassion from the media, citing her own treacherous experience with cyberbullying after her 1998 affair with former President Bill Clinton that took the world by storm.

“Just imagine walking a mile in someone else’s headline,” Lewinsky said, according to the Washington Examiner. “We need to communicate online with compassion, consume news with compassion, and click with compassion.”

Lewinsky, 44, dubbed the media and onslaught of internet vitriol “our culture of humiliation,” adding that the country needs a cultural revolution to stop it.

“Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop. It’s time for an intervention in our culture and on the internet,” she said. “The shift begins with something simple, but it’s actually not easy to do. We need to return to a long-held value of compassion. Compassion and empathy.”

In her Tuesday speech, Lewinsky warned of the “dangerous cycle” internet culture has created.Still, Biden used the podcast to stress that “one of the passions of my life is violence against women,” and reiterated that he found Trump’s rhetoric “vulgar.”

Men “have an obligation not to engage in degrading talk,” he said. “I think what it does, it does encourage the minority element of a male population that it’s okay to engage in the behavior the president talks about.”

Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct ― including harassment, assault and rape ― by 21 women, though he vehemently denies the allegations.

“It’s important to continue to make the point that women are entitled to be treated with respect, damn it. It’s about time we men stand up. We’ve got to be part of the solution,” Biden said.

For what it’s worth, according to a survey from Public Policy Polling, 37 percent of voters think Biden could take Trump in a fist fight, with 32 percent putting their money on Trump and 30 percent having no opinion.

PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Digital Minister Mounir Mahjoubi has come out as gay, in a rare move for a French public figure that he said would help give gay people more visibility at a time when homophobic acts are on the rise.

In a message on Twitter late on Thursday, the international day against homophobia, the 34-year old junior minister in Emmanuel Macron’s government said homophobia “sometimes forces us to adapt and lie just to avoid hatred and to live our lives.”

“Homophobia is an ill that eats away at society, invades schools, and poisons families and lost friends,” Mahjoubi said in his post.

The son of Moroccan immigrants who became a successful tech entrepreneur before joining Macron’s campaign, Mahjoubi is not the first French politician to come out, but he said his personal experience could inspire those facing prejudice.

“We have to remember the consequences of homophobia in daily life, notably for the young. It has also had consequences for me,” he told Franceinfo radio in an interview.

According to French gay rights charity SOS Homophobie, the number of physical attacks due to homophobia jumped by 15 percent from 2016 to 2017.

AdvertisementMad about sitcom revivals? Well, Helen Hunt has some promising news for you.

In the wake of comedy comebacks like “Will & Grace” and “Roseanne,” the 54-year-old actress strongly hinted Tuesday that “Mad About You” could join the relaunch parade.

“Mad About You,” starring Hunt and Paul Reiser as a Manhattan couple juggling family, friends and careers, ran on NBC from 1992 to 1999.

Asked about the prospects of a return, Hunt told Entertainment Tonight in the segment above that “it’s looking interesting, I will say.”

She and Reiser discussed the viability of resurrecting the TV rom-com at her kitchen table on Monday, sharing concerns about “wrecking” it, she said.

But Hunt, an Oscar winner, did see a way in since they became parents on the show.

“It does seem compelling to visit these characters 20 years into a marriage after raising an entire human being,” she said. “So depending on some pieces falling into place, it could happen.”

Reports of a possible revival emerged in January as well, so we’ll take a “could happen.”April is a beautiful month, when warm mists can carry the flowery smells of a new spring into the air. Plastic pastel eggs pile high in the supermarkets. Wondrous golden chains of pollen fall from the skies and into your allergy-prone eyes. And, Netflix adds more shows and movies for you to binge.

Netflix has revealed what it plans to add to your subscription next month in a promotional video replete with the kind of upbeat muzak that accompanies corporate trailers.

There’s a new Adam Sandler movie that won’t be named here, as millions will watch it regardless (watch “The Meyerowitz Stories” instead). “Scarface” joins on Easter, which is of course total fun for the whole family. Actually, most of the new movies this month join on Easter (April 1), so you don’t have long to wait.

Almost all the shows that are coming to Netflix are originals from the company. Additionally, the latest season of “Jane the Virgin” will apparently be available shortly after the show finishes its season’s television run on April 6. That rarely happens, and might be a sign that Netflix wants to start competing with Hulu’s main model of adding episodes shortly after they air on traditional channels.

Netflix also loses numerous movies on April 1, including a few titles it just acquired months ago, such as “Caddyshack” and the “American Pie” series. Last chance to see Jason Biggs hook up with a pie and wonder if he would have won an Oscar if it had been a fish instead.
