Indiana now lets DACA recipients apply for professional licenses. “Dreamers” have thrived for two years in Nebraska with a similar policy.

OMAHA, Neb. — Dania Cervantes Ayala is the kind of nurse you want when you receive a life-changing diagnosis. It’s not a task for her, it feels personal. She cares for patients at her part-time job at the Nebraska Medicine’s Buffett Cancer Center with both sharp knowledge and deep compassion — traits of a skilled third-year nursing student at the College of Saint Mary who will soon take the state’s nursing license exams and move on to a doctorate of nursing program.

She’s part of the future of nursing in eastern Nebraska. She was also brought to this country illegally in 2003 when she was 6 years old.

Up until two years ago, Cervantes Ayala, who is from Mexico, would not have been allowed to become a nurse in her state because of her immigration status. In Nebraska she, along with nearly 3,400 other “Dreamers” — named after the DREAM Act, which never passed in Congress — could not apply for or receive professional or commercial licenses. That changed with the enacting of a 2016 state law, and has since led to a wave of young people becoming lawyers, nurses, cosmetologists, accountants and dozens of other licensed professionals.

“I’m finally comfortable in my own skin,” said Cervantes Ayala, who often looks back on her parents’ perilous journey across the border. “It’s like everything that we have worked hard for is finally paying off. We’re out of the shadows.”

Nebraska is one of 10 states that allow certain immigrants — such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, legal immigrants and unauthorized immigrants — to apply for professional licenses, which often require Social Security numbers. In many of those states, the door is only open for specific professions, such as for teachers in Nevada and lawyers in Florida.

Last month, Indiana lawmakers enacted a law similar to Nebraska’s, becoming the latest state to give young undocumented immigrants a chance at an advanced career in a country they’ve always called home. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said the state’s DACA recipients should be allowed “to skill up and work here in Indiana.”

Nebraska, like Indiana, is a conservative state. But the debate two years ago defied partisan norms on immigration and already has had an impact on DACA recipients.

The Long Fight in Nebraska

Alejandra Ayotitla’s voice still quivers when the Dreamer, who crossed the Mexican border as a 9-year-old in 2004, thinks back to the moment Nebraska enacted a law that would allow her to one day pursue a legal career.

A week before the measure became law in 2016, Pete Ricketts, the state’s Republican governor, vetoed the bill supported overwhelmingly by lawmakers of his own party, citing a concern it was unfair to immigrants who came to the country legally. The chamber of the unicameral Legislature was silent as senators cast the final vote to override the governor’s veto.

When the votes were in, the bill had 31 supporters — one more than was needed to override the veto. As someone in the chamber gallery full of Dreamers erupted in applause, most of the senators turned, stood up and returned applause back to the dozens of young people they had gotten to know over the many years it took to get to this moment.

“It was really powerful,” Ayotitla said. “I have no words to describe it.”

The enthusiastic passage of the Nebraska law that gave undocumented immigrants with work authorization, including DACA recipients, a chance at getting professional licenses is a far cry from some of the anti-immigrant measures state leaders enacted just seven years earlier.

In 2009, the state enacted a law that took away many public benefits, including professional, commercial and driver’s licenses, from undocumented immigrants. Then-Gov. Dave Heineman said the law would ensure “that state and local benefits go to those who truly qualify.”

Three years later, Heineman, a Republican, spoke vehemently against the Obama administration’s DACA program, which allowed those who were brought to the country illegally as children to work legally, while members of the Legislature tried to pass an Arizona-style “show me your papers” bill.

But as that was happening, support for changes to immigration policy was building in the state — not just among activists, but also among business leaders.

Dreamers Won the Argument

That support continues. Nebraska needs workers, said Jennifer Creager, the senior director of public policy for the Greater Omaha Chamber, in an interview. Like many rural states, Nebraska is exporting too many of its young people to sustain a statewide workforce, she said. With an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent and some 50,000 job openings across the state, immigration is a “pure workforce issue” for Creager and other business people. The new law could allow more Nebraska Dreamers to help fill the gap.

“It makes absolutely no sense to educate kids here, to put state resources into them with public schools and higher education, to basically train them to work, and then say we don’t want them to work here or pay taxes here,” she said. “Not only do we want you. We need you.”

Those same economic arguments are what drove business leaders such as Jim Partington, the executive director of the Nebraska Restaurant Association, to form a coalition to study immigration in Nebraska, a state with an aging and declining population. Between 2011 and 2015, nearly 12,000 Nebraskans 25 and older with at least a bachelor’s degree were leaving the state every year. Meanwhile, Nebraskans 65 and older are expected to increase by 75 percent between 2010 and 2030, according to the AARP.

The restaurant group, along with the Nebraska Cattlemen’s Association and other industry groups, soon became some of the loudest voices pushing the state Legislature to remove barriers for immigrants in state law. Those barriers, such as being the last state in the country to not allow DACA recipients to receive driver’s licenses, were in direct conflict with state officials’ economic goals, Partington said. (The Legislature gave DACA recipients the ability to get driver’s licenses after overriding a Ricketts veto in 2015.)

“I don’t think you can meet these people and then take a position that we want to deport them,” Partington said. “They’re so valuable to have here. They’re teachers. They’re accountants. Some of them are studying to become lawyers. They’ve got a great future ahead of them.”

Ultimately, it was meeting students such as Ayotitla that inspired lawmakers to make a final push, said Darcy Tromanhauser, the director of the immigrants and communities program at Nebraska Appleseed, a Lincoln-based advocacy group. Many of the DACA recipients grew up in small, rural communities across the state, such as the majority-Latino towns of Schuyler and Lexington, and the young people wanted to give back and become the next generation of skilled professionals in those areas.

“Senators felt like they got to know youth, and care personally,” Tromanhauser said. “There’s a lot more community support that is playing out that is wildly different than the national dialogue would make you think.”

Since the law was enacted, advocates at Nebraska Appleseed said they are unaware of any snags in its implementation, and they have not heard of any applicants being denied because of their status as DACA recipients. Administrative offices across the state were prepped and ready for new DACA applicants the day after the policy went into effect, Tromanhauser said.

Officials at the Nebraska Department of Labor said they do not track the number of DACA recipients who have applied for professional and commercial licenses. To be sure, Tromanhauser and other advocates said there is no easy way of measuring how many DACA recipients have taken advantage of the new policy, but countless stories of Dreamers applying for new licenses continue to pour into their offices.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, across the country, 9,000 DACA recipients are teachers, 14,000 are health care practitioners and in health care support roles, and 2,200 are financial specialists — roles that may require the Dreamers to hold a professional license.

In New York, one of the states that allows teachers to receive certifications, around 700 DACA recipients are in the education field, according to MPI.

Many more DACA recipients are studying to become skilled workers. Almost 17 percent of DACA recipients are pursuing an advanced degree, according to a 2015 survey by the National Immigration Law Center and the Center for American Progress. Further, more than 50 medical schools now consider applications from DACA recipients nationwide, according to the law center.

Ayotitla even decided to change her career path from becoming a school psychologist to becoming a lawyer because of this fight. She starts at the Nebraska College of Law in the fall.

Confusion Around DACA

More than 80 state organizations and local leaders — from chambers of commerce to mayors — have publicly supported the deferred action program since the license law was enacted, said Omaid Zabih, the federal policy director at Nebraska Appleseed. Just after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, the state Legislature passed a resolution in support of the program.

“I look at it as one very powerful moment in an ongoing movement,” Zabih said of the license law. “That didn’t happen in a vacuum. It built momentum for what we want, which is common sense immigration reform.”

Ricketts, however, has publicly agreed with Trump’s decision to end the “unconstitutional” program.

Still, Washington’s confusion over whether DACA recipients, who have only temporary protection from deportation, have a future in the country, including congressional inaction, remains a worry for young Nebraskans like Armando Becerril.

Becerril came to the country flying through the air. When he and his family got to a fence at the U.S. border in 1997 in the pouring rain, soaked and muddy with only the clothes on their backs, his uncle threw the then-4-year-old over the barrier into California. His mother, father and uncle hopped the fence too.

Over the next two decades, Becerril and his family settled in and created a life here. When people ask him where he’s from, he always says York, Nebraska — the town of 8,000 where his father worked as a meatpacker. Growing up, he excelled at school, and numbers especially came naturally to him. “They were my thing,” he said.

When college rolled around, Becerril received both undergraduate and graduate degrees in accounting at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He still doesn’t miss a Husker football game.

Now working at the Omaha office of prestigious international tax and auditing firm KPMG, the DACA recipient is six months away from finishing his certified public accountant exams. Two years ago, he couldn’t have become a CPA in Nebraska.

But he may soon lose his protected status, as Congress and Trump have failed to come to an agreement on the program that expired in March, but has continued indefinitely while a federal court considers its legality.

“I don’t know how things are going to unfold with DACA,” he said. “We’re talking about everything I worked for for years. It could have been a waste.”

Unlike other DACA recipients in Nebraska, however, Becerril has options. His firm, knowing his status, has offered to employ him in the company’s Mexico City office if he is deported. He says he’s luckier than most. But he still wants to live in his home state.Syracuse University has suspended a fraternity after video surfaced showing members saying things that the university’s chancellor called “extremely racist.”

Chancellor Kent Syverud suspended the university’s chapter of Theta Tau, a professional engineering fraternity, on Wednesday. He additionally described the videos as “anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and hostile to people with disabilities.”

The school newspaper, The Daily Orange, obtained and released a copy of one video, which it said was originally posted on a secret Facebook group. The university became aware of the videos after someone forwarded them to officials, a spokeswoman told The New York Times.

In one video, filmed in Theta Tau’s house, a person gets on his knees and repeats an “oath.”

“I solemnly swear to always have hatred in my heart for” black people, Latinos and Jews, the person repeats, using slurs for those groups.

Many students staged campus protests over the video. Liam McMonagle, 19, told the Times it demonstrates that racism is alive and real.

“Now today there’s a video, and today it’s on social media, and today it’s proven.” he said.

Michael Abraham, executive director of the national Theta Tau organization, told the Times he had not yet seen the video, but that his organization was “investigating the allegations.”

He added: “While the language that has been described is troubling and inconsistent with our values, we tend to distinguish between words and deeds as well as between individuals and groups when determining appropriate remedies and penalties.”

The Theta Tau chapter released a statement on Friday to the Syracuse Post-Standard apologizing for the video, saying, “Anyone of color or of any marginalized group who has seen this video has every right to be angry and upset with the despicable contents of that video.”

The chapter also claimed that what the video depicted was a satirical roast of a “conservative Republican” fraternity member.A Democratic lawmaker in Washington, D.C., who once blamed a winter storm on Jewish bankers visited the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on Thursday.

It didn’t go well.

According to The Washington Post, Trayon White Sr., a member of the D.C. Council, and his staff made several unusual observations about the exhibitions. Then, White abruptly left, citing an event he had to attend, only to be spotted later on the sidewalk outside the museum.

During his time inside, White pointed to an image of Nazi stormtroopers surrounding a woman who was wearing a sign that read: “I am a German girl and allowed myself to be defiled by a Jew.” He asked Lynn Williams, the museum’s director of leadership programs, if the stormtroopers were “protecting her.”

When told that they were forcing her to march down a street in Norden, Germany, White offered that “marching is a form of protecting.”

“I think they’re humiliating her,” Williams explained, per the Post.

White made headlines last month when he posted a video of himself blaming “the Rothschilds” for late-winter snow in Washington.

“Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,” White said. “And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.”

The wealthy banking family has been the target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for generations.

White later apologized, reached out to Jews United for Justice and vowed to “continue to be allies” with the Jewish community.

On Thursday, he didn’t mention his visit to the museum on his social media accounts. However, he told the Post he planned to return.

“This opportunity has given me the chance to meet a lot of great Jews, a lot of people. A lot of good Jews that I’ve never had the chance to meet before,” White said after a long silence. “It’s an awesome experience.”The artist known for songs like “Wake Me Up” and “Levels” was highly respected in the electric dance music industry, even though he retired at age 26 in 2016.

Stephen Colbert has some advice for President Donald Trump.

But the “Late Show” host said Thursday that there’s one way to keep him from talking.Jimmy Kimmel is known for his elaborate pranks, with no one ― not even children ― being safe from his stunts.

Joshua Malina, one of the stars of “Scandal,” is also known for pranking his costars. But he was no match for Kimmel.

As “Scandal” was about to end its seven-season run, the “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host set Malina up for a truly memorable night.Ariana Grande has turned the world upside down with her new single, “No Tears Left To Cry.”

The pop star dropped the first track off her upcoming and currently untitled fourth studio album on Thursday night accompanied by a gravity-defying music video. The song is the first single Grande has released since her album “Dangerous Woman,” which was stacked with hits like “Into You” and “Side To Side.”

“No Tears Left To Cry” is also the first to arrive since a terrorist attack after her concert in Manchester, England, claimed the lives of 22 people in May 2017. Grande returned to the city a month later for a benefit concert that raised millions for the families of the victims.

The single, which reunites Grande with frequent collaborators Savan Kotecha, ILYA and Max Martin, appears to address the tragedy. “Right now, I’m in a state of mind / I wanna be in, like, all the time / Ain’t got no tears left to cry,” she sings. The final shot of the music video also features a bee, an emblem of the British city that became a symbol of unity in the wake of the bombing.

But the song doesn’t dwell in sadness for long, transitioning to an upbeat chorus. “So I’m pickin’ it up, pickin’ it up / I’m lovin’, I’m livin’, I’m pickin’ it up,” she belts.

After releasing the single, Grande thanked fans for their support on Instagram and revealed what she was trying to achieve with the new sound:

thank you from the bottom of my heart. i have no idea where to start or what to say. i’m unimaginably grateful for your love, warmth and kindness. i hope this song brings you light and comfort but also makes you wanna dance and live ya best life! i am so excited for this new chapter with you all. thank you for this beautiful start.

But it appears all may be forgiven between the duo ― if a profile published on Thursday for Time’s list of the 100 most influential people is anything to go by. Cruz penned the glowing tribute to Trump, praising him for “doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.”This is more bonkers than paying $19 for smashed avocado on toast.

Michael Rotondo, the 30-year-old man who was court-ordered to move out of his parents’ home, spoke with Brooke Baldwin of CNN on Wednesday ― and their chat went way off the rails.

Toward the end of the interview, Baldwin told Rotondo that many people reacted to his story by saying millennials are entitled, and asked him what he thought of that criticism.

“I would say that I’m really not a member of that demographic,” Rotondo said. “I’m a very conservative person. The millennials that they are speaking to are very liberal in their ideology...”

“But you’re 30, so technically, I think you are part of the millennial generation,” Baldwin replied.

“You’re right ... but when people speak to the millennials and their general nature as a millennial, they speak to more liberal leanings, in my opinion. Do you disagree?”

“I think a millennial is a millennial is a millennial, based upon the year that you were born,” Baldwin said, though she added that Rotondo had the right to say he doesn’t feel that he fits the stereotype.

On that awkward note, Baldwin then attempted to end the interview, but Rotondo abruptly interrupted:

“I’m a millennial.”

After the interview, Baldwin responded like this:

“So that … was one of the most surreal interviews we’ve taken part of here in the last little while,” Baldwin said. “But I genuinely wish him and his parents luck.”The New Jersey Devils won their first Stanley Cup in the ’90s, so what better way to pump up a crowd than to have their craziest fan from that decade’s biggest sitcom return?

WASHINGTON ― The violence that left seven inmates dead and a score more injured in a South Carolina prison this week was inevitable, Henry McMaster, the state’s Republican governor, suggested Monday. “It’s not a surprise when we have violent events take place inside the prison, any prison in the country,” he said.

In fact, a night of unchecked prison violence that ends in more than a half-dozen deaths is extremely unusual. States have a responsibility to protect inmates and prison staff—and well-funded, properly staffed prisons can and do prevent widespread inmate violence or stop it swiftly when it occurs, prison experts say.

Lee Correctional Institution, the high-security prison where inmate fights broke out on April 15, houses violent offenders with longer sentences, as well as people with behavioral issues. The incidents started around 7:15 p.m., but a large emergency response team didn’t enter the first of three dorms until 11:30 p.m., officials said. The team entered the last dorm hours later.

CBS News obtained leaked video (not independently verified) that shows what McMaster apparently finds unsurprising: An eerie dystopia featuring an inmate smearing blood against a white wall and another roaming shirtless with a weapon that resembles a kitchen knife.

This is not a typical prison scene. As far as the death toll goes, the most recent comparable event was an 11-day riot—in which inmates took multiple hostages—that left nine inmates and one officer dead in an Ohio prison way back in 1993.

Prison violence “shouldn’t be an expectation,” said Robert Ayers, who worked at California’s San Quentin State Prison from 1968 to 1987 and went on to serve as the warden at four California prisons. “It’s almost, ‘well, seven people died, but they were just inmates, and these are violent guys anyway ... so it’s no big loss to society.’ That’s extrapolating a lot, but I think there’s an undercurrent out there that believes that.”

People need to be asking questions of the governor’s office and the legislature, said Anthony Newland, a former warden of California State Prison Solano and former chief compliance officer for that state prison system. “It’s no surprise that this kind of problem can happen — when there isn’t enough money to run the system,” Newland argued. “These things are preventable in prisons,” he added.

Prisons need to have enough staff to keep inmates and officers safe

Lee Correctional Institution has an understaffing problem. Security staff numbers continued to “lag behind the authorized strength [like officers],” according to a FY2017 South Carolina Department of Corrections report. On April 1, 2017, there were 90 vacancies for frontline security positions at Lee — approximately half the facility’s authorized positions, a state DOC spokesman told HuffPost. Those numbers have improved due to recruitment and retention efforts—the number of vacancies was down to 52 as of April 1, 2018.

But a former Lee employee, who worked there from 2004 to 2012 and declined to be named due to pending litigation, said he still found those staffing numbers concerning. “You have to have a certain number of bodies in a certain number of places or you can’t operate normally,” the former employee said.

Crises are the result of an inadequately funded prison system, one Democratic lawmaker argued. “Yes, stuff happens — stuff happens because you neglect things, you underfund them, and you put people in danger,” said state Rep. Todd Rutherford (D). He said that he doesn’t blame the current DOC director, who’s been “sounding the alarm bells about how understaffed and underfunded he is, how bad the prisons are, how hard his correctional officers are working.”

South Carolina has had a large number of violent inmate deaths in recent years compared to other states. When there aren’t enough officers—or people like mental health professionals and maintenance staff—staff may fear for their safety, and that in turn can allow violence to flourish. “I don’t blame the officers for what happened,” the mother of a Lee inmate told the Anderson Independent Mail. “My son says the gang members do what they want to. That they will pull out shanks right in front of the guards.”

It’s impossible to talk about understaffing without mentioning the nationwide push to reform mandatory minimum sentences and end mass incarceration in the U.S., issues that contribute to spiraling, problematic prison systems that disproportionately impact people of color.

McMaster’s office did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment. But “the governor is committed to continuing to fund raises at the agency and will continue to do that as long as the agency is in need,” a spokesman for the governor told NBC News. (South Carolina’s average starting salary for officers this year was $33,289, according to NBC.)

“Small indignities add up, yet some officials feign surprise when those treated inhumanely behave in inhumane ways.” - Issac Bailey for the Charlotte Observer

Cellphones: Potentially a symptom of a bigger problem

Officials have blamed the violence on gang conflicts over territory and contraband, particularly cellphones, which can be used to coordinate illegal activity. Officials are using the incident to push for signal-jamming at prisons.

But contraband is not a new issue, nor unique to South Carolina. And cellphones can be a symptom of wider security problems, prison experts say. (A prison can be fully staffed and still have security problems, though substantial understaffing makes things worse.) When staff can’t adequately sweep for forbidden items, an economy can spring up that includes weapons. Some inmates may also feel like they need gang protection because they don’t feel safe in the facility.

“Cellphones did not stab people,” said Justin Bamberg, a state representative and attorney who represents the family of an inmate killed in a different state prison on New Year’s Eve. “What did were some of those [multi]-inch blades.”

When there’s severe understaffing, you’re “not going to enforce simple rules and regulations, much less more serious stuff,” the former Lee employee said. “You’re going to stay somewhere it’s safe, which is like a staff area in the middle of the unit, where you don’t see and you don’t hear. And who can blame them?”

Staff “routinely” search correctional institutions for contraband, the South Carolina DOC spokesman told HuffPost, though he declined to provide more information about routines, citing security. The agency is installing netting at certain facilities to thwart people from throwing over contraband, he said.

Why did it take hours to get control of the dorms?

Lee conducts monthly emergency training, the DOC spokesman said, and there are three teams with specialized training that assisted in responding to the violence. Lee is located in a rural area, about an hour from Columbia, which may have increased the time it took to gather sufficient numbers of staff to respond to the crisis.

But experts have wondered how the violence was able to spread unchecked to multiple dorms, rather than the facility being swiftly secured. It’s also concerning how long it reportedly took an emergency team to re-enter and take control of the areas under siege, Jeffrey Schwartz, a consultant who has worked with correctional agencies and law enforcement for more than 30 years, told HuffPost. “Whether it’s staff or inmates,” he said, “your commitment to saving life has to be the same.”

And that’s why prison reform advocates find the governor’s statement so troubling— it suggests prison is supposed to be a violent place.

The incident is “more than just a tragedy,” a group of state Democratic lawmakers wrote to McMaster on Thursday. “We are concerned it is indicative of much bigger problems within correctional facilities in South Carolina.”

“I was hurt. I wept. Because these were lives that were snuffed out,” James Murray, a former inmate who now is a chaplain for South Carolina prisoners, told local news station ABC Columbia.

“We’ve been tough on crime,” he added. “But actually, we’ve been tough on people.”The memos of former FBI Director James Comey released to congressional leaders provide a trove of insight into President Donald Trump’s priorities and concerns.

They reinforce Trump’s widely reported obsession with pinning down leakers, his desire to protect his own reputation at all costs, and his preoccupation with loyalty. They also reveal snippets of conversation difficult to imagine happening inside the sanctum of the leader of the free world.

Here are some of the nuttiest parts:

Trump had doubts about Michael Flynn from the start.

The president felt his first national security adviser Michael Flynn had “serious judgment issues” after finding out that Flynn didn’t alert him soon enough to a congratulatory call from a world leader, according to Comey.

He made the comment during a lunch with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, whom Trump thanked for being the first world leader to call him and express her congratulations. Flynn, according to Comey, then told the president that another world leader had actually called first. Though the name was redacted in Comey’s memos, that person was Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to both The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press.

Trump on Friday responded to the memo, assailing Comey for making notes “so General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed.”We meet Al as he is jarred awake from a depression nap by an apparition of his mother. She is chastising him for being “lazy” and straightening up his things when she blurs into the background of his living room, her gentle gospel humming melding smoothly into the jagged sound of his phone vibrating.

Earn has called to check in on the aspiring rapper to sign some paperwork and check in on him — a task he shrugs off before hanging up and tossing his phone on the table. It’s unclear how soon or long after the call it takes Paper Boi to rise from the couch, throw on fresh clothes, walk out of his dark home and into the sun to greet Sierra, an Instagram-famous woman the rapper either wants to sleep with or ask to be his girlfriend.

The latest installment of “Atlanta” begins slowly and with a surreal haze that hangs over the episode as Al drudges through a series of incredibly unfortunate events. Paper Boi spends his day being berated by Sierra for his desire to stay real before storming out of their dual pedicure appointment. He starts his long walk home but, on the way, he’s robbed at gunpoint by three unnamed teenagers who scoff at his realness before busting his lip and snatching his jewelry and wallet. A dash into the nearby woods — a nod to the episode’s title (“Woods”) and a metaphor for his mental state — to avoid being shot leads Paper Boi to an old man, another likely apparition. The man violently forces him to “make the decision”: Is he going to accept his celebrity and alter his life accordingly or is he going to die trying to maintain his sense of regularity?

On this week’s “Run That Back,” Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss Paper Boi’s awakening, how losing a degree of realness is a means of economic survival for black folks, and the internal wars that force us all to confront our ghosts.

Sierra drives past the strip club where she used to dance and wonders aloud if she and Paper Boi had ever encountered each other before they became famous. If they did, she’s sure that she’d have brushed him off as a “broke ass nigga,” and he agrees. He probably thought she was a “stuck up ho with too many stretch marks.” She laughs off the comment, and begins a spiel about how she likes hanging with him because he gets what it’s like to be famous. It’s the first hint at an interesting dynamic between the two — she’s Paper Boi’s biggest cheerleader but also his unwelcome life coach, who knows how to work the online fame machine in her favor in a way he doesn’t. She insists he care more about his money and, most importantly, the celebrity that has come along with it. But he doesn’t take her wisdom well and abruptly ends the day by storming out of a nail salon where they’re getting pedicures. The impetus: she snapped a photo of him without asking.

Taryn: Paper Boi. Al. The nigga that kept getting got this episode. Let’s discuss.

Julia: I pray I never have a day as bad as Paper Boi’s Tuesday afternoon was. Don’t ask me how I know it was a Tuesday, I just feel that it was in my spirit.

Taryn: I keep telling folks that Tuesday is the worst day of the week. You could also tell it was Tuesday cause the nail salon wasn’t packed, but we’ll get there in a minute.

Julia: Wow, that’s how I knew it was Tuesday. That empty salon looked familiar.

Taryn: HELLO! I knew I wasn’t alone on that one. This episode was a damn doozy from jump.

Julia: It was. Paper Boi just wanted to hang out with Sierra, an Instagram-famous woman he was considering sleeping with, and it took an ugly turn. But let’s start with him lying on the couch and his mama cussing him out.

To me, that opening scene of him laying on the couch, sleeping all day, the house is dirty, he’s being short when people ask how he is, etc. ― Paper Boi is depressed. Incredibly so. And I know this because WHEW HAVE I BEEN THERE.

Taryn: That was so triggering. You know how many mornings I’ve woken up to getting cussed out about not cleaning?

And that’s a really good point that confirms my belief that his mom really wasn’t there. He was either dreaming or imagining his mom because that’s how she probably used to talk to him in the mornings when he was younger, living with her, when times were simpler and he didn’t have to make these complicated, messy decisions about how he was gonna take control of his life/career.

Julia: I don’t think his mom was really there either. I think she was an apparition ― the first of two this episode, but we’ll get to that later.

Taryn: Oh, we sure will get there. This episode also reminded me of his past interactions at the streaming company and at Clark County’s studio. His primary concern was “keeping it real” while “being all about that paper, boy.” Those two can rarely exist together unless you’re Cardi B, like you told me last night. Sierra tried to tell him that, but he thought she was just blowing smoke. He’s too busy trying to “keep it real” that he’s removed himself from the reality of how he’s perceived and the direction his career is going.

I was really excited when we saw Sierra. I thought they were about to be my new favorite hood couple when she picked him up in the big boy truck. That’s the hood bitch shit I live for!

Julia: I, too, live for that hood bitch shit. And Sierra, tbh, is the only person we’ve seen this season who gets him and who gets that you can’t keep it real and be famous. Fame, which we got into last episode, is all about the aesthetics and the perception. It’s like ole girl said, “It’s a simulation, Van. It’s all fake.”

Paper Boi has to understand that very few people are going to care that he’s Al and even less are going to care about his privacy. They care about Paper Boi. Just like people love Cardi B, but they don’t care about Belcalis. (Except us. We care.)

Taryn: We care so much about Belcalis. ❤️

Sierra was all about helping Paper Boi level up, which in turn, would help her level up. Her comments at the shoe shop about him getting new clothes ’cause no one wants to fan over a nigga in a loose-collar ass Polo, telling him he needs a new manager that knows how to make money moves, taking his crusty-toe ass to the nail salon, telling him to post more on IG. Sierra, though imperfect, moves with purpose, something Paper Boi doesn’t give a damn about. (See: Al blowing off Earn telling him to get those papers signed earlier in the episode.) Al thinks he’s about that paper, but Sierra is about that paper.

Julia: Exactly, and to be about the money is to lose a degree of your realness. It just is. Think about black people who infiltrate corporate America. How many of us are actually not gutta af? Black folks in all walks of life have to conform to the demands of white-dominated industries — at least initially. And, also, Al isn’t as interesting as Paper Boi. He’s not as compelling. He’s just a nigga in a Polo and cargo shorts. Is that fine? Yeah, for somebody who isn’t famous. And it’s like that kid said — with a mean “we bout to get this nigga” chuckle — before they robbed him, “Oh, so you keeping it real?” Keeping it real doesn’t get you anything in the public, except robbed twice in one season. Does that say A LOT about our society? Yes. But at the end of the day, GET MONEY BITCH (Khia voice).

TL;DR ― Be real at home.

Taryn: That part. He got so frustrated with Sierra telling him what’s really real about this money game that he ended up on his ass eating Krystal in a parking lot with a broken heart and wet socks. His pride wouldn’t even let him call an Uber cause he was that big mad. Shit, I’d be surprised if Paper Boi even had the app since he wanna be so damn real.

Also, special shoutout to Sierra for this line: “Everybody wanna be a black girl, but the black girls ain’t making money from it.”

Julia: Give her a fucking Emmy. Another Emmy-winning line: “Permission? Nigga, you famous.” I was shouting, “LET HIM KNOW!”

Taryn: She may be rude af to people with service jobs, but she gets everything else!

Julia: She’s incredibly rude, which ... I don’t understand the relevance of her being rude, but I know for a fact that she had to be rude, because I know women like her and they’re just rude!

Taryn: Yea, I chalked it up to the same thing.

Julia: Yeah, so let’s not get into nail shop politics, when people speak their native language and how black people react. I’ll just say people should be able to speak whatever language they feel most comfortable speaking and Sierra was on 10. And now let’s move on to the Krystal parking lot.

FX NETWORKS

After storming out of the nail salon, Paper Boi stops at Krystal — a Southern staple — to grab a burger. He gets a text from an unsaved number saying they’re thinking about him, another check-in he shrugs off. He continues on his walk home and encounters three teens who are discussing the latest “Star Wars” movie. Their demeanor is a little odd. They don’t seem genuinely enthused to see Paper Boi — which differs vastly from other encounters with fans this season — and the scene feels as though the trio were waiting on his arrival. They inquire why he’s alone with no car and Al, nervously, counters with his own question of whether he’s allowed to walk. The teens inch closer to him with one saying through a cartoonish smile, in an unprovoked reference to his conversation with Sierra, “Oh, you keeping it real? That’s what’s up!” They slowly surround him, smiling, before one throws ice in his face as the other sucker punches him and the third pulls out a gun. The rapper fights off the kids who make off with his watch and his chain. He headbutts the one holding the gun before dashing into the woods to avoid getting shot.

Julia: Have you ever had a Krystal burger? They so good that one time, when I was visiting my parents in Georgia, me and my stepdad went and didn’t tell my mom. And she KIRKED. We tried to sneak the bag in the house but it didn’t work. We got busted.

Taryn: See. Y’all wrong af for that. You know Krystal is too damn good.

Julia: She should’ve rode out with us! We asked her if she wanted anything. She said no, so we assumed that meant Krystal as well.

But after he had his Krystal burger, Paper Boi kept walking and ran into some teenagers. And got his watch snatched. And his chain. And he almost got shot. Like you said last night, this is when keeping it real went wrong.

I also think Sierra set him up.

Taryn: Do tell. 👁

Julia: So, this is my conspiracy theory. When Paper Boi walks up on the trio of teens, something about it feels off. It’s like they aren’t genuinely excited to see him as his fans usually are. Their body language is weird and they’re talking like bad actors, like they rehearsed this or something. It wasn’t a natural encounter. But the tip was when ole boy with the gun says, “Oh, you keeping it real?” completely unprovoked. How would he know that Paper Boi walking was an attempt to keep it real, which is what he told Sierra basically, if she didn’t set him up?! And it’s not like she wasn’t acting cartoonish herself throughout their day.



Or, alternatively, when the other teen said, “I can’t wait to tell my brother about this!” maybe his brother recognized dickhead out walking alone and tipped them off. Either way, SOMEBODY SET HIM UP!

Taryn: Yea, their behavior definitely felt off from jump. I just wonder if it was Sierra’s doing or not. I’m leaning toward his brother ― or someone else ― but I wouldn’t put it past Sierra cause she’s strategic as hell. I also think he might’ve said, “Oh, you keeping it real?” on his own just thinking about the Glover brothers’ method of threading things together by way of repetition via different vessels. Like the humming from his mom, then late, from the old man. Or Teddy Perkins slamming his hand on the piano as his father did in the home video a couple episodes ago. Might be a reach, but I feel like they might be making a larger point about what happens when you don’t listen to the universe. Facing fucked-up shit is cyclical and not always from the same source.

Julia: That makes more sense than my conspiracy.



Taryn: LMAO I have a deep appreciation for a good conspiracy theory, though.



Julia: Thank you. I feel seen.

Taryn: But that young boy saying, “Oh you keeping it real? That’s what’s up.” was like him saying “Bet, you just like any other nigga? So we bout to rob your ass as soon as the Marta passes.” Though I’ve never gotten robbed at gunpoint as the train goes by, the scene felt so familiar, and so triggering. My heart rate was UP.

Julia: When they asked if he was by himself I knew he was about to get robbed at gunpoint. But Paper Boi, in true real nigga form, grabbed the gun. I was impressed tbh because I just would’ve ran them my shit. I’m not dying over a chain, a phone, money. Nah.

“Give me your phone.” hands over phone, which is the bane of my existence anyway so thanks for the favor lowkey, don’t shoot me.

I’m gonna get a new iPhone next year anyway so Midas Whale just turn it over. Shoutout to the upgrade-every-year plan.

Taryn: CHILE! Stressing me OUT. That struggle with the gun had me shook. I guess I get it cause he’d been robbed earlier in the season and he’s a big nigga so maybe he thought he could take them on. It just wouldn’t have been me. Then I couldn’t take him running into the woods for his life. And we begin to see this recurring horror trope this season has been fond of using.

Julia: Him grabbing the gun, to me, was symbolic of his priorities. Paper Boi cares deeply about respect (as many ppl from the hood do because it’s understood that disrespecting someone can get you hurt). He cared enough about his chain, his watch and his pride to grab the gun, headbutt the kid, then go looking for them once he collected himself in the woods. But he doesn’t care enough to do what’s required to protect himself and his fame and prevent this from happening? He doesn’t care enough to accept that this will keep happening unless he levels up and accepts the perceptions of him and his fame? OK, Paper Boi. You got it, sis.

And the horror trope. They are really killing it. it’s such an effective way to explore the mind states of black Americans.

Taryn: HELLO! Also, when I saw this episode was entitled “Woods,” I surely thought it was gonna be about Backwoods. That’s the black in me, though.

Julia: I’m honestly speechless, Taryn. But, never change.

Taryn: I wouldn’t have been keeping it real if I didn’t admit that.

Julia: ljhsDGFDEFCJDSHFC. Can someone sucker-punch me? I’m so fed up. I’ll just hand over my phone.

Taryn: Unlike Al, however, I know how real to keep it while still getting to this check. And THAT’S what’s really real.

Julia: I love that meme of Rihanna so much it hurts.

FX NETWORKS

In the woods, Paper Boi encounters an old man humming a gospel tune. The old man could be homeless, lost or a figment of Al’s imagination. Al tells the guy that he’s just passing through and he doesn’t want any trouble. But the old man follows Al through the woods, taunting him, asking him if he wants some money or some ChapStick and, at one point, apologizing for being high. In one instance, Al grabs the old man and tells him to back off, to which the man responds with a deep look of concern in his eyes, “You is just like your mama.” Fear invades Al’s face leaving us to wonder if he knows this old man from somewhere — or if it’s a clear nod to the old man’s status as an apparition — though the old man just laughs it off. Eventually, Al takes a seat and says he needs a moment to think. The old man tells Al that thinking is an impossible task causing Al to lash out and ask, again, to be left the fuck alone. The old man, baffled at the disrespect, puts a box cutter to Al’s neck, delivers a mean word of wisdom about making critical decisions and gives Al 30 seconds to get out of the woods before he hurts the rapper.

Taryn: That old man was the realest character in this episode, tbh. We’re introduced to him by his humming at first. I didn’t get the significance of the negro spiritual hum until I went back and rewatched it and saw that Al’s mom was humming in the opening scene. The man in the woods represented so much: his mom’s wisdom, the guiding light necessary for his internal conflict and his mental health.

I’d even argue that he represents the ancestors. We see the dead deer (another “Get Out” reference) that wasn’t able to make it out of the woods for whatever reason. If Al wants to survive, he has to learn from those who came before him and stop being so damn stubborn, like the old man told him.

Julia: The humming of the same (or at least similar) tune is what led me to believe the old man was an apparition along with a mumbled line from him I missed on my first watch: “Don’t think you can out-slip me.” He represented Al’s internal conflict with accepting his fame just like the woods represented the direness of this transitional moment Al is in. And when Al passed the dead deer again, I realized that he was walking in circles — just like he was in his life — and that refusal to push forward out of the woods would kill him one way or another.

I found this line really telling as well: “Make the decision. Keep standing still, you gone boy. You wasting time and the only people who got time are dead. And if you dead, I’m gon’ take them shoes. And your wallet. And that shirt.”

And the fact that Al ran straight out of the woods once the man started his countdown tells me that the answer was always straight in front of him. No circles required.

Taryn: Yes! Literally lost and he didn’t know it until that point. My mom always says that the answers are always in front of you, you just gotta stop being so damn stubborn and see it. It took a long day of getting dumped, robbed at gunpoint, lost in the woods and almost getting his throat slit to get him to realize it, but he finally did. He finally made “the decision” that I’m sure had been lingering in his head for forever. He just chose to ignore it. He finds himself in the gas station and runs into a fan who recognizes him. He asks if he wants a selfie and, alas, we have the awakening of Paper Boi.

I just wonder a) when he’s gonna try to get back with Sierra and b) when he’s gonna fire Earn and get a new manager.

Julia: Yes. He finally accepts that Al and Paper Boi are the same nigga. And, oh yeah, this episode confirmed that he is absolutely going to fire Earn. He can’t be Paper Boi and have Earn as his manager. Earn is Al’s manager.

Taryn: Exactly! I just hope he doesn’t switch up on Darius. I also hope that after this long-ass day, Darius saved him some of that toe jam tortellini he made cause I know that burger didn’t hold him over burning all them calories in the woods all day.

Julia: Nah that lil Krystal burger gone.

Taryn: Also, I wanna give another special shoutout to the old man in the woods for humming the “Golden Girls” theme song while drinking a Mad Dog. And for offering Paper Boi ChapStick but telling him not to put his lips on it. Those moments made me smile through the stress.

Julia: My granddaddy used to drink Mad Dog, the red one, which was incredibly comforting.

One last thing. I read in Vulture that all the older black men this season have been ghosts in some way: “Ghosts of themselves, as with Teddy Perkins. Ghosts of their children, as with Darius. Ghosts of what they could’ve been, as Earn notes of his uncle. And now, Al has come into contact with his own ghost — although what he’s a conduit for, specifically, no one can say. All we know for certain is that Al wants nothing to do with him.”

It’s kind of wild that everyone this season is dealing with a ghost. Something is following all of them and I’m interested to see how this all ties together in the end (or if it does).

Taryn: Wow. That makes so much sense. The same thing that you let haunt you will rob you if you don’t take control. Everyone is looking for that control, but no one really knows how to achieve it because they haven’t addressed what’s haunting them. Shit, that blows my mind.

Julia: The gag is that that’s life. Real or fake, that’s life.

Taryn: Whew!California State Assembly member Evan Low introduced a bill that seeks to make advertising conversion therapy a fraudulent business practice in California. NurPhoto via Getty Images

California lawmakers are considering a bill that would make selling or advertising gay conversion therapy a violation of the state’s consumer fraud laws.

The state Assembly passed Bill 2943 on Thursday. The legislation, which targets the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation, now heads to the state Senate. If enacted, the bill would make “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts” to the list of fraudulent business practices already banned in California.

Assemblyman Evan Low, a leader of the legislature’s LGBT Caucus, proposed the bill.

“This is a very personal issue to me,” Low said before the vote on the Assembly floor. “This notion that we would accept as a legal practice that conversion therapy works is antithetical to my very existence in this body.”

Major mental health associations have thoroughly discredited conversion therapy. The American Psychological Association has said that attempts to change sexual orientation through therapy have “serious potential to harm young people.”

A 2012 law already bars mental health providers from attempting conversion therapy on minors, The Associated Press reported. Low’s bill seeks to offer consumer protections to adults who accuse people of defrauding them by advertising sexual orientation change efforts.

Several Republican Assembly members were concerned that the bill would infringe upon the right to freedom of religion. They cited the ability of churches to sell books about conversion therapy, for example, or invite a therapist to speak about the subject at a church event.

“This is a bill that would be overturned by a higher court on the grounds of the First Amendment,” Assemblyman Matthew Harper, a Republican, said.

Low said that the bill is limited to conversion therapy offered as a service in exchange for monetary compensation. He said it would not prevent people from speaking or writing on the subject, and it would not apply to the sale of books.

“You can still try to pray the gay away if you’d like, but it hasn’t proved to be effective,” said Assemblywoman Susan Talamantes Eggman, a Democrat who supports the bill. “To advertise that you can change someone’s orientation is simply that — fraudulent.”

The bill has the support of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Psychological Association, and civil rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign. Conservative religious rights groups, such as the California Family Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom, are opposing the legislation.

Low told California’s Assembly members on Thursday that he too had wondered if he could change his sexual orientation as a teenager. He said he ultimately suffered from depression and experienced suicidal thoughts.

“Growing up with so much hate, I too wanted to find out if I could be changed and if anything could work because of the societal pressures that we have,” he said during an emotional speech on the floor. “There is nothing wrong with me. There is nothing that needs to be changed.”President Donald Trump floated the idea of jailing journalists to stop leaks from the White House, former FBI Director James Comey wrote in a memo last year in which he recalled an encounter with the president. The document was published by various news outlets on Thursday just hours after the Department of Justice released copies to congressional leaders.

“The president then wrapped up our conversation by returning to the issue of finding leakers,” Comey wrote in the document, dated Feb. 14, 2017. “I said something about the value of putting a head on a pike as a message. He replied by saying it may involve putting reporters in jail.”

″‘They spend a couple days in jail, make a new friend, and they are ready to talk,’” Comey recounted the president saying. “I laughed as I walked to the door Reince Priebus had opened.”

The New York Times first reported the encounter last May.

The Justice Department sent the memo copies to top lawmakers after some threatened to subpoena the agency to obtain them. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the Justice Department decided to do so after determining their release “would not adversely impact any ongoing investigation.”

They were quickly leaked to various media outlets who published the redacted versions in full. They contained little information that hadn’t been made public during congressional testimony or in Comey’s new memoir, but they touched on a variety of topics reported since Comey’s firing last May.

Trump has long fought against the press, branding national media outlets like CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post as “fake news”

Late Thursday, Trump tweeted that Comey’s memos proved there was “NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION” regarding the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.

“Also, he leaked classified information. WOW!” Trump wrote. “Will the Witch Hunt continue?”

The Jerusalem-born “Black Swan” actress was scheduled to accept the Genesis Prize, a so-called Jewish Nobel, in June, but the Genesis Prize Foundation said in a news release on Thursday that a rep for Portman explained the Oscar winner would not attend because of “recent events in Israel.”

The foundation quoted Portman’s rep as saying that “recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing” to the actress, and that “she cannot in good conscience move forward with the ceremony.”

Portman later posted her own statement:

A post shared by Natalie Portman (@natalieportman) on Apr 20, 2018 at 3:37pm PDT

The prize was established in 2013 to honor those who inspire Jewish values. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, actor Michael Douglas and violinist Itzhak Perlman are among its winners.

The foundation said it respected Portman’s right to disagree with the policies of the Israeli government, but was saddened that political reasons would prevent her participation.

“We fear that Ms. Portman’s decision will cause our philanthropic initiative to be politicized, something we have worked hard for the past five years to avoid,” the foundation said.

Portman’s announcement follows Israel’s response to demonstrations along the Gaza border this month, killing dozens of Palestinians. Portman, who said she was proud of her Israeli roots and Jewish heritage after hearing in November that she would receive the prize, has been critical of Netanyahu.
