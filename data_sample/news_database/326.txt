We know “gotta catch ’em all” is a Pokemon thing, but OMG we need these “A Wrinkle in Time” Barbies in our lives immediately.

In case you weren’t excited enough for the upcoming film adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s beloved children’s book, we’ve been blessed with our first look at a trio of dolls modeled after actresses Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling.

In the film, they play Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who, respectively, and guide the book’s 13-year-old hero, Meg Murry, through the universe to save her father.

The film’s director, Ava DuVernay, who also has her own Barbie, shared a photo of the dolls on Wednesday, adding that seeing the characters in plastic holds a special importance for her.

“When Disney makes Barbies of your movie’s characters and you just want to stare at them all day in disbelief because you loved Barbies as a girl but never had any like these,” she wrote on Twitter.

The new merchandise cast its spell on fans on social media, with many joyfully reacting to the dolls’ diversity.

Warren spoke at the annual gathering of the consumer advocacy group Families USA. She emphasized that she wholeheartedly supports efforts to expand public health insurance programs, including a “single-payer” bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would expand Medicare to the entire population.

But in the meantime, Warren said, the federal government needs to impose new standards on private insurers to build on the accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

“Private insurance companies are failing the American people. We all know it,” Warren said. “And whatever public alternatives you support, there is no reason on earth for us to continue allowing the health care of the American people to be held hostage by an industry that both attacks any new health care proposals and, at the same time, refuses to do any better.”

Warren’s speech laid out a three-part plan to rein in insurance companies: Crack down on the practice of shifting costs onto consumers; force private insurers to provide coverage as affordable as Medicare and Medicaid; and “call their bluff” if they resist complying with the first two planks.

For the first component, Warren would forbid insurance practices that she dubbed “cheat[ing] people,” including drawing narrow boundaries for the network of health care providers they cover and rescinding coverage of certain drugs in the middle of the year.

In the second part, Warren would subject private insurers to stricter cost and quality guidelines in order to achieve parity with Medicare and Medicaid. The senator noted that Medicare and Medicaid provide better value to consumers, covering 84 cents for every dollar of health costs, compared to private exchange plans, which tend to cover 60 to 70 cents for every dollar of costs.

The third plank, which is effectively Warren’s enforcement mechanism, is likely the most innovative idea.

Borrowing from a model already in place in New York, Warren proposes requiring private insurers that bid on Medicare Advantage or Medicaid contracts to participate in the ACA exchanges.

Private insurers have frequently lost money on their ACA exchange plans, but they’ve profited handsomely from their participation in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage.

“If they want to bid on the really juicy federal health care contracts, they should have to offer a basic private insurance plan for individuals as well, even if those exchange plans aren’t quite as juicy for their investors,” Warren said. “And if some insurance companies really, truly aren’t willing to provide high-quality, affordable coverage in exchange for billions of dollars in federal subsidies and access to Medicare and Medicaid ― if they really, truly want to pick up their toys and go home because their bazillion-dollar profits aren’t high enough ― then I say good riddance.”

The Families USA conference is frequently the site of important policy announcements by likely presidential contenders. Then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) used his 2007 speech to the group to present his vision for universal health care.

Defending the ACA was a priority of progressive lawmakers and activists for much of 2017. Their efforts succeeded in scuttling several Republican attempts to repeal the law’s essential components.

But President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have continued to undermine the ACA’s protections, most recently by using their tax legislation to end the individual insurance mandate. And even before the latest sabotage efforts, the landmark health care law had still left 28 million Americans uninsured and millions more underinsured.

So the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and the potential presidential candidates who claim its mantle have now set their sights on more ambitious reform ideas that they could implement if the party retakes the White House in 2020. These lawmakers and activists maintain that the ACA’s biggest vulnerabilities are rooted in its relatively conservative attempt to achieve universal coverage within the bounds of the private insurance system.

Sanders, whose 2016 presidential bid vaulted single-payer into the political mainstream, held a live digital town hall about “Medicare for all” on Tuesday that drew more than 1 million viewers in real time.

Warren, a battle-scarred Wall Street foe widely considered the most progressive sitting senator after Sanders, is evidently trying to make her own mark on health care policy.

Her speech to Families USA highlighted her own rhetorical style and policy emphases. She began with a deeply personal anecdote ― the kind Sanders tends to eschew ― about how, when she was a child, her family was permanently set back financially because of expenses related to her father’s heart attack.

As a former law professor whose research found that medical bills were a leading cause of household bankruptcies, Warren is more interested in the details of technocratic fixes to the ACA than are many Medicare-for-all warriors like Sanders. On Thursday, she rattled off statistic after statistic demonstrating the success of the Massachusetts health model, such as the fact that it has “the second-lowest premiums in the ACA market of any state in the country.”

Warren’s rhetorical balance is likely to please some of the influential policy wonks and liberal leaders uncomfortable with what they see as Medicare-for-all advocates’ vagueness about how to achieve their dream system.

At the same time, Warren, like her more populist counterparts, makes clear that she views the profit motive itself as the greatest obstacle to universal coverage.

“Why can’t middle class families get good coverage at an affordable price?” Warren asked on Thursday.WASHINGTON ― How did a fairly obscure freshman Republican senator from Louisiana suddenly become one of the most quotable people in Washington?

For John Neely Kennedy, it was easier than pulling a greased string through a goose. Or perhaps it was easier than shucking corn in a henhouse. Or maybe it was just easier than drinking weed killer.

Since being elected to the Senate a year ago, Kennedy, previously the longtime state treasurer of Louisiana, has made a name for himself on Capitol Hill with his wit, humor and penchant for folksy expressions ― a notable feat in a place where jargon and arcane procedure tend to reign supreme.

At a time when many of his colleagues are using modern forms of media to communicate with their constituents ― e.g., Twitter ― Kennedy has managed to command viral headlines with little more than Southern wisdom and a Pelican State drawl, distilling events of the day into blunt terms regular people can understand.

“Our country was founded by geniuses, but it’s being run by idiots,” Kennedy said dismissively last week, as a government shutdown loomed. “I think most Americans are wondering how some folks up here made it through the birth canal.”

A former member of the Democratic Party, the Oxford-educated Kennedy ― no relation to those other Kennedys you may have heard about ― worked as a trial lawyer and later served as legal counsel in the 1980s to then-Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer (D). He switched parties in 2008 in order to mount a challenge to then-Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat. But he didn’t win office until scandal-plagued former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) decided not to run for re-election in 2016.

Kennedy has acquired a bit of a reputation as an easy mark on Capitol Hill ― at least among the press. He loves talking to reporters, and reporters love talking to him because he’s notoriously quotable. While other senators, like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), for example, usually shun the Capitol Hill press corps, Kennedy tends to post up in a hallway and dutifully answer question after question on just about any topic.

It’s a welcome trend in a legislative body that has grown more cautious and guarded in recent years.

“It’s like a circus without a tent,” Kennedy said of the Senate this week.

Kennedy’s greatest hits ― like the “weed killer” line ― came during last year’s debates regarding health care and tax cuts. But he’s provided some of his most memorable one-liners in recent weeks as well.

When nearly all of Washington seemed to erupt over President Donald Trump reportedly referring to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” earlier this month, Kennedy likened the ensuing nastiness to “The Jerry Springer Show” and even quipped that the drama between his colleagues may be hampering Earth’s chances of contact with extraterrestrial life.

“That’s why the aliens won’t talk to us,” Kennedy told reporters, referring to the bipartisan blame game over the president’s comments. “They look at us and say, ‘These people... they’re 13-year-olds.’”

He later described a recent meeting at the White House with Trump as “very positive,” adding that “no one called anybody an ignorant slut or anything.” The line was a reference a “Saturday Night Live” catchphrase from the 1970s.

Lawmakers often berate the nation’s capital in broad strokes as a way to curry favor with folks back home. But Kennedy ― who ran for Senate twice before finally succeeding in 2016 ― upped the ante when he used some choice language to describe the city last year amid negotiations over the GOP tax plan.

“This is Washington, D.C.,” Kennedy said in December. “Politics is in everybody’s blood, kind of like herpes.”

Kennedy has directed witticisms at his fellow Republicans, as well. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), for example, is “tougher than a $3 steak,” according to Kennedy, while Sen. John McCain, who is still recovering from cancer surgery in Arizona, is “tough as a boiled owl.”

GOP senators said this week that Kennedy is proving to be one of their most effective messengers ― a surprising turn of events, given how little time he has spent in Washington.

“Well, when he’s awake, he’s awesome,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) quipped this week. “He has a good way of using humor to make a point. One of the most effective things you can do in politics ― [Ronald] Reagan was really good at this ― is you use humor at the right time.”

“In a place not known for being witty, he’s witty,” added Graham, who has a similar reputation and ought to know. “But in the Senate, to be witty the bar is low.”

Kennedy isn’t all hat and no cattle, though. Despite his lack of seniority, which determines one’s place in the Senate pecking order, the senator has had several standout performances at committee hearings.

In October, Kennedy drew plaudits from both parties when he said the IRS contracting the hacked company Equifax to combat fraud was like giving actress Lindsay Lohan ― who’s had her troubles ― “the keys to the minibar.”

And his incisive questioning during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing ― Kennedy spent years working as a corporate and civil trial attorney ― humiliated a Trump district judge nominee in a clip that went viral last month.

“Just because you’ve seen [the movie] ‘My Cousin Vinny’ doesn’t qualify you to be a federal judge,” Kennedy said to nominee Matthew Petersen, who admitted during the hearing that he had never tried a case or argued a motion in court.

While he is a strong Trump supporter, Kennedy has been one of the few Republicans critical of his judicial nominees, saying at one point that the president is getting some “very, very bad advice” on judicial nominations.

“It’s not just talk,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said of Kennedy. “There is substance to what he suggests. There aren’t a lot of people that can do that.”

While he is one of the most conservative members of the Senate ― especially on gun control, social issues and the environment ― Kennedy has been known to vote against expectations. He was one of just two Republicans to oppose a bill last year that nullified an Obama-era regulation allowing consumers to band together and sue banks or credit card companies.

Earlier this month, Kennedy nearly joined Democrats in blocking a hotly contested surveillance bill that extended powerful spying tools authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. After nearly 30 minutes of drama and debate with his GOP colleagues, Kennedy relented and voted to reauthorize the law, in part, he later said, because the Senate has a hard enough time governing without him rocking the boat.

For now, it seems Kennedy is becoming more accustomed to the daily whiplash of Washington, and that he’s dealing with it on his own terms.Some state officials want to take action to protect their residents against the FCC’s decision to repeal net neutrality.

By Jenni Bergal

While Congress wrestles with whether to restore net neutrality rules after the Federal Communications Commission scrapped them last month, a growing number of states have decided to take on the issue themselves.

Legislators in at least 15 states, from California to Rhode Island, have introduced bills that would create state net neutrality laws or use other approaches to require that internet service providers follow net neutrality requirements in some way to ensure an open and equal internet.

Last week, nearly two dozen state attorneys general, all of them Democrats, filed a lawsuit to block the FCC’s rollback of net neutrality. And just this week, Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the first governor to mandate that internet service providers that sign state contracts follow net neutrality standards.

“Net neutrality is going to be a big issue for states in 2018. We expect more and more bills to be filed,” said Danielle Dean, a policy director for the National Conference of State Legislatures. “The issue will be contentious, and there will be heated conversations about what role states should take.”

But any state that enacts net neutrality legislation should expect major legal obstacles, because the FCC ruling also prohibited state and local governments from adopting their own rules. Internet service providers — who largely support the FCC’s move — would likely challenge state restrictions, and they could be joined by the federal agency.

Net neutrality rules, approved by the FCC in 2015, during the Obama administration, required internet service providers such as Verizon and AT&T to treat all content equally. Providers were prohibited from blocking, slowing down or prioritizing web traffic from some sites or apps, and giving preferential treatment to their own content over rivals’ — or to content from those willing to pay extra fees.

The Federal Communications Commission’s December decision to do away with the rules was cheered by the broadband and wireless industries and some conservative groups — and bitterly opposed by consumer groups and tech companies such as Google and Facebook.

Supporters of the decision argue that, with fewer regulatory burdens, internet providers will be able to make greater investments in innovation and broadband infrastructure, leading to faster networks for consumers and businesses. They say consumers’ internet experience won’t change.

“We do not and will not block, throttle [slow down], or discriminate against lawful content,” said Comcast’s senior executive vice president, David Cohen, in a blog post on the eve of the FCC vote.

Comcast and some other major internet providers have said they also do not plan to speed up delivery of some online content, creating fast lanes for those who pay more, but they wouldn’t rule out the possibility.

“Maybe they won’t, but the point is they could,” said Jonathan Schwantes, a lobbyist for Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group that supports net neutrality. “We think government has a role to play to protect consumers.”

Schwantes and other opponents of the FCC decision argue that doing away with net neutrality destroys the concept of a level playing field and will hurt both free speech and access to information. They worry small businesses and startups that can’t afford to pay for faster download speeds will be stuck in the slow lane and unable to compete.

It’s a contentious issue, and Congress already has entered the fray.

As of mid-January, all 49 senators in the Democratic caucus and one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, supported a measure to overturn the FCC ruling and restore net neutrality. If one more Republican signs on, the measure would reach the simple majority it needs to pass. It then would have to be approved in the House, where it could face an uphill battle, and be signed into law by President Donald Trump.

Many state lawmakers and attorneys general aren’t waiting for Capitol Hill.

Some legislators have filed broad bills that would require internet service providers to practice net neutrality in their states. Others have crafted more narrow legislation, such as allowing state contracts only with internet providers that have been certified to meet net neutrality requirements or defining net neutrality violations as unfair trade practices.

“A free and open internet is at the heart of a 21st century democracy and economy. The idea that an internet service provider will decide whether to block a website or slow it down is unacceptable,” said California Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, one of the legislators leading the charge. Wiener has introduced a bill that would require telecom companies that do business in his state to meet net neutrality requirements.

Wiener said he is collaborating with legislators in New York and other states to shape the bill’s language into model legislation that would be “as strong and legally defensible as possible.”

While most legislative efforts in the states are being led by Democrats, it’s a different story in Washington state.

“In our state Legislature, we have bipartisan support for protecting net neutrality,” said Republican state Rep. Norma Smith, whose bill would prohibit internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic or offering paid fast lanes.

Smith, who represents a rural district in Washington, said her constituents, both Republicans and Democrats, have been “very vocal” about this issue.

“Like those in many rural areas, they may not have a choice about internet providers, and they are quite concerned,” Smith said. “Many are working from home or are engaged in the economy online. We want people in rural communities to participate fully, and the concern is that they would not be able to in the future if they don’t have the acceptable internet speeds to do that.”

Millions of Americans have access to only one broadband provider; that’s especially true in rural areas and small cities. If residents are unhappy about slow service, they can’t just switch to another plan, Smith said.

“We’re afraid residents will face slower services for higher prices,” said Christopher Mitchell, who directs internet policy at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit that advocates for local businesses.

State and Local Impact

One of the most contentious battles likely will be fought over the FCC’s decision to prohibit state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality laws and regulations.

A week before the FCC’s vote, 68 mayors and county officials wrote to the Federal Communications Commission that they were strongly opposed to the net neutrality rollback and “deeply disturbed by the Commission’s efforts to preempt our ability to protect consumers and businesses in our communities.”

The FCC didn’t agree, and, led by Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, it repealed net neutrality in a 3-2 party-line vote. The commission included the preemption rule.

“Broadband service is not confined to state boundaries and should not be constrained by a patchwork of state and local regulations,” said Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, a Republican, at the FCC’s December meeting.

Internet service providers supported the FCC ruling and say states shouldn’t be allowed to create their own net neutrality laws, just as they don’t get to regulate the transmission of TV and radio broadcasts.

“Crossing state lines doesn’t change your mobile experience,” said Scott Bergmann, a senior vice president at CTIA, a wireless industry trade group that represents companies such as AT&T and Verizon, in a recent blog post. “The laws governing that experience shouldn’t change either.”

He said the jumble of regulations would put investment at risk and ultimately harm customers. Some government officials don’t buy that argument.

“Preemption is the biggest issue for us,” said Angelina Panettieri, a lobbyist for the National League of Cities, which represents more than 19,000 cities, towns and villages.

Panettieri said many local officials worry about access to information for their residents. Universities or government networks that stream a lot of video such as council meetings or hearings, for example, could end up in the slow lane, she said, because they won’t be able to pay for fast-lane access, as big content companies will.

“That will leave a secondary tier for all other content creators,” she said. “That could be a city government or a local business in a city.”

Connecticut’s chief information officer, Mark Raymond, said he sees the FCC’s ruling as a potential barrier to effectively delivering government services. Simple government transactions, such as applying for unemployment benefits or renewing a car registration online, for example, could end up taking two or three times longer, he said.

“If internet providers decide to prioritize Netflix and ESPN over a government website because they’re paying a lot more money for bandwidth, then it will make it much more difficult for our citizens to have access to our services online,” he said.

But not all state CIOs agree with Raymond.

Tony Young, Wyoming’s chief information officer, said the repealed net neutrality rule was government overreach.

“I support access to the internet. Everyone should have it,” Young said. “[But] it’s a marketplace decision. Government should not always be the solution or the arbitrator.”

Nor does Young think the FCC ruling will have an impact on government services in Wyoming. “It might change economic models for the businesses operating in the state,” he said, “but for our operations and what we do, I don’t see that it’s going to change anything.”

Legal Fights

Many of the disputes over net neutrality likely will wind up in the courts.

Last week, a coalition of 22 state attorneys general, led by New York’s Eric Schneiderman, filed a lawsuit to block the FCC’s rollback of net neutrality regulations, which the suit called “arbitrary and capricious.” The FCC declined to comment.

Public interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge also have filed lawsuits challenging the FCC ruling. So has tech company Mozilla, as well as the Open Technology Institute, an arm of the New America think tank.

The Internet Association, a trade group that represents tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, has announced that it too will join the upcoming legal fight.

States that ignore the preemption rule and enact their own net neutrality legislation also may be challenged in court by broadband companies and others.

But even as evidence keeps emerging of Russian meddling, the more flagrant finagling of our politics may be coming from our own representatives.

The process is called gerrymandering, where state lawmakers redraw boundaries for U.S. House and state legislative seats to benefit their party in elections. It’s a time-honored tradition, but in the computer age it’s been honed to an egregious art.

On Monday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that state’s congressional map to be illegal, declaring it went too far in helping Republican candidates.

Bee suggested that 32-year-old Miller, who is one of President Donald Trump’s key advisers on immigration issues, is “the exact same racist asshole he’s been since childhood.”

“Who is this enterprising slime mold on the Wonder Bread of democracy?” asked Bee, as she played footage of Miller blasting janitors during a student president run in high school.

At just 16 months old, Ethan Dvash-Banks had been living in the U.S. legally on a tourist visa until it expired last month. His twin brother, Aiden, has a U.S. passport.

The boys were born via a surrogate in 2016. Ethan’s biological father is Elad Dvash-Banks, an Israeli citizen living in the U.S. legally on a green card, and Aiden’s is Andrew Dvash-Banks, a U.S. citizen. The State Department determined that Ethan possessed no grounds for citizenship without a biological connection to a U.S. citizen.

Immigration Equality, an LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit, filed suit on behalf of Ethan on Monday, accusing the State Department of discriminating against same-sex binational couples. The group argues that because both parents are listed on the children’s birth certificates, both boys are eligible for U.S. citizenship.

“He should be treated just like any other child born to a U.S. citizen abroad,” Andrew Dvash-Banks said of Ethan.

The organization filed a second lawsuit involving two women, one from the U.S. and one from Italy, who were married in the U.K. and each gave birth to a child. The child born to the Italian woman was also denied citizenship.

“If a mother and father walk into a consulate and have a marriage certificate and birth certificate, they’re never asked any questions about the biology of the child,” Aaron Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, told The Associated Press. “But the converse is also true and every same-sex couple will be asked that.”

Elad and Andrew Dvash-Banks said they met in Tel Aviv and moved to Toronto so that they could wed legally in 2010, back when same-sex marriage wasn’t yet legal in the U.S. When the American Defense of Marriage Act was struck down three years later, they planned to relocate to the U.S., since their Canadian marriage certificate would be recognized by the U.S. government. They settled in Los Angeles after the twins were born in 2016, and Andrew sponsored Elad for a green card.

When they went to the U.S. consulate in Toronto, they found out they had to go through DNA testing to confirm which child was genetically related to whom.

“It was an awful moment for our whole family,” Andrew Dvash-Banks said.

The couple is hopeful that legal action will help other families confronting similar issues.After months of hiding out, Kylie Jenner has been spotted out in public for the first time since September.

TMZ published exclusive photos and video of the 20-year-old reality TV star on Thursday, clad in all-black, walking around a construction site in Hidden Hills, California. Kris Jenner and Jordyn Woods joined Jenner on the excursion.

Jenner has yet to officially confirm her pregnancy, though multiple outlets announced that she was pregnant in September and due sometime in February.

Jenner’s boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott, reportedly told friends they’re expecting a girl, according to TMZ.

Despite her hesitation to comment on the matter, Jenner did break her silence on certain rumors by shutting down the Daily Mail. The reality star accused the outlet of digitally altering photos of her “baby bump.”

“First of all if you’re going to photoshop my photos blogs/paps!! Check for the crooked lines in the background,” Jenner tweeted. “2nd photo is clearly altered.”

Bobby Berk, the interior design expert from Netflix’s “Queer Eye,” recently stopped by the AOL.com office to makeover my desk on behalf of Chase Ultimate Rewards ― and being the “hero” for a day was everything I’d hoped it would be and more.

Before Bobby showed up to clean up my work space, my desk at our New York office was simply overloaded with stuff. As an editor of the site, I get sent a lot of books and alcohol and other random knick-knacks and, because I live in New York and don’t have very much space in my apartment, I keep a lot of it at work ― that is, until Bobby gave his two cents.

As he showed on the incredible first season of “Queer Eye,” Bobby has a natural eye for design and what works best for a space ― regardless of how big it is. When he was done with my desk, it was simplified, sleek, decluttered and just overall more pleasant to work in.

More from AOL.com:WASHINGTON ― White House national security adviser John Bolton warned on Sunday that President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the international agreement over Iran’s nuclear program could result in sanctions on companies based in European nations that are critical U.S. allies.

“It’s possible,” Bolton said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program when host Jake Tapper asked him about that prospect. “It depends on the conduct of other governments.”

The 28-member European Union remains committed to the accord, and top E.U. members France, Britain and Germany helped negotiate the deal and signed it. Their leaders tried to persuade Trump not to abandon it.

The E.U. was Iran’s largest trade partner until 2012, when the Obama administration cobbled together a massive international sanctions regime on the Islamic Republic ― even bringing along China and Russia ― to force it to make concessions on the nuclear issue.

Since the deal went into effect in 2016, lifting some sanctions in exchange for Iran opening up its nuclear facilities for inspections and accepting limits on its enrichment of uranium, Europe-Iran trade has mushroomed and companies based in the E.U. have signed deals worth billions of dollars with Tehran.

“I think the Europeans will see that it’s in their interest, ultimately, to come along with us.”

By reimposing American sanctions, Trump placed those companies at risk because the U.S. might crack down on them in the America-centric global financial system and technology trade. The administration has given companies in different sectors different windows of between three and six months to cut off business with Iran. Bolton’s comments confirmed that after that, Trump is willing to subject them to penalties.

“The consequences of American sanctions go way beyond goods shipped by American companies because of our technology licenses to many other countries and businesses around the world. As those sanctions kick in, it will have an even broader effect as well,” he said. “I think the Europeans will see that it’s in their interest, ultimately, to come along with us.”

European officials are brainstorming ways to protect their countries’ business interests in Iran and also preserve the deal’s procedures to prevent Iranian nuclear weapons development by keeping economic benefits to the country flowing. But the Trump administration appears to agree with outside critics of the deal who say the Europeans will eventually realize the U.S. market is more important to them ― and give up on the landmark accord.

Trump has repeatedly said that he wants a “better” deal with Iran on the nuclear issue.

But allies’ increasing skepticism of any commitments by Trump and the way the weakening of the deal helps hard-liners in the Iranian government make it hard to imagine successful negotiations.

“Diplomacy isn’t Trump’s strong suit,” Stimson Center arms control expert Michael Krepon wrote recently. “Trashing Barack Obama’s accomplishments is.”

Bolton on Sunday reiterated the administration line that the U.S. wants to work with its partners in new ways to counter a whole range of Iranian activity ― from its nuclear development to its support for forces around the Middle East that often work against American interests.Lou Anna Simon resigned on Wednesday after 13 years as president of Michigan State University in the wake of a massive sexual assault scandal involving the disgraced sports team doctor Larry Nassar.

Calls for Simon to step down began with reports that MSU administration officials and law enforcement knew about Nassar’s behavior and failed to stop him. Following Nassar’s sentencing for sex crimes on Wednesday, a source told the MSU student newspaper, The State News, that Simon would step down from her position by Friday.

Simon posted her resignation announcement on the school’s website, where she addressed the statements of Nassar’s victims and the long justice process. She also minimized her role and previous knowledge of accusations against Nassar in 2014.

“As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,” Simon wrote. “I understand, and that is why I have limited my personal statements.”

The former university president wrote about her work at MSU and her desire to put the university first.

“I urge those who have supported my work to understand that I cannot make it about me now,” Simon continued. “Therefore, I am tendering my resignation as president according to the terms of my employment agreement.”

Earlier in the week, Joel Ferguson, vice chairman of the MSU board of trustees, said that Simon, whom he described as a good fundraiser, would not resign. Ferguson added that the university had more going on “than just this Nassar thing.”

Nassar was once a respected physician employed by both the university and USA Gymnastics, which is also facing fierce criticism over its failure to do something about the serial abuser long ago. Because he was known for treating Olympic athletes, Nassar’s patients felt pressured to accept that his inappropriate, ungloved touch was legitimate medical care.

Simon told the Detroit News that she knew about the abuse allegations in 2014 ― two years before Nassar was fired by the school ― when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed. School police investigated, but allowed Nassar to keep seeing patients. At least two student athletes had previously voiced complaints about him to university staff.

She said in her resignation that she’d planned to retire in December 2016, but decided against it when the Indianapolis Star broke the story of the allegations that year.

“I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth,” Simon told the News. The same article said that more than a dozen MSU staffers knew about the accusations of abuse and did nothing.

It’s clear that it’s in the best interest of these courageous survivors, their families, and our State for President Lou Anna Simon to resign. — Sen. Debbie Stabenow (@SenStabenow) January 24, 2018

Michigan’s two senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, called for Simon to resign on Wednesday. Both Democrats are alumni of the university.

Peters released a statement in which he emphasized the need for new leadership as MSU has a “long way to go in rebuilding trust.”

More than 150 young women said Nassar had molested them, including one girl who was just 6 at the time. Sometimes, they said, he even abused them when their parents were in the room during medical treatments.

On Jan. 24, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison after 169 survivors and family members spent a week reading statements in court about the impact his abuse has had on their lives. One of his former patients died by suicide; her mother read a statement on her behalf. The father of another girl Nassar abused killed himself, and his daughter suspects it was partly out of guilt because he didn’t initially believe her story.

Nassar, 54, previously received a 60-year sentence for possession of child pornography and is expected to spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Many of the women who read statements in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina’s Lansing, Michigan, courtroom blamed MSU and USA Gymnastics for failing to act sooner. Several USA Gymnastics officials resigned prior to Nassar’s sentencing. In an open-letter apology to the Team USA victims, the U.S. Olympic Committee also pledged to launch a third-party investigation into who enabled Nassar to commit his abuses for so long.

MSU faculty called for a vote of no confidence in the school’s leadership this week, while the student newspaper ran a front page demanding that Simon resign. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette plans to open an investigation into MSU’s role in the scandal.

The NCAA also announced that it would open an investigation into the university’s athletic department.

“Since my first day on the job as athletic director, my focus has always been on the student-athlete,” MSU Athletic Director Mark Hollis told HuffPost in a statement. “They are at the core of our athletic department mission statement. Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety. In regards to the letter we received from the NCAA last night, the athletic compliance and university general counsel offices are preparing a comprehensive response. Michigan State University will cooperate with any investigation.”

President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser is catching heat online after she deleted a line about being an “advocate for the education and empowerment of women and girls” from her Twitter profile over the weekend, per multiple reports.

Trump changed her bio from this:

Wife, mother, sister, daughter. Entrepreneur & advocate for the education and empowerment of women & girls. This is my personal page. Views expressed are my own.

To this:

Wife, mother, sister, daughter. Advisor to POTUS on job creation + economic empowerment, workforce development & entrepreneurship. Personal Pg. Views are my own

It’s unclear what prompted the alteration.

MSNBC journalist Stephanie Ruhle spotted the tweak on the same weekend that thousands of women around the world were taking part in the second annual Women’s March.

Ivanka Trump has previously been accused of being “complicit” with her father’s actions. The president has a history of misogyny and of making derogatory remarks to and about women.Oprah Winfrey said recently she had no interest in running for president in 2020, casting doubt on speculation about her political aspirations.

In an interview with InStyle editor-in-chief Laura Brown three weeks before her powerful Golden Globes speech earlier this month, the 63-year-old entertainment icon said she had met with someone who offered to help with a political campaign, but she shut them down. InStyle published the interview on Thursday.

“I’ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not,” Oprah said during the interview. “And so it’s not something that interests me. I don’t have the DNA for it. ... That’s not for me.”

Speculation about a potential Oprah 2020 presidential campaign began swirling this month following her Golden Globes speech.

Members of Oprah’s inner circle, including her longtime partner Stedman Graham and CBS’ Gayle King, hinted that she might consider running.

“It’s up to the people,” Graham told the Los Angeles Times when asked about a possible campaign. “She would absolutely do it.”

While there has been an outpouring of support for a President Oprah, the media mogul suggested during the InStyle interview that it wouldn’t be a good move for her personally.

“Gayle ― who knows me as well as I know myself practically ― has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, ‘When’s Oprah going to run?’” Oprah told Brown. “So Gayle sends me these things, and then she’ll go, ‘I know, I know, I know! It wouldn’t be good for you ― it would be good for everyone else.’”It’s been 10 years since the premiere of “Breaking Bad,” and we’re three seasons into “Better Call Saul,” so let’s face it: At this point, pretty much all lingering questions have been answered.

And we know all of this because Vince Gilligan, the creator of both shows, has repeatedly told us so.

But there is one question that remains, and it’s got people simultaneously scratching their heads and reaching for barf bags.

Why would someone ever drink chamomile tea with soy milk and stevia?

“Chamomile tea with soy milk, please, and I’ll need more stevia.”

Walter White’s business-associate-turned-enemy Lydia (Laura Fraser) uttered those haunting words in the penultimate “Breaking Bad” episode, “Granite State.”

The forbidden combination eventually led to her death, when Walter White switched out her stevia for ricin. Perhaps she could’ve survived, had her beverage order not been so unusually gross. Even nowadays, fans continue to talk about how it’s just so ... so gross.

If there is one thing I absolutely cannot tolerate about Breaking Bad is Lydia putting milk in chamomile tea. *Pukes* — Ekta (@SnoozeMode_) June 5, 2017

The most morally abhorrent character in Breaking Bad is Lydia, because she puts milk in her chamomile tea. — Jon Ashton (@Calicoville) January 27, 2016

So, yeah, all we’re left with is a question about “Breaking Bad” beverage choice. Is this a fandom high? Or is it a (Sweet’n) low?

Reporters have repeatedly asked the actor behind it all, Laura Fraser, about Lydia’s unholy concoction. Vulture said soy and chamomile “sounds awful,” GQ called it “really gross,” and The Guardian just outright asked, “What sort of monster drinks chamomile tea with soy milk”?

Fraser repeatedly claimed she didn’t know why Lydia made the order, admitting to Vulture that the writers “tell you nothing” and to GQ that “that should have been clue #1 there, of how deranged she was going to get.” Lydia is clearly “a monster,” she told The Guardian.

Her tea order is the danger! Netflix

Well, Lydia made her return to the “Breaking Bad” universe in Season 3 of “Better Call Saul.” So, during a recent chat with Gilligan, we thought it was the perfect opportunity to finally ask, “What’s up with the soy, chamomile and stevia combo?”

The “Breaking Bad” creator spilled the tea. All these years later, it turns out Lydia isn’t the monster. Gilligan is.

“Oh, I actually put milk in chamomile tea. A lot of people don’t, though, I guess. I guess you’re right. No, I don’t think there was any hidden message there,” he said, before adding something even more heinous. “You know my mom, when I was a kid, used to toast our Pop-Tarts and then melt butter on top of them. I thought everyone did that, and then I would tell people, ‘Oh yeah, hot buttered Pop-Tarts.’ People looked at me like I was insane. My tastes are all just screwed up.”

Hot buttered Pop-Tarts.

Gilligan went on to explain that the soy milk decision came down to the fact that he thought it “sounded healthy.”

“I don’t know about soy milk because I’m not a big soy milk person,” he said. “That sounded kind of healthy, like health-medy, but I actually put milk in any kind of tea, including mint tea and chamomile tea. I guess you’re right. I guess most people are not into that.”

He immediately regretted dispelling the ungodly soy milk mystery.

“People used to think, probably, ’Man, there’s a hidden message there,′ and now they’re just sort of making faces, ‘Ah, that guy. Ugh, who would do that? That sounds disgusting.’ I don’t know. That’s just me, I guess.”

To cleanse our palate, we asked Gilligan the obligatory, “Blah, blah, blah, when is Walter White coming to ‘Better Call Saul’? Blah, blah.” Except the wording was more like: “How many seasons do you think ‘Saul’ can go before you’d have to bring Walter White back?”

“I greedily want to see that happen, so every year I’m kind of looking for that possibility, and as viewers of the show have seen in the first three seasons, he’s nowhere in sight, nor is Jesse Pinkman. I think we’re always kind of open, definitely — not to speak for co-creator Peter Gould and the writers — I think it’s fairly safe to say they’re always open to the idea. I am as well,” he said, “I think it would be a real shame if the show ran its entire course without us ever seeing Walter White, maybe Jesse Pinkman, too.”

That’s not a promise that we’ll get to see either of those characters, he added.

Of course it’s not.It’s one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in U.S. law enforcement: What happened to the three inmates who broke out of Alcatraz in 1962?

A newly surfaced letter not only claims the trio survived but purports to be from one of them.

“My name is John Anglin. I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris,” the letter which was recently obtained by KPIX 5, the CBS station in San Francisco, read. “I’m 83 years old and in bad shape. I have cancer. Yes we all made it that night but barely!”

The station said the letter was sent to the San Francisco Police Department’s Richmond station in 2013.

The author of the letter claims the other two escapees have died in recent years. He also wrote that he was willing to meet with police if they would state on TV that he would spend no more than a year in jail and offer medical care for his cancer.

Experts were skeptical.

The U.S. Marshals Service told The Washington Post that based on a handwriting analysis and “other factors” they do not believe there was any merit to the letter. The FBI told KPIX its own tests were inconclusive.

On the night of June 11, 1962, three inmates placed dummy heads in their beds and escaped from their cells via vents they had gradually widened using sharpened spoons and other makeshift tools.

Once out of the prison compound itself, they slipped into the waters of San Francisco Bay on a raft made of raincoats and were never seen again.Aly Raisman says more people need to be held accountable for the sexual abuse that more than 160 girls suffered at the hands of disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar.

“USA Gymnastics, United States Olympic Committee, [Michigan State University] ― they need an independent investigation,” Raisman said Thursday during an appearance on NBC’s “Today” show.

“This is bigger than Larry Nassar,” she continued. “We have to get to the bottom of how this disaster happened.”

The 23-year-old Olympic gymnast was one of dozens of women to read impact statements about their experiences with Nassar, a former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor, during a seven-day sentence hearing this month. Nassar, 54, was sentenced Wednesday to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.

“We really are an army of survivors and it’s just the beginning for us,” Raisman said. “I want to make sure that never, ever happens again.”

Lou Anna Simon stepped down as president of MSU on Wednesday, following calls for her resignation from lawmakers and Nassar survivors. Simon said she knew about sexual abuse allegations against Nassar in 2014 ― two years before MSU fired him.

Raisman said MSU isn’t the only organization to turn a blind eye to Nassar’s record of abuse. She’s calling for independent reviews of USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee as well.

″[Nassar] did not have a medical license in Texas, which is where we went to the ranch and trained,” Raisman said. “It’s a national team training center and the Olympic training center... so what does that say about USA Gymnastics and United States Olympic Committee? Whether they knew or didn’t know, that’s a big problem and we need to investigate how this happened.”

“For so long they put medals, reputation and money over the safety of athletes,” Raisman said. “Even now, you see the United States Olympic Committee ― they just spoke out Monday for the first time. They just released a statement for the first time. They have been quiet this whole time.”

USA Gymnastics hasn’t contacted Raisman since she spoke at Nassar’s sentencing hearing, she said.

AdvertisementA Baltimore police officer faces charges of evidence tampering and misconduct after video taken by his body camera appears to show him planting drugs at a crime scene.

Richard Pinheiro Jr., 29, will be arraigned on the charges Feb. 13, Melba Saunders, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore state’s attorney, told HuffPost. Pinheiro will likely remain free pending trial, Saunders said.

A grand jury indicted Pinheiro on Tuesday, finding enough evidence to support allegations that he fabricated physical evidence and committed a wrongful and improper act, authorities said.

“I’ve made a pledge to apply one standard of justice for all,” Marilyn J. Mosby, the Baltimore state’s attorney, said in a statement. “It’s critical we remain transparent throughout the process to the extent the law allows as we continue to rebuild community trust.”

Pinheiro was suspended from the Baltimore police force in July after a 90-second video shot by his body camera was released by the public defender’s office.

The footage, recoded on Jan. 24, shows Pinheiro place a plastic bag into an aluminum can and hide it among garbage in a trash-strewn yard. Pinheiro then exits the area, activates his body camera, and returns to retrieve the plastic bag, which was filled with white capsules.

Pinheiro seemed unaware that Baltimore’s police body cameras record and save 30 seconds of activity before they are switched on.

Pinheiro used the drugs as evidence in a heroin arrest. Once the video was discovered, prosecutors dropped the charges against the suspect and ordered his release from jail.

"Conveyed an offer of a plea for ... one pill of heroin"

Prosecutors have since tossed out more than 100 cases tied to Pinheiro.

Pinheiro’s attorney, Michael Davey, said his client is innocent.

“Officer Pinheiro simply tried to document the recovery of evidence with his body-worn camera that he had previously recovered,” Davey told The Baltimore Sun. “This is just another overreach by the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office, and an attempt to prosecute a police officer when there’s no evidence to do so.”

Tampering with evidence is a misdemeanor offense, with a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. Misconduct, a common law offense, allows for any penalty that does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

Authorities said Pinheiro will likely remain suspended from his job until the case concludes.A former teen model says magician David Copperfield drugged and sexually assaulted her when she was 17 years old three decades ago.

Brittney Lewis told The Wrap that she met Copperfield in 1988 at the “Look of the Year” modeling contest in Atami, Japan. Copperfield was serving as a judge and after the competition Lewis alleges that the magician invited her to one of his shows in California. According to Lewis, who was living in Utah, he got permission from her grandmother who was assured that the teen would be accompanied at all times and would be staying in a separate hotel room than his.

When Lewis met Copperfield in California, she said he took her shopping, enthusiastically introduced her to his team and at one point tried to hold her hand. She said she made it clear to the then 32-year-old that she wasn’t interested in a romantic relationship.

Lewis said that after the show, she was at a bar with Copperfield and he poured something into her drink. When she asked what he was doing, he told the teen that he was “just sharing” with her.

Lewis admits that the rest of the night was a blur, but said she remembered Copperfield lying on top of her, kissing her and taking off her clothes.

“He was kissing my face and then I remember him starting to go down on my body with his face,” she told the Wrap. “And then, as soon as he started going down, I just completely blacked out.”

Lewis said that the next morning, “he wanted me to know that nothing happened because I was underage.”

“He said: ‘I didn’t enter you,’” she added.

Lewis told The Wrap that Copperfield made her write a letter that morning saying she was OK.

“My therapist later told me that he made me write a contract to keep me quiet,” she said.

The Wrap reported that representatives for Copperfield did not respond to its request for comment on Tuesday. But on Wednesday, Copperfield posted a statement to Twitter in which he expressed support for the #MeToo movement calling attention to sexual abuses while also cautioning against “a rush to judgment.”

He made a vague reference to Lewis’ accusations, and went into detail about a previous sexual assault claim made by a different woman against him.

“But imagine what it’s like, believing in the movement, and having also been falsely accused publicly in the past. To have your life and your family’s life turned upside down,” he wrote.

Former beauty queen Lacey Carroll accused Copperfield of sexual assault on a private island in 2007. The FBI investigated the claim and even raided Copperfield’s Las Vegas warehouse. The case was eventually closed, however, without charges.

Carroll was later charged with making false sexual assault claims against another man.

Copperfield noted this prior accusation in his statement on Twitter.

“I’ve lived with years of news reports about me being accused of fabricated, heinous acts, with few telling the story of the accuser getting arrested, and my innocence,” he wrote.

He added: “So while I weather another storm, I want the movement to continue to flourish. Always listen, and consider everything carefully, but please for everyone’s sake don’t rush to judgment.”Gal Gadot, right, is hailed as a feminist icon, but Amena Khan, left, was criticized for sharing her views on the same political issue. Getty Images

When L’Oreal announced it had hired Amena Khan, a British, hijab-wearing model and beauty blogger, for its latest hair care product Elvive, the company was widely applauded for it strides towards inclusion. After all, L’Oreal prides itself on “championing diversity.”

However, just four days after the announcement, Khan announced on Instagram that she was stepping down after it emerged that she’d posted a series of critical tweets about Israel four years ago. L’Oreal swiftly released a statement declaring that the company “is committed to tolerance and respect towards all people” and “we agree with her decision to step down from the campaign.”

In other words, they were not sad to see her go.

This is not the first time L’Oréal has hired and then almost immediately parted ways with a model from an underrepresented community for past social media posts. Five months ago, the company cut ties with Munroe Bergdorf, its first transgender model, over her remarks about white America’s systemic racism.



Major brands and corporations have recently been targeting Muslim women, particularly hijab-wearing Muslim women, in recent marketing attempts to showcase their diversity efforts. Nike’s launch of its Pro Hijab for female Muslim athletes and Mattel’s hijab-wearing Barbie inspired by fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad are just small examples of major corporations featuring visibly Muslim women in the name of diversity and female empowerment.

But are these efforts really all that empowering when Muslim women have to police their opinions on controversial topics?

Amani Al-Khatahtbeh found herself in a similar position just last week. The founder and editor of MuslimGirl.com received Revlon’s Changemaker Award in recognition of her advocacy for Muslim women.

But Al-Khatahtbeh declined the award.

“It means so much to me when @muslimgirl’s work is recognized and elevated in spaces from which we’ve been traditionally excluded,” she wrote in a caption on her Instagram post. “But that’s what makes it even more important at this moment to elevate and stand up for ALL women and girls.”

Al-Khatahtbeh said she could not accept the award because she believes the company is not inclusive. In particular, she said Revlon has given Gal Gadot, a brand ambassador for Revlon’s newest “Live Boldly” campaign, a pass when it comes to the “Wonder Woman” actress’ political beliefs. Gadot has strong opinions about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and is a vocal supporter of the Israel Defense Forces.

So why is Gadot rewarded for being an empowered woman with opinions and views of her own, while Khan loses out for sharing hers?

If brands and companies want to get behind women's empowerment, they must do so for ALL of us, not just some of us -- otherwise they are only servicing women's inequality even further. — Amani (@xoamani) January 22, 2018

There’s a low bar for Muslim representation in mainstream media, which often portrays the Muslim community as politicized and associates its members with war, terrorism and foreign affairs. News stories about Muslims are overwhelmingly negative.

Stories about Muslim women, in particular, often focus on oppression or on companies that feature Muslim women to advance an aesthetic of diversity. But purposeful, authentic Muslim representation, in which a Muslim woman can express her opinions freely and without consequence, is desperately missing.

When Muslim women like Khan ― who are already vastly underrepresented in the mainstream ― have any sort of visibility, it becomes conditional, and they’re forced to monitor their speech.

With the whole L'Oréal thing - aren't they ultimately saying, you can have your views but just don't air them or speak them.



Just sit pretty and flick your hijab.



I really feel as though L'Oréal picked up Amena and then left her out to dry. — Nafisa/ Amaliah.com (@Nafisa_Bakkar) January 23, 2018

Nafisa Bakkar, co-founder of Amaliah.com, a media company that aims to amplify the voices of Muslim women, recently wrote about the superficial marketing of Muslim women.

“White women and men are allowed to apologise and get their career back on track. Minorities on the other hand, one red card and you’re out,” Bakkar told HuffPost in an email.



Gadot’s outspoken support for Israeli policy has done nothing to discourage companies like Revlon from naming her as their brand ambassador. On the other hand, L’Oreal dropped Khan four days after her critical Israel tweets were uncovered.

L’Oreal and Revlon did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Despite this, the push to reach Muslim consumers continues. After all, the Muslim market, comprising an approximate 1.7 billion consumers, is a marketable one. According to Thomson Reuters’ State of the Global Islamic Economy Report, “the global Islamic economy has a potential bigger than every country in the world except China and the United States.”

Muslim consumers are estimated to spend $464 billion on fashion and $73 billion on cosmetics alone globally by 2019.



Major corporations are well aware of this. Just last year, London held its first Modest Fashion Week to appeal to Muslim fashion designers. Other major brands such as DKNY, Dolce & Gabbana and Uniqlo have all offered modest fashion lines.

In 2016, CoverGirl named its first hijab-wearing ambassador, 24-year-old beauty blogger Nura Afia. Halima Aden rose to stardom signing with IMG Models and walking at New York’s fashion week for Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 5. In 2015, H&M, the world’s second-largest retailer, featured a hijab-wearing Muslim model in its recycling campaign.

It’s not only profitable for major brands to tap into the Muslim market. Muslims want to see themselves in major advertisements and billboards.

Muslims react positively when they see major ads acknowledging their community’s identity and needs, according to a research report by Ogilvy Noor, a division of Ogilvy & Mather that specializes in engaging with Muslim audiences. Over 90 percent of Muslims said their religion affects their consumption habits and that they feel “shortchanged by the quality of marketing and products aimed at them in comparison with other consumer groups.”

When L’Oreal and Khan cut ties, the online Muslim community reacted, with some even calling for a boycott of L’Oreal products.

Studies have shown that millennial consumers choose brands that feel authentic to them. The Muslim consumer is no different. Showcasing a hijab-wearing model but reprimanding her and other minorities for freely expressing thoughts is not how any brand is going to “champion diversity,” as L’Oreal once claimed.
