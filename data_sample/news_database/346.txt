NEW YORK― Women’s health clinics from Iowa to Kenya have been forced to close their doors. International nonprofits have lost the ability to provide birth control, HIV testing and fistula surgeries in the poorest communities around the world. Half a million U.S. teenagers no longer have access to sex education programs.

In a single year, President Donald Trump has already decimated reproductive rights and access to family planning in the U.S. and around the globe. He reinstated and massively expanded the Global Gag Rule, restricting $8.8 billion in U.S. foreign aid funding for international health programs that provide or even mention abortion. He defunded the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a global maternal health organization that provides contraception and pregnancy care to low-income women in 150 countries. The group had relied on U.S. money to help to prevent 295,000 unsafe abortions ― a leading cause (13 percent) of maternal deaths around the world.

International health workers are already seeing the effects of Trump’s policies on women and girls.

“Girls aren’t able to get contraception, and they’re starting to come back pregnant, suicidal, bereft,” said Lisa Shannon, a global women’s rights advocate who works with reproductive health clinics in East Africa. “They’re desperate, and they’ll do whatever it takes. The only difference here is that the women will die from unsafe abortions.”

There is no comprehensive data yet on how many clinics around the globe have had to shut down because of the Global Gag Rule, but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to show its effects. Family Health Options Kenya, a network of family planning and reproductive health clinics, is closing half of its 16 clinics this year because it had relied on the United States for 60 percent of its overall funding. The group’s Mombasa clinic has already shut down, leaving women and girls without a family planning clinic nearby. And its clinic in Kibera, the largest urban slum in Africa, has had to scale back services, lay off staff and stop its mobile outreach program, by which its staffers traveled to provide contraception, cancer screenings and medications to women in remote areas that otherwise have no health care access.

Any reduction in family planning access is devastating to women in Kenya, where unsafe abortion is a leading cause of death. The country also has one of the highest counts of HIV infections in the world, and the same clinics that provide retroviral medications and condoms are the ones being shut down or at least crippled by the U.S. anti-abortion policy.

“Trump’s Global Gag Rule was a death sentence,” Shannon said. “Women are dying right now because of it, and not in small numbers.”

His Policies Affect The U.S. Too

Meanwhile, here in the United States, Trump has assembled one of the most anti-abortion cabinets in history, stacked federal courts and the Supreme Court with anti-abortion judges who could serve for the next several decades, and interfered with access to birth control and abortion for low-income women and immigrants.

First, the president appointed Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, whose conservative record suggests that he would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 abortion rights decision. Gorsuch has twice sided against Planned Parenthood funding and birth control access.

In April, Trump signed an executive order giving states the okay to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest family planning provider. The following month, Planned Parenthood had to close four clinics in Iowa due to state funding cuts, leaving 15,000 patients to find a new health care provider.

The Trump administration then cut more than $200 million in federal grants to 81 teen pregnancy prevention programs around the country, leaving an estimated 580,000 students without access to comprehensive sex education. And in October, Trump rolled back the Obama-era requirement that guaranteed birth control coverage at no out of pocket cost to 62 million women. All employers are now able to opt out of including birth control in their health insurance plans for any moral or religious reason.

The president has also stacked his administration with anti-abortion activists. Charmaine Yeost, the former CEO for Americans United for Life, is now the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at HHS. She believes abortion should be banned entirely, and she opposes some forms of birth control. And Teresa Manning, who has said birth control doesn’t work, is overseeing the nation’s Title X federal family planning program, which Trump is aiming to defund entirely in his budget.

Trump’s pick for director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Scott Lloyd, recently tried to block a detained immigrant teen rape victim from having an abortion because he personally opposes it. And just this week, the administration established a new federal office within HHS that would protect health providers who refuse to offer women abortion care on moral grounds.

“Now that the Trump administration has filled these agencies with right-wing appointees, they are busy under the cloak of darkness repealing access to care,” Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, told HuffPost. “The steady dismantling of women’s rights and access to affordable care is going to have long-term consequences, and it’s our job to make sure the American people are aware of it.”

“While the president is tweeting and saying crazy things, Pence is executing a campaign to really dismantle health care for women.” - Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood

Richards suspects that Vice President Mike Pence, rather than Trump himself, is driving the administration’s policies on women’s health. Before joining Trump’s campaign, Pence led the GOP’s fight against legal abortion in the House of Representatives for half a decade.

“[Pence] is the real mastermind in the White House, systematically trying to undermine women’s reproductive rights,” she said. “While the president is tweeting and saying crazy things, Pence is executing a campaign to really dismantle health care for women.”

Trump has stumbled and wavered on the issue of reproductive rights throughout his career. He once called himself “very pro-choice,” and he defended Planned Parenthood during a GOP primary debate in 2016, conceding that “millions of women are helped” by the organization. He then angered the anti-abortion movement when he said at a town hall event during his presidential campaign that if abortion became illegal, women should “face some sort of punishment” for undergoing the procedure. Many viewed him as playing into a progressive narrative about Republicans aiming to punish and patronize women.

But anti-abortion activists have warmed up to Trump since his administration has so relentlessly dismantled reproductive rights. And on Friday, Trump became the first sitting president in U.S. history to address the anti-abortion March for Life rally.

“Under my administration, we will always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence and that is the right to life,” Trump said in his speech.

But the Trump administration has so far failed to make good on two of his biggest campaign promises ― defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing the Affordable Care Act ― despite Republicans having control of the House and Senate. Richards offers that as a glimmer of a hope and a sign that women may have more power to resist Trump’s agenda than he realizes.

“You couldn’t go to a single town hall meeting without facing angry women in pink hats and T-shirts,” Richards said. “That was something we’ve never seen on that level.”

The 2017 Women’s March was likely the largest single-day protest in American history, and women are expected to show up in force again this weekend at the second annual march. Women are also running for office in greater numbers than ever before, so it may be more difficult after the 2018 elections for Trump to dismantle access to abortion.“Our family sat together this morning with the Medical Examiner – Coroner’s office and we were informed of their final analysis that Tom Petty passed away due to an accidental drug overdose as a result of taking a variety of medications.

“Unfortunately Tom’s body suffered from many serious ailments including emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip.

“Despite this painful injury he insisted on keeping his commitment to his fans and he toured for 53 dates with a fractured hip and, as he did, it worsened to a more serious injury.

“On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication.”WASHINGTON ― House Republicans spent the end of the workweek telling everyone who would listen that the American people must be allowed to see a top-secret four-page document that could bring an end to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 elections.

One thing about that document: Republican staffers wrote it.

The memo Republican staffers compiled reveals information that is “absolutely shocking,” “sickening,” “jaw-dropping” and “worse than Watergate,” GOP members of Congress said Thursday and Friday. The document could send government officials to jail, one congressman said. “Is this happening in America or is this the KGB?” asked another.

Even the most plugged-in news consumer could be forgiven for thinking the classified memo is an executive branch document that exposes wrongdoing within the Justice Department and the FBI. It isn’t.

The document, which alleges abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the FBI’s quiet counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign in the final months of the 2016 election, was actually compiled by Republican staffers on the House Intelligence Committee. That committee voted along partisan lines this week to allow any member of Congress to take a peek at the document themselves. Republican members soon flocked to a secure room to read the memo written by their allies — and then ran to tell the press about it.

Sara Carter, a Fox News contributor, wrote in a blog post on her personal website that the “bombshell” document “could lead to the removal of senior officials in the FBI and Department of Justice” and potentially spell the end of the Mueller probe. Carter’s post was widely shared on Twitter, including by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch and former White House official Sebastian Gorka. Ahead of Carter’s appearance on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Thursday night, Sean Hannity used the story to send a “message” to Mueller.

“Your witch hunt is now over,” Hannity said, addressing the Republican special counsel who was unanimously confirmed as FBI director in 2001 by the U.S. Senate, which a decade later unanimously voted to extend his term past the 10-year limit. “Time to close the doors.”

Overnight, #ReleaseTheMemo ― a hashtag reportedly given an additional boost by Russian-connected bots ― started trending on Twitter. In less than 24 hours, Donald Trump Jr. ― a likely target of the Mueller probe who communicated with Wikileaks before the election and held a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton ― sent off more than 30 tweets and retweets about the memo to his nearly 2.5 million followers.

Americans deserve to know the contents of the memo. Democrats & deep state govt officials are doing everything they can to protect those within the government who used their positions of influence to target those they disagree with politically. RELEASE THE MEMO! #ReleaseTheMemo — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 19, 2018

The broader theory of the case Republicans are pushing is that the FBI inappropriately used information gleaned from a controversial “dossier” on Trump to obtain a FISA warrant to monitor a Trump campaign affiliate. They hope that’s the poison pill that could somehow justify shutting down Mueller’s entire investigation (which of course didn’t begin until after Trump was elected, took office, and fired former FBI director James Comey).

Democrats say the Republican-drafted classified memo is full of omissions and distortions intended to fuel efforts to run cover for President Trump.

“It’s a distorted view of what the FBI has been doing,” one Hill source told HuffPost. “The majority of the committee is only sharing it so that other members of the caucus can also disparage and discredit the FBI.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the document was a “profoundly misleading set of talking points drafted by Republican staff attacking the FBI” and the bureau’s handling of the investigation.

“Rife with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read, this is meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI,” Schiff said. “This may help carry White House water, but it is a deep disservice to our law enforcement professionals.”

Is there actually a new bombshell in the report? It’s possible. But the motives and track records of the Republican lawmakers behind the media blitz surrounding the memo suggest there may be less to it than they claim.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who chairs the committee that cooked up the document, had been the public face of the GOP push to undermine the Mueller probe, although he’d taken a backseat as of late. Last year, Nunes was involved in an embarrassing episode in which he briefed President Trump on information he received from a source he wouldn’t name. It later turned out he’d met that person on White House grounds.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) ― who previously called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign (which would allow Trump to replace him with an official who could shut down the Mueller probe) ― said the memo was “absolutely shocking.” But Meadows thinks the entire Russia probe is manufactured hysteria.

I viewed the classified report from House Intel relating to the FBI, FISA abuses, the infamous Russian dossier, and so-called "Russian collusion." What I saw is absolutely shocking.



This report needs to be released--now. Americans deserve the truth. #ReleaseTheMemo pic.twitter.com/oP2UNujKQL — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) January 19, 2018

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who said the memo “is so alarming the American people have to see” it, has previously called for a new special counsel to investigate Mueller’s special counsel team.

The American people should be able to read what I did in that briefing room. It's time to #ReleaseTheMemo.https://t.co/287N3hSGnQ — Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) January 19, 2018

Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who said he was shaking his head when he read the memo and that the “American people deserve the truth,” benefited politically from documents the Russians hacked, and pushed a measure that would kill the Mueller probe.

Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) ― who has called for reining in the Mueller probe by gutting its financing, and recently went pheasant hunting with Donald Trump Jr. ― said he was sickened by the memo and that it was “worse than Watergate.” He thinks the FBI was part of the #NeverTrump movement and wanted Clinton elected.

I have read the memo. The sickening reality has set in. I no longer hold out hope there is an innocent explanation for the information the public has seen. I have long said it is worse than Watergate. It was #neverTrump & #alwaysHillary. #releasethememo — Steve King (@SteveKingIA) January 19, 2018

If the memo does eventually go public, it won’t end well for Republicans, Susan Hennessey, the executive editor of the legal commentary site Lawfare, argued Friday. “After causing completely unnecessary chaos today, this memo will be released in some redacted [form] in a few weeks and prove to be an utter embarrassment to Nunes personally, the [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence] majority, and frankly to US House of Representatives,” Hennessey predicted.

Some conservatives have urged caution, worrying that Republicans are overhyping a secret document. Republicans “should not oversell” the report, conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt wrote. Over at the conservative blog Hot Air, Ed Morrissey wondered if it was a “set-up for a let-down.” He argued the memo should be released, but warned conservatives to “not go all-in on it until we have a chance to see it for ourselves. In the meantime, remember that most things that seem too good to be true usually are.”

Rep. Matt Gaetz, a 35-year-old Republican freshman from Florida who recently flew on Air Force One with Trump and is friends with Roger Stone, is one of the believers. Gaetz has called for Mueller to be fired and said on “Hannity” on Thursday that officials might wind up in jail over what he saw in the memo.

HuffPost ran into Gaetz on Capitol Hill on Thursday evening, just a few hours after the congressman appeared on the Fox Business channel above the chyron “I JUST READ A 4-PAGE MEMO THAT THREATENS DEMOCRACY TO ITS CORE.”

.@mattgaetz: "The allegations contained in this important intelligence document go to the very foundations of our democracy and they require an immediate release to the public in my opinion." pic.twitter.com/kqjxp21GcA — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) January 18, 2018

“I believe that the contents of that memo need to be made available to the public immediately, and that that is a critical concern in kind of all of the Mueller, Russia, Trump discourse,” Gaetz told HuffPost of the memo, which he said “kind of aggregates” intelligence data.

In the interview with HuffPost, Gaetz ran into a common problem for Republicans who suggest the FBI was too rough on Trump but went too easy on Clinton during the 2016 campaign: the indisputable fact that the FBI’s actions then harmed Clinton. Comey’s conduct during the Clinton investigation was even the underlying justification the Trump administration provided last spring to explain Trump firing Comey. If people in the FBI and the so-called “deep state” were trying to get Clinton elected president, then frankly, they did a terrible job of it.

Surely Gaetz could concede the FBI’s actions ahead of the 2016 election were much more damaging to the Clinton campaign than they were to Trump? “I wouldn’t agree with that characterization,” he replied.

Under Gaetz’s theory, the FBI was hellbent on leaking information to the press to stop Trump from being elected. Gaetz told HuffPost that texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page showed they were “talking about a plan to strategically leak information to embarrass Trump.” As HuffPost recently explained, a deeply flawed story by John Solomon of The Hill has left a lot of people with the inaccurate impression that the text messages show the FBI officials were leaking information to hurt Trump. That’s what Gaetz believes.

“That was explicit in their communications to each other,“ Gaetz claimed.

“How so?” HuffPost asked. Here’s how the conversation went from there:

Gaetz: Well, when they talked about the, um, I think it was the Wall Street Journal article, and they were talking about, oh, was it behind a paywall and did it contain the information that ― HuffPost: What Wall Street Journal story was that, that was negative against Trump? Gaetz: Uh, again it’s referenced in their communications back and forth, this was I think in October. HuffPost: Mhmm. But do you know what story it was? Gaetz: Yeah, it was all about the contents of the dossier. HuffPost: The Wall Street Journal story on the 24th was about the contents of the dossier? The dossier wasn’t released until ― Gaetz: No, it might not have been the one of the 24th. It was the communication that was referenced in the Page-Strzok text messages. HuffPost: No, I know the one you’re talking about, you said the Wall Street Journal story. I just think the Wall Street Journal story that they were talking about, if you look at it in context, they were talking about a story that was actually negative about the FBI and to Hillary Clinton. It was the story about the then-deputy attorney general McCabe [Ed. note: McCabe is the FBI’s deputy director] who was basically being accused of ― I think you’ll probably recall this [from] the time ... Gaetz: Mhmm. HuffPost: ... was basically being accused, because his wife had received money, so that was what the story was about. Gaetz: No, yeah, but I think there was other stuff that was included within that ― HuffPost: Like what? Gaetz: Well I don’t have it in front of me.

Gaetz’s theory ― that the FBI provided information for an Oct. 24, 2016, Wall Street Journal story on the Trump dossier ― doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, chiefly because no such story exists. The first story to reference the “dossier” was published by Mother Jones on Oct. 31, 2016, a full week after Strzok-Page exchanged texts about a Wall Street Journal article. The Mother Jones story only came out after Comey sent a letter about the Clinton investigation on Oct. 28 that set off a media frenzy Clinton has partially blamed for her loss.

But the secret GOP memo gave Gaetz a convenient pivot point: the suggestion that there’s something, a bombshell, that he can’t reveal publicly. And it totally supports the theory he’s been pushing this whole time.

“I can say that if this memo become available to the public, many of the concerns that have been raised by members of the Judiciary Committee will be highlighted,” Gaetz said.

Later on Friday, all nine Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement calling the memo a “misleading set of talking points attacking the FBI.” Since the documents that the GOP-prepared memo cites are highly classified, the Democrats said, they will not be made public and it will become “impossible for the few Members who have seen the documents to explain the flaws and misstatements contained within the talking points” without disclosing sources and methods.

“This is by design,” they said. “Not surprisingly, the GOP campaign to attack the FBI now has been joined by the same forces that made common cause during the Trump campaign — Wikileaks, Julian Assange and a multitude of online Russian bots are now involved in promoting this effort. It should be seen for what it so plainly is: yet another desperate and flailing attempt to undermine Special Counsel Mueller and the FBI, regardless of the profound damage it does to our democratic institutions and national security agencies.”Guns N’ Roses’ frontman Axl Rose had an incredibly pithy take Friday on Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his role in the latest assault on special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe. “Fuck Nunes,” he tweeted.

And Twitter exploded. Fans were beside themselves that their man finally got woke. There were lots of “welcome to the jungles” in honor of the Guns N’ Roses hit song.

All it took for Axl’s tweet was a story floated by the Republicans that the Obama administration spied on Donald Trump’s campaign team by allegedly abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It’s all there in a secret four-page memo viewed by members of Congress. The problem? It’s written by Republicans, orchestrated by Nunes and, Democrats complain, designed to try to cut Mueller’s probe off at the knees.

Whatever it takes to get Axl going.

One of his fans even managed to unearth an ancient photo of the congressman long before he was head of the House Intelligence Committee.

To be fair, the singer has been plenty woke for a while about current political events. He has slammed Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the “disgraceful” White House. Back in October he criticized Mike Pence for his estimated $200,000 trip to an Indianapolis Colts game just so the vice president could storm out when some members of the visiting San Francisco 49ers predictably took a knee in protest of racial injustice.

In 2016, Rose invited fans to the stage at a Mexico City concert to beat a pinata that looked like Trump.

does this mean axl rose is now president — sufstan stevstans (@soalexgoes) January 20, 2018Shortly after taking office, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt set out to permanently limit the agency’s regulatory power in what he billed as a “Back to Basics” agenda focusing on cleaning up toxic waste and providing safe drinking water ― but not curbing new industrial pollution.

Former administrators warn that it could take anywhere from a few years to three decades for future administrations to restore the EPA to where it was a year ago, before the regulatory rollbacks, mass attrition and budget cuts.

“If [former President Barack] Obama’s name is near it ― irrespective of whether it’s good, bad or indifferent ― they’re undoing it,” Christine Todd Whitman, who served as administrator under former President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003, told HuffPost. “To just mindlessly do it is… mindless. There’s no other word for it.”

The lasting damage is already significant, and seems likely to get worse. Despite rumors that Pruitt may leave his post early to run for Senate or governor in Oklahoma, his home state, or take over as attorney general if Jeff Sessions steps down, the administrator has plans to ramp up his efforts in 2018. He told The Wall Street Journal this week that his second year would focus on accelerating efforts to remake the agency and speeding up the permitting process.

“There’s tremendous opportunity to show really significant results to the American people in a really short time frame,” Pruitt said.

Some of the policies Pruitt has rolled back could be restored. The administrator decided in April not to prohibit a pesticide linked to brain damage, immediately prompting lawsuits that could force the agency to issue a ban anyway. The next EPA chief could ramp up enforcement efforts to make up for the dramatic drop in prosecutions of polluters seen so far under Pruitt. A future head of the agency could also reverse Pruitt’s October order barring scientists who receive agency grants from serving on its advisory boards, and could even, in theory, issue a new order to limit the industry-funded researchers now set to dominate the panels.

Yet, Pruitt’s swift moves to axe major rules that took decades to craft stands apart from previous Republican efforts to slow new regulatory regimes at the agency.

Take, for example, the EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, which curbs heavy metal pollution from coal-fired power plants. The rule took over two decades to craft: It began under former President Bill Clinton, was briefly sidelined during the Bush era, and came into effect more than two years ago, under Obama. But, in 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had not adequately accounted for the cost of adhering to the regulation, and sent the case back to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal government had been scheduled to defend the rule. Then, in April, Pruitt ordered the agency to “fully review” the findings behind the rule, stoking fears among environmentalists that the new industry-friendly administration was laying the groundwork for a potential repeal.

“Under Pruitt, what they’re doing is conscientiously tearing the place down.” - Carol Browner, EPA administrator from 1993 to 2001

Consider, too, the Clean Power Plan. The signature Obama-era climate policy limiting carbon dioxide pollution from power plants and incentivizing renewable energy came out of a policy analysis started in the mid-1990s.

Back then, the Clinton administration drafted what became known as the Cannon memo, arguing that greenhouse gas emissions could be regulated as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. That formed the legal foundation of Massachusetts’ landmark Supreme Court victory over the Bush-era EPA in 2007. From there, the Bush administration began writing what became known as the Endangerment Finding ― that greenhouse gases posed a threat to public health and required EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act ― although it never implemented the policy. In 2009, the Obama administration picked up the baton, issuing the Endangerment Finding and, in response to its mandate, drafting the Clean Power Plan. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the rule in February 2016. Rather than defend or modify that regulation, Pruitt proposed repealing the plan outright in October. He didn’t provide an alternative.

Most legal scholars argue that overturning the Endangerment Finding would require Pruitt to prove in court that climate change isn’t caused by humans. Still, the hard-line climate change deniers with whom Pruitt has allied himself are calling on the EPA to attempt just that.

If the Clean Power Plan were completely repealed, the next administration at the EPA would have to start from square one, said Carol Browner, who served as EPA administrator under Clinton from 1993 to 2001. She said it could take “20 to 30 years.”

The agency suffered from “sort of benign neglect” under Bush, said Browner, but “it wasn’t a forced policy.”

“Under Pruitt, what they’re doing is conscientiously tearing the place down,” she said.

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

The EPA’s dismantling does not rest in Pruitt’s hands alone. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the agency’s budget by 30 percent ― to a 40-year low of $5.7 billion ― and the Republican-dominated Congress seems ready to make significant cuts. Restoring the agency’s capacity in the future will require replenishing its coffers with adequate funding.

“It’s just the sheer fact that you’d need a budget to do it,” Browner said, referring to the challenge of reversing the damage Pruitt has inflicted.

Restaffing the agency after Pruitt could pose a series of challenges. More than 700 personnel have left the EPA over the past year, according to a joint investigation published last month by The New York Times and ProPublica. Of the employees who quit, retired or took buyouts, more than 200 were scientists, and another 96 were environmental protection specialists. The EPA aims to cut staffing by nearly 50 percent ― from 15,000 to less than 8,000 ― by 2021, the agency told the Washington Examiner this month.

“You’d have to convince some of those who have been dismissed to come back,” Whitman said. “You’d want some of them to come back and help break in new people so you don’t have a complete vacuum of that institutional knowledge.”

“We’re in grave danger of losing that,” she added. “It’s a very complicated agency, these regulations are complicated, the rules Congress enacted when they enacted the legislation are very prescriptive.”

She warned that it could become harder to attract top young talent in the future if they fear the agency cannot offer stable, long-term careers.

There are other, less tangible potential effects of EPA’s pendular approach to regulatory policy and newfound status as a culture war battleground. Pruitt’s oft-repeated slogan ― that “regulations ought to make things regular” ― runs amok of his radical agenda to roll back rules that scientists say are necessary to curb pollution, and therefore appear likely to return under future administrations.

Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator from 2013 to 2017, said Pruitt is creating the exact sort of regulatory confusion for businesses that he railed against.A German magazine is reporting that officials of Deutsche Bank have informed Germany’s banking regulator about “suspicious” transactions by the real estate company owned by Jared Kushner and his family.

No details were provided about the nature of the transactions, but Deutsche Bank officials are prepared to turn over documents related to them to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, the business magazine reported Friday.

Deutsche Bank is a key banker for both senior White House adviser Kushner and his father-in-law, President Donald Trump. Reuters reported last month that Mueller had issued subpoenas to the bank for information on certain money and credit transactions by Trump and members of his family, according to a source described as being close to the matter. The New York Times reported last month that the U.S. attorney based in Brooklyn, New York, had also issued a subpoena to the bank for information related to Kushner.

The bank discovered the troubling Kushner company transactions after an internal audit ordered by board President Paul Achleitner, according to the German publication, Manager Magazin, in an article first reported and translated by Mother Jones magazine.

“Achleitner’s internal detectives were embarrassed to deliver their interim report regarding real estate tycoon [Jared] Kushner to the [German] financial regulator BaFin,” stated the article, according to Mother Jones. “Their finding: There are indications that Donald Trump’s son-in-law or persons or companies close to him could have channeled suspicious monies through Deutsche Bank as part of their business dealings.”

Deutsche Bank has reportedly loaned over $2 billion to companies affiliated with Trump since the 1990s. It continued to give millions to him even though he defaulted on one of his loans. Trump owes the German bank at least $130 million, according to the president’s most recent financial disclosure form, though it could be much more. Trump initially turned to the bank after a number of his businesses declared bankruptcy, making it difficult for him to find loans in the U.S.

The bank also loaned Kushner’s real estate company $285 million for a planned renovation of its building at Times Square in Manhattan, The Times has reported. Kushner and his mother, Seryl Stadtmauer, also have a multimillion-dollar line of credit from the bank, according to a financial disclosure form Kushner filed with the government.

Kushner stepped aside as the Kushner Companies’ chief executive when he assumed his White House job a year ago. He sold some of his assets but still owns part of the business.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration reduced fines against five banks — including Deutsche Bank — linked to interest rate manipulation, reported the International Business Times.

Days later, Senate Banking Committee member Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) sent a letter to Jerome Powell, Trump’s pick to head the Federal Reserve. He asked Powell for reassurance that he would rebuff any White House attempt to interfere with the Fed’s supervision of Deutsche Bank. Van Hollen said he was concerned about Trump’s “significant liabilities” with the bank. Powell responded that he would hold the bank accountable and that the Fed would function as an independent entity answerable to the public and Congress, Bloomberg reported.Ross Levinsohn was hired to run the Los Angeles Times last August.

A new NPR report details multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and “frat house” behavior by Los Angeles Times CEO and publisher Ross Levinsohn, just a day ahead of a major announcement regarding Times staffers’ efforts to unionize the newsroom.

The story, published Thursday, found that throughout the last two decades of his publishing career, Levinsohn has been a defendant in two sexual harassment lawsuits, has created workplace environments hostile to women and has made homophobic comments, according to uncovered court documents, financial filings and interviews with 26 of his former colleagues.

Levinsohn, whom the Los Angeles Times’ parent company, Tronc, hired to run the paper in August, previously held high-ranking roles at Guggenheim Digital Media, CBS, the search engine Alta Vista, Yahoo and News Corp. The two lawsuits against Levinsohn were filed by female colleagues at Alta Vista in 2001 and at News Corp. in 2006, NPR reported.

During the 2001 suit, Levinsohn admitted under oath that he’d openly ranked the “hotness” of women in the office, had discussed whether one of his female subordinates had a second job as a stripper and had speculated on her sex life.

In the 2006 lawsuit, a female subordinate alleged that workplace sexual harassment thrived under Levinsohn. When she asked him for a promotion, she claimed, he pointed to a female reporter who was a former pinup model, saying she had “learned how to work her way to the top.”

At Yahoo, colleagues and industry peers said Levinsohn’s approach to selling ads was to throw big parties where bikini-clad models mingled with Yahoo’s business partners ― an alienating process for women attempting to make business deals, some told NPR. (Yahoo and AOL merged in 2017 to become Oath, HuffPost’s parent company.)

In 2013, while overseeing Guggenheim Digital Media’s portfolio, which included The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard magazine, Levinsohn said he was leaving a company party early because it was attended by of “a bunch of ladies and fags,” sources told NPR.

At another party months later, witnesses say they saw a then-married Levinsohn aggressively kiss another woman with “his hands ranging over her body” in plain view of his employees.

The Los Angeles Times guild campaigning for the union said Thursday that the accusations outlined in NPR’s report shed light on the many ways Tronc has failed the Times staff.

Ross Levinsohn should resign or be fired immediately. A man who sexually harasses women, engages in “slut-shaming” and refers to gay men as “fags” is not fit to lead our newspaper. Tronc and its board of directors must be held accountable for their failure to properly vet Levinsohn for one of the most important positions at the company and in American journalism.

Levinsohn declined to answer questions for NPR’s story ― but according to the report, he called NPR CEO Jarl Mohn on Wednesday, calling the allegations “lies” and threatening to potentially seek legal counsel.

On Friday, the Los Angeles Times staffers successfully voted to unionize. The union campaign has largely centered on the staffers’ complaints about editorial leadership, fair wages and outsize salaries and perks for top executives. Management has taken a strong stance against the campaign.At least 16 state lawmakers have resigned or been expelled from their legislatures since the #MeToo movement started seven months ago. But many female lawmakers and political consultants say there is a long way to go before the culture in statehouses improves.

In March, former Minnesota state Rep. Tony Cornish made a surprise visit to the state Capitol, where he attended committee hearings and talked to former colleagues.

His presence was enough to put at least a few women on edge. Sarah Walker, a lobbyist, said she heeded texted warnings to avoid certain areas of the building. State Rep. Erin Maye Quade said she made a point of staying in her committee room. When Cornish ended up walking in the room, she said, for a split second she thought he was there to kill her.

Cornish, a Republican, resigned in November after Walker and Maye Quade, a Democrat, accused him of sexual harassment. Walker said he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and Maye Quade said he often made inappropriate comments — allegations that Cornish has denied. He did not return a phone call for comment.

But that day in March, some of his former colleagues greeted him with smiles and laughter, Maye Quade recalled. The visit sent a potentially corrosive message to women in the Statehouse, Walker said — a message that nothing had changed.

Seven months after the #MeToo movement began, state lawmakers across the country are still grappling with how to root out what many say is a longstanding misogynist culture in statehouses. After dozens of sexual harassment accusations against sitting male state lawmakers, at least 16 legislators in a dozen states have resigned or been expelled, according to a Stateline tally.

In many states, accused lawmakers were knocked from leadership posts, or voluntarily relinquished them, while remaining in office. Others apologized and kept their positions, or maintain their innocence.

As many legislative sessions end, many of the substantial policy changes that state lawmakers were hoping for — such as creating a private and safe method for victims to come forward and a nonpartisan way for bad behavior to be punished — remain elusive.

Many female state lawmakers, as well as consultants working to help legislatures prevent harassment, say there is still a long way to go before women feel entirely safe reporting harassment, and before men who engage in harassment or assault are held accountable.

In Minnesota, Walker said, the message hasn’t gotten through. “I don’t think it’s easy to change culture overnight.”

State lawmakers this year have mostly focused on “low-hanging fruit,” said Andrea Johnson, senior counsel for state policy at the National Women’s Law Center. At least 11 legislative chambers have updated their harassment policies. At least three of those policies now explain that everyone who works in, or visits, the statehouse is protected from harassment.

In at least a dozen states, legislatures have begun hosting more in-depth or frequent anti-harassment trainings. And at least three states — Delaware, Illinois and Virginia — enacted laws to make this training mandatory.

The work will continue, Johnson said, and the momentum is not slowing. At least a third of states are studying what changes should be made.

“We recognize how much our laws and culture need to change,” Johnson said. “That’s not something you can accomplish in one legislative session by any means.”

Many legislatures have realized that while their policies are strong, the overall environment needs to change, said Jon Griffin, a program principal at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Griffin and Johnson have visited legislatures across the country this year to provide advice on how to prevent harassment.

Griffin repeated a line he heard in California: “Cultures eat policies for breakfast” — meaning that culture influences behavior more than rules and regulations.

Power of #MeToo

One thing, at least, has changed: Some more senior female state lawmakers say they no longer hesitate to speak out when they see what they perceive to be harassment.

In Kentucky, state Rep. Kelly Flood, a Democrat, said she “had her own evolution” on this when in January former House Speaker Jeff Hoover, a Republican who resigned from the speakership but retained his seat after being accused of harassment, was speaking on the House floor. Suddenly, Hoover called out a younger female staffer in a way that Flood perceived to be hostile — an attempt to intimidate the staffer.

Last year, she said, she may have pulled Hoover aside in private after to talk to him about it. This year, though, she spoke out on the House floor.

“It was not acceptable, to me, to have that happen,” she said at the time to fellow representatives. “I have never seen that happen on this floor. And I intend for it not to happen again in my presence.”

Women feel as if they have a community behind them now, Johnson said. “That’s the power of this #MeToo movement, is so many people are sharing their stories, and so you know you have people behind you and you will be believed.”

This newfound boldness has the potential to backfire. In one state, a lawmaker who publicly accused another lawmaker told Stateline she feels she is being retaliated against. The House Speaker has told other lawmakers not to work with her, or even talk to her, she said. She asked not to be named because she feared it would hurt her chances of getting a bill that she cares about through the legislature this session.

In New Jersey, political receptions and parties — where harassment may be more likely to occur but where lawmakers have additional opportunities to work together — have been canceled or switched to coffees, said Jean Sinzdak, associate director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

Johnson said canceling events is not the right approach. “It’s not about a social event,” Johnson said. “It’s not about sex. It’s about power and power imbalances. We need to be calling that out, and talking about what women face.”

In many states, though, female lawmakers say they feel supported by their male colleagues.

In Colorado, three male lawmakers who were accused of sexual harassment have faced repercussions. In January, the House expelled state Rep. Steve Lebsock, a Democrat who changed his party to Republican shortly before he was expelled; in April, state Rep. Paul Rosenthal, a Democrat, lost his re-election bid; and this month, state Sen. Randy Baumgardner, a Republican, was stripped of several committee positions. They denied the accusations against them.

State Rep. Faith Winter, a Democrat who recently accused Lebsock of making lewd remarks to her in 2016, said many of her male colleagues have told her recently that they didn’t know women were facing such harassment, but now that they do, they have her full support. That is a big step forward, she said.

“It feels like night and day from where we started to where we are,” Winter said.

It helps, Winter said, that the Colorado House speaker and majority leader are women. Under their leadership, the House voted to expel Lebsock three days after a report from an outside investigator deemed the allegations against him to be credible.

Meanwhile, more women are bidding for states’ highest office this year. A record number of women — 43 so far — have filed to run for governor in the 36 gubernatorial races, according to Rutgers data.

The campaigns are different, too. In the past, women often would try to downplay their gender, Sinzdak said, or try to prove they were as strong as men. Now, she said, “women are leaning into gender as a positive as part of their campaign messaging.”

‘You Have to Be Bold’

In Minnesota, where Cornish and Democratic state Sen. Dan Schoen resigned in November after sexual harassment allegations, one sign that not much has changed, Walker said, is that new cases of alleged harassment continue to crop up. A few weeks ago, a woman who works as an advocate at the Statehouse accused state Rep. Rod Hamilton, a Republican, of touching her without her consent last month in his apartment. Hamilton denied the accusations, and said the touching was friendly, not sexual.

“It’s a little disturbing to me that, with what’s going on around the country, any member can do this type of action,” Walker said.

Just days before the accusations were made public, the Minnesota House changed its harassment policies to cover third parties, such as members of the public, lobbyists and journalists who interact with lawmakers.

The National Women’s Law Center recommends the inclusion of third parties in harassment policies. It also advises legislatures to publicly disclose harassment claims, while protecting the confidentiality of victims. The Maryland Legislature in December decided to begin tracking claims and reporting them annually. The center also recommends creating a process in which an outside entity, not elected officials, investigates claims and recommends punishment. Illinois and Iowa recently made this change.

In Kentucky, Flood proposed a bill that would have defined harassment more clearly, authorized the Legislative Ethics Commission to set up a tip line for complaints, and investigate and resolve complaints. The state has seen a few waves of harassment accusations, first in 2013 against former state Rep. John Arnold, a Democrat, and other staff of the Legislative Research Commission, and this year with accusations against Hoover and three other Republican members of the House.

When her proposal failed to move in the Senate, Flood said, she didn’t “go to the mat throwing a stink about it.” Instead, she said, she wants to work on getting the best language and solutions, and pass something next year.

Sputnik Photo Agency / ReutersThe Trump administration hopes to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem by 2019, a much faster timeline than expected, according to several media reports.

Rather than building an entirely new structure in the city, plans have reportedly shifted in recent days, and the U.S. State Department now plans to retrofit a building the government already owns in West Jerusalem.

“We will not be moving to a new facility ... we are going to retrofit a building,” Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state for diplomacy and public affairs, told The Wall Street Journal. He said the building would be ready sometime next year.

The New York Times corroborated the report, and said the retrofit would help keep costs down and allow the move to happen quickly, rather than on a multiyear timeline that would have seen embassy staff move sometime after 2020.

Trump officially declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel in December and directed the State Department to move the embassy there from Tel Aviv. Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their capital, and the decision sparked massive protests around the globe and marked a controversial shift in U.S. policy that threatened to stall the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Rhetoric coming from the White House about the timeline of the embassy’s move has been muddled. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. ambassador would be relocated “in the course of the year,” but Trump said that same day he was “not really looking at that.” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also noted last month that the move was “probably no earlier than three years out,” according to Reuters.

But the Times says the State Department, under the advice of David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, has settled on the retrofitting plan. In a meeting Thursday, Tillerson reportedly continued to push Trump for a lengthier timeline to upgrade security measures at the new embassy, although both agreed to use an existing building, The Wall Street Journal reported.ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images

NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it plans to retry Democratic U.S. Senator Robert Menendez on bribery and corruption charges after a jury was deadlocked during a trial in November.

The government said in a court filing it wants a federal judge in New Jersey to set the “earliest possible date” for a retrial. Menendez, who has represented New Jersey in the Senate since 2006, is running for another six-year term this year, and the state’s Democratic leaders have supported his bid despite the federal charges.

“The decision to retry this case was made based on the facts and the law, following a careful review,” the Justice Department said in a statement.

A spokesman and a lawyer for Menendez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Menendez, 64, is accused of accepting private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors.

Melgen, who was separately convicted last year in Florida of perpetrating a massive Medicare fraud, will also be retried, the Justice Department said.

The case was the first high-profile corruption trial for federal prosecutors since a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2016 limited their ability to bring such charges.

A second trial this year could pose a major distraction for Menendez and his fellow Democrats, who are already facing an unfriendly electoral map in their quest to wrest control of the Senate. Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 advantage but only have to defend eight seats, compared with 26 for Democrats and independents who caucus with them.WASHINGTON — Outgoing advisers of the National Park Service who stepped down this week over frustrations with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are swinging back at what they called “degrading,” “slanderous” and dishonest assertions from a department official.

In a strongly worded statement Wednesday, Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift celebrated the resignation of nearly the entire National Park Service Advisory Board, accusing them among other things of allowing a culture of sexual harassment to fester at national parks.

“We welcome their resignations and would expect nothing less than quitting from members who found it convenient to turn a blind eye to women being sexually harassed at National Parks,” Swift told the Washington Examiner and several other media outlets. The spokeswoman also dismissed as “patently false” the advisers’ claims that the department had refused to engage with them over the last year, as The Washington Post first reported.

Departing board Chairman Tony Knowles told the Post that the panel had been “frozen out” by Zinke and was not consulted on key NPS decisions, including hiking visitor fees at several national parks. Only two of the board’s 12 members remain.

Established in 1935, this body of unpaid volunteers advises the Interior Department and the director of the NPS on a wide range of matters and policies at the organization, from the designation of historic and natural landmarks to addressing climate change. However, they are not employees of the National Park Service, let alone managers. And they played no role in determining how the agency should address the sexual harassment and assault issues that have made national headlines in recent years, two board members who quit this week told HuffPost on Thursday.

“I read the L.A. Times. Of course I was aware of it,” Belinda Faustinos, a former board member from California, said of the allegations. “But was that my job as an advisory board member? No.”

Faustinos, who in 2011 retired as executive officer of the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, said Swift’s condemnation only confirmed that she and her colleagues made the right decision to leave. The actions taken by Zinke’s team over the last year are not consistent with the values of the park service or the board, she said.

“This administration tends to double down whenever they get challenged on anything, and that’s exactly what happened,” she told HuffPost. “I’m not shocked or surprised. I’m disappointed. I am beyond belief that we’re actually in this situation.”

In October, the Interior Department released the results of an NPS survey that found 38.7 percent of its employees had experienced some form of harassment or discrimination over a one-year period. Just over 10 percent reported being sexually harassed.

Zinke has promised to crack down on a problem that he blamed on his predecessors.

“All employees have the right to work in an environment that is safe and harassment-free,” he said in an October statement. “I’ve removed a number of people who were abusive or acted improperly that other administrations were too afraid to or just turned a blind eye to.”

Gretchen Long, a board member from Wyoming who also quit this week, echoed Faustinos. Sexual harassment, she said, is a management issue that the board never discussed, in part because of privacy laws. And while a general misunderstanding about the advisory board’s responsibilities may have factored into Swift’s response, both women suspect the agency acted maliciously.

“They politicized the good work of citizen volunteers who represent both a broad political spectrum and a broad background and expertise,” Long said.

Long added that she was “shocked” to see the Interior Department put out such a “slanderous” statement. “I think that the degrading style of the response and the dishonesty of the response is quite unsettling just from a point of view of an American citizen,” she said.

Faustinos called it a “tactical” move that is being used by people throughout the administration.

“That seems to be something that I see happening a lot,” she told HuffPost. “Untruths. Not knowing what they’re talking about, and trying to turn the messaging around to make it a counterattack.”

Faustinos and Long also disputed Swift’s claim that as recently as this month and before the board member resignations, the agency was “working with the board to renew their charter, schedule a meeting and fill vacancies.”

“It just never happened,” Long said.

In her statement, Swift also dismissed the reported resignation of two members whose terms expired back in July as a “hollow and dishonest political stunt.” And she said the department would “fast-track filling these new vacancies with people who are actually dedicated to working with the department to better our national parks.”

Long and Faustinos stressed the importance of the advisory board and said they are extremely proud of the work they did during their terms to improve the park service. And while they expected that the Trump administration would move in its own direction and appoint new members, they hoped for an opportunity to sit down with Zinke to discuss initiatives that the board championed over the last several years.

Faustinos said Interior’s aggressive and inaccurate statement Wednesday is just another attempt to distract from the real issue: “That the people of this great country are just being blindsided by all these ridiculous policies that are coming out, from fee hikes [at national parks] to drilling in the Arctic.”

“The truth doesn’t seem to matter [to them],” she said.African asylum-seekers, mostly from Eritrea, protest Israel's deportation policy in front of the Supreme Court in Jerusalem on Jan. 26, 2017. MENAHEM KAHANA via Getty Images

A rabbi in Israel is calling on fellow Jewish activists in the country to protect the thousands of African asylum-seekers the government is threatening to deport.

Religious leaders from the advocacy group Rabbis for Human Rights expressed their willingness on Tuesday to open up their own homes to shelter the migrants.

Rabbi Susan Silverman, sister of the American comedian Sarah Silverman, promoted the idea during a conference in Jerusalem and received the support of about 130 religious leaders who had assembled there, Haaretz reports.

Silverman said the rabbis’ activism is driven by their Jewish faith ― and the fear that the asylum-seekers may face torture, human trafficking or death if they are deported. She also said it was inspired by the story of Anne Frank as well as by the sanctuary movement in the U.S.

Silverman told Israel’s i24 News that if asylum-seekers need protection, the Jewish rabbis in her network will be ready.

“We’re saying [to the migrants], ’Come ... we are thousands of Israeli families and we will be here for you and you can come and you live in our homes and the government will have to come through us to take you.”

About 35,000 Eritrean and Sudanese natives live in Israel, Haaretz reports, along with about 5,000 of their children who were born in the country. Many of the adults entered Israel illegally through Egypt, and have temporary visas that must be renewed every three months.

The next time these migrants attempt to renew their visas, those who don’t meet certain criteria will face with a tough choice ― to return to their country of origin or to a third country like Rwanda or Uganda, according to the Associated Press. As an incentive, the Israeli government is offering those who choose to be deported before April a payment of $3,500 and the cost of their airline tickets. Those who stay past April may face indefinite incarceration, the AP reports.

Silverman believes all of this is a clear violation of Jewish values. She referred to the way that non-Jews took great risks to hide Anne Frank and other Jewish people inside their homes during World War II, in an attempt to save lives.

Silverman told i24 News the African migrants in Israel are facing a similar situation.

“No one’s going to go to their deaths in Israel. The Israeli government isn’t proposing anything of that sort,” she said. “But we know that when people are sent from here to other countries that they are back on the refugee trail …. Absolutely no guarantee of their safety, in fact they’re at very, very great risk. If we are sending them to these other countries, then we are complicit.”

Silverman, RHR and a representative for the Israeli government did not immediately respond to HuffPost requests for comment.

The religious leaders who attended Tuesday’s conference hope to gather support for the campaign among their communities across Israel, Haaretz reports, and get American Jewish communities involved as well.

Rabbi Yehiel Grenimann, RHR’s director of organization development, referred to the example set by the American civil rights leader Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who participated in civil rights demonstrations with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

If Heschel were alive today, he would be “passionately protesting the plans to expel African asylum seekers and refugees to a tragic fate in Africa,” Grenimann wrote on Facebook on Jan. 15. “Especially when these things are being done by representatives of a people who have themselves suffered expulsion, refugee status and worse in the past.”

Late last year, the U.N. refugee agency expressed serious concerns about Israel’s deportation of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum-seekers. The agency said it is worried people who have been relocated have not found adequate safety.
