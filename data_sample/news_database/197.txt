Cochran, who has been battling health problems for quite some time, is not up for re-election this year. The seven-term Republican was absent from the Senate late last year as he recovered from urinary tract infections.

Cochran denied that he was physically unfit for office, CNN reported at the time. But his resignation could help the political fortunes of his colleague, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).Billionaire Carl Icahn, President Donald Trump’s longtime friend and former special adviser, sold $31.3 million in shares of a steel-related company just before Trump announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.

Icahn unloaded nearly 1 million shares in crane manufacturer Manitowoc Co. of Wisconsin from Feb. 12 to Feb. 23, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission first reported by the website Think Progress. Manitowoc relies on steel, and shares in the company fell after Trump announced on Thursday that he plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel. The Commerce Department’s report recommending the tariffs was made public Feb. 16.

Icahn told CNBC Thursday that he hadn’t had “much interaction” with Trump in the “past four or five months,” and had no special knowledge of what Trump planned to do or when. But the CNBC question concerned his opinion about market effect, not whether he had any privileged information. Stock trades based on insider information not available to the public are illegal.

Icahn’s selloff represented about one-third of his stake in the company, according to CNBC. Last month’s selloff was his first trading in the company’s shares since January 2015, The Washington Post reported.

Icahn’s stocks sold for between $32 and $34 a share. The shares were worth $26.93 when the market closed Friday.

Icahn quit his informal White House role as adviser on regulatory reform in August, shortly before The New Yorker reported he had been pushing to overturn an environmental regulation promoting biofuels and renewable energy that was costing him millions through his stake in oil refiner CVR.

He said in his resignation letter that he “never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position.” He said he “only expressed views that I believed would benefit the refining industry as a whole,” and that he was quitting out of an “abundance of caution.”Joshua Roberts / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is continuing to raise campaign funds off of his defense of President Donald Trump, using a fundraising letter to tout a tweet in which Trump described him as a “Great American Hero” because of Nunes’ work undermining the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

In the letter, Nunes writes that he’s “standing strong” with Trump and asks for a donation to “take the fight to the liberals.” He writes that he “exposed the real collusion between the Department of Justice, the F.B.I. and the Clinton campaign” through his work as House intelligence committee chairman.

“When Barack Obama’s Department of Justice and the F.B.I. used Hillary Clinton’s patently false opposition research to justify a warrant to spy on associates of the Trump campaign, I exposed the scandal and brought it to the attention of the entire nation,” Nunes wrote.

The top of a fundraising letter sent to an individual in Virginia, which was obtained by HuffPost, promotes a tweet Trump sent about Nunes’ work:

Nunes letter

That tweet was sent after Nunes appeared on “Fox & Friends” in February, when Nunes falsely said the president had never met with George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is working with special counsel Robert Mueller’s team.

Nunes says in his letter that he has “earned the hatred of revenge-driven members of the Democratic leadership cabal and the Far Left media.” He said he has faced an “onslaught of lies, propaganda, attacks, slurs and smears,” that Democrats had “come unhinged” in their attacks on him and that he was up against “liars, propagandists and hypocrites from the Far Left fringe.”

Nunes letter

Nunes’ campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

In November’s midterm election, Nunes faces Democrat Andrew Janz, a deputy district attorney in Fresno County who raised more than $1 million in the first quarter, much of it from Democrats upset over the so-called Nunes memo and his attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. The final report from Nunes’ committee released last month attempted to clear Trump of wrongdoing.

“It’s clear my opponent is only interested in pleasing the President,” Janz told HuffPost in a statement. “He takes great satisfaction in voting against our interests and stands by devastating tariffs placed on our farmers to serve Trump and his billionaire buddies. There’s nothing heroic about that.”

Nunes’ seat in the House no longer considered a “safe Republican” seat, according to Sabato’s Crystal Ball.

Liz Mair, a Republican strategist with the Swamp Accountability Project, a group that is running ads against Nunes, called the letter “mostly a political stunt undertaken to beef up direct mail appeals to rich Beltway donors to try to help him get through a tough cycle in which he faces a potentially viable opponent for the first time in a long time”

“Nunes is positioning as an opponent of the ‘Deep State’ as a matter of political convenience because a Democrat has made his district potentially competitive, and Nunes is not well-liked among California conservatives— another reason why he has to ask for money in Virginia,” she said.

This article has been updated with comment from Mair.UPDATE: A man suspected of stealing Frances McDormand’s Oscar Sunday night has been arrested for grand theft, Los Angeles police told the New York Daily News on Monday.

The suspect was identified by police as 47-year-old Terry Bryant.

TMZ posted video on Monday of Bryant pretending the Oscar was his the night before. Security located Bryant during the post-Oscar festivities and called police, the entertainment site said.

Frances McDormand reportedly lost her Oscar at the Governors Ball on Sunday after the Academy Awards ceremony. Someone apparently “grabbed” the statuette and ran outside with it, The New York Times reported.

The actress, who won the Best Actress statuette for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” frantically searched for the award, but left the affair empty-handed and broken-hearted, USA Today reported. She was “crying emotionally” as she departed with her husband, director Joel Coen, the paper said.

McDormand had been at the ball in part to get her name engraved on her second career Oscar. Shortly after the engraving was finished, the little gold man went missing, People noted.

The New York Times’ Cara Buckley reported that a man took off with the statue, but was stopped outside by a photographer for celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. The man gave the Oscar back, according to the report, “and disappeared back into the ball.”

Actresses Annabella Sciorra, Ashley Judd and Salma Hayek praised Hollywood’s shakeup as the Me Too movement gained strength in the last year, and acknowledged there was more work to be done.

“This year, many spoke their truth, and the journey ahead is long, but slowly a new path has emerged,” said Sciorra, referencing sexual misconduct allegations against powerful players in Hollywood.

“The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, of different voices, of our voices, joining together in a mighty chorus that is finally saying ‘time’s up,’” Judd said, alluding to the “Time’s Up” movement to end inequality and sexual misconduct in the workplace.

Hayek added: ″So we salute those unstoppable spirits who kicked ass and broke through the biased perceptions against their gender, their race and ethnicity to tell their stories.”

As the Oscars celebrated its 90th anniversary, Judd called on the awards show to focus on “equality, diversity, inclusion, intersectionality” in its next 90 years.

“That’s what this year has promised us,” Judd said.

"The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, of different voices, of our voices."

The 3.5-minute video montage featured interviews with trailblazing directors, writers and actors, including Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig and Kumail Nanjiani.

Judd, Sciorra and Hayek are just three of more than 80 women who have accused now-disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.

Judd first publicly accused Weinstein in a bombshell New York Times report published in early October that helped ignite the wave of allegations against the film producer. She said Weinstein invited her to his hotel room for a business meeting in the 1990s. When she arrived, he was wearing a bathrobe and asked her to massage him and watch him shower.

A couple weeks later, Sciorra joined those speaking out against Weinstein. She told The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s and continued to sexually harass her for several years.

Hayek came forward in December, penning an essay for The New York Times in which she called Weinstein a “monster.” She said she, too, had experienced Weinstein’s repeated sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances, including massage and oral sex requests.Selfies, puppies and pizza are so yesterday. The next evolution of the feel-good awards show moment has arrived at the Oscars.

To show their appreciation for people who actually go see movies, host Jimmy Kimmel and a group of famous types — including Margot Robbie, Lupita Nyong’o, Armie Hammer, Gal Gadot, Ansel Elgort and Guillermo del Toro —surprised moviegoers during the ceremony.

While the awards were being handed out at the Dolby Theater, the group crashed a screening of “A Wrinkle In Time” around the corner ― during a scene featuring Oprah, we might add ― to thank fans for their undying support.

The crowd predictably freaked out as Wonder Woman herself showed up with the late-night host, who cracked, “There is a strong aroma of marijuana in this theater.”

Lucky for them, celebs proceeded to hand out a bevy of drinks and snacks, including the longest submarine sandwich we’ve ever seen. Hammer and Elgort even broke out hot dog cannons.

Kimmel then tapped a random moviegoer to announce the next presenters, Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph. Unfortunately, the guy butchered the “Girls Trip” star’s name.

Maybe if she’s nominated for another Oscar, Hathaway will have a better time and ignore those corny haters.Actors Lupita Nyong’o and Kumail Nanjiani paid tribute to young immigrants during Sunday’s Academy Awards in a moving speech that also referenced the pair’s immigration status.

The ceremony took place the day before the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― which protects undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― had been set to expire. Because of a recent Supreme Court decision, the program effectively lives on, but its beneficiaries ― known colloquially as Dreamers ― still remain uncertain over their futures due to Congress’ ongoing debate on immigration reform.

“Like everyone in this room and everyone watching at home, we are dreamers,” Nyong’o said before announcing the nominees for achievement in production design. “We grew up dreaming of one day working in the movies. Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood, and dreams are the foundation of America.”

Nanjiani chimed in, saying that, “to all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you.” The crowd erupted in applause.

The actors also poked fun at their own experiences as immigrants, with Nyong’o joking that both of their names are impossible to pronounce and Nanjiani revealing that his real Pakistani name is actually Chris Pine.

“I’m from Pakistan and Iowa, two places that nobody in Hollywood can find on a map,” Nanijani added.

Trump in September announced he was disbanding DACA, which lets hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants stay in the U.S. He later professed his love for the Dreamers, and expressed a desire to allow them to remain in the U.S. ― with a few caveats. He demanded that any protections for Dreamers come with funding for a border wall, the suspension of the visa lottery program, and an end to family reunification policies.

As Monday’s deadline arrived, hopes for immigration reform continued to flicker.Turns out there might be something even better than winning an Oscar at the Academy Awards: winning an Oscar and a jet ski.

At the start of Sunday night’s show, host Jimmy Kimmel said he would be timing the acceptance speeches, with the shortest speaker taking home an extra prize worth $18,000.

He wasn’t kidding, either.

As the show came to a close, Mark Bridges, who won an Oscar in the Best Costume Design category for his work on “Phantom Thread,” came on stage riding his brand-new jet ski. Bridges’speech was a concise 36 seconds long, but not because he was trying to win the additional prize, which was presented by actress Helen Mirren.

“That was an accident,” he told “ET” after the show. “I really had things to say... I forgot a sentence and now look ― I got me and Helen Mirren on a jet ski and now I have a jet ski.”

Bridges said he was plucked from the audience toward the end of the awards show.

“They said can you come to the green room and I was like, oh no, I got the jet ski,” Bridges said.

“What the fuck am I going to do with a jet ski?” -Mark Bridges, earlier tonight #oscars pic.twitter.com/GawCCgQA2c — erickohn (@erickohn) March 5, 2018After a night of rousing speeches, historic firsts and stunning red carpet looks from Hollywood’s elite, the Academy Awards viewership numbers are in, and they aren’t pretty.

Viewership of the 90th Oscars, broadcast Sunday evening on ABC, hit a record low at just 26.5 million, according to data from Nielsen. That was down 19.5 percent from 32.9 million viewers who watched the show last year, and fell beneath the previous low of 32 million in 2008.

Producers were wary of a potential drop in viewership leading up to the Oscars, saying they hoped the award show would focus on films ― and not on politics ― even amid a months-long conversation about sexual misconduct in the movie industry.

“The Oscars should be a spectacle. Fun and funny and great performances,” Jennifer Todd, a producer of the Academy Awards, told The New York Times in February. “It should also be a giant commercial for the movie business, which we all need to keep going.”

Come Sunday night, host Jimmy Kimmel and a number of other stars paid tribute to the Me Too, Time’s Up, and Never Again movements. Some touched on gender inequality, immigration and gun control, though those topics rarely took center stage.

According to some critics, the award show is just too long and too predictable. The Oscars dragged on for nearly four hours this year, even with the enticement of a free jet ski for the winner who delivered the shortest speech.

Others say the Oscars seem increasingly trivial in a world wrought by violence and inequality.

“This year’s awards come amid rising oceans, sexual abuse scandals and slain schoolchildren. Our country is divided; our president is a Twitter fiend. Our immigrants feel unwelcome and our working poor can’t afford healthcare. We face nuclear threats from multiple sides. We are sinking deeper into debt and have stumbled badly in the eyes of the world,” wrote film writer Jeffrey Fleishman in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times. “The Oscars seem insignificant amid the clamor.”

A representative for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.“This year when you hear your name called, don’t get up right away. Just give us a minute. We don’t want another ’thing,’” Kimmel joked before elaborating on what really happened at last year’s ceremony.

“Last year, about a week before the show, the producers asked me if I wanted to do some comedy with the accountants. I said ‘No, I don’t want to do comedy with the accountants.’ So then the accountants went ahead and did comedy on their own,” Kimmel said.

The late-night host joked that Oscar (the statue) is the “most beloved and respected man in Hollywood.”

“There’s a very good reason why. Look at him,” Kimmel said. “He keeps his hands where you can see them. Never says a rude word. And most importantly, he has no penis. He is literally a statue of limitations.” The host added a beat later that Oscar is “the kind of man we need more of in this town.”

Kimmel elaborated on Hollywood’s treatment of women by assailing Mel Gibson for the second year in a row and discussing the disparity between Mark Wahlberg’s and Michelle Williams’ reshoot fee for “All the Money in the World.”

“Here’s how clueless Hollywood is about women. We made a movie called ‘What Women Want’ and it starred Mel Gibson,” Kimmel said.

He went on to talk about how the industry can no longer let bad behavior slide.

“We need to set an example ... Things are changing for the better. This is a night for positivity,” the comedian said.

In that vein, Kimmel implored the winners of the night to keep their speeches brief but impassioned, using their platform to support causes like Me Too, Time’s Up, and Never Again.

“If you want to encourage people to join the amazing students at Parkland for their march on the 24th, do that,” he said, just before announcing that whomever gives the shortest speech of the night would receive a new Jet Ski.

The watercraft was presented by Helen Mirren (not included).

Prior to Kimmel’s speech, there was a pan over the audience shot in black-and-white, which featured a plethora of stars. One notable bit featured a really uncomfortable shot of Salma Hayek with her “date” ― the fish man from “The Shape of Water.”

The lack of overt political commentary in this year’s monologue is surprising considering Kimmel’s stance on causes like health care, but he still couldn’t resist at least one solid dig at the vice president.Gary Oldman took home gold for his performance as Winston Churchill in the historical drama “Darkest Hour” at the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday night.

The actor was essentially a shoo-in to win the Best Actor award after picking up trophies at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and Screen Actors Guild Awards in the past few months. He beat out competition like Daniel Kaluuya in “Get Out” and Timothée Chalamet in “Call Me By Your Name,” who was set become the youngest Best Actor honoree in almost 80 years.

“Movies, such is their power, captivated a young man from south London and gave him a dream,” he said onstage in his acceptance speech before thanking his mother. “Put the kettle on, I’m bringing Oscar home.”

Oldman’s win arrives amid a growing backlash against the actor, as allegations of domestic violence against him have resurfaced. The English actor was accused of choking and beating his then-wife Donya Fiorentino in 2001 with a telephone while their young children watched.

The police investigated Fiorentino’s claims and charges were never filed, with Oldman describing her account as “replete with lies, innuendos and half-truths.”

People watching along immediately reacted on Twitter to Oldman’s win, as well as to accused rapist Kobe Bryant’s, who picked up an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film.

The “Girls Trip” star wore a dress that cost more than her mortgage to the premiere of the hit film in July. She wore the gown again to host “Saturday Night Live” in November, and she vowed to audiences then that she would be wearing that same dress again and again and again.

During her “SNL” monologue, Haddish said her team told her it was “taboo” to wear the white gown to host the NBC show since she had already worn it to the “Girls Trip” premiere.

“I don’t give a dang about no taboo. I spent a lot of money on this dress,” she said in response. “This dress cost way more than my mortgage. This a Alexander McQueen, OK? This a $4,000 dress. Imma wear this dress multiple times.”

Fox used Twitter to hit back after Trump’s anti-immigration rant during a White House meeting with California leaders.

“You’ve got to get your shit together,” Fox tweeted at Trump.

.@realDonaldTrump, you’ve got to get your shit together: migrants are people who have left everything behind - not by choice, to pursue a better life.

“Migrants are people who have left everything behind — not by choice, to pursue a better life,” Fox added. “You must show compassion and humanity. Your golden head and a #FuckingWall won’t stop these people’s dreams and hopes.”

Fox has repeatedly criticized Trump over his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and force Mexico to pay for it. In April, he promoted a T-shirt portraying Trump as a baby constructing a wall from toy bricks.

The deer shows up multiple times in the social thriller as a metaphor for modern-day racism. For example, it’s on the wall of Rose’s (Allison Williams) parents’ home, where she’s just brought her boyfriend, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), for the weekend. A deer also appears in the first moments of Chris’ first trip to the “Sunken Place” while being hypnotized by Rose’s mother.

The deer and antlers imagery works to mirror Kaluuya’s character, revealing how black men are often prey to racism. The theme is one of many for which the film has been applauded.

“Get Out,” which has a 99 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, is nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay.

Emily Blunt stars as Mary Poppins in the sequel to the original 1964 classic. The first look shows Poppins descending upon London as Lin-Manuel Miranda, who plays Jack the lamplighter, wrestles a kite overtaken by the wind. Blunt channels Julie Andrews, who originated the role, in a moment any fan will recall from the classic film.

The star-studded cast also features Meryl Streep and Angela Lansbury.In an unhinged media spree that continued into Monday evening, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg told multiple outlets that he won’t comply with the subpoena he received to appear before a federal grand jury hearing evidence surrounding Russia’s possible interference in the 2016 election.

“Let him arrest me,” Nunberg told The Washington Post on Monday of special counsel Robert Mueller, who he says has requested his appearance before the jury this Friday. Mueller, the former FBI director who is leading the investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, is also seeking any records Nunberg has relating to Trump and nine others involved with his administration, including emails and telephone logs, Nunberg said.

“I think it would be funny if they arrested me,” he said live on the phone with MSNBC shortly after the Post story broke.

Continuing his streak of surprising comments, Nunberg told The Associated Press later that evening that he’d likely end up cooperating with Mueller after all.

“I’m going to end up cooperating with them,” he told the outlet.

He later told MSNBC, however, that he would not appear before the jury on Friday.

Watch: Ex-Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg says he's refusing comply with Mueller subpoena:

Nunberg, who aided Trump early in his campaign, had previously said he won’t cooperate with handing over documents, repeatedly emphasizing the “ridiculous” amount of time it would take him to go over his emails.

“I’m not spending 80 hours going over my emails with [former Trump adviser] Roger Stone and [former White House chief strategist] Steve Bannon and producing them,” Nunberg told the Post. “Donald Trump won this election on his own. He campaigned his ass off. And there is nobody who hates him more than me.”

Nunberg was fired from the Trump campaign in 2015 after racially-charged Facebook posts he allegedly wrote came to light, though he has denied writing them.

Speaking to MSNBC, Nunberg said he doesn’t think Trump colluded with the Russians but that Mueller may have uncovered some illegal activity by the president. He did not elaborate either time as to what he thinks may have been illegal.

Nunberg said repeatedly throughout his day of interviews that he was worried Mueller was attempting to build a case against Stone, whom he considers a “mentor” and “like a father.” Stone said in a statement to HuffPost later that day that he has “no knowledge or involvement” related to any collusion with Russia.

Nunberg then took his media blitz to CNN, where he reiterated the suspicions in a phone call with host Gloria Borger. Minutes after hanging up, Nunberg got back on the air with CNN’s Jake Tapper with more bold claims.

“Carter Page was colluding with the Russians,” Nunberg said of his fellow former Trump campaign aide. He also called Page a “scumbag” and “a weird dude.”

Page responded, telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity that “there’s been a lot of people that have been quite intoxicated for over a year and a half now, so nothing new here.”

During another CNN appearance, host Erin Burnett said she smelled alcohol on Nunberg’s breath and asked if he had been drinking. He said no but elaborated that he had taken his medication, antidepressants, earlier that day.

During a subsequent press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed any knowledge Nunberg may have.

“He hasn’t worked at the White House, so I certainly can’t speak to him or the lack of knowledge that he clearly has,” she said.

Nunberg brought the roadshow back to MSNBC later in the day, this time appearing in person. The segment, at times, resembled an intervention.

“I think your family wants you home for Thanksgiving, and I think you should testify,” MSNBC legal expert Maya Wiley told Nunberg after he maintained his position on the subpoena.

“I’m not going to jail. Do you think I’m going to jail?” he asked the room as MSNBC host Ari Melber closed out the segment.

Nunberg rounded out the day’s media flurry around midnight in an interview with New York Magazine during which he referred to Sanders as a “slob” and Trump as a “fat ass.”

“I’ve been very clear about this,” he said. “They can take down Trump! I don’t care! Take him down! Take him down!”

In a direct attack on the president’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, Nunberg said that “Trump’s falling is gonna be that Trump is loyal and won’t do anything to his stupid-ass son-in-law, who, by the way, is a thief that stole money from him.”

Nunberg also defended his performance in the Monday night television appearances.Tristan Thompson and Khloe Kardashian on Feb. 17 in Los Angeles, California. Jerritt Clark via Getty Images

The Kardashian family has another baby girl on the way!

Fans found out Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson will welcome a daughter during a pre-taped episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” on Sunday.

Khloe received the baby news while she was on a trip with Kourtney and Kim. Little sister Kylie called to deliver the news from Khloe’s doctor.

Khloe was stunned to find out that she was having a girl.

“I don’t feel like I’m having a girl,” the 33-year-old said on the show crinkling up her face. “I don’t feel like I’m having a girl at all. I’m, like, in a state of shock.”

Kim comforted her younger sister, telling her, “It’s OK, I cried when I found out North was going to be a girl too.”

Khloe later said she was so shocked simply because she was “convinced” she was having a boy.

“When you have your mind made up as to what you’re having — like everyone told me you’re going to feel what you’re having and you’ll just kind of know,” she said, according to E! “And then when you find out it’s the complete opposite, it’s just a shock. I just was convinced that I was having a boy, so to be having a girl it’s just like, ‘OK, that wasn’t what I thought was going on.’”

On Sunday, Khloe tweeted that her hormones had something to do with her reaction.

God gives us what we need! His timing is never wrong! 👶🏽 my hormones were IN RARE FORM for that news — Khloé (@khloekardashian) March 5, 2018

The “Last Week Tonight” host characterized NRATV as an infomercial where stories are “amplified to terrify you and sell you products.”

In a show about firearms aimed at women called “Love At First Shot,” firing an AR-15 was even described as “a nice, light poof of happiness.”

“It’s a little weird to describe a semi-automatic rifle the way Bob Ross describes a fucking cloud,” Oliver said.

Some of the shows, he observed, were more akin to getting “a deranged letter from a serial killer.”“In a normal situation, you might terminate a staff member for that reason. [It] becomes a lot more difficult if you’re going to be sitting at Thanksgiving dinner with that person. And so for Jared and for Ivanka and for all the other members of the family we were involved in one way or the other, I think everybody’s got to focus on what’s best for the president.”One of the most stirring moments at Sunday night’s Academy Awards came when three of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s accusers introduced a video montage to promote “equality, diversity, inclusion, intersectionality.”

Featuring interviews with trailblazing filmmakers like Barry Jenkins, Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig and Dee Rees, the montage crystalized a lot of the themes of the evening.

But the examples seemed cherry-picked and already widely known, and many of the milestones that it lauded only came in the last year or two. The effort felt half-baked and premature: It gave Hollywood something to celebrate, while hiding the larger lack of progress and masking the fact that the industry, and society as a whole, has a lot more work to do.

Study after study on diversity in Hollywood produces the same findings: Women and people of color are woefully underrepresented on screen. Behind the camera, the people who make movies in Hollywood and the executives who decide which movies get made are largely straight, white men. The numbers tick up every now and then, but there is a lack of substantial, permanent progress.

Last week, a study from the University of California, Los Angeles, also highlighted how Hollywood has been slow to realize that audiences prefer diversity on screen ― the same week that Marvel’s “Black Panther” demolished Hollywood’s longstanding myth that movies by and about people of color do not perform well with international audiences.

“Get ready for some more ‘Get Outs’, for some more ‘Black Panthers.’ Get ready for some more ‘Wrinkle in Times.’ We’re here, and we’re not going anywhere,” Lee Daniels, director of “Precious” and “The Butler,” and co-creator of the hit TV series “Empire,” predicted in Sunday’s montage.

In the past, Hollywood executives often considered these hits the exception rather than the rule. It’s too early to tell if they’re learning otherwise.

Largely unmentioned in the segment was the fact that for all of Hollywood’s talk about the need for more black representation, the situation is even worse for Latinos and Asians in the entertainment industry.

Other parts of the show made that clear. In recent years, the Academy has made an effort to include more Latino and Asian performers on stage ― Sunday night’s show again featured a diverse slate of presenters, from “Star Wars” star Kelly Marie Tran, to “Jane the Virgin” and “Annihilation” star Gina Rodriguez ― but still fails to nominate them.

And for all of the focus on the Me Too and Time’s Up movements and the brave women who have led the charge, the Academy still managed to reward Kobe Bryant, who was accused of raping a hotel worker in 2003; and Gary Oldman, whose then-wife said that he beat and choked her in 2001.

Meanwhile, E! host Ryan Seacrest, facing sexual assault allegations from his former stylist, was still a prominent fixture on the network’s red carpet coverage.

Sure, it is encouraging to hear messages of empowerment for women and people of color, and to see awards go to movies like “Moonlight” and “Get Out,” which, even a few years ago, would have been such unlikely Oscar winners. But until the industry produces genuine, lasting progress in diversity and representation ― both in front of and behind the camera ― it will still seem like mere lip service.

One moment in the montage itself encapsulates how this is not the first time expectations of change have surrounded Hollywood.

“When ‘Thelma and Louise’ came out, the huge prediction in the press was, “This changes everything! We’re going to see so many more movies starring female characters,” the movie’s star, Geena Davis, said. “That didn’t happen.”

Davis, who has spent years advocating for greater female representation in movies, went on to declare that “this is now that moment.”The New York Times launched a Twitter zinger at actor Kevin Spacey during the Oscars’ red-carpet procession on Sunday.

Nice to see Kevin Spacey on the red carpet https://t.co/YBPk2kpWRA pic.twitter.com/EXxdqc7sEI — NYT Styles (@NYTStyles) March 4, 2018

Some got it, and appeared to appreciate the burn.

To a few others, it looked at first glance like the Times would have to issue one of its famous corrections because, well, the man pictured is Christopher Plummer. But noooooo. This was Grade-A dissing.

Spacey, of course, did not attend the Academy Awards. He faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, and was replaced by Plummer in reshoots after the film “All The Money In The World” was finished. The 88-year-old Plummer then went on to become the oldest man to earn an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor in his portrayal of J. Paul Getty.

He didn’t win Sunday, but the Times got to post a winner of an insult.

Can we get a rim shot for the Gray Lady?As Ryan Seacrest hosted “E! News” coverage of the Oscars red carpet Sunday night, comedian Kathy Griffin tweeted a message to the woman who has accused the TV host of sexual harassment and assault.

In a message posted to Twitter, Griffin offered to hire Seacrest’s former stylist Suzie Hardy to prepare her for appearances on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “Real Time with Bill Maher” this week.

“I will do for you that which no one did for me after May 30,” Griffin wrote.

Hey Suzie Hardy, I will do for you that which no one did for me after May 30. After you were brave enough to speak out I’m happy to offer you a job as my stylist to dress me this week for Jimmy Kimmel and Real Time & I’ll PAY you. What ya think? KG #Oscars — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) March 5, 2018

Griffin seemed to be referring to the industry reaction she faced after a photo of her holding a fake bloodied, severed head of President Donald Trump circulated on the internet. Amid outrage, Griffin apologized, saying she went “way too far.” Months later, she rescinded her apology, saying the backlash against her was “B.S.” She lamented that she “lost everybody,” including her longtime friendship with Anderson Cooper, due to that photo.

Griffin’s tour was canceled amid the backlash, and CNN fired her from co-hosting the network’s annual New Year’s Eve show.

The comedian posted her tweet as Seacrest seemed to be enjoying his Oscars perch for “E! News,” interviewing celebrities on the red carpet as he usually does.

But days earlier, Seacrest’s former stylist accused him of years of sexual misconduct, including groping her vagina. She said she reported Seacrest to “E! News” human resources in 2013 and was fired.Jennifer Garner’s clap-and-halt at the Oscars on Sunday remains shrouded in mystery ― and memes.

The actress was shown in the audience applauding. Then, suddenly she stopped, and a panicked look took over her face. Or was it confusion?

The internet wanted to know what came over her.

There were at least two chicken jokes, too. That alone should vault the “Dallas Buyers Club” star into Academy Awards meme history.

Jennifer Garner is me every 5 seconds of life — Sahar Bandbaz (@itsaharrr) March 5, 2018Fox News, dogged by years of sexual harassment claims, has named Suzanne Scott its first female CEO despite accusations she contributed to a toxic workplace for women at the cable network.

Scott, a 22-year Fox News veteran who had been president of programming, will lead Fox News and Fox Business Network, the network said on Thursday. She will report to 21st Century Fox Chairman Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who took over Fox News after former CEO Roger Ailes was forced out in a 2016 sexual harassment scandal.

“Suzanne has been instrumental in the success of FOX News and she has now made history as its first female CEO,” Lachlan Murdoch said in a statement. “Her vision and innovation have helped create some of the most popular and lucrative primetime programs on cable and as we embark on the era of the proposed New Fox, I am confident that Suzanne’s leadership will ensure the dominance of both FOX News & FBN for years to come.”

Scott has risen through the ranks at Fox, holding programming, production and creative positions after starting as a programming assistant in 1996.

She’s been accused of helping enforce Ailes’ miniskirt dress code for women ― a claim that she denied to HuffPost last year. She also was named in at least two sexual harassment complaints.

A Fox News spokesperson, asked Thursday about the past allegations, repeated Scott’s denial of wrongdoing.

A lawsuit filed by Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky accuses Scott of encouraging others to gang up on former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson in retaliation for Carson’s complaint of sexual harassment and retaliation against Ailes.

Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros named Scott as a defendant in a lawsuit that accused the network of operating “like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency, and misogyny.”

Scott was promoted to president of programming in May 2017 by Rupert Murdoch after co-president Bill Shine resigned amid accusations he ignored sexual harassment complaints. Nancy Erika Smith, a lawyer who represented Carlson at the time, celebrated Shine’s departure and called for Scott’s ouster as well.

Scott was quoted in Fox News’ announcement of her promotion as saying she was “incredibly honored and humbled.”

Amid the network’s sexual harassment fallout, which includes allegations against now-former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, as well as allegations against Ailes by former Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, the network says it has made strides to improve its workplace.

Those have included Scott announcing a programming leadership team in June that was composed mostly of women. In January, the network released photos of its updated newsroom that has glass walls and bright lights that increase workspace transparency.There are some mistakes that “The Walking Dead” just can’t fix.

For instance, why didn’t Rick (Andrew Lincoln) just shoot Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in Season 8, Episode 1? Rick went to the Sanctuary to shoot him. Negan was right there, out in the open. Why didn’t Rick, you know, do that?

Or why did Carl (Chandler Riggs) aim a machine gun with his missing right eye? You can’t aim a gun accurately if you have no eye on that side. That’s just science.

Outside of “The Walking Dead” universe, these questions have simple explanations. In the case of Rick, producers probably wanted the season (and his battle with Negan) to be longer than one episode. As for Carl, Riggs admitted to HuffPost that he didn’t feel comfortable switching his holster and aiming with his left eye after his character lost his right. (“It was super weird, so I was just like, forget continuity. That’s just ridiculous.”)

But within the universe of “The Walking Dead,” these things don’t make sense. Fortunately, other possible blunders are fixable.

During the Season 7 episode “New Best Friends,” in which we get to know the junkyard-dwelling Heapsters/Scavengers, fans spotted an unidentified object moving behind Rick as he stood on a trash heap. There were also birds in the background of the shot, but many on Twitter determined the object was moving so fast it had to be a plane or some other type of flying contraption, and the production hasn’t said otherwise.

Was that a plane behind Rick's head? Is it supposed to be there or is it a blooper? @WalkingDead_AMC pic.twitter.com/fqkuh4oJAJ — Molly Ehret (@MollyEhret) February 20, 2017

So, did the show’s production team fail to notice an airplane flying around in the background? Or did Rick miss a potential sign that there’s another organized human society out there? (That would be a big deal in the apocalypse!)

The actress who plays Jadis on the show, Pollyanna McIntosh, wouldn’t say whether it was an error. She told HuffPost in an interview late last year, “I can’t say anything. You either talk about a studio screw-up or you talk about a possible thing that might be part of a story.”

The show did introduce a possible solution to the plot hole in Season 8′s “The Big Scary U.” During that episode, Rick briefly sees a mysterious helicopter as he’s walking to see the Heapsters.

And he’s all like, “Da heck?”

Then it’s gone.

We haven’t learned anything else about this helicopter, but if it has some association with the Heapsters, that detail could also explain away the possible airplane plot hole: Perhaps the object flying behind Rick wasn’t an airplane. It was a helicopter all along.

That takes us to Sunday’s Season 8, Episode 10.

In it, the Saviors head to the junkyard to punish the Heapsters for betraying them and siding with Rick. There, they take the group’s guns and end up only leaving the leader, Jadis, alive to torment her over the deaths of her peeps.

But before all that, they question the Heapsters, asking why they apparently have solar panels and a helipad in the back of the junkyard. Jadis doesn’t give them an answer, just stating that the place is a dump, but all we gotta say is, “Oh, heli-yeah.”

Helipad ? So wait that helicopter belongs to the junk people #TheWalkingDead #DemDeadz pic.twitter.com/vddBimx9Qp — B E A N Z | Wakanda’s Favorite 📸 (@PhotosByBeanz) March 5, 2018

The news of the helipad is basically confirmation that the chopper Rick saw had something to do with the junkyard gang. If so, this could finally explain away the UFO that fans spotted behind Rick.Rita Moreno proved she is a truly Oscars icon on Sunday night when she wore the same gown she donned on Oscar night in 1962.

The“One Day at a Time” star revealed to Vanity Fair earlier on Sunday that she’d be wearing the gown she wore when she won her Oscar for “West Side Story.”

Legend and badass Rita Moreno, wearing the same dress she wore to the #Oscars in 1962. pic.twitter.com/d5V7Pbyqiu — Devan Coggan (@devancoggan) March 4, 2018

Moreno, who’s presenting at the 90th Annual Academy Awards ceremony, told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet that the dress was made from a obi sash from the Philippines. Obi sashes are traditional garb for Japanese women that accompany their kimonos. Moreno noted that her skirt is one piece of fabric.

“I would think that it would tarnish,” Moreno said of the dress’ longevity. “It’s been hanging in my closet.”

The 86-year-old Moreno is a marvel for far more reasons than simply fitting into a dress she wore 56 years ago. She’s also one of 12 people to have achieved so-called EGOT status: She’s won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.

Best Dressed at the 2018 Oscars

When Moreno won the Oscar in 1962, she had a mere 15-second speech.

“I had no idea that I was going to win,” she said, after Seacrest asked her what she was thinking that night. “I was sure it was going to be Judy Garland.”Every year, the Academy Awards run long. They run so long each year that the presenters’ banter starts to feel like a series of taunts and watch parties begin to resemble hostage situations. The awards run so long that the academy is forced, annually, to get into a defensive crouch about how this could be allowed to happen again.

And every year, we are offered one scapegoat: the winners, who often ramble on for more than their allotted 45 seconds. Yes, we are told, it is not the academy that is to blame for extending our fun Sunday night TV event into a miserable Monday morning TV ordeal. It is the self-absorbed actors, documentarians, makeup artists and cinematographers who simply can’t stop yammering on about their moms and the plague of racism and other stuff no one cares about.

Well, this year, I refuse to buy into this convenient, academy-exculpating narrative. This year, I say “enough!” to Leonardo DiCaprio talking for two and a half minutes while documentary short directors and sound mixers are played off stage after 30 seconds in the name of brevity. This year, I say it is time to leave the poor speeches alone and instead, at last, to burn the dumbass skits to the ground.

Oscars speeches might sometimes be dull, but they are almost always sweet, a moment of genuine joy and gratitude. Sure, we can hear from Matthew McConaughey whenever we want, and in fact far more often than we want. But most speeches aren’t by McConaughey; they’re by sound editors and costume designers experiencing a rare moment of glory in recognition of their craft. This is literally the point of the Academy Awards, and it should be left alone.

For the terrible, unfunny, smug skits, there is no such excuse ― and yet each year, the Oscars dedicates precious time to them. Take Sunday night’s ceremony, which managed to include one of the most dull and needlessly patronizing Oscars stunts in recent memory.

On the occasion of the 90th Academy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel invited several stars ― including Gal Gadot, Emily Blunt, Lupita Nyong’o, Armie Hammer and Ansel Elgort ― to duck out of the Dolby Theatre and join him in crashing a screening of “A Wrinkle in Time” at a neighboring cinema. They arrived with baskets full of Red Vines and launchers full of hot dogs, ready to shower a crowd of ecstatically grateful proles with snacks and, more crucially, proximity to their celebrité.

The moviegoers, in fact, reacted with tepid applause as their film was interrupted by a group of self-satisfied actors in couture bearing junk food they likely wouldn’t deign to sully their own digestive tracts with.

“This is so much better than the Oscars!” shouted Gadot, who certainly could have gone to a “Wrinkle in Time” screening instead of the Oscars if she wished.

The jaunt was framed as a thank you to moviegoers, we heroic consumers without whose ticket-purchasing prowess Gadot and Elgort would be naught but normies themselves. But I don’t watch movies to make Gadot and Elgort happy, or to make them rich, or to enable them to spend four hours feting their craft and perfect cheekbones on national television each year.

Much like celebrities and other humans, I do things out of self-interest, without any thought as to how I’m serving the rich and famous. A skit that suggests celebrities view us as saintly but pathetic serfs isn’t an act of gratitude ― it’s an act of smug condescension.

The bit, which seemed to go on for days, actually took up at least four and a half minutes of screen time and was certainly less enjoyable to watch than a beaming sound editor experiencing the pinnacle of his Hollywood career.

That wasn’t even the only casually snobbish bit of the night. Kimmel also made a running gag of offering a prize to the shortest speech-giver, as an incentive to be timely. The prize: a Jet Ski and a getaway to Arizona’s Lake Havasu. Oscars attendees roared with laughter as a promo reel played for Lake Havasu, a perfectly lovely vacation spot.

Kimmel is particularly prone to this sort of backhanded comedy when hosting the Oscars. Last year, he ushered in a busload of Hollywood tourists, a skit driving to the punchline that frumpy Midwesterners who take tour buses somehow exist in the same universe as glamorous 90-pound actresses in sequins. He also enlisted his mom to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the attendees, another skit premised on the idea that ordinary people can’t even comprehend the opulence of a celebrity lifestyle. PB and J! At the Oscars! LO fucking L.

Even Oscars skits that wisely avoid positioning the glitterati as benevolent demigods among schmucks in sweatpants rarely seem worth the effort. Sometimes they endeavor to make celebrities seem relatable with junk food ― Ellen DeGeneres ordered pizza for everyone in 2014, because stars eat crap too! (Sure they do.)

Or forget the painful attempts to make us relate to celebrities. Chris Rock’s PricewaterhouseCoopers ballot-counting joke in 2016, in which he introduced three children of Asian descent as the accounting firm’s top representatives, added nothing but a sour note to the evening.

I get it. The Oscars are excruciatingly dull, and skits break up the monotony of award after award after award.Transgender history was made at the Academy Awards Sunday night when “A Fantastic Woman” nabbed the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.

Directed by Sebastián Lelio, the Chilean drama follows a trans waitress and singer, Marina Vidal (played by Daniela Vega), whose grief over the sudden death of her lover, Orlando (Francisco Reyes), is compounded by the scorn she experiences from his family.

“A Fantastic Woman” makes history as the first Oscar winner to feature a transgender storyline with an openly trans performer in the lead role. Although the movie originally featured a cisgender protagonist, Lelio updated the script after he began working with Vega, who had appeared in only one other film (2014′s “The Guest”) before taking on the role of Marina.

Vega appeared onstage alongside Lelio as he accepted the award. The director called the star, who is openly trans, an “inspiration” in his acceptance speech.

“This film was made by a lot of friends and artists,” he said. “I share this with all of you tonight.”

A number of LGBTQ rights advocates and allies praised the win on Twitter.

Daniela Vega's presence on that stage just gave a little more hope to every transgender child around the world watching this broadcast. It can't be overstated the importance of that moment.#Oscars #AFantasticWoman — Charlotte Clymer🏳️‍🌈 (@cmclymer) March 5, 2018

Stars packed into the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday for the 90th Academy Awards. Hosted for a second time by late-night favorite Jimmy Kimmel, this year’s ceremony was the first Oscars to air in the wake of Hollywood’s recent reckoning with sexual harassment and assault.

Guillermo del Toro’s ravishing romantic fantasy “The Shape of Water” led the pack with 13 nominations, and ended the night with four wins, including Best Director and Best Picture. It was the first sci-fi movie ever to win the award.

The genre-defying “Get Out,” certainly the most timely of the films up for Best Picture, also scored four nominations. Director Jordan Peele became the first black director to win for Best Original Screenplay.

Not every award was groundbreaking, though. Timothée Chalamet failed to upset the expected winner, actor Gary Oldman, for his star turn in the sumptuous “Call Me By Your Name.” The 22-year-old would have been the youngest Best Actor honoree in almost 80 years.

Movie fans also had their eyes out for the typically male-dominated Best Director category ― shoutout to Natalie Portman ― which included relative newcomers Peele and Greta Gerwig competing against industry stalwarts like Steven Spielberg and Paul Thomas Anderson. The award ultimately went to del Toro.
