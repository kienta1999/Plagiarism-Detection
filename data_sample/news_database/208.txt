Paramount Network’s original series “Heathers” is a satirical comedy that takes creative risks in dealing with many of society’s most challenging subjects ranging from personal identity to race and socio-economic status to gun violence.

While we stand firmly behind the show, in light of the recent tragic events in Florida and out of respect for the victims, their families and loved ones, we feel the right thing to do is delay the premiere until later this year.WASHINGTON ― Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said Thursday that he would cancel an order for an expensive furniture set for his government office after it sparked ethics concerns and controversy in light of the agency’s proposed budget cuts.

“At the request of the secretary, the agency is working to rescind the order for the dining room set,” HUD spokesman Raffi Williams said in a statement.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later Thursday that HUD is “looking for another option that is more responsible with taxpayer dollars.”

Carson told CNN that he initially wasn’t aware of the purchase. He said he looked for new furniture after he was told the dining set located in a meeting room adjacent to his office was “beyond repair.”

“I left this matter alone to concentrate on much bigger issues. I was as surprised as anyone to find out that a $31,000 dining set had been ordered,” he said in a statement. “I have requested that the order be canceled. We will find another solution for the furniture replacement.”

A former HUD official, Helen Foster, alleged that she was reassigned because she raised concerns about the purchase.

House Oversight Committee chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) asked HUD on Wednesday to provide documents pertaining to office redecorating and Foster’s reassignment.Russia flexed its muscles Thursday when it unveiled new “invincible” nuclear weapons. President Vladimir Putin drove home the point by playing a video that appeared to show those missiles, which he said could hit almost anywhere in the world, striking Florida.

“With the new system, there is no limitation,” Putin said during his annual address to Russia’s Federal Assembly. “As you can see from this video, it can attack any target through the North Pole or via the South Pole. No missile defense system will be able to withstand it.”

The video simulation showed multiple nuclear missiles traveling across the globe and through space before showering down on southern Florida, where President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort happens to be. The footage of Florida being hit was recycled from a 2015 video created by the Russians.

In his speech, Putin said the West has been “ignoring us.” But no longer, he warned.Hackers stole victims names and partial driver's license numbers but not their Social Security numbers, the company said Thursday. NurPhoto via Getty Images

Equifax Inc (EFX.N) said on Thursday that it identified an additional 2.4 million U.S. consumers affected by last year’s massive data breach, bringing the total number of people whose data was compromised to more than 147 million.

The company said in a statement that the newly identified victims had their names and partial driver’s license information stolen, but that the hackers had not obtained their Social Security numbers.

The breach, which was first disclosed in September, has triggered investigations by governments around the world, lawsuits and the departure of several Equifax executives.

The U.S. Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation plans to obtain more information on the newly identified victims, said the group’s chairman, Republican John Thune.

“The company should have acted sooner to mitigate the impact on these additional affected consumers,” Thune said in a statement. “Equifax needs to put consumers first and shouldn’t be trying to clean up its mess in a piecemeal fashion.”

Equifax will release fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, earnings that will give investors a clearer picture on how much it will cost the company to recover from the hack.

The company in November said breach-related costs totalled $87.5 million in third quarter. It issued a fourth-quarter outlook that missed Wall Street forecasts, predicting $60 million to $75 million in costs related to the incident during the period.

Equifax said on Thursday it would contact the newly identified breach victims and offer them free identity theft protection and credit monitoring services.A documentary that premiered Wednesday at the Cannes Film Festival alleges that Whitney Houston was molested as a child by singer Dee Dee Warwick, who was her cousin and the sister of hitmaker Dionne Warwick.

Kevin Macdonald’s “Whitney” dropped the bombshell revelation about three-quarters into the film, according to The Associated Press.

Houston’s half-brother Gary Garland was first to tell Macdonald of the abuse, and said he was molested as well, the director told Indiewire. Pat Houston, who was Houston’s sister-in-law and manager, corroborated the claim.

Macdonald said Houston’s aunt and longtime assistant Mary Jones later provided additional details of the abuse, which she said Houston had confided to her. It was Jones’ interview that changed the direction of the film at the last minute.

“She told me Whitney’s point of view on this, and what Whitney had told her in detail, and how important she felt it was for understanding Whitney, but how scared everyone was to talk about it,” Macdonald told Deadline. “So, yeah, the film changed radically in the last weeks of editing it, which I guess, as a detective, is the result you want.”

Jones says in the film that the abuse filled Houston with shame.

The director said he believes the revelation will add understanding to Houston’s difficult life before her death in 2012 at age 48 from what was ruled an accidental drowning in a bathtub.

“I think it will impact her legacy in a positive way because I hope that it will make people feel like I’m not going to dismiss her as this drug-addicted, tabloid, ne’er do well, low-class person,” Macdonald explained. “By understanding, you humanize. I didn’t start this as a great Whitney Houston fan, but I ended up with a credible sense of empathy for her, and a love of the music born out of that empathy.”

Dee Dee Warwick, a two-time Grammy nominee and backup singer for Aretha Franklin and others, died in 2008 at age 63.Amazon is adding many movies and shows this March, but the most notable titles are a couple original projects from the service.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly may be having second thoughts about his decision to work in the Trump administration, based on comments he made on Thursday.

Kelly was speaking at an event marking the 15th anniversary of the Department of Homeland Security, which he led for six months before replacing former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.

Kelly seemed to miss the days when he was merely protecting the United States and not dealing with the repercussions of every Trump tweet.

He began his remarks on Thursday by telling the crowd, “I miss every one of you, every day.”

The crowd laughed at the comment, which inspired Kelly to express regret at leaving his post at DHS.

“The last thing I wanted to do was walk away from one of the great honors of my life, being the secretary of Homeland Security,” Kelly said. “But I did something wrong and God punished me, I guess.”

Kelly’s quip was taken as a joke by the audience, but there may have been an undercurrent of truth.

Since Kelly became chief of staff in late July, he has had to defend all sorts of Trump gaffes, including telling false stories about Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.), and defending former aide Rob Porter against allegations that he physically abused his two ex-wives.There are crossovers and then there’s James Harden of the Houston Rockets making an absolute mockery of L.A. Clippers’ Wesley Johnson on Wednesday night:

Harden’s crossover sent Johnson flying backward, but it didn’t end there. Harden then paused just to stare Johnson down before casually sinking a three-pointer on his way to a 25-point night.

The Rockets beat the Clippers, 105-92.

If an ankle-breaker main course with a side order of staring wasn’t brutal enough, Harden had some dessert after the game as he laughed the whole thing off:

AFP via Getty Images

The Roman Catholic Church in Italy is reportedly dealing with a crisis of supernatural proportions.

Demand for exorcists in Italy has tripled in recent years, according to Benigno Palilla, a priest and exorcist from Sicily who has taught training courses on exorcism for several years. Palilla told Vatican News in a Feb. 22 article that he believes about 500,000 cases of alleged demonic possession are now emerging in Italy annually.

The priest attributed much of this demonic activity to rising dependence on fortune tellers and tarot card-readers ― practices he claimed “open the door to the devil and to possession,” according to a translation by The Local Italy.

Many alleged demonic possessions turn out to stem from psychological issues, said Palilla. That’s why it’s important for exorcists to be approved by the church and receive intensive trainings.

“A self-taught exorcist certainly makes errors. I will say more: It would also take a period of apprenticeship, as happens for many professionals,” he said, according to the Catholic News Agency.

In the Catholic tradition, an exorcism is a specific form of prayer used to liberate people from the “power of the devil.” In severe cases of demonic possession, church law states that only a bishop or a priest who has obtained the permission of a diocesan bishop can perform this special prayer.

Usually, priests appointed to be exorcists have received specialized training. The priests are taught to thoroughly investigate claims of demonic possession and to consider input from medical and mental health professionals.

During an exorcism, priests recite prayers and read from the Bible. They sprinkle water, lay hands, and sometimes breathe on the afflicted person, before showing a cross. The purpose of these rituals is to demonstrate the power of Christ over the devil, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Palilla’s trainings in Sicily have the approval of local bishops.

The Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum, a Catholic educational institution in Rome, is planning to offer a special course on exorcism starting April 16. Similar sessions have been offered by the school in the past.

Barack Obama, the basketball-loving former president, said this week he’d play for the San Antonio Spurs if he were an All-Star free agent in the NBA. The declaration prompted a funny response on Wednesday from Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.

At an MIT Sports Analytics Conference in Boston, Obama said that as a player he would seek out the five-time champion Spurs because they satisfy his checklist for ideal organizations.

“They’re smart, they’re well-run, they’re focused on team,” he said (listen in the sound clip below). “They treat everybody in the organization with respect, and that is the kind of organization that I want to be a part of. So I would say that over the last 15 years in basketball, San Antonio would be a great example of that.”

“If you look at what they’ve built,” he continued, “it’s just a smart, well-run operation with a good culture.”

Obama’s shoutout did not go unnoticed by the Spurs’ coach, who happens to be a critic of President Donald Trump and a socially conscious fellow. He also has a sense of humor.

“That’s very flattering,” Popovich said, according to the Bay Area News Group. “I’d have to do a background check on him, though, because I’ve heard some things he’s done in the past aren’t very good. I can’t remember where I heard that stuff, but I’d have to do a background check.”

Hera, give us strength.

Kristen Wiig is being considered to play a villain named Cheetah in the follow-up to 2017′s blockbuster “Wonder Woman,” Deadline reports. The untitled sequel is set to take place during the Cold War era of the 1980s.

Cheetah first appeared in Wonder Woman No. 6 in October 1943. In the issue, the character Priscilla Rich is upstaged by Wonder Woman at a social event. Her jealousy causes her to develop an enraged alter ego known as Cheetah, and she becomes a lifelong nemesis of Wonder Woman.President Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his repeated and wildly inaccurate claim that the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre could have been prevented if attendees had access to firearms.

Trump appeared to be more in agreement with Democrats than Republicans during much of the televised White House meeting on gun violence. The president’s suggestions included preventing people with mental illnesses from obtaining guns, raising the age limit for buying assault rifles from 18 to 21, and arming teachers in schools.

To back up his ideas, he once again cited the Pulse attack ― which targeted members of the LGBTQ community and left 49 people dead.

“As an example, you take Pulse nightclub,” he said, as seen in the Wall Street Journal video above. “If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly not to the extent it did, where he was just in there shooting and shooting and shooting, and they were just defenseless.”

The president, unfortunately, ignored the fact that there was an armed, off-duty police officer at the club on the night of the attack. Adam Gruler was at his second job working Pulse security, and he reportedly exchanged gunfire with shooter Omar Mateen outside the club’s entrance in the wee hours of June 12, 2016.

Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018

Gruler attended Trump’s State of the Union speech this year as a special guest of U.S. Rep. Val Demings (D-Orlando).

The president has falsely claimed that no one at Pulse was armed before.

“If you had some guns in that club the night that this took place, if you had guns on the other side, you wouldn’t have had the tragedy that you had,” he told CNN in a June 2016 interview, the day after the attack. “If people in that room had guns with the bullets flying in the opposite direction right at him... right at his head, you wouldn’t have had the same tragedy that you ended up having.”

Just days after that, he offered similar sentiments at a campaign rally in Atlanta.

“If some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle, and if the bullets were going in the other direction, aimed at this guy who was just open target practice,” he said, “you would’ve had a situation, folks.”

AdvertisementAlec Baldwin came under fire for the way he defended Woody Allen against molestation accusations in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Thursday.

The actor described his inclination to support Allen as “normal. Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow, 32, says the director sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old. The director has denied all accusations.

Baldwin said the best way for the Me Too movement to succeed is to have someone ”go to jail and prove that there are real consequences.”

His choice: Harvey Weinstein.

“He’s not even low hanging fruit, he’s right in the dirt to pick up ― and we need to see a conviction,” Baldwin said.

However, he thinks too much of the movement is “just accusations and condemnations being played out in the press.” The actor fears the movement is becoming a witch hunt of sorts.

“When the community at large runs out of perpetrators, they start to turn on the supporters of the perpetrators because they need more fuel for the fire,” he said. “The next thing they throw on the fire are the friends of these people who aren’t stepping out and renouncing them.”

Baldwin then explained why he continues to defend Allen and filmmaker James Toback, who has been accused of sexual assaulting 38 women.

“My inclination to want to defend my friends — who either A) I thought were innocent, which is Woody or B) I had no knowledge of what they did and I still have no knowledge of what they did, which is Toback — is a normal inclination,” he said. “It’s a normal inclination to want to rally by your friends up until the point that they are convicted of something. If they’re convicted of a crime, well then you’re sad, and that’s tragic, but they’ve got to go through that process.”

“In the meantime,” he added, “I hope that we see some manifestation of this beyond just social media.”

Baldwin’s latest venture, an ABC talk show called “Sundays With Alec Baldwin,” will debut after the Oscars on Sunday with comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Kate McKinnon as guests.

One person unlikely to be a guest is Allen, Baldwin admitted.On Wednesday night’s “Conan,” Zach Galifianakis’ introduction began like it would for any guest.

Galifianakis was appearing on the late night program to promote his FX show, “Baskets.” When it was time for him to come out, Conan said, “Please welcome our friend, Zach Galifianakis!” Conan gestured to the guest entrance to his left, but no one appeared.

Both Conan and sidekick Andy Richter look around, confused, before the late night host announced Galifianakis a second time. Still nothing.

“The Simpsons” version of President Donald Trump, however, has yet to appear on the site. So, here you go:Reuters

Patton Oswalt is not just a devoted nerd, he’s an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful nerd. In 2012, he appeared on “Parks and Recreation” and ranted for eight minutes straight, outlining his brilliantly detailed plot for a Star Wars-Marvel crossover film.

On Saturday, Oswalt knocked around a theory about “The Dark Knight” ― specifically about the origin of Heath Ledger’s Joker. The 2008 film explains almost nothing about where the character came from, but some fans have theorized that because of his fighting style and familiarity with weapons, the Joker is a war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Oswalt takes that idea further and asks, “What if he’s not only ex-military, but ex-military intelligence?”

This theory makes a lot of sense and adds clarity to some of the Joker’s lines throughout the film. For example, he says of one character, “I know the squealers when I see them.” Or the scene in the police interrogation room where Batman slams the Joker’s head on the table, and the villain says, “Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy.”President Donald Trump briefly mentioned Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate in a special House election in western Pennsylvania, during a visit to the district in January to tout the GOP tax cut bill. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― What happens to a president who hosts a rally for a candidate in an obscure special election but then watches that candidate lose anyway?

President Donald Trump’s political advisers don’t really want to find out. Which is why less than two weeks away from the March 13 election to fill a traditionally Republican congressional seat in western Pennsylvania, his team has yet to finalize an appearance by him.

A March 10 rally with Rick Saccone, the GOP candidate for the House District 18 seat, is still only “tentative” for Trump, according to multiple sources. One Republican consultant close to Trump’s political operation said the tightening of the race in recent weeks has sparked worries of the damage to Trump should Saccone lose despite a presidential visit.

“They’ll wave off if the numbers don’t get better,” the consultant said on the condition of anonymity.

A mid-February Gravis poll gave Saccone a 6-percentage point lead over Democrat Conor Lamb ― just half the size of what the Republican enjoyed the previous month. A Monmouth University poll, also from mid-February, showed Saccone with a 3-point lead, within the poll’s error margin of plus-or-minus 5.5 points.

In the 2016 presidential race, Trump won the district by 19 points. The special election is to replace former Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, who resigned late last year because of a sex scandal. First elected in 2002, Murphy ran unopposed in 2014 and 2016.

A White House official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity said the characterization of Trump’s political operation fearing damage to him should Saccone lose was not accurate. Rather, Trump would likely not bother going to the Pittsburgh suburbs if polling shows that Saccone is clearly winning or if he is clearly losing.

“They want to get closer and see what the race looks like,” the official said. “If there’s a need, he’ll go.”

Trump already suffered two high-profile election defeats during his first year in office, as Democrats have swarmed to the polls to register their displeasure with the new president and his policies.

Trump backed Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia governor’s race in November, warning voters that their economy would tank and that a Salvadoran gang would send crime rates skyrocketing if the Democratic candidate were to win. Gillespie lost by nine points.

The next month, Trump backed defrocked judge and accused child molester Roy Moore for a Senate seat in Alabama, which Republicans had held for decades. Democrat Doug Jones won by a little less than 2 points.

The president blamed Gillespie for losing the Virginia race, arguing that had the candidate embraced Trump more fully, he would have won. And after Moore’s loss, Trump pointed out that in the GOP primary he had endorsed Moore’s opponent, Luther Strange.

Trump did not physically campaign for Gillespie. He did wind up publicly praising Moore, but at a rally in Pensacola, Florida ― across Perdido Bay from Alabama.

In Saccone’s race, Trump issued a statement via Twitter the morning of Jan. 18: “Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE, running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!”

That day’s visit, though, was an official one to tout the newly passed tax cuts. While Trump briefly praised Saccone ― “He’s a great guy; loves this area, loves this country” ― the campaign visit was to come later, at a Feb. 21 rally.

By mid-February, though, the polls were showing increasing Democratic enthusiasm in the contest. And when the Florida school massacre took place on Feb. 14, Trump’s political operation cited it in their announcement that the following week’s rally had been canceled.

Matt Mackowiak, a campaign consultant and chair of the county Republican Party in Austin, Texas, said a Saccone loss would speak more to the overall political environment than say anything about Trump personally.President Donald Trump is hawking a new $50 hat emblazoned with the slogan “American Dreamer.”

At first, the navy blue headwear sold on Trump’s official website may appear inoffensive. But the slogan actually references a particularly divisive line from Trump’s first State of the Union speech in January, which critics described as “a racist dog-whistle against immigrants.”

Donaldjtrumpcom

During his address to Congress, Trump doubled down on his administration’s uncompromising immigration policies and said it was his duty was “to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers, too.”

Some perceived the statement as a swipe at Dreamers, the children of undocumented immigrants who were previously protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Trump terminated the program in September 2017 and Congress has yet to agree on a substitute.

The “Americans are dreamers, too” line was also endorsed by white nationalist Richard Spencer and former KKK grand wizard David Duke.

These Trump hats get worse and worse https://t.co/OkunkPWUz3 — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) February 28, 2018Workers have rallied at the state Capitol every workday since the strike began last Thursday. Dave Jamieson/HuffPost

The statewide strike by teachers and other school workers in West Virginia stretched into its second week on Thursday, as protesters filled the state Capitol for a sixth straight workday with no clear end to the work stoppage in sight.

The standoff between workers and legislators appeared all but resolved just two days earlier, when Republican Gov. Jim Justice announced a deal with union leaders to hike pay for teachers and state employees. But rank-and-file workers felt the plan didn’t resolve the most pressing concern for many of them ― the rising costs of the state employee health plan ― and were reluctant to end the strike before the legislature passed a bill guaranteeing the raises.

In a remarkable turn, workers bucked union leadership and vowed to return to the picket lines, carrying out what amounted to a wildcat strike. Schools in all 55 counties stayed closed on Thursday, a day Justice had expected everyone to return to work after a one-day “cooling off” period on Wednesday.

I was concerned that going wildcat today would dampen public support. So far, I'm not seeing it. People are still in our corner as we stand up for a better system for public employees — Jonathan Williams (@maxforinstance) March 1, 2018

Negotiations in the West Virginia Capitol showed little sign of an imminent breakthrough to reopen schools. By Thursday night, all counties announced that they would be closed for Friday.

The previous night the state’s House of Delegates had passed the pay raise bill, which would boost salaries by 5 percent for teachers and other school personnel; and 3 percent for state workers this year. On Thursday, the state Senate moved the same proposal to its finance committee, which wasn’t scheduled to meet for the day. Many Republicans questioned whether the state had the money in its budget to pay for the raises that Justice had agreed to fund.

Republicans control both chambers of the statehouse.

Many workers have been adamant that a clear path be laid out to rein in rising premiums under their health care program, known as the Public Employee Insurance Agency, or PEIA. In interviews with HuffPost, several school employees said health care costs were a greater concern than pay, noting that high premiums could wipe away some or all of the pay increases the state would give them.

Still, some workers told the Gazette-Mail they would be willing to go back to work if the senate would at least pass the pay raise legislation, leaving health care to be dealt with later.

In the initial deal, Justice had said he would set up a task force to stabilize PEIA costs, and that unions would have a seat at the table. Workers were reluctant to take the governor at his word. Many of them wanted legislators to create a concrete solution to health care costs, arguing they had maximum leverage while they were on strike.

“All hell is breaking loose,” one teacher told HuffPost Wednesday.

Day 6.. We are we and cold but still holding strong! #55United #55strong pic.twitter.com/X2fp2tDb80 — Emily Tettenburn (@ETettenburn) March 1, 2018

West Virginia teachers are some of the lowest compensated in the nation, ranking 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in pay, according to the National Education Association. The state hasn’t given them an across-the-board raise since 2014. Meanwhile, rising health care costs have caused some workers’ take-home pay to go down.

The massive school shutdown is the first of its kind in West Virginia since 1990, when 47 of the state’s 55 counties closed schools for 11 days during a labor dispute. Public sector workers in West Virginia do not have collective bargaining rights, so their unions don’t negotiate contracts with local school districts the way unions do elsewhere. Instead, they lobby the state legislature, which sets the statewide payscale and oversees the health care program.

The state’s attorney general made clear before the walkout that the state would view any strike by public sector workers as illegal. It’s possible that individual counties could start pursuing court injunctions forcing workers back onto the job if the strike isn’t resolved soon, and counties are determined to reopen schools.

So far that hasn’t happened, probably because there’s been a lot of sympathy and community support around the state for the striking workers. It remains to be seen how long that support will last if the strike persists, or whether all 55 counties will remain onboard with a prolonged walkout. A return to work by some but not others could begin to crack the solidarity of a strike that began with the slogan #55strong.Despite Mary J. Blige receiving a slew of accolades ― including an Oscar nomination ― for her role in “Mudbound,” new reports indicate that she spent more on the role than she made.

Nominated for best supporting actress and best original song in “Mudbound,” Blige said the film left her with expenses that far outweighed the monetary compensation received, according to a report in The Blast. The report did not specify what exactly those expenses were or how much she received.

Blige also reportedly said that she’d been in need of finding new projects to make money and that her TV/film roles were not lucrative, citing touring as her main source of income. She said her roles on television and film were more integral to supporting her image and brand than her wallet.

Netflix declined a request for comment.

This latest news came to light after Blige recently filed court documents ahead of her upcoming divorce trial with Kendu Isaacs. According to the documents, she is refusing his request for spousal support, saying Isaacs is responsible for financial hardships.

The divorce battle began in July 2016. Blige claimed that Isaacs only sees her as his “bank” and that she’s paying down the $12 million in debt the two accrued while married. While Isaacs claimed he is currently “unemployable” and was recently hospitalized due to stress from the divorce.

Of the divorce chaos, Blige told Variety in September of last year that she’s “not happy about a lot of things.”

“I thought someone loved me, right? Turns out, he was a con artist and he didn’t, and now he’s coming after me for all my money,” she said. “When you come out of something like that, you realize you were never the one. There was someone else that was his queen. I got played. I got suckered.”Georgia lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday effectively punishing Delta Air Lines for its decision to cut ties with the National Rifle Association in the wake of last month’s school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

The state’s House and Senate passed a major a tax bill, which Republican lawmakers had amended to remove a sales tax exemption on jet fuel, The Associated Press reported. Delta, which is based in Atlanta, would have been the primary airline to benefit from the exemption.

Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle (R) was one of the main lawmakers pushing for the amendment after Delta announced it would no longer offer NRA members discounted fares following the Feb. 14 shooting in Florida. A gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and injured over a dozen others, reigniting a fierce debate on gun control around the country.

A number of companies, ranging from banks to insurance providers to rental car brands, announced decisions to end formal and informal deals with the NRA in response to the company’s staunch anti-gun control stance.

Cagle, however, saw Delta’s decision as a direct attack on conservatives and vowed to undermine any legislation that might benefit the airlines.

“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Cagle wrote on Twitter on Monday.

I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back. — Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018

Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R), who is serving his last year in office, criticized lawmakers’ attack on Delta as an “unbecoming squabble.”

“Ours is a welcoming state, the epitome of Southern hospitality,” Deal said on Wednesday. “We were not elected to give the late-night talk show hosts further fodder for their monologues, or to act with the type of immaturity that has caused so many in our society to be skeptical about politics.”It's that time of the year when President Trump pretends he respects women. MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images

President Donald Trump proclaimed March Women’s History Month in a rather, um, ironic statement published Wednesday evening.

“Our history is rich with amazing stories of strong, courageous, and brilliant women,” his statement begins. “Since America’s founding, women have played an integral part in American innovation and productivity, while simultaneously raising generations of lively children and providing leadership in their local communities.”

First lady Melania Trump also recognized the month, tweeting that it’s “a time to celebrate ways American women have historically changed & continue to shape our society.”

In his statement, the president pointed to women who have created change throughout history ― like Mary Katherine Goddard, who printed the second copy of the Declaration of Independence in 1775. He also gave himself a pat on the back, saying that his recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help women.

While it’s standard for presidents to formally declare Women’s History Month (Barack Obama and earlier presidents did so too), there’s a certain discordant note this year ― as there was with Trump’s similar declaration last year. It’s no secret that the current president and his administration have a horrible track record with women and the issues that benefit us lady folk.

He has been accused of sexual misconduct ― ranging from harassment to assault and rape ― by 21 women and has categorically denied all allegations as “fake news.” Last fall, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested that all those accusers were lying.

He has rolled back access to safe and affordable reproductive health care around the world, while Vice President Mike Pence recently suggested that legal abortions in the U.S. “could end in our time.”

Trump, along with other members of his administration, continued to defend former White House staff secretary Rob Porter even after he resigned from his position following reports that he had physically abused both of his ex-wives. Staying true to form, the president suggested that both women were lying with their accusations of domestic violence.

The list goes on and on. And though most voters do recognize that Trump lacks credibility in the feminist department, it seems fitting to remind Americans on the first day of Women’s History Month that our president is an accused sexual predator and a defender of an alleged wife beater.

AdvertisementThe Senate Intelligence Committee has found that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are responsible for leaking to Fox News confidential text messages between the Senate panel’s highest ranking Democrat and a Washington lobbyist associated with a Russian billionaire, sources familiar with the situation told The New York Times on Thursday.

Two Senate committee members ― Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), whose texts were leaked, and Sen. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.), the panel’s chairman ― were “perturbed” by the findings and discussed them with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last month, the sources told the Times.

The senators, whose committee is conducting an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, reportedly relayed to Ryan their concern about the direction of the House panel under the leadership of its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Nunes drafted and pushed for public release a controversial memo last month accusing the Justice Department and FBI of impropriety in their separate probe into the Russian meddling and possible connections to President Donald Trump’s campaign.

Fox News touted the text exchange as an “exclusive,” but even some Republicans discounted its worth.

Warner disclosed to his committee months before the leak that he had reached out last year to lobbyist Adam Waldman, who runs a firm that worked with a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska in 2009 and 2010. Warner hoped Waldman could connect him with Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the now infamous dossier that, among other things, alleges a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

The leaked communication also appears to fall in line with Warner’s duties on the intelligence committee. Nevertheless, Trump seized on the shell of a controversy to attempt to discredit the investigations into the role Russia played in influencing the 2016 election.

Both the timing of the Fox News report and markings on the documents they published indicated to the Senate committee that Republicans on the House committee were behind the leak, the sources told the Times.A transgender male wrestler won his second-straight Texas girls’ 6A 110-pound division title on Sunday.

Mack Beggs, who is an 18-year-old senior at Euless Trinity High School just north of Arlington, Texas, entered the state tournament last week with a perfect record. On Sunday, he beat Chelsea Sanchez — who he also beat in the championship last season — to take the 110-pound title.

Fans had mixed reactions, and a loud chorus of boos could be heard when Beggs was named the state champion.

“It definitely felt different,” Beggs told the Dallas Morning News. “I felt a lot more humble. This year I wanted to prove a point that anyone can do anything. Even though I was put in this position, even though I didn’t want to be put in this position, even though I wanted to wrestle the guys, I still had to wrestle the girls.

“But what can I tell people? I can tell the State Legislature to change the policy, but I can’t tell them to change it right now. All I can hope for is that they come to their [senses] and realize this is stupid and we should change the policies to conform to other people in my position.”

Though he has repeatedly asked to wrestle in the boys’ devision, Beggs is forced to wrestle girls because, under University Interscholastic League rules, athletes must compete in the gender division that corresponds to their birth certificates.

Beggs, who was born female as Mackenzie, identifies as a male. He has not yet had gender reassignment surgeries, though the Dallas Morning News reports that he recently consulted with a Plano, Texas, clinic and hopes to have “top surgery” in the near future.

Beggs beat three female wrestlers en route to his state title, at least one of whom has said she doesn’t think it’s fair that Beggs gets to wrestle in the girls’ division.

“I understand if you want to transition your gender,” said Cypress Ranch wrestler Kayla Fitts, who went 52-0 this season before falling to Beggs in the semifinals. “I understand that totally. But there’s a time and a place. You can do that after high school.

“Or if you want to do it, you can quit the sport. Because I don’t think it’s fair at all that you’re taking testosterone. That’s steroids. I know it’s not a lot. But still.”

Beggs has been taking low-dose testosterone injections prescribed by his doctor since his freshman year, though that was not made public until last January. He is allowed to take the testosterone, even though State and UIL rules prohibit their use by high school athletes, because they are “dispensed, prescribed, delivered and administered by a medical practitioner for a valid medical purpose.”

Many have called for this rule to be changed; a lawsuit was even filed by a Texas high school parent.

While more than a dozen states and the NCAA allow athletes to participate in sports based on their gender identity, the UIL still stands firm on its ruling.

“The UIL is not in the gender-determining business and schools don’t want to be either,” UIL deputy director Jamey Harrison told the Associated Press.

His mom, Angela McNew, said that Beggs isn’t trying taking advantage of the girls he is forced to wrestle simply to have an easier path to a state title. It’s just the situation he was forced into.

“He has so much respect for all the girls he wrestles,” McNew said. “People think Mack has been beating up on girls. … The girls he wrestles with, they are tough. It has more to do with skill and discipline than strength.”

Beggs has compiled a 132-9 record over the last three seasons, and hasn’t lost a match in the past two years. He currently has scholarship offer to a small college, where he was promised a spot on the men’s wrestling team next season.NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity performance tumbled and the dollar strengthened against the Canadian and Mexican currencies on Thursday after President Donald Trump said the United States would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports next week.

The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso hit session lows after Trump vowed to rebuild American steel and aluminum industries at a meeting of U.S. industry officials at the White House.

U.S. steelmakers jumped on the news, with AK Steel Holding up 9.7 percent, U.S. Steel Corp gaining 7.1 percent and Nucor rising 2.85 percent.

The administration has said duties would protect U.S. companies, but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a Trump campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, called Trump’s proposed tariffs a “bombshell” announcement that might help the steel and aluminum industry but ultimately hurt U.S. stocks.

“It’s helping about a dozen stocks in those industries but has raised the specter of trade wars, and trade wars don’t help the stock market,” Tuz said.

Stocks on Wall Street had mostly traded lower before Trump’s actions, weighed by remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Senate Banking Committee in Congress and New York Fed President William Dudley in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

While Powell tried to temper remarks he made on Tuesday that raised concerns about the potential for four interest rate hikes this year rather than the Fed’s forecast of three, Dudley was a bit more pointed and said four rate hikes would be “gradual.”

“By and large (Powell) painted the picture of an economy that is doing well and even a little bit better than expected, and that’s prompted fears of rising inflation. Four (rate hikes) this year is now the consensus I think,” Tuz said.

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York, said tariffs have not worked historically and they cause retaliation.

“This is sort of working your way into a trade war which is a drag on the economy. It is also inflationary so if you are worried about inflation it is going to pump that up,” Hogan said.

MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.88 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.26 percent to close at 1,468.47.

European markets had already closed by the time Trump’s comments about tariffs was reported.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265.07 points, or 1.06 percent, to 24,764.13. The S&P 500 lost 21.52 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,692.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.12 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,213.89.

The dollar index rose 0.07 percent, with the euro up 0.11 percent to $1.2206. The Japanese yen weakened 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 106.75 per dollar.

The Mexican peso lost 0.29 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.89, while the Canadian dollar fell 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 1.29 per dollar.

The gap between short-dated U.S. borrowing costs and those in Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks by the Fed and European Central Bank for the two regions diverged.

U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to push yields lower to 2.8351 percent.

U.S. consumer prices increased in January as a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, but a survey showed the euro zone’s factory boom slowed a little further in February, pressuring euro zone yields lower.

“In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz.

Oil fell more than 1 percent, hitting two-week lows on pressure from a strong dollar and worries that surging U.S. crude output might thwart efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain global supply.

U.S. crude fell 51 cents to $61.13 per barrel and Brent was last at $63.95, down 78 cents on the day.TONIGHT: Move over Obama, it turns out Donald Trump is the president who might take away America's guns. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/FhyLaQGAce — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) March 1, 2018

It’s not often that “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert is left speechless, especially when it comes to President Donald Trump.

But it happened on Wednesday night.

Colbert had to give the president credit for something he said earlier in the day while discussing gun control.

Now, Colbert said, Trump may have finally achieved something that President Barack Obama never did.A 26-year-old Utah man who has been imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years without trial posted videos to Facebook on Wednesday that show him begging for his life amid rioting at the prison.

Josh Holt, who was arrested in the South American country with his newlywed wife Thamara (Thamy) Caleno in 2016, posted short videos and messages to the site, in which he claims rioters in Caracas are threatening to kill him.

“Help me please united states, how long do I have to suffer unjustly in this place?” he wrote in one Facebook post. “I am not a political pawn i am a human being a child of God and I just want to live happy with my wife and children. I have NEVER done anything wrong in my life. Please help me!!”

American Josh Holt, 26, posted videos to Facebook on Wednesday that appear to show him begging for his life amid riots at a Venezuelan prison. Facebook

Rioting has been reported at the Caracas prison, El Helicoide, which is the headquarters of Sebin, the country’s intelligence agency. Videos viewed by Reuters purportedly show prisoners walking around freely inside of the facility demanding their freedom.

“This has been taken over peacefully by all the political prisoners and all the prisoners who are abducted here, who are tortured daily,” one man is quoted as saying in a video. The man said tear gas and weapons had been fired upon the detainees but that they are holding out to demand their release.

The violence reported this week in Caracas comes days before the country will hold a presidential election. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who is seeking reelection, has some of his top opponents imprisoned inside Helicoide.

Utah Rep. Mia Love (R) said Wednesday that she has spoken with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and her office confirmed that the prison where Holt is being held was threatened by riots and violence but that he is safe.

“I am extremely concerned about this situation, but have been assured that Josh is safe at this time,” Love said in a statement. “It is time for the State Department to quickly produce a plan of action in order to resolve this situation once and for all. Josh and his family have suffered far too long.”

Holt was arrested shortly after his family said he traveled to Venezuela to marry Caleno, a fellow Mormon that he met online. It was while they were in Caleno’s apartment in a Caracas public housing project that they were arrested, with the police accusing him of stockpiling an assault weapon and grenades.

His family has said that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His mother, Laurie Holt, speaking to the Deseret News Wednesday, said his trial was scheduled to start Tuesday but that he was never brought to the hearing.

“He hasn’t had any justice whatsoever on trumped-up charges that are ridiculous,” she said.

The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. will hold the Venezuelan government responsible if anything happens to Holt or any of the other political prisoners.That thing that much of America is anxiously waiting for is finally happening.

No, Robert Mueller hasn’t pointed at President Donald Trump and yelled, “He did it!” Yet. But after much anticipation, Hulu will add “National Lampoon’s Dorm Daze 2: College @ Sea” this month. If you don’t have a subscription, this would be the time to get one.

But if that title somehow doesn’t interest you, Hulu also adds many other movies and shows this month. Maybe “Earth Girls Are Easy,” starring Jim Carrey, Jeff Goldblum and Damon Wayans as truly insane-looking aliens, is more your thing.

Or maybe you’d rather just watch a classic like “Dirty Dancing.” Hulu has you covered this month regardless.

A few highlights:

Movies: “Dirty Dancing,” “Power Rangers,” “The Square,” “Young Adult” and many James Bond movies.

Shows: “American Idol” (Series Premiere), “American Ninja Warrior” (Season 9 Premiere), “Angie Tribeca” (Season 3) and “Roseanne” (Series Premiere).

If you don't know Hasan Minhaj yet, you're about to. His new Netflix talk show is gonna tell the truth in the most hilarious way possible. Here's a taste (from his special Homecoming King, which you can watch now) pic.twitter.com/iVGhuge8oh — Netflix US (@netflix) March 1, 2018

Minhaj will become the first Indian-American to front a weekly comedy show, one that THR’s story said will “explore the modern cultural and political landscapes with depth and sincerity.”

Netflix has already committed to 32 episodes of the show, according to THR.

“I’m thrilled to be joining the Netflix family as the country braces for another election season — and like you, I cannot wait to find out who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin picks this time,” said Minhaj in a statement.

He also quipped on Twitter that this news came just in time:

Phew. My LSAT score just expired. https://t.co/ctIKknr8BB — Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) March 1, 2018

Minhaj reportedly produced his own pilot, sparking a bidding war that Netflix won. Netflix’s vice president of content, Bela Bajaria, told THR she’s been “a big fan of Hasan’s for many years.”

Bajaria, who is the industry’s highest-ranking Indian-American executive, also touted Minhaj’s writing skills and thoughtfulness.

“He’s a phenomenal writer with a distinct point of view [and] he is a brilliant performer, who is hilarious both onstage and off,” she said. “And more importantly, he isn’t afraid to share his thoughtful voice and unique perspective.”
