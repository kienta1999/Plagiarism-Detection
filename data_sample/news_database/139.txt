“Star Trek” legend William Shatner set his phasers on Facebook after a sponsored ad circulating on the social media platform’s Messenger service falsely claimed he had died.

A Twitter user alerted Shatner to the premature news of his death on Wednesday afternoon, the day before the actor turned 87. Shatner responded by asking Facebook to investigate.

Hey @facebook isn’t this your messenger app? What’s up with you allowing this Acocet Retail Sales ad to pass your muster? Thought you were doing something about this? https://t.co/1fFriJ8PRu — William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) March 21, 2018

“What’s up with you allowing this Acocet Retail Sales ad to pass your muster?” Shatner asked. “Thought you were doing something about this?”

The fake ad came at a tricky time for Facebook, which is currently catching heat over a huge data breach ― for which CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally apologized on Wednesday.

Rob Leathern, Facebook’s director of product management, responded to Shatner more than two hours later to reveal that the offending ad and page had been “removed” from the social media platform.

Hi, I'm from Facebook. Thanks for letting us know about this. We have removed this ad and Page from Facebook — Rob Leathern 🛠 (@robleathern) March 21, 2018

Shatner thanked Leathern for the prompt action and added what appeared to be a semi-serious request.

AdvertisementJudd Apatow on Wednesday revealed a side of Garry Shandling’s wit that most people had never seen before.

While promoting his new documentary about Shandling on “Conan,” Apatow read aloud from a diary the comic wrote after his 2000 film “What Planet Are You From?” flopped. Shandling wrote and starred in the sci-fi satire.

At some point, Apatow said, the dejected Shandling wrote out some mock movie-poster quotes about the misfire, including “I hate myself ― Garry Shandling.”

Shandling, perhaps best known for “The Larry Sanders Show” and “It’s Garry Shandling’s Show,” died in 2016 at age 66.

Apatow, who directed an episode of “The Larry Sanders Show,” spoke to host Conan O’Brien with genuine reverence about his mentor Shandling. The whole interview above is worth a watch, but you can fast-forward to the 3:45 mark if you want to cut to the “Planet” part.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross claims he sold his stake in Diamond S Shipping months ago.

When private equity magnate Wilbur Ross agreed to become President Donald Trump’s commerce secretary in January 2017, he promised to divest himself of investments all over the world ― with a few exceptions. In particular, Ross said he’d maintain a “passive” stake in Diamond S Shipping, an international shipping operation that sails under the Chinese flag.

Ross’ decision to hold onto Diamond S raised more than a few eyebrows. In March 2017, a report by the Center for Public Integrity highlighted controversial Diamond S operations in Iran and Russia, and questioned whether Ross’ continued ownership stake in the shipping enterprise was a conflict of interest for an American public official tasked with overseeing much of U.S. trade policy.

Ross’ investment in Diamond S flew largely under the radar, however, in an administration plagued by chronic scandal. In November, after further questioning from the Center for Public Integrity, Commerce Department spokesman James Rockas declared that Ross “has fully divested of his interest in Diamond S. Shipping.”

Yet more than four months after Rockas’ announcement, there is still no public record indicating that Ross has actually divested from the company. None of the 27 filings he has made with the Office of Government Ethics since joining the administration have mentioned Diamond S or any of the financial intermediaries through which Ross owns his stake in the shipping firm ― including WLR Recovery Associates IV DSS AIV LP, WLR Recovery Associates V DSS AIV LP, and DSS Holdings LP. In December, Rockas said that Ross had already made the filings, which would be released “in due course.”

Administration officials are legally required to disclose transactions of personal assets valued at more than $1,000, and Ross has detailed the progress of his divestments in other companies ― including Sun Bancorp, BankUnited, Ocwen mortgage servicing, Chevron, Merck and Apple. But there are no filings on the shipping giant.

In 2011, Ross’ private equity firm led a consortium of investors taking a $1 billion stake in Diamond S, making him non-executive chairman of the Diamond S board. (The size of his current investment is not entirely clear.) The Greenwich, Connecticut-headquartered company operates 45 oil tankers, of which 32 are officially registered in Hong Kong. That means they sail under the Chinese flag rather than the American flag, a distinction that allows them to avoid key U.S. regulations and pay workers lower wages. Diamond S vessels have made more than 100 stops in China since 2012, according to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity.

Since he became commerce secretary, Ross has been closely involved in U.S. trade policy with China, meeting with the head of that country’s largest sovereign wealth fund in July. In November, Ross and Trump announced a series of agreements with Chinese government firms to develop natural gas resources in Alaska, although it’s unclear which, if any, will come to fruition.

As it happens, Navigator Holdings, a separate shipping business in which Ross owns a major stake, specializes in transoceanic shipment of natural gas. Rockas insisted in December that Ross had also divested his interest in Navigator, but public government filings show only one sale of up to $50,000 in Navigator stock.

As of Dec. 31, 2016, a Ross-controlled private equity group owned 39.4 percent of Navigator. He was the company’s chairman, although Navigator said in 2017 that he would not participate in company decisions as a member of the Trump Cabinet.

After this story was first published Thursday, Rockas told HuffPost, “The Secretary’s interest in these companies was divested through a transfer to an irrevocable trust, and because such transfers are not considered transactions under federal regulations, they are not reported through the public financial disclosure report system.”

The Commerce Department would not initially identify the beneficiary of this trust other than to say it was not Ross himself. The Department declined to explain why Ross has never disclosed or detailed the arrangement. The Office of Government Ethics requires public officials to disclose irrevocable trusts that benefit an official’s spouse or dependent child on an official’s initial public disclosure form. Several hours after this story was updated, the Department told HuffPost that Ross had not designated his wife as the beneficiary, but would not answer further questions. Ross has two children.

Irrevocable trusts are used in estate planning by wealthy people to shield assets from personal creditors by passing them on to their heirs. A deeply indebted rich man who owns a lot of stock can put the stock in an irrevocable trust for his children, preventing the rich man’s creditors from seizing the stock as payment for his debts.

The discrepancy between the Commerce Department’s public statements about Ross and the official financial history of the commerce secretary was the most troubling item in a new report from the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen that details connections between Trump administration officials and Chinese businesses, including failed talks between presidential adviser Jared Kushner and a Chinese government-linked investment group involving his disastrous real estate investment at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York.

Trump has talked tough on trade policy throughout his administration. Earlier this month, he alarmed free trade enthusiasts by declaring new tariffs on steel and aluminum. But the ultimate impact of those tariffs is likely to be small, and other Trump efforts to reduce the trade deficit have had almost no effect. The U.S. trade deficit has, in fact, steadily increased during his time in office, including the deficit with China.Artfully79 via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ―The federal government would finally be authorized to study gun violence under a provision included in a two-year $1.3 trillion spending package released by congressional leaders Wednesday night.

Collecting data about gun violence is difficult in the United States because of a 1996 law that restricts federal funding to research the issue. The so-called Dickey Amendment, named after former Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.), effectively ended such research by barring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from studying gun violence as a public health issue.

Democrats and gun control advocates renewed a push to lift the prohibition after last month’s shooting in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman opened fire at a high school, killing 17 people and wounding dozens of others.

But gun rights advocates like the National Rifle Association have for years opposed the treatment of firearms as a public health issue ― warning it would lead to the erosion of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

The budget deal unveiled by lawmakers on Wednesday does not repeal the Dickey Amendment outright. Instead, the bill clarifies the amendment’s language so that it would no longer prohibit the research into gun violence.

In exchange, Democrats assented to several other modest proposals authored by Republicans that would boost the FBI’s beleaguered background-check system and increase funds to schools in order to improve campus safety. Democrats previously argued the budget deal ought to include broader gun control measures like universal background checks.When will Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg agree to answer questions before Congress?

If it were up to Zuckerberg, the answer may be never.

Unfortunately for him, it isn’t entirely his decision: The House Energy and Commerce Committee just invited him to testify about a political research firm’s secret use of at least 50 million Facebook users’ personal information, and he may well be forced to accept it because optics compel him to do so.

Yet as Zuckerberg’s language in recent interviews made clear, he’ll need plenty of convincing.

Faced with the dual crisis of a precipitous falloff in public trust and sinking stock prices, Facebook provided Zuckerberg for a series of interviews Wednesday. Among other things, he was asked repeatedly if he’d voluntarily testify in front of Congress.

And his answer, repeatedly, was designed to sound like “yes” when he really seems to be saying “no.”

“If it is ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that,” Zuckerberg told Wired.

This isn’t a “yes.” At best, it’s a highly qualified “maybe, but...” ― the semantic equivalent of a massive loophole.

Zuckerberg’s willingness to answer questions before Congress if he’s “the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify” gives him cover to never testify. There will always be some employee Facebook can trot out and present as more informed on a particular topic and therefore better positioned to answer politicians’ pointed questions.

He proceeded to tell Wired that if lawmakers actually care about substance (presumably over the spectacle of him personally being held accountable), he doesn’t foresee a need for him to testify at all.

“So as long as it’s a substantive testimony where what folks are trying to get is as much content as possible, I’m not sure when I’ll be the right person,” Zuckerberg said [emphasis added]. “But I would be happy to if I were.”

The founder of Facebook just said he isn’t sure he’ll ever be able to add anything of substance to a conversation about Facebook and its role in the world.Actress and advocate Cynthia Nixon took a moment during a campaign event Wednesday to respond to former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who called the Democratic gubernatorial hopeful “an unqualified lesbian” the day before.

Nixon’s announcement Monday that she will challenge New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in September’s primary was met with skepticism from Quinn, a prominent member of the city’s LGBTQ community. Quinn ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York in 2013, losing in the Democratic primary to Mayor Bill de Blasio, whom Nixon publicly endorsed. In an interview Tuesday, Quinn attacked Nixon’s lack of qualifications and experience, calling the candidate “an unqualified lesbian.”

Nixon, who identifies as bisexual, responded to the attack but laughed it off. “Yesterday, when I announced my candidacy, one of Gov. Cuomo’s top surrogates dismissed me as an ‘unqualified lesbian,’” Nixon said during an event at the historic Stonewall Inn.

“And I just want to say tonight that she was technically right,” Nixon continued. “I don’t have my certificate from the Department of Lesbian Affairs. But in my defense, there is a lot of paperwork involved.”

Quinn was quick to clarify her remarks on Tuesday after they went viral, arguing that she never meant to attack Nixon’s identity and was merely trying to make a comparison between herself and the gubernatorial candidate.And the devil said, “Thanks a bunch Goldilocks. Enjoy the show in Santa Fe tomorrow. Someday, real soon, I’ll have you for dinner.” pic.twitter.com/h1G6smzK5t — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) May 19, 2018

Actor Jim Carrey’s latest political artwork blasts a Kent State University student who posed with her AR-10 rifle on campus for her graduation photos.

In the photos, Kaitlin Bennett’s graduation cap was also decorated with an image of her gun and the words “come and take it.” She posted the shots on Twitter and they quickly went viral. The university prohibits guns for students, staff and faculty, according to school policy, but state law allows visitors to openly carry guns outdoors on campus, The Washington Post reported.

The Kent State campus became infamous in 1970 when Ohio National Guardsmen shot to death four unarmed students protesting the Vietnam war. Nine other students were injured when the guardsmen opened fire.

Carrey’s painting shows his version of Bennett, with a gun strapped on her back, in front of a large, macabre face of the devil. “Thanks a bunch, Goldilocks,” the devil says in Carrey’s tweeted caption of the painting. “Enjoy the show in Santa Fe,” the devil adds, apparently referring to Friday’s shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, where 10 people were killed. “Someday, real soon, I’ll have you for dinner.”

Bennett called Carrey’s painting “disgusting.” She said he should be in the painting with the devil because “you’re the one that supports gun control policies that let these kids die.”

Jim you should be the one in this picture with this caption. You're the one that supports gun control policies that let these kids die. Is this what you have to do because you've become irrelevant? Disgusting. #GunControlKills https://t.co/vl1miG3YmF — Kaitlin Marie (@KaitMarieox) May 19, 2018

Bennett’s photos were hugely controversial, particularly because of the deadly violence at Kent State and the recent school gun fatalities. Since the photos went viral, Bennett has complained that she has been the target of “blatant racism” and death threats.

One of the survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that killed 17 people in February reminded her in a tweet that the Second Amendment is no guarantee that she’ll never be a victim.Mr. Boombastic is slated to perform for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

To celebrate the queen’s 92nd birthday on April 21, a concert to end all concerts will be held at Royal Albert Hall in London. The party will be produced by the BBC ― because who among us wouldn’t want their party produced by a major media outlet ― and will air on live television in the U.K.

The list of performers includes Sir Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue, Craig David, Anne Marie, Shawn Mendes, Sting, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Shaggy. A motley crew to say the least.

For one, we have this to say:

Additionally, we’re going to need the BBC to have cameras on the queen during Shaggy’s entire performance. We’re not sure if he’ll be singing “It Wasn’t Me” just yet, but let’s be real: That would be a gift for the world, more so than it would be for the queen.WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although his action was far removed from threats that could have ignited a global trade war.

Under the terms of the memorandum, Trump will target the Chinese imports only after a consultation period, a measure that will give industry lobbyists and legislators a chance to water down a proposed target list which runs to 1,300 products.

China will also have space to respond to Trump’s actions, reducing the risk of immediate dramatic retaliation from Beijing, and Trump struck an emollient tone as he started speaking, saying “I view them as a friend.”

“We have spoken to China and we are in the middle of negotiations,” Trump said, adding that loss of American jobs from unfair trade was one of the main reasons he had been elected in 2016.

The United States runs a $375 billion goods trade deficit with China.

Washington will also pursue alleged breaches of intellectual property law by China through the World Trade Organization, a body that has repeatedly drawn the ire of the administration but which could provide a resolution that avoids a trade war.

Global stocks had sold off on Thursday on the expectation of tough action from Trump, with U.S. markets down as much as 2 percent, but recovered somewhat after the announcement.

Following Trump’s announcement on Thursday, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office will present a list of products that could be targeted, primarily from the high-tech sector. There will then be a 60-day consultation period before definitive action will be put into force.

CHINESE INVESTMENTS

White House officials told a briefing ahead of the trade announcement that the administration was eyeing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. They said the figure was based on a calculation of the impact on the profits of U.S. companies that had been forced to hand over their intellectual property as the price of doing business in China.

There was no explanation of the difference between the numbers provided by White House officials in the briefing and Trump’s $60 billion.

“Many of these areas are those where China has sought to acquire advantage through the unfair acquisition and forced technology transfer from U.S. companies ... establishing its own competitive advantage in an unfair manner,” Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.

In addition, Trump will also direct the U.S. Treasury to propose measures that could restrict Chinese investments in the United States, Eissenstat said.

The tariffs and investment restrictions will be imposed under the U.S. Trade Representative’s “Section 301” investigation into alleged misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property by China.

Eissenstat said the investigation clearly demonstrates unfair practices by China, which forces U.S. investors to turn over key technologies to Chinese firms.Late night host Jimmy Kimmel mocked President Donald Trump on Wednesday night over his struggles with spelling.

“The president’s nubby little fingers must’ve been going so fast, he made some mistakes,” Kimmel said, referring to a typo-ridden tweet in which Trump ranted against the special “council” Robert Mueller and “wether” crimes exist.

The tweet was later deleted. Yet when a corrected one was posted, the word “whether” had been fixed, but the word “council” was still in the tweet multiple times.

“If you’re wondering whether our president is crazy or just dumb ― people are saying I don’t know if it’s crazy or just dumb ― dumb just won another round, OK?” Kimmel said on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” “I guess he wants to show his base that he won’t be swayed by a bunch of left-wing liberal dictionaries.”Progressives celebrated a string of wins in Illinois’ Democratic primaries on Tuesday, claiming a significant blow against Chicago’s so-called Democratic Party “machine.”

The victories, mostly in down-ballot races for state and local offices, were overshadowed by higher-profile congressional and gubernatorial contests, but the region’s left-leaning activists believe they lay the groundwork for bigger pickups over the long term.

Key wins include Fritz Kaegi’s defeat of Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios, who also serves as chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party; Aaron Ortiz’s defeat of state Rep. Dan Burke (D); Ram Villivilam’s defeat of state Sen. Ira Silverstein (D); and Brandon Johnson’s narrow defeat of Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin.

In addition, Alma Anaya was elected to fill the Cook County Board of Commissioners seat vacated by Jesús “Chuy” García, who won his congressional race. Delia Ramirez picked up an open Illinois House seat and Beatriz Frausto-Sandoval won her race for 14th Subcircuit judge.

“The Chicago machine today is licking its wounds,” said Clem Balanoff, a longtime progressive strategist and former state lawmaker who’s now executive director of Our Revolution Illinois, a local chapter of the legacy group of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “They could be the fatal wounds.”

“There’s no doubt that change is in the air,” he added.

On the surface, the issues that dominated these down-ballot races were often far removed from the national discussion. But upon closer examination, they track closely with the intra-Democratic debates taking place across the country, where progressive newcomers are challenging incumbents to do more to curb growing economic and racial inequality.

In the case of the Cook County assessor’s race, there was also the factor of seemingly brazen corruption in Chicago. Berrios, who has spoken unapologetically about securing government jobs for family members, was under fire after an investigation revealed that he had systematically been over-assessing the property taxes of less valuable homes and under-assessing the homes of wealthier individuals. Between October and February, Berrios received $276,000 in campaign contributions from property tax appeals attorneys who represent wealthy clients in cases Berrios oversees.

Balanoff was initially skeptical of getting behind a “financial guy” like Kaegi, a former mutual fund manager, but concluded that there was a “real genuineness” in his commitment to a more transparent and less regressive property tax assessment system.

With the help of Our Revolution Illinois and other grassroots groups, Kaegi prevailed Tuesday by promising a fairer system for the city’s middle-class homeowners. He defeated the two-term incumbent and Cook County party chairman by 15 percentage points.

Victories like Kaegi’s did not come about in a vaccum. Chicago’s progressive movement has been growing steadily in recent years, beginning with a successful strike launched by the left-leaning Chicago Teachers Union in 2012.

The strike humiliated Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), whose business-friendly policies had already put him on a collision course with grassroots activists. He has presided over massive public school and mental health clinic closings, as well as upscale urban development that has pushed out some members of the city’s longtime black and Latino communities.

Efforts to check Emanuel and the coalition of politicians with whom he makes common cause have gradually matured since then.

“There is no progressive movement anywhere in this country if it not does not underscore black, left progressive men and women winning elected office.” - Stacy Davis Gates, Chicago Teachers Union

Chuy García came up short in his attempt to unseat Emanuel in 2015. But with the backing of the teachers union and other progressive groups, he shocked the Chicago Democratic machine by forcing an unprecedented runoff.

“What you’ve seen since then is a steady stream of movement in the electoral realm that this city hasn’t seen before,” Stacy Davis Gates, the political director of the Chicago Teachers Union, said of the 2015 race.

Sanders’ 2016 presidential run gave the region’s progressives another jolt of energy. In Hillary Clinton’s home state of Illinois, she defeated Sanders by just 1.8 percentage points thanks in part to the enthusiasm Sanders inspired in Chicago’s young people and restive activists.

By the time the 2018 primaries rolled around, there were several significant loci of progressive power in Chicago with the resources to recruit and elect a new crop of candidates. García’s mayoral run made him a household name throughout the city and expanded his political organization in the predominantly Latino parts of western Chicago; Our Revolution Illinois was flush with energized activists; and the Chicago Teachers Union was spoiling for another fight.

United Working Families, a local branch of the labor-backed Working Families Party, had also made key inroads into the city’s black and Latino communities.

Together, these groups provided the financing and field organizing operations that younger or lesser-known candidates needed to challenge entrenched incumbents and compete in contentious open seats.

García, who was virtually assured of victory in Illinois’ 4th Congressional District from the moment he stepped into the race, leveraged his political operation to ensure the election of younger progressive Latinos. The clearest beneficiaries from his reach in west and southwest Chicago were Alma Anaya, one of his former aides; Aaron Ortiz, a 26-year-old college counselor and member of the Chicago Teachers Union; labor activist Delia Ramirez; and immigration lawyer Beatriz Frausto-Sandoval.

Ortiz’s win was especially notable because he unseated Dan Burke, 66, who had represented the state House district since before Ortiz was born. Ortiz criticized Burke for the ties of his brother, Chicago Alderman Ed Burke, to President Donald Trump. Ed Burke’s law firm has saved Trump millions of dollars in taxes on Chicago’s Trump Tower.

Brandon Johnson’s Cook County Board Of Commissioners win, by a few hundred votes, also carried special significance.

Johnson, a Chicago Teachers Union member and organizer on the West Side, is now one of the Chicago area’s most progressive black elected officials. One reason García lost in 2015 was because of his inability to peel black voters away from Emanuel.

Ensuring that Chicago’s progressive leadership adequately represents the city’s formidable black population is essential to electing a progressive mayor and other powerful leaders, according to Davis Gates. It also provides a road map for national progressives like Sanders, whose struggle to gain traction among African-American voters likely cost him the Democratic nomination, Davis Gates said.

“There is no progressive movement anywhere in this country if it not does not underscore black, left progressive men and women winning elected office,” Davis Gates said. “It just doesn’t happen.”

“Bernie Sanders alone is not gonna be enough to compel black people to turn out and vote,” she added.

At the same time, the teachers union’s decision to go all in for Johnson reflected its disdain for Richard Boykin, an African-American corporate lobbyist and former chief of staff to Rep. Danny Davis (D). Boykin opposed Johnson’s ideas to raise progressive revenue for the county that would enable it to save public jobs. He also responded to the city’s epidemic of gang violence by calling for alleged shooters to be tried as “domestic terrorists” and inviting United Nations peacekeepers to occupy his district.National security adviser H.R. McMaster is leaving President Donald Trump’s administration, the president announced Thursday. McMaster will be replaced by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.

I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018

McMaster and Trump “mutually agreed” that it was time for the adviser to leave his post after discussing the idea “for some time,” according to the White House.

“The timeline was expedited as they both felt it was important to have the new team in place, instead of constant speculation,” a White House official said in a statement. “This was not related to any one moment or incident, rather it was the result of ongoing conversations between the two.”

McMaster will also retire from the U.S. Army, in which he has served for 34 years, he said in a statement.

McMaster is the latest of several senior officials to leave the White House, following the departure of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump announced earlier this month that he intends for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be Tillerson’s replacement, starting in April.

At least a dozen aides to the president have now left their posts in a little over a year.

NBC News was first to report that the White House was preparing for McMaster’s exit, a move reportedly orchestrated by chief of staff John Kelly and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. In response, the Trump administration dismissed NBC’s March 1 report as “fake news” and stressed that McMaster was doing “a great job.”

NBC reported in early March that Stephen Biegun, a Ford executive who once worked under former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, was rumored to take over as national security adviser.

However, in recent weeks, another possible replacement came to light: Bolton, who served as a highly controversial ambassador to the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration. Tillerson was rumored to have expressed concerns over working with Bolton, whose tactics New York magazine once labeled “very undiplomatic.”

McMaster’s tenure in the Trump administration was marked by conflict as he repeatedly found himself at odds with the president. After special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians in February, McMaster said there was “incontrovertible” evidence that Russia had moved to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump himself has long pushed back against allegations of Russian interference in the election, but recently attempted to blame former President Barack Obama for not doing enough to counter Russian meddling.

General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems.

Despite the Mueller indictments, the departing head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said at the end of February that he had not received any orders from the White House to counter future subterfuge. Rogers is reportedly set to retire this spring.President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will appoint John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as his new national security adviser.

Trump said Bolton’s appointment will be effective on April 9.

I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018

In an interview with Fox News shortly after Trump tweeted, Bolton said his appointment wasn’t finalized until Thursday afternoon. “I didn’t expect an announcement this afternoon, but it’s obviously a great honor.”

Bolton replaces Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who replaced Michael Flynn in February 2017 following revelations about conversations Flynn had had with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Bolton, once rumored to be Trump’s pick for secretary of state or top choice to run day-to-day operations at the State Department, is considered one of the world’s most disliked foreign policy operators. During his less than two years serving as the U.N. ambassador under former President George W. Bush, there was a severe uptick in anti-American sentiment among diplomats.

Bolton also served in the State Department under presidents George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.

The new national security adviser may push for aggressive stances toward Russia, the self-described Islamic State group and North Korea, experts familiar with his track record say. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published last month, Bolton argued there is a legal case for a U.S. strike against Pyongyang.

He has stood by the 2003 decision to invade Iraq, even as bipartisan consensus has moved toward agreeing that the invasion was a mistake. While acting as undersecretary of state for arms control for George W. Bush, Bolton was emphatic that there was proof Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. He reportedly created a dynamic in the department that led to intelligence officials being afraid of defying his unverified claims.

He has also been a member of several conservative think tanks, contributed to Fox News as a talking head and wrote the foreword for a 2010 book by two well-known anti-Islam figures.Chrissy Teigen (not Chrissy Legend) and John Legend at a pre-Grammy gala on Jan. 27. Mike Coppola via Getty Images

Christine Diane Tiegen, better known to most of us as Chrissy Teigen, is a model, cookbook author, TV host and one of the funniest people on Twitter.

She’s been married to John Legend, whose real name is actually John Roger Stephens, since 2013. After their wedding in Italy, Teigen ― for one reason or another ― kept her last name and didn’t become Chrissy Legend.

Recently, a Twitter user posted a question asking why women didn’t take their husband’s last names after marriage. Teigen hilariously responded and broke it down in just eight words.

“My husband didn’t even take his last name?” the 32-year-old said, referring to the fact that even John goes by a stage name (which was originally his nickname at the University of Pennsylvania).

Twitter

That settles that.

Teigen and Legend have a daughter together, named Luna, and she has John’s real last name: Luna Simone Stephens. The two are expecting another child together, a baby boy, who will presumably also have the last name Stephens.

Though they’ve got the last name picked out, the two were still deciding on a name for their new addition just a few months ago.

“We love going the music route [for names],” Teigen told People in January, before she publicly confirmed she was having a boy. “John loves looking at who he grew up with or people he grew up listening to. And maybe we’ll have a little baby Todd Smith, I don’t know. Maybe we’ll have a little Simone.”FBI agents collect evidence at a FedEx facility following an explosion at a nearby sorting center on Tuesday in Sunset Valley, Texas.

WICHITA, Kan. ― Whenever a white non-Muslim man commits an act of mass violence ― not an infrequent occurrence in recent history ― the online debate begins. Why aren’t authorities calling this terrorism?

The debate broke out once again Wednesday morning after the news broke that the bomber behind a string of deadly attacks in Austin, Texas, was a 23-year-old white Christian male.

Media coverage often grants white non-Muslim perpetrators a level of humanity not typically seen in coverage of other attackers, and “terrorism” can often be used simply as a stand-in for “Muslim.” But it’s more than just politics and privilege that makes authorities ― and in turn, the media ― shy about calling terrorism by its name.

The United States has no federal law criminalizing acts of domestic terrorism. That’s something the FBI Agents Association, an organization that represents more than 14,000 current and former FBI special agents, would like to see changed.

“Calling it what it is is something that I believe is important,” Thomas O’Connor, a current FBI agent who has worked on domestic terrorism investigations, said in an interview earlier this year. O’Connor, speaking to HuffPost in his capacity as head of the FBI Agents Association, said that the lack of a federal charge has broad implications for how the American public thinks about the threat of domestic terrorism.



“It’s easy for people to wrap their heads around someone coming in with an internationally based ideology and committing a crime,” O’Connor said. “But when it’s a domestic terrorist, because there’s no charge, we can’t get our head wrapped around it.”

While the U.S. code defines domestic terrorism, there’s no broad criminal statute that outlaws such acts. As HuffPost previously explained, the lack of a criminal domestic terrorism statute makes the federal government extremely cautious about using the term “terrorism” when there’s no link to a group the United States has officially designated as an international terrorist organization. In practical terms, that means the government doesn’t call white, non-Muslim terrorists what they are.

That’s not really an excuse in the case of Mark Conditt, the young man behind the Austin attacks. Because Conditt is dead, there’s no future trial to be concerned about.

Conditt’s precise motive is not entirely clear. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley received a lot of backlash Wednesday evening for describing a 25-minute tape Conditt recorded as an “outcry by a very challenged young man” and noting that it “does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate.” Nevertheless, the federal government would have been able to charge Conditt with a terrorism-related crime had he lived: His package bombs would count as weapons of mass destruction.

O’Connor says that doesn’t make much sense and that the federal government needs to be able to charge domestic terrorists with domestic terrorism regardless of their weapon of choice.

“The weapon itself shouldn’t be the determining factor on when someone is committing an act of domestic terror,” O’Connor said. “Call it what it is. If you have an incident that takes place, and the person uses a firearm, a car, a knife ― if that crime of force or violence is done to forward a social or political agenda, then that person fits the elements of domestic terrorism.”

O’Connor points to the Family Research Council shooting in Washington, D.C., in 2012, when a man shot a security guard because of the organization’s opposition to gay marriage. It was clearly an act of terrorism. But because the terrorist used a gun, there was no federal terrorism-related federal statute under which he could’ve been charged. The only reason he faced a terrorism charge was that the District of Columbia has its own terrorism statute, which federal prosecutors were able to use because they handle criminal cases in the nation’s capital.



This week here in Wichita, three white men from rural Kansas are facing trial, accused of plotting to bomb an apartment complex occupied by Muslim refugees they considered “cockroaches.” If the defendants did what the government says they did, they’re domestic terrorists. But the only reason they’re facing terrorism-related charges is because their alleged plot involved bombs. Had they decided to go door to door shooting Muslims living in an apartment complex in Garden City, as they are accused of discussing on audiotapes, there would be no basis for a terrorism-related charge and they’d likely be facing only civil rights charges.

As HuffPost first reported last summer, there has been an internal debate at the Justice Department about whether the executive branch should lobby Congress to create an actual criminal statute that would outlaw acts of domestic terrorism. Thomas Brzozowski, the Justice Department’s top authority on domestic terrorism, said in January that the Justice Department was “continuing to look at that very closely” and getting input from multiple agencies. O’Connor’s group has been lobbying for such a plan, but the effort hasn’t gained much traction on Capitol Hill.

It’s not only a question of fairness, says O’Connor. It’s also about measuring the extent of the problem of domestic terrorism in the United States. Since there’s no central domestic terrorism charge, the federal government doesn’t keep track of cases that qualify as domestic terrorism.

“If you look up domestic terrorism in general and try to figure out the numbers of domestic terrorism incidents that have taken place in the United States over the past 20 years, you’re never going to come up with an accurate number because people haven’t been charged with domestic terrorism,” O’Connor said.

“It comes down to transparency,” O’Connor said. “When there is an incident and it’s not called that, then it gets lost.”

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) on Thursday slammed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson for failing to take full responsibility for a series of recent embarrassments at the agency, including the decision to spend $31,000 of taxpayer funds on a dining room set for his office.

Carson said at a congressional hearing earlier this week that his wife had been in charge of the redecorating effort, and he was “as surprised as anyone” to find out the furniture came with such a high price tag.

“Instead of taking responsibility, Mr. Secretary, you seem to want to blame others,” Brown said in his opening remarks during a Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs hearing.

“Blaming others seems to be the order of the day in the swamp,” Brown later continued. “Under your leadership, Secretary Carson, HUD has decided a wobbly chair in a private D.C. dining room requires the urgent attention of no fewer than 16 staffers and thousands of taxpayer dollars.”

Carson had previously called the old furniture “dangerous.”

A request to refund the purchase was submitted only after news outlets reported on the extravagant purchase, which a spokesman for Carson initially said would not be returned. Federal guidelines put a $5,000 cap on office decor.

Carson’s subsequent effort to replace the old furniture came out to $3,500.

The housing secretary defended himself at the hearing by pointing to his decision to direct Irving Dennis, HUD’s chief financial officer, to “lead an internal task force within HUD to combat waste, fraud and abuse.”

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) also criticized Carson for failing to take full responsibility, confronting him with emails reported by CNN that appear to contradict a spokesman’s previous assertion that Carson and his wife were not involved in the $31,000 purchase. Carson later stated he does “not intend to be responsible for what anybody else said.”

Menendez called it “an extraordinary statement because everyone is responsible for what our spokespeople say.”

“If he was wrong, he or you should have had the record set straight,” the senator added.

Following questioning by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Carson eventually admitted he was responsible for the chair incident.

“Even though I wasn’t aware of the $5,000 requirement I still take responsibility,” Carson said.

The housing secretary also faced heated questions during the hearing over a proposed budget that would increase HUD-subsidized rent for low-income households.This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.

By Nate Terani

Understand this: I’m an American veteran. I’m also a Muslim-American in a country in which, in these years, that hasn’t exactly been the happiest category to fall into. Now, let me tell you a little story.

Recently, I had an ominous dream. It was noon on a grey, cold January 20th, 2020, and Donald Trump was being sworn in for his second term as president. Massive inaugural crowds cheered him exuberantly as a gentle snow fell upon a sea of MAGA red-hats and TRUMP banners waving in front of the Capitol.

In my dream, however, the Capitol wasn’t quite the same as I remembered it from my days stationed there as a young Navy sailor. It seemed almost war-torn as clouds of dark smoke billowed up on the horizon and the sound of gunfire could be heard somewhere in the distance. In my dream ― don’t ask me how ― I could also hear the terror-filled voices of people screaming or crying out for help as ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents, clad in black uniforms, stormed local Washington homes and businesses, arresting people and loading them onto large unmarked cargo trucks.

Meanwhile, those inaugural crowds ― I have no idea if they were the largest in the history of dreams ― were flanked by military Humvees as heavily armed soldiers in unfamiliar camouflage uniforms stood behind the president while he delivered his second inaugural address. I could even hear his words eerily reverberating through the Capitol. “The enemy,” he exclaimed, “has infiltrated our great nation because of weak immigration laws allowed by treasonous politicians!”

At that very moment, he told the exuberant crowd, he was already singlehandedly purging “those terrorists and their enablers from our ranks.” The MAGA banners waved ever more frantically and the crowd roared as he declared, “Law and order are now being restored to our great nation once again!”

I awoke in a cold sweat. Unlike the sort of nightmare I’d normally shake off as a fantasy of slumber, the result perhaps of that late night dose of Ben and Jerry’s I had meant to resist, this one stuck with me and, I’m sorry to say, recurred.

“I’m an American veteran. I’m also a Muslim-American in a country in which, in these years, that hasn’t exactly been the happiest category to fall into.”

American Fear-scapes

Worse yet, these days I no longer have to drop into some deep, unnerving dream state to experience it. Though few of us are likely to admit it, some version of that dream of mine is, in fact, the secret daily nightmare of millions of my fellow Muslim-Americans. In a moment, when immigrants in this country live in a fear-scape all their own, believe me, so do we. In our living nightmare, an administration that can seem not just ineffective but hapless beyond imagining, plagued by scandal, and stocked with staff members heading for the exits (or being escorted off White House grounds) might nonetheless transform itself into something even more deeply threatening to Americans like us. It might sooner or later consolidate power and, eager to distract the public from its actual plutocratic and other grim policies, turn on us “bigly.” Without dropping into another dream state, I can easily enough imagine how, with the tacit endorsement of Trump’s base, that administration might prepare itself to use a future devastating terror attack, the next Orlando or San Bernardino, to skewer American Muslims or the immigrant community and so pave the way for a true living nightmare.

Such a crisis could take many forms, but imagine, for instance, a “dirty bomb” attack (the use of conventional explosives to spread radioactive nuclear waste materials across a wide area of some urban neighborhood). Just such an attack has certainly been a focus of concern in the U.S. intelligence community for years now. In fact, in 1999, while on active duty as a new member of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the first interagency briefing I attended at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, focused on that very issue.

Should that happen or anything like it, it’s easy enough to imagine how the Trump administration might use it to enhance its own power at our expense. With the public cowering in fear, martial law might be declared. Meanwhile, a Congress that, in the face of the imperial presidency, has already abdicated its constitutional duty to declare war, might grant Donald Trump far greater authority than he already possesses, thanks to the unprecedented post-9/11 powers any president now wields ― and the American people (or enough of them, at least) would “rally ’round the chief.”

And then, or so I imagine (and, at least among American Muslims I know, I’m not alone in this), so much worse would begin to unfold and my recurring nightmare would become a nightmarish reality. In the aftermath of such an attack, so much in our world, from the Women’s March to Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, would become distant and forgotten memories. Dissent would be denounced as unpatriotic, perhaps ultimately illegal, and basic human rights might be suspended.

By now, I’m sure you see where I’m going. In my nightmare at least ― and I’m talking about the waking one now, the one I live with every day ― countless immigrants and American Muslims are in camps awaiting who knows what. It’s not as if there is no precedent for anything like that in America, given the experience of Japanese-Americans rounded up and kept in just such camps during World War II.

In this moment of growing Islamophobia, at a time when a president has a desire to simply ban foreign Muslims and cast American ones as the worst of the worst, it’s just one more step into my fears of the future for me to imagine myself, an American veteran, as well as my family and other members of the Muslim community, sitting inside darkened train cars on our way to internment camps, while we desperately try to convince ourselves that surely the Supreme Court will overturn such an injustice.

And given our world, given the history of racism in this country, it’s not that hard to imagine scores of broken men, women and children already at our destination as we hurtle down the tracks to join them. Nor is it that hard to imagine the Trump administration dismissing those who protest such treatment as disloyal co-conspirators, and then using militarized police raiders to hunt some of them down, too. I can even imagine mosques being set ablaze and synagogues and churches that attempted to protect citizens fleeing all of this being raided at the government’s orders.

Heading for a Dark Destination

In some dark corner of my mind, given what we know about what we human beings are capable of, I can almost imagine some kind of Muslim-American version of the Holocaust, the ultimate nightmare that immigrants and Muslim-Americans have dreaded since Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2016, but dare not whisper. There’s nothing sadder to say than that such fears do not completely lack historical precedent: the world has, of course, been here before.

If the fate of the millions who perished during World War II, thanks to Adolf Hitler and his minions, doesn’t seem real enough to you, just pay a visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. There, you can witness the haunting images of our human brethren who, by virtue of their faith or background, were destroyed, some by their own countrymen.

Now, I know perfectly well that those of you who aren’t Muslim-Americans are likely to find such fantasies at best extreme; at worst, beyond conception. The reason isn’t hard to imagine, because of course Donald Trump isn’t Adolf Hitler; White House adviser Stephen Miller isn’t Joseph Goebbels; White House Chief of Staff John Kelly isn’t Hermann Göring; and former CIA Director and next Secretary of State Mike Pompeo isn’t Heinrich Himmler. Yes ― but Pompeo, a major Islamophobe in an administration filled with them, has insisted that all Muslims are potentially complicit in terrorism and that “people who deeply believe that Islam is the way” are a “threat to America.” He has also received the “National Security Eagle Award” from a noted anti-Muslim hate group, ACT for America, and has been interviewed more than 20 times by Frank Gaffney, “the country’s most influential Islamophobe,” on his radio show. And when it comes to Islamophobia (and Iranophobia as well), in this administration Pompeo is hardly alone.

Still, not even bans, insults, and a visible loathing for those of us who don’t look like and pray like the president and his men, not even torchlight parades by Trump-supporting American neo-Nazis, get you easily to anything like an American Holocaust. But know, when you read this, that there are those of us out here who, in the dark of night, are indeed haunted by such thoughts anyway and by thoughts as well of those in the 1930s who dismissed the fears of the worst to come as so much hyperbole.

Speaking just for myself, I can’t help but believe that, in our 241-year history that includes a bitter civil war, two world wars, and the Great Depression, this could turn out to be the most crucial moment of all. I can’t help but wonder, at least in my bleaker moments, whether there will be any coming back from the dark destination, whatever it turns out to be, that we, as a nation, now seem headed for. And if not, just remember that no one will be able to say that we didn’t know what we were doing, that there were no warnings as people like me were demonized in our own country.

Whatever hell might still come, for this veteran at least, Donald Trump’s America is already hell enough.

Follow him on Twitter at @NateTerani.Just two days after a young man opened fire on his classmates and teachers at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, the National Rifle Association’s incoming president, Oliver North, blamed Ritalin and a “culture of violence.”

On “Fox News Sunday,” the controversial Iran-Contra figure told host Chris Wallace that the solution for the increasing number of school shootings ― there have been 22 so far in 2018, by one count ― is not gun control.

“We’re trying like the dickens to treat the symptoms without treating the disease,” he said.

“And the disease in this case isn’t the Second Amendment. The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” he said. “They’ve been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male. ... Many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.”

North’s comments on Sunday echoed those made by President Donald Trump after the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012. Following the shooting, Trump tweeted about violent video games and the “glorification” of violence.

Video game violence & glorification must be stopped—it is creating monsters! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 17, 2012

North, a retired Marine whose role in the Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s made him a household name, appeared in ads for the war-centered video game “Call of Duty: Black Ops II” and has also worked as a consultant for the game.

Other prominent Republicans have blamed violent culture, and not lax gun laws, in the wake of recent shootings, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

A Wisconsin judge on Thursday ordered Gov. Scott Walker (R) to call the special elections for two legislative seats that he has refused to call since December, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Democrats sued Walker over his refusal to schedule quick elections and said he wouldn’t do so because he was afraid of losing the contests to Democrats.

Dane County Circuit Court Judge Josann Reynolds, a Walker appointee, ordered the governor to call the elections within a week. An appeal of that order is expected.

Amy Hasenberg, a Walker spokeswoman, told HuffPost that the governor was consulting with the state’s attorneys to “determine the next steps in this case.”

The dispute involves two seats ― one in the Wisconsin State Assembly and one in the Wisconsin Senate ― that became vacant in December 2017 when the Republican incumbents resigned to take jobs in Walker’s administration. Walker said he wouldn’t hold a special election for the open seats, but would instead allow them to be filled by the regularly scheduled elections in November 2018. The winners of those elections wouldn’t be seated until January 2019.

Walker insisted that he had no legal obligation to call the special election sooner and that he was saving the state money by not doing so. But Democrats argued that his decision was motivated by the fact that Republicans lost a special election this January in a Wisconsin district that President Donald Trump had carried by more than 20 points in 2016. Walker labeled that election a “wake-up call.”

Wisconsin law says that a special election must be held as promptly as possible for any vacancy in the state legislature that occurs before the second Tuesday in May in a regularly scheduled election year. Walker’s team contended that he was not obligated to call a special election because the vacancies occurred in 2017, not the regularly scheduled election year of 2018, according to the Journal Sentinel.

In a bench ruling Thursday, Reynolds accused state Attorney General Brad Schimel’s office of reading the law in an absurd way and not following “basic rules of grammar.” She also accused his office of being hypocritical in advocating generally for a strict reading of laws while interpreting the relevant statute in this case in a way that undermined “the most basic constitutional guarantee.”

Judge Reynolds: "I cannot reconcile the incongruity between Gov. Walker's administration's very vocal and consistent policy advocating for strict constructionism and the position taken by the attorney general in this case involving the most basic constitutional guarantee." — Shawn Johnson (@SJohnsonWPR) March 22, 2018

The judge alluded to the fact that Walker’s decision had left 175,000 people without a voice in the state legislature. While Reynolds’ order came as that legislature ended its regular session, she noted that it was likely to be called back for a special session, in which voters in the two districts deserved to have their full voice.

She says not holding elections deprives voters of their rights.

The lawsuit challenging the governor’s lack of action was brought by the National Redistricting Foundation, an affiliate of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that is focused on state races this year.

“This is an important victory for the impacted citizens of Wisconsin who have gone without representation because of Governor Walker’s refusal to call special elections,” Holder said in a statement after the judge made her order. “One of our most basic rights as American citizens is that we get to vote and have representation in our legislatures. Governor Walker’s actions have undermined that right and it never should have taken legal action to force him to do his job.”WASHINGTON — A Trump administration political appointee previously worked at Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that assisted Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and is now being investigated for collecting private information from Facebook.

Kelly Rzendzian, a special assistant to the secretary at the Department of Commerce, worked at SCL Group in Alexandria, Virginia, from March 2016 through February 2017, according to her public financial disclosure report. SCL Group is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, a firm that harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of millions accounts without their permission as part of its voter targeting efforts.

On her LinkedIn page, Rzendzian describes herself as a senior adviser at SCL Group. Her resume, obtained by the government watchdog American Oversight through a Freedom of Information Act request, says she worked at Cambridge Analytica starting in March 2016.

One of her responsibilities at Cambridge Analytica was to “Collaborate Across Teams to Execute Targeted Engagement and Outreach Strategies, including Oversight of Audience Segmentation and Message Planning for Presidential Campaign,” she wrote in her resume. The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica starting in June 2016. Before that, the company worked on the Ted Cruz campaign.

Rzendzian’s history with Cambridge Analytica has not previously been reported. She declined to comment on her work with the firm.

SCL Group started as a British political messaging group. Cambridge Analytica is the creation of SCL Group executive Alexander Nix, GOP megadonor Robert Mercer and his political adviser Steve Bannon. Nix was the CEO of Cambridge Analytica until he was suspended in the wake of the Facebook scandal.

In 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to place television advertisements, target digital advertisements and conduct polling in swing states.

Last week, a former Cambridge Analytica employee revealed how the group collected data from more than 50 million Facebook users ― mostly without their consent. Cambridge Analytica wanted the data to help create profiles of voters based on their psychological traits. It is unclear whether Cambridge Analytica used the information it collected from Facebook to help the Trump campaign.

Cambridge Analytica is now under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, congressional committees, and the U.K.’s information and data privacy regulator. Special counsel Robert Mueller asked Cambridge Analytica to turn over emails belonging to employees who worked on the Trump campaign, The Wall Street Journal reported in December.

Rzendzian joined the Commerce Department’s Office of Business Liaison as a special assistant to the secretary in February 2017, shortly after Trump took office.

The department declined to comment about Rzendzian’s job responsibilities or whether there are other former Cambridge Analytica or SCL Group employees who now work at the agency.

Rzendzian lists extensive campaign experience on her resume. She worked on John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid and Mitt Romney’s in 2012, the document says.
