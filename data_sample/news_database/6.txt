Bill Maher believes the White House daily press briefings have had their day.

On Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” the host groaned at the outrage over fellow comedian Michelle Wolf’s speech at last weekend’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. He said she “did a great job.”

Critics have suggested the association should stop inviting comedians to host the event, but Maher disagreed and proposed the White House instead scrap its daily press briefing conducted by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

“I heard from people in the press this week that they’re just fed up with Sarah Huckabee Sanders at this point,” said Maher.

“We know this is the lyingest administration ever,” he added. “What is the point of going into this room every day and having this Baghdad Bob person just tell you this bullshit that you know is bullshit and she knows is bullshit? They should walk out en masse and make a statement.”Authorities have arrested four people in connection with the brutal killings of 21-year-olds Alize Ramon Smith and Jarron Keonte Moreland.

The suspects, now in custody, are reportedly all related. According to police, they are Crystal Rachell Boettler, 40, her boyfriend Johnny Shane Barker, 43, and her children Kevin Garcia-Boettler, 22, and a 16-year-old juvenile.

Court documents obtained by Oklahoma City’s KOCO 5 News say authorities in Moore, Oklahoma, filed a variety of charges against the suspects this week, ranging from first-degree murder to accessory after the fact.

Smith and Moreland were last seen alive on April 14, when they allegedly went to meet the two younger suspects at a Moore grocery store. Moreland had posted a classified ad for a gun online and one of the suspects had agreed to purchase it, police said.

Relatives of Smith and Moreland reported them missing when they failed to return home.

Police suspected the two missing men were connected to a report they’d received from the same grocery store earlier that day.

According to police, someone had found a handgun and sandal in the store’s parking lot. Witnesses allegedly told investigators they’d seen a black male covered with blood inside a white Chrysler minivan. Another black male was allegedly seen hanging out of the van as it sped off.

Investigators got their first break in the case when they obtained communication records that showed the 16-year-old suspect had been in contact with one of the missing men, Oklahoma’s KFOR reported.

On April 17, Moore police went to the Boettler residence to investigate whether the communications were connected to the case. Upon arrival, they allegedly spotted a van matching the description of the one that had fled the grocery store. Officers also spotted “cleaning products ... dried blood spatter [and] a bucket of water with a chainsaw bar inside,” according to a search warrant filed in the case.

Questioned by police, Garcia-Boettler and Barker allegedly admitted their involvement in Smith and Moreland’s disappearance.

Court documents say that when the two younger suspects went to the grocery store parking lot, Smith and Moreland approached the minivan.

“There was apparently going to be a sale of a gun, possibly off of Craigslist when the two victims entered the vehicle,” Moore Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis told KFOR-TV. “The suspects claimed they heard a gun being racked or cocked. At that point, one of those individuals fired at the two victims that entered the van, killing them both at that time.”

The 16-year-old is suspected of being the shooter, police said.

The two suspects then allegedly went to see Boettler and Barker, who authorities say attempted to help the young men cover up their crime.

Police searched a local pond on April 18 and found Smith and Moreland’s bodies, which, according to court documents, had been dismembered and tied together with a tarp that was attached to cement blocks.

The juvenile suspect is facing charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, unlawful removal of a dead body, desecration of a human corpse and possessing a firearm after delinquent adjudication.

Garcia-Boettler and Barker have both been charged with accessory after the fact and unlawful removal of a dead body. Barker faces an additional charge of desecration of a human corpse. Boettler, the mother of the two younger suspects, has been charged with accessory after the fact.

“Felt like somebody ripped my heart out of my chest,” Moreland’s mother, Kennetha Moreland, told KFOR.

“At least we know what happened,” Smith’s aunt, Raquel Hall, told Oklahoma City’s News9.com. “Even though we weren’t able to find him alive, we were able to find him and get that closure that we all needed as a family.”

Hall added, “Nobody deserves to die the way that they died.”

AdvertisementIt did not occur to Bertha Lewis to be afraid.

She was watching the final presidential debate of 2008, and John McCain had just said something insane. “We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama’s relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy,” the Arizona Republican proclaimed.

Lewis had been leading ACORN ― the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ― for about five months. ACORN advocated for the poor. In addition to helping families navigate federal aid programs, the group ran campaigns to improve city sanitation, protested against predatory lenders and registered people to vote. The nation’s top Republican politician had just declared this body of work tantamount to stealing an election.

“It was absurd,” Lewis said in a recent interview. “Those words had no meaning.”

If anything, Lewis reasoned, the attack was probably good news. Republicans had always loathed ACORN, in no small part because poor voters tend to vote Democrat, but open, inflammatory denunciations of the group were generally confined to the talk radio fringe.

Lewis had been bogged down in a top-to-bottom overhaul of ACORN’s financial and managerial structure ever since she accepted her promotion. If GOP leaders were escalating things in October, she figured it meant she was running a solid voter registration operation despite all the paperwork she’d been buried in.

McCain’s debate paranoia wasn’t an isolated outburst. It became the Republican Party’s closing pitch for the 2008 election, amplified in political media. U.S. newspapers published over 1,700 stories on ACORN during October ― more than 10 times the average monthly total so far that year. More than three-fourths of these stories were devoted to allegations of “voter fraud.”

The illegal voting accusations never panned out. But within 18 months, Lewis would be forced to close ACORN’s doors ― exhausted, short-staffed, out of money and, most important, out of allies.

ACORN had survived for more than 40 years. Its sudden collapse was a defining moment in 21st century American politics. The explosive cocktail of racism, dishonesty, incompetence and cowardice that brought down the organization reveals as much about Washington Democrats as it does about the conservative movement. It marked the Republican Party’s full transition from the coded winks and nods of Richard Nixon’s “Southern strategy” to the bellicose white nativism that defines Donald Trump, and it exposed a Democratic Party establishment unprepared for dirty tricks in the Digital Age and unwilling to defend many of the black voters and activists it claimed to represent.

After McCain lost the 2008 election, his allegations of a vast ACORN conspiracy to steal the election looked even more preposterous. Nobody could find a single fraudulent vote that had been cast by someone connected to ACORN. But the ACORN story kept bouncing around conservative media anyway. Prosecutors in a few states cited a handful of ACORN employees for shoddy voter registration ― submitting incomplete forms or paperwork with bogus names like “Donald Duck” or “Tony Romo.” In many cases, ACORN itself had flagged the faulty documents before turning them over to state officials, since election laws required that all registration paperwork an organization had collected be turned in. This detail often wasn’t included in the stories.

Then in September 2009, everybody seemed to forget about ACORN voter fraud entirely. Right-wing provocateurs James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles released a batch of undercover videos through Andrew Breitbart’s new website that appeared to show ACORN employees offering to help O’Keefe get away with all kinds of outrages, including dodging tax payments for an underage prostitution ring he claimed he wanted to smuggle into the country. Fox News pumped out updates on the story day after day as more videos were released in a slow trickle. O’Keefe appeared on “Fox & Friends” dressed like a 1970s stereotype of a pimp one morning, and Breitbart and Giles would make Sean Hannity’s show another evening.

It was much juicier than the stale voter fraud story. Both Hannity and Glenn Beck ran segments in which a California ACORN employee supposedly confessed to murdering her husband.

Several formal investigations would later find that, although the undercover videos might have been embarrassing, ACORN workers didn’t violate any laws. The district attorney’s office in Brooklyn, New York, found “no criminality” after a five-month investigation. Neither did the California attorney general’s office. The murder “confession” touted by Fox turned out to be a prank by an ACORN employee who’d caught on to the stunt. (State investigators interviewed her ex-husbands, who were still very much alive.)

In an interview with HuffPost, O’Keefe said it’s wrong to focus on whether his work uncovered actual criminality.

“It exposed immorality. It exposed soullessness,” he said. “Undercover work is about testing and affirming what people are willing to do.”

O’Keefe has clung to the fact that ACORN workers in Baltimore gave him tax advice for his illegal business, including tips on “how to disguise my 13 underage El Salvadorian sex girls on the tax returns,” as he claimed on Reddit in January.

In fact, after being told the girls didn’t have Social Security numbers, the ACORN worker told O’Keefe that “we can’t use them at all,” according to unedited transcripts originally posted to Breitbart’s site. Confronted about the transcript, O’Keefe said it was still “highly immoral” for ACORN employees to help him report illegal income to the IRS. But even that’s questionable, since illegal income is supposed to be reported to the IRS.

“One of the things a tax preparer has to do when you have a client with illegal income is navigate between reporting the illegal income ― which must be done ― and protecting the client’s right not to incriminate himself,” according to Larry Zelenak, a tax professor at Duke University School of Law.

A crime may well have been committed at the ACORN offices ― by O’Keefe. California state law prohibits non-consensual recordings of confidential conversations. The state granted him immunity from potential charges in exchange for access to his complete recordings, but it didn’t wipe out his liability in civil lawsuits. O’Keefe eventually agreed to pay a $100,000 settlement to a former ACORN employee who had actually contacted the police after O’Keefe’s visit but was portrayed in the video as a willing collaborator. As part of the settlement, O’Keefe said he regretted “any pain” he caused the man.

But Washington didn’t wait around for the facts to come out. On Sept. 14, 2009, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 83 to 7 to block some federal grants to ACORN. Government funding typically accounted for 10 to 15 percent of ACORN’s annual funding. The group received $48.4 million from the federal government from 2005 to 2009 ― most of it, including a $25 million grant in 2008, for housing counseling and foreclosure mitigation.

On Sept. 17, the House followed suit, with 172 Democrats joining 173 Republicans in voting to defund ACORN, including some of the most progressive voices in the party, such as Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) and John Conyers (D-Mich.).

Today, Democrats don’t like to talk about that vote. Several told HuffPost they didn’t remember how they voted or why they voted the way they did, other than to note the vote occurred amid a rash of scandalous ACORN headlines.

“Democrats panicked and felt like they had to be a part of that,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), one of the 75 Democrats who voted no, told HuffPost.

Democrats had assumed a defensive posture following electoral victories in November 2008 and wanted to focus on their policy agenda, according to Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who missed the vote.

“We’re fighting about Dodd-Frank, we’re fighting about stimulus, we’re fighting about the Affordable Care Act, and we’re fighting about climate change and cap-and-trade,” Connolly said. “Huge battles. Huge! I think the calculus for some of my colleagues was, ‘How much political capital do I want to expend on this when I have these other big ones?’”

But that wasn’t how Republicans saw Democrats at the time. Democrats were on a roll ― they had taken control of Congress in 2006 and pounded Republicans again in 2008. They’d just reclaimed the White House. The GOP was the party of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, the financial crisis and the bank bailouts. Reeling from these failures, the official Democratic rebuke of ACORN seemed to chart a new course for Republican political strategy in which aggressive attacks from Breitbart and Fox News ― however outlandish ― could force Democrats into concessions.

“In many ways, I feel like this issue was a prelude to how conservatives would weaponize issues going forward in the tea party era that would follow,” said Kurt Bardella, who has worked for both Breitbart and as a spokesman for Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the foremost Republican ACORN opponent in Congress. (Bardella is currently a columnist for HuffPost.)

“ACORN was the only political success Republicans experienced in this period of time,” Bardella said. “I think having a win that the Breitbart side of the world could claim as their own gave them the first real sense that the Republican base was with them more than the politicians, and they could leverage and activate that to play a more impactful role in shaping the direction of the GOP.”

“It exposed immorality. It exposed soullessness.” - James O'Keefe

A day after the Senate voted to defund ACORN, an incredulous Jon Stewart featured the O’Keefe video on “The Daily Show,” shaming journalists for missing the apparently massive nationwide fraud underway at ACORN. Hadn’t Republicans been warning about the group for years?

“Where the hell were you?” Stewart ranted.

Reporters had, in fact, scrutinized ACORN, turning up a major scandal at the organization the previous year. In July 2008, The New York Times reported that Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN founder Wade Rathke, had embezzled almost $1 million from the organization from 1999 to 2000 and kept it secret from the ACORN board. Rathke was fired, and some funders, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, decided to sever ties with the group. But there was not a rush for the exits. Drummond Pike, the head of the Tides Foundation, personally paid back the embezzlement debt.

The board promoted Lewis from her position in New York’s ACORN office to replace Wade Rathke, and she spent much of the next year auditing finances and reorganizing ACORN’s management structure. As the country’s financial crisis escalated, she beefed up the group’s anti-foreclosure activism, and by the summer of 2009, the stigma from the embezzlement scandal seemed to have faded. Republicans weren’t really harping on it. Instead, Reps. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) and Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) were raising a fuss over the possibility that ACORN volunteers might somehow corrupt the census.

The reforms Lewis implemented convinced Dave Beckwith, who was then the executive director of the Needmor Fund, a philanthropy that supports social justice work, that ACORN had turned a corner. “They took organizational internal repair very seriously,” Beckwith told HuffPost. “They changed the role the board played, they became much more transparent about finances and they changed leadership.”

But when the O’Keefe videos hit, ACORN was still in a funding hole. Lewis and other longtime ACORN staffers say the group could have weathered the storm if the Democratic Party hadn’t abandoned it. It wasn’t just a question of losing government grants. The vote to defund ACORN sent a very clear signal to liberal donors that ACORN wasn’t worth defending.

“We tried to engage the philanthropic community in understanding what happened and the degree to which the organization was taking the repair process,” said Beckwith. “And frankly, most were not interested in hearing that story because they had been convinced by a false narrative of corruption and malfeasance.”

By the spring of 2010, the organization was out of money and officially closed its doors.

Other liberal and left-wing organizations also refused to speak out on ACORN’s behalf, Lewis said. When she reached out to Planned Parenthood, which O’Keefe had gone after the year before, she said the reproductive health care nonprofit told her that it didn’t want to help or even be seen together. As Lewis saw it, Planned Parenthood’s leaders seemed to feel like they had “dodged a bullet” in avoiding a congressional funding battle and didn’t want to court any further controversy.

Another ACORN alum, former executive director Steve Kest, says Planned Parenthood didn’t just leave ACORN for dead. It made phone calls to funders and members of Congress on behalf of ACORN ― more than plenty of other liberal groups were willing to do.

“It is clear now that the attack on ACORN was the beginning of a new era of extreme attacks on community-based organizations,” Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Erica Sackin told HuffPost. “None of us, including Planned Parenthood, knew enough or did enough in that moment to expose these video attacks for what they were.”

When a different group of conservatives published videos that purported to show Planned Parenthood negotiating fees for fetal organ tissue in 2015 and Republicans sought to defund group, Democrats and liberals rallied instead of running for cover, offering a much stronger defense than ACORN had enjoyed.

Lewis thinks this was a matter of optics. While Planned Parenthood serves plenty of low-income black and brown women, it has always deployed accomplished, well-to-do white women as the centerpiece of its public image. Planned Parenthood officials make the rounds at Democratic Party fundraisers and fancy liberal conferences. ACORN hired poor people of color and held sit-ins at bank branches.

“If we had been a community group ― like, stick to your neighborhood, give out some turkeys, give the natives some blankets, do social services, occasionally have a silent march and then kneel down and pray ― that might have been fine,” Lewis said. “The attacks on the organization were all around race …. It was because our constituency was black.”

The O’Keefe videos dropped about a month after a different ACORN-related bombshell that had gone almost entirely unnoticed. In August 2009, the House Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages of emails and transcripts related to President George W. Bush’s controversial decision to fire several Department of Justice prosecutors in his second term.

The documents revealed that in 2006, after a U.S. attorney in New Mexico refused to file bogus voter fraud charges against an ACORN worker, the Bush administration retaliated by firing him ― an account that corroborated a report from the Justice Department’s inspector general. This was a major scandal. The president had fired prosecutors for refusing to bring a nonsense case against an organization he believed to be a political enemy.

The U.S. attorney scandal was not new in 2009, but the details about the involvement of White House adviser Karl Rove were. Several major news outlets picked up on it ― but nearly all of them missed that Rove’s displeasure with the New Mexico prosecutor wasn’t just about voter fraud. It was about voter fraud and ACORN.

Nearly a decade since the documents were disclosed, however, Rove remains a respected member of the Republican intelligentsia. O’Keefe, though he succeeded where Rove failed, is disgraced. Most of his subsequent undercover projects have fallen flat ― none more dramatically than last year’s attempt to discredit the Alabama women who had credibly accused Senate candidate Roy Moore of having abused or stalked them when they were teenagers.

Several Democrats told HuffPost they didn’t think they would fall for another smear campaign like the one waged against ACORN. O’Keefe and Breitbart were new figures in 2009. People wouldn’t take them seriously today.

“Having been there and done it, I think there’s some wisdom now that would take hold that would perhaps prevent this from happening again,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), who voted in favor of the 2009 ACORN resolution.

But Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) isn’t so sure.

“We react spontaneously to virtually anything, and sometimes overreact,” Yarmuth said. “The impact of social media has increased exponentially since 2009 where you can get swamped by social media on any particular misstep or issue. The potential for that happening again is greater, not less.”

Without ACORN to kick around, the Republican Party’s voter fraud claims have evolved. President Trump claims 3 million to 5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote in 2016, and he even appointed a commission to investigate the supposed problem. Its work was clearly farcical, and the commission disbanded earlier this year in disarray.

ACORN registered more than 865,000 voters for the 2008 election. While other groups have tried to pick up the slack, there’s a reason Republicans haven’t selected a new organization to serve as the voter fraud boogeyman: nobody is doing the same caliber work on the same scale that ACORN did.

And while just about every possible explanation for Trump’s 77,744-vote margin of victory in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan has been explored to death, almost nobody talks about the effect ACORN might have had in those states.

If Congress has learned any lessons from the ACORN episode, you wouldn’t know it from the legislative record. Each year, government spending bills typically include new bans on funding for ACORN or its successors ― a term with no legal definition. Congress blocked money for ACORN again in its March funding bill.

Issa, who championed the original, successful defunding effort in 2009, told HuffPost that ACORN offshoots might still be at large, though he could not name any. The conservative group Judicial Watch hasn’t raised alarms about an alleged ACORN affiliate receiving federal funds since 2014.

Bardella, the former Issa spokesman, said Republicans had been right to investigate ACORN’s use of federal funds and its finances back in 2009. But he said Issa is probably foolish to raise the specter of ACORN successor groups running amok.Evangelist and author Beth Moore is speaking out about the sexism and misogyny she's endured for decades as a woman in the ministry. Terry Wyatt via Getty Images

Beth Moore is a prominent American evangelist and author who has spent decades studying and preaching from the Bible.

But as a female leader who has worked within conservative evangelical circles for most of her life, she’s faced misogyny from men in ministry ― whether it’s being ignored or made fun of during team meetings, or being criticized by men who flat-out refused to value Bible lessons taught by a woman.

It’s a reality that the evangelist has largely kept silent about ― until now.

On Thursday, Moore posted a blog to her website that revealed some of the sexist attitudes she’s had to endure in more than 20 years of ministry.

Moore says a respected male theologian looked her up and down during their first meeting, smiled “approvingly” and commented that she was “better looking” than another female Bible teacher he knew. She said she learned early to show “constant pronounced deference” to male leaders and when called upon to lead alongside them to “do so apologetically.” Moore said she’s been talked down to by male seminary students who were years younger than her.

I’ve ridden elevators in hotels packed with fellow leaders who were serving at the same event and not been spoken to and, even more awkwardly, in the same vehicles where I was never acknowledged. I’ve been in team meetings where I was either ignored or made fun of, the latter of which I was expected to understand was all in good fun. I am a laugher. I can take jokes and make jokes. I know good fun when I’m having it and I also know when I’m being dismissed and ridiculed. I was the elephant in the room with a skirt on. ... These examples may seem fairly benign in light of recent scandals of sexual abuse and assault coming to light but the attitudes are growing from the same dangerously malignant root. Many women have experienced horrific abuses within the power structures of our Christian world.

Moore is the leader of Living Proof Ministries, an organization she founded in 1994 with the intent of teaching women of all Christian denominations about the Bible. The Texas resident is the author of numerous books and Bible studies, and she’s often called upon to preach at conferences around the world.

Moore wrote that many of the men she’s worked with have shown her nothing but respect and support throughout her career. But she said a “colossal disregard and disrespect of women” persists in some male leaders in conservative Christian circles. For years, she chose to silently accept the challenges that come with being a female evangelical leader in the spotlight.

But she wrote on Thursday that she had decided to speak up now about these experiences for the sake of other female leaders in the evangelical world.

“I cry foul and not for my own sake. Most of my life is behind me,” she wrote. “I do so for the sake of my gender, for the sake of our sisters in Christ and for the sake of other female leaders who will be faced with similar challenges.”

"I was the elephant in the room with a skirt on," Beth Moore writes. Terry Wyatt via Getty Images

The evangelist’s blog seemed to strike a chord with many Christian women online, who started chiming in with their own stories about what it’s like to be a woman in conservative Christian circles who feels called to lead and to preach.

Kaitlyn Schiess, a student working toward a master’s at Dallas Theological Seminary, told HuffPost about a time she experienced pushback from a male classmate.

“In one of my classes at seminary, a man asked in the middle of class, ‘How can I kindly tell my sisters in Christ that they shouldn’t be in the ThM (master of theology) program?’” Schiess recalled. “I appreciate his desire to be loving, but a brief discussion in class about gender roles in the Bible had prompted him to assume the role of ultimate interpreter and judge over the decisions of his female classmates.”

The most important thing evangelicals can do to fight this sort of misogyny is value the insight and contributions of women, Schiess said. That means, among other things, ensuring that male pastors are “learning from and with women.”

“When our seminaries make it possible for men to spend three to five years studying Scripture without women showing up in their classes, on their syllabi or teaching their classes, they will be unprepared to faithfully minister to a church that is at least half women,” she said.

Other women told their own stories on Twitter about being female leaders in the ministry:

Thank u, @BethMooreLPM. I was once invited to preach on a Sunday morning, & the pastor said: "Men, Jen has a few words to share with the ladies & we'll just peek over their shoulders until she is finished." Humiliating, condescending, shocking even since he invited me to preach. https://t.co/HRWgWJh0sN — JenHatmaker (@JenHatmaker) May 3, 2018

I am so so so sorry for your experience!

It's so embedded in us to think we don't matter. When I was at the #lynchburgrevival and was shown so much respect, by the men in my season, it actually surprised me.

Moore’s blog post also provoked an outpouring of comments from evangelical men ― including the prominent pastor Thabiti Anyabwile, who wrote a long letter asking for forgiveness for the attitude he had held toward women in the ministry.

“I hope, with God’s help, to grow in sanctification, especially with regards to any sexism, misogyny, chauvinism, and the like that has used biblical teaching as a cover for its growth,” Anyabwile wrote.

Thank you Beth. This Moore house loves you and are grateful for you. — Russell Moore (@drmoore) May 3, 2018

Katelyn Beaty, an editor-at-large at Christianity Today, told HuffPost that verses in the Bible instructing women to submit to men have been misinterpreted by some to essentially “baptize male dominance.”

An overly broad approach to women’s submission, coupled with the belief that divorce should be avoided at all costs, is a “potent and literally deadly” combination that leads many women to endure abuse, she said.

“It leads pastors like Paige Patterson to justify or excuse domestic violence or to see it as the price of a godly marriage,” Beaty wrote in an email. “This is a gross departure from the biblical text as well as a grave departure from the pastor’s call to shepherd his members.”

Moore’s blog comes as controversy about the Southern Baptist Convention leader’s attitudes toward women has roiled the denomination. In a recently resurfaced 2000 audio clip, Patterson, the president of a Southern Baptist seminary in Texas, can be heard claiming that physically abused women should try as hard as possible to avoid divorce. This week, he clarified that, although he doesn’t condone abusive relationships, he thinks “non-injurious” abuse might spur a woman to “pray through” the situation rather than get a divorce. The scandal over Patterson has divided the denomination, with some calling for the leader’s resignation and others standing by him.

What Christians, particularly evangelicals, need to do is develop a theology that calls out sexism and misogyny as sins, Beaty said.Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was identified by DNA evidence as the "Golden State Killer," authorities say. Sacramento Bee/Randy Pench/Pool via REUTERS

WASHINGTON ― There were reasons to suspect the serial murderer and rapist known as the “Golden State Killer” worked as a cop. He knew to conceal his identity, wearing ski masks and gloves, ordering his victims not to look at him, disguising his voice in a whisper. He meticulously cased victims’ neighborhoods and homes: emptying bullets from a gun, disrupting phone lines, reducing noise. He brought shoelaces and ropes to use as makeshift handcuffs. He had a knack for parking outside of a police perimeter. He was proficient with firearms, tactically sound and skilled at making his victims comply. An escaping woman once heard him shout, “Freeze!” And for decades, he managed to escape authorities.

As it turns out, Joseph James DeAngelo, the 72-year-old man arrested last week on suspicion of committing a chain of rapes, murders and burglaries in California in the 1970s and ’80s, was an ex-police officer. (He also reportedly served in the Navy during the Vietnam War.) DeAngelo hasn’t entered a plea yet, and his attorney emphasized that he is innocent until proven guilty.

But if DeAngelo is the Golden State Killer, his background matters: Being in law enforcement could have helped him further his alleged crimes. And although this case is extreme — DeAngelo may have only been interested in policing to get away with wrongdoing — there’s dramatic evidence that when a person with abusive tendencies joins a police force, the tools and authority that come with being a cop may only make them more dangerous.

“With his training in law enforcement, he would absolutely look to try to use that to his advantage,” John Hall, the police chief at Exeter Police Department, where DeAngelo worked decades ago, told HuffPost.

Most people enter law enforcement “because they believe it’s a very noble and honorable profession, and they have a genuine desire to go out and make a positive difference,” Hall added. “So when you have somebody that comes on board, and they ... betray that trust that was placed in them, it’s just extremely disappointing.”

“He’s always been a wolf in sheep’s clothing.” - Larry Pool, formerly of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, on the suspected Golden State Killer

DeAngelo graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminal justice from California State University, Sacramento, in 1972. He did an internship in “Patrol Identification and Investigation Divisions,” according to a 1973 Exeter Sun article that reported he joined Exeter Police Department in May that year. Hall told HuffPost he had “no doubt” DeAngelo worked there, though there are no employee records from that time.

DeAngelo then went on to work at the Auburn Police Department from 1976 to 1979, according to news reports, until he was fired after stealing a hammer and a can of dog repellent. The Auburn Police Department did not respond to a request to verify that timeline.

DeAngelo would have been with the Exeter police when a spree of high-profile burglaries took place in nearby Visalia in the mid-’70s. Those crimes have not yet been officially linked to him, but he also appears to have been with the Auburn police when a string of rapes occurred not far from that area.

DeAngelo’s public defender did not respond to a request for comment.

Only around 1 percent of serial killers have a law enforcement background, not counting security guards. Out of the 5,009 serial killers in the Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database, the largest nongovernmental serial murderer database in the world, 32 were former members of law enforcement and 25 were in law enforcement for at least part of their series of murders, according to Michael Aamodt, a professor emeritus at Radford University in Virginia. Two other serial killers were ex-military police, and 44 were security guards.

DeAngelo was an officer in sleepy communities decades ago, and it’s unclear how much serious policing he did. He reportedly caught a toilet-papering teenager, and the police department in Auburn mostly handled property crimes.

But law enforcement experience might help a killer to conduct surveillance, physically and verbally force a victim to comply, and conceal evidence. Today, police officers have access to sophisticated information databases, but even in the ’70s, DeAngelo may have been able to view information disseminated about his alleged crimes. (It’s unknown if he did so.) Additionally, once someone works as a cop, that experience and those instincts can become deeply ingrained.

“Police have tremendous authority, and they get information and access that simply isn’t available to most people.” - Seth Stoughton, assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina

Investigators had suspected that the Golden State Killer could be a police officer and/or have a military background, said Larry Pool, a former investigator with the Orange County Sheriff’s Department who spent more than 20 years working on the case. Pool personally believed that “our offender would be someone who, while needing to control people, would not be very good at controlling themselves,” and he suspected the offender wouldn’t be successful for long in those careers. Nonetheless, Pool said he wouldn’t have excluded somebody who was “very successful” in the military or law enforcement.

Pool documented names of police officers, detectives and emergency personnel who touched the case, and followed up on them to determine what they’d done since the series of crimes, he noted.

In his view, DeAngelo was not a real police officer, but “someone who came into law enforcement wanting to be placed in a position of control and authority,” he told HuffPost. “He’s always been a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”

Policing experts say vigilant screening and oversight can be key to making sure a violent person stays out of a police force. “Law enforcement agencies do a pretty good job now of screening for violent-type tendencies,” said David Thomas, a program manager for the International Association of Chiefs of Police who focuses on addressing violence against women. But for anyone looking to bolster their hiring practices, “I would want to do a case study on everything that they can connected to the [DeAngelo] case to learn from it.”

Screening is not infallible. So when victims report officer abuse to internal affairs departments, for example, those complaints must be taken seriously, victim advocates say. (A HuffPost investigation on officer-involved domestic violence found that even minor-sounding complaints can reflect deeper problems.)

Although the Golden State Killer is an extreme case and the crimes took place decades ago, keeping forces free of bad apples is just as important today, particularly as communities of color continue to distrust police and may feel that badly behaving officers are protected rather than held accountable.

“Police have tremendous authority, and they get information and access that simply isn’t available to most people,” said Seth Stoughton, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina and a former police officer. “There are plenty of concerns that arise from the risk that officers will slightly misuse their knowledge and authority — and what this guy did was not a slight misuse.”

Nick Willick, the former Auburn police chief who fired DeAngelo decades ago for shoplifting, told Fox40 he was “personally embarrassed” that his ex-colleague had turned out to be the alleged killer.

AdvertisementDonald Trump’s so-called executive time in the White House, when he mostly chills, watches TV and makes calls, may be growing. He had only two items on his calendar Thursday. He’s taking off Friday to speak at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention, then he’s expected to spend another weekend golfing.

White House schedule

Trump’s incredible shrinking workday was spotted and highlighted by Mother Jones magazine.

“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert made a song out of Trump’s workday on his program Wednesday, altering Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5″ lyrics. Colbert crooned: “Working 11 to 2, what way to run a nation. Just three things to do, then it’s basically vacation. Write a tweet or two, just to add to the confusion, and pray that they don’t convict you of collusion!”

Axios obtained Trump’s daily schedule early this year revealing hours each day of “executive time” when the president was “in his residence, watching TV, making phone calls and tweeting.”

On one day, Trump’s day began with a meeting with Chief of Staff John Kelly at 11 a.m., followed by an hour of “executive time,” an hour for lunch, an hour and 15 minutes of “executive time,” a 45-minute meeting, then 15 more minutes of “executive time,” according to Axios.

Trump had blasted Barack Obama for spending too much time on the golf course when he was president. Trump also told The Hill in 2015: “I would rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done. I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.”Rudy Giuliani lashed former FBI Director James Comey as a “sensitive little baby” Thursday after Comey defended the bureau’s agents after Giuliani called them “storm troopers,” The Washington Post reported.

Among a number of stunning comments by Giuliani in his Fox News interview Wednesday night, he compared FBI agents to Nazi storm troopers for raiding the office of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen last month and collecting documents and computers. Agents, provided with court-issued warrants, were legally authorized to do so. Cohen is being investigated for bank fraud and possible campaign finance violations.

Comey tweeted Thursday that there are no “stormtroopers” in the FBI — “just a group of people devoted to the rule of law and the truth.” Comey said the country would be better off if “our leaders” tried to emulate them instead of “comparing them to Nazis.”

I know the New York FBI. There are no “stormtroopers” there; just a group of people devoted to the rule of law and the truth. Our country would be better off if our leaders tried to be like them, rather than comparing them to Nazis. — James Comey (@Comey) May 3, 2018

Giuliani, who just joined Trump’s legal team, responded to the tweet in an interview with The Washington Post, calling Comey a “sensitive little baby.”

He added, without offering details: “He should be sensitive, because he’s been caught lying over and over again.”

Bolstering his growing reputation as Trump’s new insult man, Giuliani on Fox also called Comey a “disgraceful liar” and “very perverted man” — again, without explaining what he was referring to.

In defending Trump on Fox, Giuliani appeared to support suspicions that the president fired Comey a year ago to short-circuit an investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to swing the election in Trump’s favor.

Giuliani said the president “fired Comey because Comey would not — among other things — say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.” So “he fired him and he said, ‘I’m free of this guy.’”

Giuliani has traditionally enjoyed strong ties with the FBI, both as a U.S. attorney and as New York City mayor. After Comey reopened the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails just before the election, Giuliani indicated he learned that members of the bureau weren’t happy with the initial conclusion to not pursue her use of a private email server from both former and “active” agents.

LOVELAND, Ohio ― Rand Paul says he’s not trying to oust his fellow Kentuckian, Mitch McConnell, from his seat atop GOP leadership in the Senate. But some of the candidates he’s supporting sure are.

Paul, a former presidential contender, came to a convention center in this Cincinnati suburb on Thursday to campaign for Mike Gibbons, an investment banker running for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Gibbons is facing Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), who has the backing of both McConnell and President Donald Trump, in next week’s primary.

Gibbons, along with several other candidates Paul is backing, has refused to support McConnell as majority leader. Paul is also supporting state Sen. Kelli Ward in Arizona, who is directly challenging McConnell-backed Rep. Martha McSally. Another candidate he’s backing, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, indicated he wouldn’t back McConnell during a Fox News debate earlier this week.

This handful of candidates poses no real threat to McConnell’s leadership. But the endorsements show how Paul is still trying to shape the Senate Republican conference in a more libertarian, anti-establishment direction, even as he’s come under fire for eventually supporting both the GOP tax law and the confirmation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after initially threatening to torpedo both.

“We’re really trying to find people who aren’t beholden to leadership,” Paul told reporters after the Gibbons rally. He later added he wasn’t specifically referring to McConnell: “It isn’t so much about a person. And I’m trying not to make it about a person. Frankly, I’m trying to keep good relations with my fellow senators.”

“It’s not about him so much as it is about leadership in general,” he said. “Whenever I think of leadership, I think ‘Dear Leader,’ and this structure that isn’t really American.”

Gibbons wasn’t as diplomatic.

“The guy I’m running against was recruited by Mitch McConnell. Do you think he’s not going to go with him on every single thing?” he said. “I’m proud of the fact that [McConnell] isn’t supporting me.”

Renacci remains the front-runner in the contest and is airing ads that emphasize Trump’s endorsement of him ― although the high number of undecided voters in public polls indicates a Gibbons victory remains possible. Renacci dismissed Paul’s backing of Gibbons as insignificant.

Excited to share my first TV ad in Ohio's U.S. Senate race and how as your next Senator, I will always Fight for Ohio! #OhSen pic.twitter.com/J3MNpWbqV3 — Jim Renacci (@JimRenacci) April 13, 2018

“I’m humbled to have the President of the United States and the entire Ohio Republican party supporting my campaign,” he said in an emailed statement. “I am glad to see he found someone from Kentucky to support his.”

Besides Gibbons, the candidates Paul is supporting are a mixed bunch. Ward, who previously challenged occasional Paul nemesis John McCain during the 2016 cycle, is in a three-way race with McSally and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to secure the GOP nomination for outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake’s seat. Morrisey is locked in a battle with Democrat-turned-Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins in West Virginia. Montana Auditor Matt Rosendale is the front-runner to battle Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat. All three had the backing of former White House strategist Steve Bannon when he was plotting to oust McConnell before his political self-immolation in January.

Political consultants with strong ties to Paul are also deeply involved in two of the contests. Gibbons’ senior adviser is Michael Biundo, who worked for Paul’s 2016 presidential bid. And Jesse Benton, a former Paul aide who was convicted of conspiracy and other charges for his role in a bribery scheme during the runup to the 2012 Iowa caucuses, is working for both a super PAC supporting Ward and for Maine state Sen. Eric Brakey’s campaign for U.S. Senate. (The Daily Beast first reported Benton’s resurgence.)

Meanwhile, Paul has endorsed primary candidates in two races ignored by most Republican senators: He’s supporting state Del. Nick Freitas for the nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and backing Brakey to challenge Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats.

Freitas and Brakey, who are both running in contested primaries, are ideological soul mates for the libertarian-minded Paul, and Brakey previously worked for former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) ― who is Rand Paul’s father ― when the elder Paul mounted presidential bids. As a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016, Brakey argued for a host of libertarian policy proposals, including the legalization of medical marijuana. Freitas recently ignited a firestorm with a passionate defense of gun rights on the floor of the Virginia legislature.

“We’re looking for people who are conservative first and party second,” Paul said, noting he wants candidates who share his vision of a Constitution that dramatically limits the size of the federal government.

During the Loveland rally, in front of a crowd of about 100 people, both Paul and Gibbons warned of the exploding national debt, and emphasized their status as political outsiders and their support for term limits. “When the Republican Party gets in charge, there is no conservative party,” Paul said to applause as he lambasted the spending bill passed by the GOP Congress and signed into law by Trump in March.Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel said the party will win in November.

DORAL, Fla. – In a turbulent ocean roiled by Robert Mueller, Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, President Donald Trump’s subtropical golf resort offered the nation’s top Republicans an island of calm on Friday.

Here at the Trump National Doral Golf Club, the Republican National Committee boasted about its fundraising totals, its placement of campaign staff in key states months ahead of the November midterm elections, the strong economy it attributes to tax cuts passed by a Republican Congress.

The special counsel investigation? Hush money to a porn star? An FBI probe of the president’s longtime personal lawyer?

“I haven’t had a conversation about any of those, to be honest,” said Bill Currier, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party.

“Just idle chatter. It has to be something every day,” said Charles Joyce, the RNC committeeman from New York state. “I take it all with a grain of salt.”

Miriam Hellreich, Hawaii’s RNC committeewoman, said she has heard “not a word” about Trump’s various scandals from her colleagues at this week’s meetings. “What the country’s worried about right now is not Stormy Daniels and the Russia probe. It’s what’s happening with their families.”

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told members that the group’s record fundraising so far this election cycle ― $171 million ― will help Republicans buck the historical trend of a party losing a substantial number of congressional seats in the first general election after taking control of the White House.

“We can win in November,” McDaniel said. “You know how I know? Because when the media, the Democrats, everyone said in 2016 it couldn’t be done, the RNC and President Trump proved them all wrong. Victory in 2018 is possible because we have the best team in place. The RNC is in a stronger position than we’ve ever been.”

Privately, RNC officials and members are more candid about their election prospects given a president who has proved unable to stay focused on a single message for any length of time and who seems to enjoy generating chaos for its own sake. Further, they acknowledge that the results in November are far more likely to turn on whatever controversy Trump whips up in mid-October than any of their preparations right now.

“Who knows what he’s going to do?” said one RNC member on condition of anonymity.

Republicans said they are hopeful that the U.S. dialogue with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un can improve Trump’s poll numbers by persuading Americans that the president’s incendiary talk about nuclear weapons will actually result in a peace deal.

If that happens, and the economy remains strong through the summer, enough voters might decide that, despite their personal dislike for Trump, he’s doing a good job and Republicans should retain control of Congress.

“The question is: Can we make that ‘blue wave’ Democrats are talking about into a ripple?” said Ron Kaufman, the RNC committeeman from Massachusetts.

Regardless of November’s midterm results, RNC members made it clear they’re already looking ahead to support Trump’s re-election in 2020. By a unanimous vote with but a single abstention, they voted to abolish the debate committee that would have set the ground rules and schedule for presidential primary debates.

“Quite simply, we have no need for presidential primary debates,” said Jeff Kent, chairman of the RNC Rules Committee and the committeeman from Washington state.

That move was meant to make it harder for Trump critics within the party, like Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, to mount their own presidential bids. “It probably won’t discourage Kasich or Flake, but it does make it more challenging,” said Randy Evans, the committeeman from Georgia.

Hellreich agreed that Republicans have no need for presidential primaries in 2020. “Everybody’s happy with the president,” she said. “We’re excited to look ahead to the re-elect.”Harvey Weinstein plans to turn himself in to New York City law enforcement on Friday morning, The New York Times reported Thursday citing two unnamed law enforcement officials, along with other news outlets.

The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has been conducting a criminal probe into accusations against the disgraced former Hollywood producer.

Inspired by October exposes in The New York Times and The New Yorker, dozens of women began coming forward late last year with stories about the alleged sexual abuse and harassment they sustained at his hands. Reporters for the Times and The New Yorker ― Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey and Ronan Farrow ― received the Pulitzer Prize for public service earlier this year for their effort to expose Hollywood’s culture of abuse.

Their work is credited with sparking the Me Too and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct.

After the Times delivered the first devastating blow, Weinstein issued a bizarre statement quoting Jay-Z to apologize for his actions. He explained that they stemmed from growing up “in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.”

Since then, Weinstein has repeatedly denied engaging in any nonconsensual sex acts through his attorneys.

A number of women spoke out against Weinstein following the lead of Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Asia Argento, who were among his first public accusers.

Hollywood stars including A-list actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie began sharing stories that started feeling grossly similar to those told by women who agreed to be named in initial media reports. A pattern of abuse quickly emerged: Much of the time, Weinstein would use his position of power to lure individual young women to his hotel rooms, offices or other private spaces under the guise of speaking about work. Sometimes he would tell them another woman would be present in order to make his female guests more comfortable; the woman would either be completely absent or quickly leave.

Their accusations have ranged from uncomfortable sexual harassment to brutal sexual assault.

The charges against him are reportedly related to an accusation made by Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker the disgraced Hollywood producer forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting ostensibly on a work opportunity.

As part of its investigation, the NYPD also examined the alleged 2010 sexual assault of “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, The Wall Street Journal reported.

In 2015, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. let Weinstein off the hook for an alleged sexual assault by an Italian model, deciding there was insufficient evidence for charges after he allegedly groped her. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered the state attorney general to review the decision, which Vance has defended.

Weinstein was fired from the studio he co-founded, The Weinstein Company, in October 2017.Luck was not a lady for these gamblers.

Top takeaway? It’s best not to eat an entire spoonful of salt.Twitter users received an alert from the company on May 3 directing them to change their passwords. Bloomberg via Getty Images

Twitter is urging its more than 330 million users to change their passwords after it discovered a bug in its system that inadvertently stored account passwords in an internal log.

The company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, called the glitch an “internal defect.”

We recently discovered a bug where account passwords were being written to an internal log before completing a masking/hashing process. We’ve fixed, see no indication of breach or misuse, and believe it’s important for us to be open about this internal defect. https://t.co/BJezo7Gk00 — jack (@jack) May 3, 2018

Twitter users on Thursday received an alert from the company explaining the issue and directing them to their account settings so they could change their passwords.

In a linked blog post, the company apologized for the problem.

“We are very sorry this happened,” said Twitter’s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal. “We recognize and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.”

The company fixed the bug, deleted the stored passwords and launched an investigation that showed no signs of a breach or data misuse, according to Agrawal.

Still, “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said, it recommended that users change their passwords not only for Twitter but also for any other accounts with the same password.

Twitter said a bug caused users’ passwords to be stored in an internal log. Twitter

The bug affected a process called hashing, which Twitter uses to mask users’ passwords by cryptographically converting them to different number and letter combinations before storing them.

Twitter uses the masked passwords to validate users’ account credentials.

“This is an industry standard,” Argawal said.

However, the bug discovered by the company caused the passwords to be stored in an internal log before they were masked.

Argawal said that Twitter has “no reason to believe password information ever left Twitter’s systems or was misused by anyone” but recommended that users take extra steps to secure their accounts, including two-factor authentication and using different passwords for separate accounts.

He received some backlash from Twitter users after he tweeted that the company “didn’t have to” tell users that their passwords had been stored in plain text in its system.
