SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s 28-year-old sister will make her debut on the world stage when she visits South Korea to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics on Friday, Seoul’s Unification Ministry said.

Pyongyang notified Seoul that Kim Yo Jong would be accompanying Kim Yong Nam, North Korea’s nominal head of state, along with Choe Hwi, chairman of the National Sports Guidance Committee, and RI Son Gwon, who led inter-Korean talks last week, according to the ministry.

The inclusion of Kim Yo Jong in the delegation is “meaningful” as she is not only the sister of the country’s leader but a senior official at the ruling Workers’ Party, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

But the trip could provide a source of contention between Seoul and Washington, as she was blacklisted last year by the U.S. Treasury Department over human rights abuses and censorship, while Choe is subject to a travel ban under U.N. Security Council sanctions.

Kim Yo Jong is vice director of the party’s Propaganda and Agitation Department, which handles ideological messaging through the media, arts and culture. Choe had previously worked for the same organization.

Kim Yo Jong was seen in state media on Tuesday greeting a North Korean art troupe that has since departed for the South to stage performances during the Olympics.

“One of the positives of her visit is that she is someone able to deliver a direct message on behalf of Kim Jong Un”, said Shin Beom-chul, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul.

“What is problematic is that she’s coming with Choe Hwi. ... This raises worries that North Korea likely intends to use this Olympics as a propaganda tool rather than a possible opening to meaningful dialogue with South Korea.”

JUBILANT CHEERLEADERS

A group of 280 North Koreans arrived in South Korea on Wednesday, one of the largest peacetime crossings of the inter-Korean border, to spur on athletes from the two Koreas at the Winter Olympics starting Friday.

The delegation, made up mostly of a 229-member cheer squad, reached a border checkpoint by bus at around 0030 GMT, Seoul’s Unification Ministry said.

In addition to the cheering squad, there were 26 taekwondo performers, 21 journalists and four North Korean Olympics committee members, including Sports Minister Kim Il-guk, the Unification Ministry said.

After security controls the group left for the Olympics venue in the alpine resort town of Pyeongchang.

At a rest stop along the way, female members of the cheer squad, all donning black fur caps, red coats and ankle boots, waved and smiled at reporters who were trailing them.

“Hello, hello!” one said, giggling shyly before getting back on her bus.

When one reporter asked whether they were fully prepared, another member quipped: “You’ll know once you see. It’s no fun if I tell you everything now,” according to the South’s Yonhap news agency.

Their arrival comes a day after a North Korean ferry crossed the border carrying a 140-strong orchestra to perform during the Games.

Members of the orchestra were seen leaving the vessel for rehearsals at Gangneung Arts Center early on Wednesday, wearing the same outfits members of the cheer squad were seen in.

The orchestra is scheduled to perform at Gangneung, near Pyeongchang, on Thursday and in Seoul on Sunday.

Aside from the sports officials, the group will be housed at Inje Speedium Hotel & Resort, a four-star luxury hotel roughly two-hours drive from the Olympic venue in Pyeongchang.

Days before the group’s arrival, workers at Inje Speedium had placed banners around the premises welcoming the North Koreans, reading “We are one” and “welcome.”

Police have been deployed to enforce safety at the resort.

The taekwondo performance team is scheduled to hold four shows during their stay in South Korea. Two demonstrations will be held near Pyeongchang, while the team will travel to the capital Seoul for the remaining two.

OIL REQUEST

After the art troupe arrived on Tuesday in a ferry, which is also being used as accommodation, North Korea has asked South Korea to provide oil to refuel the vessel, the Unification Ministry said on Wednesday.

Oil is a sensitive item and has taken center stage in global efforts to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, with Washington calling for a drastic cut in energy supplies to the isolated country.

North Korea has virtually no domestic oil production, and has traditionally imported its fuel demand from China and Russia.

In December, the U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on the North, seeking to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to the country by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.

“There was a request for oil support during our discussions with the North after the ship arrived, and we’re reviewing it now,” ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a news briefing in Seoul.

Asked about concerns that South Korea was making exceptions to the sanctions, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said it was important not to let up pressure.

AdvertisementSteve Wynn has resigned as the CEO and chairman of the board of Wynn Resorts.

Wynn, 76, announced his resignation in a statement released late Tuesday night, according to NBC News.

“I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,” Wynn said in the statement. “As I have reflected upon the environment this has created ― one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts ― I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles.”

Wynn announced that Matt Maddox, the current president of Wynn Resorts, will take over his role as CEO.

The Las Vegas mogul’s ouster comes one week after he was accused of a decades-long pattern of sexual harassment and abuse toward workers at his casinos, according to The Wall Street Journal.

One day after the Journal reported on the alleged history of sexual misconduct, Wynn was forced to resign from his position as finance chair for the Republican National Committee, a position he had held for almost a year.

BREAKING: Steve Wynn steps down as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Wynn Resorts. pic.twitter.com/uDobVX2eiM — NBC News (@NBCNews) February 7, 2018

The Journal interviewed more than 100 current and former employees. They accused the billionaire of sexual misconduct ranging from lewd comments and intimidation to inappropriate touching and solicitation of sex acts.

A former manicurist at Wynn Las Vegas told the newspaper that Wynn pressured her into having sex with him despite objecting to his advances after she gave him a manicure in 2005. Wynn denied the accusation in a statement shared with HuffPost, but he reportedly paid the woman a $7.5 million settlement after she filed a report to human resources.

A former massage therapist at the spa in Wynn Las Vegas told the Journal she had felt pressured to agree to Wynn’s request to massage his penis to ejaculation, a practice that went on for several months. She said Wynn did not pay her more for the request. The massage therapist told the Journal that she eventually told Wynn she was uncomfortable with his requests. Wynn stopped requesting her for massages after that, she said.

Jorgen Gielsen, a former artistic director at the Wynn’s salon told the Journal that the salon’s employees were “petrified” of Wynn and would hide in bathrooms and closets when he approached.

A Wynn Resorts representative told HuffPost last week that the company requires its employees to receive annual anti-harassment training, adding that they also offer an anonymous hotline for harassment claims.

“Since the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that hotline regarding Mr. Wynn,” the representative said.

In his resignation statement, Wynn said that the “institution we created ... will remain standing for the long term. I am extremely proud of everything we have built at this company. Most of all, I am proud of our employees.”Disturbing footage reportedly captured in the aftermath of heavy Russian airstrikes on Syria’s Idlib province appears to show newborn babies being evacuated from a burning hospital and a small child being pulled from the rubble of a destroyed building.

NBC News shared the video on Twitter on Tuesday.

Russian jets launched a heavy airstrike bombardment on rebel held areas in Syria, resulting in one of the main hospitals, with newborn babies, being struck.

According to NBC, the bombed hospital is located in Maarat al Numan, a city in Idlib province, one of Syria’s last rebel-held strongholds. It was reportedly struck on Sunday as Syrian government forces, supported by the Russian Air Force, intensified its airstrikes in the region.

Idlib province endured as many as 150 airstrikes between Sunday and Monday, reported The Guardian, citing monitoring groups. The raids, which allegedly included chlorine bomb attacks on civilians, caused several deaths and dozens of injuries, advocates said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bodies of at least 11 people, including children, had been pulled from the rubble of destroyed buildings in Idlib city following the Sunday strikes.

On Tuesday, the United Nations urged for an immediate month-long ceasefire in Syria so it could deliver aid to conflict zones and evacuate the sick and wounded.

The UN’s International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said it was “extremely” troubled by the recent uptick in violence in Idlib province and rebel-held areas in the Eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, where hundreds have been killed in raids since the beginning of the year.

“Over the last 48 hours, the scale and ferocity of attacks [in Idlib and Eastern Ghouta have] increased dramatically resulting in multiple reports of civilian casualties and airstrikes that have reportedly hit at least three hospitals,” the commission said in a statement Tuesday.

“These reports are extremely troubling and make a mockery of the so-called ‘de-escalation zones’ intended to protect civilians from such bombardment,” said the commission’s chair Paulo Pinheiro in a statement, referring to promises Russia made to reduce violence in opposition-held areas including Idlib and Eastern Ghouta.

The surge in violence comes on the heels of the death of a Russian jet pilot who was shot down over Idlib province on Saturday.

“These reports are extremely troubling and make a mockery of the so-called ‘de-escalation zones’ intended to protect civilians from such bombardment,” said the commission’s chair Paulo Pinheiro in a statement, referring to promises made by Russia to reduce violence in opposition-held areas including Idlib and Eastern Ghouta.

The Syrian government and Russian military have repeatedly denied targeting civilian areas and facilities, despite reports suggesting otherwise. The government has also denied using chemical weapons in its attacks.WASHINGTON ― The Republican National Committee stood by its decision to keep donations from its former finance chair Steve Wynn, even as years of sexual misconduct allegations forced the casino magnate to step down from his company Tuesday night.

Wynn resigned as the RNC’s finance chair on Jan. 27 following a Wall Street Journal investigation that alleged he had engaged in serial sexual harassment and assault against employees at his Las Vegas casinos and properties over the years.

Last fall, the RNC vehemently pushed Democrats to return their donations from Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, a major donor to Democratic lawmakers, in response to his sexual abuse allegations.

Asked whether the RNC would do the same with Wynn’s money, chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Fox News last week that the allegations were “troubling,” but the party would only return his donations “if he is found of any wrongdoing.”

An RNC spokesman told HuffPost on Wednesday that the party’s position had not changed, pointing to a tweet from Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Ballhaus.

RNC spokesman says Wynn stepping down as CEO doesn’t change party’s decision not to return his donations unless a board investigation finds him guilty of wrongdoing. Wynn gave $375K to RNC late last year. https://t.co/79gwvtSKvc — Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) February 7, 2018

Wynn currently faces investigations from the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, and from his own company’s board.

The RNC’s defense of not giving back Wynn’s donations is similar to how it explained its support for other Republicans accused of sexual misconduct, namely Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and President Donald Trump. In each case, the RNC justified its financial aid because the men had denied the sexual harassment and assault allegations.

While announcing his resignation in a statement Tuesday night, Wynn continued to dismiss the allegations against him, claiming that he had become “the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,” and arguing that “a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts.”“Obtain and combine information to describe that energy and fuels are derived from natural resources and their uses affect the environment.

“Current scientific models indicate that human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, are the primary factors in the measured rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature.”WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calf.) spoke on the House floor for more than eight hours Wednesday, adamant she would not support an emerging long-term budget deal unless House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) commits to allow a vote on legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants. Such an announcement would be similar to the one Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made last month that helped reopen the government.

“If a Dream Act were brought to the floor, it would pass immediately, with strong bipartisan support,” Pelosi said Wednesday in a speech on the House floor. “The Republican moral cowardice must end.”

“Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support,” Pelosi added later in a statement.

Her speech set a record for the longest continuous remarks on the House floor. The record had been previously set in 1909, when a lawmaker spoke for five hours and 15 minutes, according to the House Historian’s Office.

Pelosi wrapped up her speech around 6:10 p.m., about eight hours and five minutes after she started.

Top Senate leaders are working to finalize a two-year budget deal that would boost defense spending sought by President Donald Trump as well as some domestic spending sought by Democrats. The House, meanwhile, passed a short-term bill on Tuesday that would extend funding for the government until March 23, but it is expected to be altered in the Senate ahead of a Thursday deadline.

As Pelosi delivered her speech in the House, McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced they had reached a budget deal, which Senate Democrats are expected to support because the Republican leader promised an upcoming immigration vote.

But its fate is uncertain in the House, where fiscal hawks oppose a spending increase and most Democrats want Dreamer protections to be part of the deal.

Trump put nearly 700,000 undocumented young people at risk of losing deportation protection and work permits when he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in September. He told Congress it had until March, when DACA recipients will begin to lose protections in larger numbers, to pass a bill to help them.

Pelosi shared personal stories of many so-called Dreamers, the term for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, on Wednesday and read aloud their words about wanting to remain in the U.S. The California Democrat delivered extended remarks, according to her rights as minority leader, which allow her to speak without a time limit on the House floor.

She and other Democrats have been calling for a vote on the Dream Act, a bill that would grant legal status to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, including DACA recipients. But Ryan, who controls the House floor, hasn’t allowed for a vote on the Dream Act or other bipartisan bills to help Dreamers.

“I don’t know when we’ll have another opportunity that matches today for us to just get a simple commitment from the speaker of the House that he will give us a vote,” she said. “There’s no guarantee. We’ll have the debate. People will weigh in. They will make their voices heard. Congress again will work its will.”

McConnell said on Tuesday that after Congress approves funding on Thursday, the Senate will have an open process for considering immigration legislation, allowing all members to present their ideas. But Ryan said he’ll only allow the House to vote on an immigration bill that Trump will sign.

“We’re not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesn’t support,” Ryan told reporters at a Tuesday news conference.

Trump said he would support a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers but is demanding measures that Democrats and even some Republicans oppose. Democrats have said they would support border security in exchange for Dreamer protections ― some of them even saying they would allow for Trump’s wall ― but draw the line on measures that would hurt asylum-seekers, including children. Democrats also oppose Trump’s demands to dramatically reduce legal immigration options by ending the diversity visa lottery and phasing out types of family-based green cards. Some Republicans also oppose cuts to legal immigration.

Many advocates believe the best chance for Dreamer protections is for Congress to pass what it can and then send it to the president, versus conforming to his demands that tank a deal.

Pelosi said Republicans who have put forward proposals have shown courage and Ryan should respect the fact that a large number of elected representatives want a vote.

“The speaker of the House is saying we don’t matter here, the members of the House,” she said. “We don’t count in this consideration. Because maybe we just don’t have the courage to do what we need to do. I believe we do.”

Calling for a vote isn’t enough, Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) argued Wednesday on MSNBC, hours into Pelosi’s speech. He said Democrats should continue to demand that Dreamer protections be a part of the spending deal rather than giving away leverage.

“If Democrats join with Republicans on this deal and lift the caps, what you will have is a collusion with Donald Trump to deport Dreamers,” he said on “MTP Daily.” “And I hope that does not happen.”

WASHINGTON ― Republicans think they have a bill to avert a government shutdown and significantly raise spending caps ― a bipartisan deal months in the making. But it’s not clear how much bipartisan support that bipartisan bill will actually draw, as House Democratic leaders were holding out Wednesday for assurances on an immigration bill.

Despite a good deal of opposition from conservatives in the House GOP conference, Republican leaders told members they were pressing ahead with another six-week continuing resolution that would raise spending limits by about $300 billion over two years, with only about $100 billion offset, allowing appropriators to write an omnibus bill that would fund the government at those new levels until October.

The deal would also include disaster aid funding, money to combat opioid abuse, some unspecified infrastructure funding, and an additional four years of money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program ― bringing CHIP funding up from six years to 10.

That’s a significant increase from the spending caps set in 2011, and many conservatives are likely to oppose the deal.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said he wasn’t just a no ― he was a “hell no.”

“To summarize it: This spending bill is a debt junkie’s dream,” Brooks said.

The deal would provide $80 billion above the spending caps for defense and $63 billion for non-defense for this year. For next fiscal year, it would provide $85 billion more for defense and $68 billion more for non-defense. The agreement would also set up $140 billion in war funding and $20 billion more for other emergency spending.

Freshman Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said the deal is proof that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was right about one thing: “The fiscal hawk has become more of an endangered species in the Republican Party.”

Pelosi, for her part, spent hours Wednesday morning and afternoon speaking on the House floor in a kind of pseudo-filibuster, calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to make the same sort of commitments that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made for Senate Democrats last month, when he said he intended to bring an immigration bill to the floor with a fair and open amendment process.

Pelosi said she was confident a bill to give legal status to so-called Dreamers ― that is, undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children ― would pass if Ryan would allow it to come to the floor.

“I don’t know when we’ll have another opportunity that matches today for us to just get a simple commitment from the speaker of the House that he will give us a vote,” Pelosi said.

A large number of Democrats have said they won’t support government funding bills without some sort of protection for Dreamers. McConnell convinced Democrats in the Senate to back off of that demand after a three-day government shutdown last month. But in the House, where Democrats don’t have the same filibuster power as their counterparts in the Senate, many of them still want not just a promise of a vote, but actual movement.

Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), a leader on immigration reform among House Democrats, said Wednesday on MSNBC that voting for a budget deal without Dreamer protections would amount to “collusion with Donald Trump to deport Dreamers.”

It’s clear House Republicans will need Democratic votes, but it isn’t clear how many Democrats will go along without those assurances. And the number of Republicans who oppose the deal will also affect how many Democrats are needed to pass the bill. If conservatives and other Republicans abandon the bill en masse ― like they did the last time there was a two-year budget deal ― there might not be enough Democrats even if Pelosi comes around.

“I think we would need votes coming from both ways,” Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) told reporters on Wednesday. “Pelosi probably won’t vote for it, but we did get a number of her members to vote for the last deal.”

The Senate is likely to vote first on this deal ― with McConnell either amending a spending bill sent over from the House on Tuesday or using a new vehicle ― but the deal is likely to be less of a problem in that chamber. The bill would then be sent over to the House, where a collection of Republicans and Democrats are likely needed to pass the measure. If it doesn’t pass, and absent another even shorter-term continuing resolution, the government would close down on Friday.

When HuffPost asked Brooks about conservatives potentially driving Ryan into making deals with Democrats, he suggested it was the responsibility of Republicans to hold the line on spending.What are your thoughts on the name? Kylie Jenner/Tyler Rose

Break out your umbrellas and put on your rain boots because Stormi (Scott? Jenner?) is here, people.

Kylie Jenner announced her baby girl’s name Tuesday and posted a sweet photo of her daughter in a pink outfit on Instagram. Stormi is her first child with rapper Travis Scott.

The name was an unexpected choice, since there were rumors the 20-year-old would name her daughter Butterfly, or Mariposa (Spanish for “butterfly”) after Scott’s song, “Butterfly Effect.”

A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Feb 6, 2018 at 1:14pm PST

But naturally, people on Twitter had a lot of thoughts about the newest addition to the Kardashian-Jenner fam.

The Kardashians must just close their eyes and point at the dictionary and whatever word they pick, they name their babies. #Stormi — Piques (@piques15) February 6, 2018

It’s been more than two years since we first met Krysten Ritter’s Jones, and it appears that Season 2 will pick up where we last saw her. Jones is still trying to piece together how she got her almighty strength, and what happened to her family ― both of which are touched on in the trailer.

Time to get some answers. pic.twitter.com/mw95uLyvDY — Jessica Jones (@JessicaJones) February 7, 2018

The formal synopsis for the second season notes that after the death of her tormenter, Kilgrave, Jones is “known throughout the city as a super-powered killer.” That suggests infamy is yet another factor she’ll have to contend with ― in addition to her inner and outer demons.

Old favorites from Season 1, like Trish Walker, played by Rachael Taylor; Malcolm Ducasse, played by Eka Darville; and Jeryn Hogarth, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, all make an appearance in the trailer. Notably missing is Rosario Dawson’s Claire Temple, and Mike Colter’s Luke Cage. Considering how Season 1 ended, this isn’t too surprising, but we’re keeping our fingers crossed regardless.

Also absent is David Tennant’s late character, Kilgrave. But, in true suspenseful fashion, there is a sinister and disembodied applause toward the end of the trailer. Perhaps he’ll make an evil return? We shall see.

The trailer’s release on Twitter has made many fans excited, and has even sparked some inter-superhero quarreling:

Got some free time if you’re still looking for a sidekick. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) February 7, 2018

“Sidekick.” Not “sidepiece.” — Iron Fist (@MarvelIronFist) February 7, 2018

Men... sometimes it’s just better when you do it alone. — Jessica Jones (@JessicaJones) February 7, 2018Hug the TV fan in your life, because it’s that time of year again.

As one season closes, another begins, and the networks are already looking ahead to their ever-so-packed fall TV slates. Not every show can make the cut, of course ― for every “The Good Doctor” there’s a “Marvel’s Inhumans” ― so it’s time to say goodbye to the dearly departed and celebrate those that get to live another day. Or two or three, if you’re the “Will & Grace” revival.

And, hey, even if your favorite show did get the ax, rest assured: It could be rescued, revived, or flat-out rebooted next season. The powers that be in TV have never been less about playing for keeps, as series now jump from networks to cable and streaming and back again.

Just look at “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” which Fox unceremoniously canceled this month only to have NBC save the series days later. Then, Fox picked up ABC’s scraps and revived “Last Man Standing” from the TV graveyard after months of fan outrage.

And if you’re an out with the old, in with the new type, ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and The CW have an entirely new slate of programming coming your way.

Here are notable series that have been either renewed, canceled, set to end after the current season or are still awaiting a pickup.

This is not a comprehensive list and we haven’t learned the fate of every single one of the HUNDREDS of shows that air each season. But as we learn more, we’ll be continually updating this list, so check back for the latest.

By his own sworn testimony, Levinsohn admitted to rating the relative “hotness” of his female colleagues in office banter as a vice president at a digital media company. He also testified that he speculated about whether a woman who worked for him there was a stripper on the side.

Two witnesses say they were shocked to see Levinsohn aggressively kissing and pressing himself against a woman at a glitzy music industry dinner in plain view of his subordinates and his clients. Levinsohn was married at the time.

Levinsohn once told an executive for the Hollywood Reporter he would not stay at the publication’s lunch honoring the entertainment business’s most influential fashion stylists because he would have to be surrounded by gays ― using a vulgar epithet for them, according to the executive.More than 19,000 children have been lured into combat since the war erupted in late 2013, according to UNICEF. Armed groups, including those loyal to the government, continue to recruit child soldiers in high numbers, despite numerous ceasefires and promises from South Sudanese leaders to stop arming kids.

In a report released this week, Human Rights Watch said this ongoing defiance of international agreements underscores a pattern of impunity in the country.

“By repeatedly failing to stop these abuses against children, South Sudan’s leaders have irrevocably damaged yet another generation and need to be held accountable,” said Mausi Segun, Africa director at HRW.Milo Ventimiglia made quite the splash on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Wednesday.

The “This Is Us” star played the game “Make It Rain” with Ellen’s DJ, Stephen “Twitch” Boss. To score some cash for the charity of his choice, Ventimiglia had to answer trivia questions. Of course, there was a big, wet caveat: To get the dough, Ventimiglia had to pull on various umbrellas to see which one rained money, while all the others dropped a bucket of water.

In the quirky sketch, Ventimiglia named the biggest drama queen within the “This Is Us” cast ― Sterling K. Brown, apparently ― and misspelled his own last name backwards.

Oh, and he got extremely wet. We’re talking SOAKED.

“I just wanted to make sure I was thoroughly more soaked than you,” Ventimiglia quipped at one point to Twitch.

WASHINGTON ― Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who Republicans portrayed as anti-law enforcement for discussing police racial bias and investigating troubled police departments, said GOP attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department show the Trump administration’s claimed support for law enforcement is hollow.

“I would hope that people will remember the way in which this administration has talked about, has treated the men and women in law enforcement during the Trump investigation, so that when they claim they are pro-law enforcement, that will be seen as the lie that it is,” Holder told HuffPost following the Christian Science Monitor Breakfast on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill have launched sweeping attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department in an attempt to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign. While some Republicans insist they’re only conducting routine oversight, others have compared the FBI with Russia’s KGB, and said investigators are worse than Watergate. Trump has accused an FBI agent of treason, and a Republican House member has called four top law enforcement officials “traitors to our nation” who should face charges.

Holder, who was attorney general under President Barack Obama, said his work at the Justice Department aimed to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the public by acknowledging and fixing longstanding problems. But the current attacks by Republicans in service of a political cause will do lasting damage to law enforcement, he said.

“I’m proud of the work that I did protecting cops, supporting cops, and also making sure that I did a lot to erase the trust gap that exists between people in law enforcement and communities of color,” Holder said. “I got criticized for that, but I was dealing with something I think is real. These guys, this administration, wants to wrap themselves in this notion of being for law enforcement, and their actions and their words show that they’re not.”

Holder cited recent polling suggesting that most Republicans now believe that the Justice Department and the FBI are out to get Trump.

“That is a shocking statistic that, A, is not true and, B, is a direct result of these anti-law enforcement things that the Trump administration has done,” Holder said.

Holder, who oversaw the FBI, said the idea that the bureau is hotbed of liberals would surprise those who work there.

“The notion that the FBI is a bastion of liberalism ― that you have wild-eyed left-wingers there running the FBI or populating the FBI ― is totally inconsistent with, again, these little things, these bothersome things called the facts,” Holder said.

While Trump has alleged that Holder “totally protected” Obama and has publicly wished his own attorney general would do the same thing, Holder said during the Monitor breakfast that Obama respected the traditional barrier between the White House and the Justice Department.

Holder said it “would be a good thing” for Trump “to have a relationship and treat the Justice Department in the same way that President Obama” treated it.

“President Obama and I are friends. But he also understood, as I understood, that there has to be a wall between the Justice Department and the White House,” Holder said.

Holder said there were things that he and Obama didn’t talk about, and that his “guess” is that there were more than a few decisions that Obama disagreed with. But he said he never heard criticism from the president, either publicly or privately.

Holder said Trump supporters’ attacks on the FBI could have long-term consequences, such as when jurors need to weigh the credibility of an agent’s testimony in a criminal prosecution. The attacks could raise doubts in a jurors’ mind that would have never existed, he said.

“The long-term negative collateral consequences are substantial,” Holder said. “I would hope the president would pull back.”“Deadpool 2” is expanding the Marvel universe.

Stars Ryan Reynolds and Josh Brolin released the two-minute trailer on their social media accounts Wednesday morning. The clip served mainly as an introduction of Brolin’s mutant character, Cable.

“I was born into war ― bred into it,” Cable said in the first seconds of the trailer. “People think they understand pain, but they have no concept of it. What’s the most pain you’ve ever felt? Maybe the kind that leaves you more machine then man.”

Deadpool’s antics and commentary takes over part of the teaser, of course. The anti-hero pauses Cable’s monologue to complain about the character being shown with a green sleeve rather than a mechanical arm.

“Why are the visual effects not done? It’s a metal arm, it’s not like we’re trying to remove a mustache!” Deadpool quips, referencing the Justice League’s much-discussed CGI removal of actor Henry Cavill’s mustache.

Yup, Deadpool seems to be as crude and irreverent as ever. Fans worried the character would be censored after the Walt Disney Company announced it would buy 21st Century Fox’s film and television divisions in December.

“[Deadpool] clearly has been and will be Marvel branded. But we think there might be an opportunity for a Marvel-R brand for something like Deadpool,” Disney’s CEO Bob Iger told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. “As long as we let the audiences know what’s coming, we think we can manage that fine.”

Reynolds let fans on Tuesday know “Deadpool 2” would soon arrive to theaters, posting a “Flashdance”-inspired poster that included the May 18 premiere.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned this week that Russia is already trying to meddle in the 2018 midterm elections. And the U.S. is inadequately prepared to counter that threat, he said.

Speaking to Fox News from Colombia on Tuesday, Tillerson said the U.S. has seen “certain behaviors” from Russia that could imply meddling ahead of multiple international elections, including the U.S. midterms.

“Really, I think it’s just important to continue to say to Russia, ‘Look, if you think we don’t see what you’re doing, we do see it and you need to stop. If you don’t, you’re just going to continue to invite consequences for yourself,’” Tillerson said.

He said the U.S. is no more prepared now than it was before the 2016 presidential election to prevent Russian interference.

“I don’t know that I would say we are better prepared, because the Russians will adapt as well,” Tillerson said. “The point is, if it’s their intention to interfere, they are going to find ways to do that. We can take steps we can take but this is something that, once they decide they are going to do it, it’s very difficult to pre-empt it.

Tillerson’s comments come on the heels of a January report by Senate Democrats detailing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts ― spanning decades ― to undermine democracy in the U.S. and Europe.

The report, released by Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned that the Kremlin will likely attempt to interfere in the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections, and urged President Donald Trump and his administration to take immediate action to counter these efforts.

“It is imperative that the American people better understand the true scope and scale of Putin’s pattern of undermining democracy in Russia and across Europe,” said the committee’s ranking member, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), in a statement. “This threat existed long before President Trump took office, and unless he takes action now, it will continue long after his administration.”

CIA Director Mike Pompeo also warned last month that Russia will almost certainly attempt to influence the 2018 midterm elections. “I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that,” Pompeo told the BBC.

He added, however, that he was “confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election [and] that we will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won’t be great.”

U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, said in a report last year that they had “high confidence” that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin used “an influence campaign” to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate [Democratic nominee Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,” the report said.

Trump, however, asserted in November that he doesn’t believe Russia interfered in the election ― because Putin said so.

“Every time [Putin] sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that,’ and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump said.

Last week, the White House chose not to impose new sanctions on Russia for its alleged 2016 meddling. The threat of sanctions was sufficient as a “deterrent,” it claimed.It looks like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is nearing a spending deal to avoid another government shutdown. Aaron P. Bernstein via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― As leaders from both parties closed in on a bipartisan agreement to raise overall spending caps, keep the government funded and potentially raise the debt ceiling, the most ardent Republicans and Democrats were trying to sink the deal Tuesday before it was even struck.

House Republicans passed yet another stopgap spending bill Tuesday night ― this time, one that would fund the Pentagon until October and other programs for six weeks ― by a vote of 245-182, with 228 Republicans and 17 Democrats voting yes, and eight Republicans and 174 Democrats opposed. Without a deal, the government is headed for another shutdown on Friday.

But the House measure isn’t expected to go anywhere in the Senate. The idea wasn’t so much to “jam” the Senate as it was to softly volley over legislation allowing lawmakers to strip the extended military funding and send it back to the House with a deal to significantly increase spending caps for two years ― adding more than $80 billion for defense per year, and $60 billion per year for non-defense programs ― while also possibly raising the debt ceiling.

That’s a deal House conservatives would hate.

“With those kind of spending numbers?” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) responded when asked if he would vote for the deal. Meadows made it clear he wouldn’t support it, and he estimated that Republicans would need at least 90 Democratic votes to get such a bill passed in the House.

When asked why Republicans would trust House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to come up with that many votes, Meadows said we were using the wrong term.

“Republicans?” he asked incredulously, refusing to acknowledge them as party colleagues.

When the question was narrowed to just Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Meadows said he guessed Ryan had a deal because it seems to be happening.

Meadows was hardly the only conservative to speak against the tentative deal. Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested headlines for HuffPost to make it clear he opposed the legislation. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said he hoped at least 200 Republicans would vote against such a deal. And Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) suggested that Congress couldn’t afford these caps increases.

“We’re broke!” Perry said.

But the most liberal Democrats were just as animated Tuesday. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), perhaps the strongest immigration advocate in Congress, said that if Pelosi made such a deal, it would be “a complete betrayal.”

“That would be tantamount to me, tomorrow, walking away and saying you can close down every Planned Parenthood facility in the country,” Gutierrez said, adding that he may never go to another Democratic Caucus breakfast if Pelosi cut a deal on spending caps without an agreement on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for so-called Dreamers.

Other Democrats signaled reservations about accepting a spending cap deal without DACA, but most who spoke to HuffPost tried to remain open to the idea. Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) said he would have to see what the deal looks like.

“I think DACA is not only a moral issue but an economic issue for our country,” Crowley said. When pressed on whether he needed movement on DACA to vote yes, he repeated that he’d wait to see what the deal looked like.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said he might oppose a deal on spending caps on the merits of increasing defense spending by so much, and he suggested he wanted action on DACA but was noncommittal ― as were John Lewis (D-Ga.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Mark Takano (D-Calif.).

Aides reported Tuesday night that, while they were close to a deal, they were still negotiating ― and the sudden shifts from the bases in the GOP conference and the Democratic Caucus may give leaders extra pause. But the prospect of no deal was just as perilous for lawmakers, as the Senate would still reject the House-passed “cromnibus” ― a portmanteau of “CR,” shorthand for “continuing resolution,” and “omnibus” ― and either send back the bill as another six-week continuing resolution for spending on all government programs or send nothing back at all.

If they did send back a clean, temporary extension, that bill could still face trouble in the House, as conservatives and some defense hawks have already staked out the position that yet another stopgap bill is unacceptable for the military.

So the clearest path toward preventing another government shutdown is still for Republican and Democratic leaders to find an agreement on the spending caps ― a deal that is certain to draw opposition from factions of both parties.

For Democrats, the prospects of a shutdown appeared less precarious Tuesday after President Donald Trump said he’d “love to see a shutdown” if Congress couldn’t agree on immigration. For many Republicans, still believing they got the better end of the last lapse in funding less than three weeks ago, there’s little reason the GOP should agree to such large increases in government spending on the non-defense side. Many Republicans believe if Senate Democrats block the House-passed bill to keep the government open and fund the military until October, it would come back to hurt them in tough races this November.

But there were still some centrist lawmakers in both chambers who liked the broad outlines of the deal and hoped it would come together quickly.TONIGHT: Trump's lawyers, fearing the President may lie to investigators, are urging him to refuse an interview with Robert Mueller. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/iTyNUESQyx — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 7, 2018

Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui offered a virtual hug to her LGBTQ fans this week, doubling down on her support of the community in a series of emotional tweets.

On Monday, Jauregui, who identifies as bisexual, retweeted a series of images that showed people who suggested they’d react with physical and sexual violence if their sons told them they were gay.

“This is such a disgusting display of toxic masculinity and a deep ignorance of the expression of human sexuality,” she wrote. “It is a spectrum that has no shame.”

This is such a disgusting display of toxic masculinity & a deep ignorance of the expression of human sexuality. It is a spectrum that has no shame. It will be painful but it will lead you to your true family. Anyone who can wish this on something they created is deeply troubled. https://t.co/urD1iosDEU — Lauren Jauregui (@LaurenJauregui) February 6, 2018

Jauregui’s tweet began a dialogue with fans and supporters, many of whom shared their own experiences coming to terms with their sexuality.

After one fan shared the particularly heart-wrenching experience of being told by a classmate to die as she was putting up Pride Club posters, Jauregui noted:

The star first addressed her sexuality in an open letter that Billboard published in 2016. Identifying herself as a “bisexual Cuban-American woman,” she went on to denounce the rampant misogyny that defined much of President Donald Trump’s campaign.An Alabama teenager says he had visions of walking with God after a traumatic brain injury pushed him to the brink of death.

Trenton McKinley, a 13-year-old from Mobile, claims he remembers walking through an open field with a shadowy, bearded figure during an apparent near-death experience. The teen said the vision proved to him that God is real.

“There is no other explanation but God,” McKinley told WALA-TV in a May 7 article about his dramatic recovery. “There’s no other way that I could have come back.

Near Death Experiences (NDEs) like the one McKinley describes are a subject debated among researchers. Some are convinced that NDEs have a scientific explanation. The visions could be caused by a spike in neural activity in the brain as it approaches death, for example.

But many of those who have experienced NDEs aren’t satisfied with a scientific explanation, saying that the spiritual nature of such moments are too numerous and widespread to discount entirely.

People who live through NDEs often relate stories about visiting an otherworldly realm, encountering a loving presence, or meeting long-lost loved ones.

McKinley’s recounting of what happened while he was in an impaired state of consciousness appear to contain some of these key elements.

The teen’s accident occurred in March, according to USA Today, while McKinley and a friend were playing with a dune buggy. McKinley was riding behind his friend, in a utility trailer pulled by the buggy. The friend suddenly hit the brakes, causing the trailer to flip over and throwing McKinley onto the concrete, head first.

According to his mother, Jennifer Reindl, the teen was rushed to the hospital with seven skull fractures. She claimed in a March 22 Facebook post that her son flatlined four times, including one instance that lasted 15 minutes.

McKinley said he experienced a vision of heaven. He said he recalled walking through an open field with a shadowy figure.

“I don’t remember faces. I saw a shadow and I was walking through a field with the shadow,” the teen told the Christian Broadcasting Network, an evangelical production company, on May 10.

He told CBN that in the vision, he was holding a baby in one arm. His mother told him it could have been a baby boy she had lost through a miscarriage.

“Mom thinks it could have been my little brother,” McKinley said.

Dr. Andrew Newberg, a physician at Jefferson University Hospitals in Philadelphia who studies how the brain functions during various religious and mystical experiences, told HuffPost that what McKinley described is in line with an NDE.

Newberg said that an NDE’s common core elements are a knowledge of one’s death, a tunnel experience, meeting others, feeling peacefulness, seeing a beautiful realm of light with beautiful nature scenes, coming to a decision (either on their own or through others that they meet) that one must go back, and then returning to life.

He believes NDEs can occur at the time of death, but can also occur in life-threatening situations. Still, he noted that many people who come back from life-threatening scenarios do not report an NDE.

“The problem is that the person is unconscious and cannot be spoken to in order to find out what they are experiencing and when,” Newberg said. “Further, it has always been difficult to know the exact state of the person. Just because the heart stops does not inherently mean that brain activity ceases. There are most likely many neurons in varying stages of dying, but they might still be functional in these states.”

Serious injuries can also spawn scams concerning NDEs, such as one perpetrated by an Ohio boy who was in a coma after a 2004 traffic accident. He regained consciousness and, in 2010, a book he wrote with his father ― The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven ― became a best seller. In 2015, the boy ― now a young man ―admitted he had made up his story of meeting Jesus and Satan.

Regardless of the details of McKinley’s NDE, the teen’s family has been heartened by his dramatic physical recovery.

Doctors reportedly told Reindl that there was little hope her son would ever recover fully. The mother said she signed a document that would have allowed for McKinley’s organs to be donated upon his death.

But shortly afterward, Reindl said hospital staff noticed that McKinley was able to move his hands and then his feet. Later on, he was able to open his eyes. The teen slowly began to heal ― recovering his memories and eventually shooting basketballs into a hoop at the hospital. In April, Reindl posted a video on Facebook of her son walking with the help of a nurse.

McKinley still has a long way to go. CBN reports that the child suffers from nerve damage and seizures. He also needs additional surgeries to help fix his fractured skull.

In the meantime, Reindl hopes McKinley’s story helps change lives.

“My hopes are that our story brings hope to any mother out there facing such odds,” she wrote on Facebook.

HuffPost reached out to Children’s of Alabama hospital for confirmation of Reindl’s story. The hospital declined to provide details about McKinley’s injuries and recovery, but confirmed that the teen was treated and released.

Newberg said there’s still much about NDEs that scientists have not figured out.

“There are too many aspects of NDEs that are not accounted for by any singular answer,” he wrote in an email. “However, NDEs might provide a unique opportunity to explore whether we have a soul or consciousness that can go beyond the body. If we can truly verify the anomalous experiences, then it could result in a paradigm shift in terms of how we scientifically understand the brain and soul.”

For his part, McKinley appears convinced that what he experienced in the hospital is proof of God’s love.
