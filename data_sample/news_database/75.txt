Trump appointee Mick Mulvaney appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday to discuss his record as acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the star of the show was seated behind him.

Dressed as Monopoly board game mascot Rich Uncle Pennybags, Amanda Werner of the nonprofit Public Justice spent the two-hour hearing quietly mocking Mulvaney as a defender of the rich. Take a look at some of Werner’s best material in the video above. We were particularly impressed with the use of multiple mustaches.

Since he was named to the top CFPB job in November, Mulvaney has not taken a single enforcement action against payday lenders, banks or any other financial firms. He has stalled the agency’s rule targeting abusive payday loans and put an investigation into the massive Equifax hack on ice. Mulvaney, who also serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget, is friendly with the financial industry and does not believe the CFPB should exist.

Earlier this week, Werner made an appearance at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Senate hearing dressed as a Russian troll. Werner previously donned the Monopoly Man outfit to attend a Senate hearing featuring former Equifax CEO Richard Smith.War authorization? Joshua Roberts / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― At a time when President Donald Trump tweets about potentially launching missile strikes against the Syrian government, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says the chief executive can do that without congressional approval.

“The existing AUMF gives him the authority he needs to do what he may or may not do,” Ryan said Thursday at a press conference.

He’s referring to the sweeping authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, that Congress passed in 2001. That measure, passed hastily in response to the 9/11 attacks, allowed then-President George W. Bush to attack anyone connected to al Qaeda, anywhere, at any time.

It never expired. For years, President Barack Obama stretched its legal limits by arguing it allowed him to go around Congress and take military action against the Islamic State, since the terror group is an offshoot of al Qaeda. Now, Ryan says Trump can go around Congress and use it to unilaterally bomb Syria.

This is not how the Constitution spells out Congress’ role in wars.

Lawmakers are constitutionally required to authorize any sustained military action. It was a stretch for Obama to use the 2001 AUMF to combat ISIS, but Trump can’t even argue that missile strikes on Syrian government targets have anything to do with al Qaeda. His action would be in response to President Bashar al-Assad’s latest suspected use of chemical weapons on his own people.

The Trump administration hasn’t even tried to claim he can take military action in Syria because of the 2001 AUMF. When Trump directed strikes on a Syrian government airbase in April 2017 ― the first-ever direct military strike by the U.S. against Assad’s regime ― the administration claimed he had that authority under his presidential powers because it was limited military action, not because of the Iraq War-era AUMF.

And as lawyers at the nonpartisan Protect Democracy argue, U.S. military action in Syria is unlikely to be limited to a single engagement. Instead, they say, it is likely to lead to larger and ongoing conflicts, which sounds a lot more like a war than a surgical attack.

But Ryan said that Trump can go ahead, and he signaled little appetite for Congress debating and passing a new AUMF more narrowly targeted to the Syrian situation ― even though it is literally their job to do that.

“The last thing I want to see is an AUMF that makes it much more difficult for our military to respond to keep us safe, because they have the authority to do that right now,” he said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) didn’t push back on the idea of Trump using the 2001 AUMF to bomb Syria, either, even as he noted, perhaps inadvertently, that the 17-year-old war authorization was never meant to be used to go after Assad.

“I think everyone knows we do have some American forces inside of Syria,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “My own view is they’re carrying out an important function and should stay there for the reason they were put there in the first place, which is to prevent [ISIS] from re-establishing [in] the eastern part of Syria.”

Congressional leaders have avoided action on a new war authorization for years for no real reason other than safeguarding lawmakers from a tough vote. But Trump’s casual hints at bombing Syria have rattled rank-and-file members in both parties, some of whom issued statements this week saying the president should not act without their sign-off.

“Assad must face consequences for the horrific atrocities he’s committed against the Syrian people,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). “But President Trump needs to finally lay out a Syria strategy and come to Congress for approval if he wants to initiate military action. He’s a president, not a king, and Congress needs to quit giving him a blank check to wage war against anyone, anywhere.”

“If he strikes Syria without our approval, what will stop him from bombing North Korea or Iran?” Kaine asked.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said the latest suspected use by Assad of chemical weapons on his people “absolutely” requires a U.S. response. But it must be constitutionally sound.

“If that response is going to include military force, the president of the United States should come to Congress and ask for authorization before military force is used,” he said.

“If he strikes Syria without our approval, what will stop him from bombing North Korea or Iran?” - Sen. Tim Kaine

The issue came up repeatedly Thursday during CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s Senate confirmation hearing to be secretary of state.

“We do believe the president has inherent authorities within the Constitution and as commander in chief,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) told him. “But it’s just not tenable to say we’re relying on an AUMF that goes back to 2001. That was 17 years ago. So, we would like to work with you on that.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) pressed Pompeo on Trump’s legal authority to take military action without congressional authorization. The War Powers Act allows a president to take unilateral military action in the event of an attack on the U.S. or if the country faces an imminent threat, he said, neither of which is the case regarding the Syrian regime.

“You’re asking me today to conduct complex legal analyses with legal conclusions,” said Pompeo, a Harvard Law School graduate. “I know it’s important, so I’m trying to do my best. At the same time, I want to make sure I parse the language correctly.”

Murphy’s time ran out to ask more questions, but he ended with a statement that was clearly on the minds of lawmakers in the room.You have to hand it to former FBI Director James Comey: He knows a good way to troll Donald Trump is to bring up the president’s reportedly small hands.

Comey touches on Trump’s hands in his new book, A Higher Loyalty, and admits the president’s mitts did appear smaller than he expected when they first met.

According to excerpts from the book posted by ABC News, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey said the 6-foot-3-inch Trump “appeared shorter than he seemed on a debate stage.”

Comey also wrote that when Trump reached out for a handshake, he couldn’t help but notice that the president’s hand “was smaller than mine” but added, it “did not seem unusually so.”

This is the type of comment liable to inspire a Trump tweet tantrum, as the president has long been sensitive to any suggestion his hands aren’t anything but “yuge.”

Trump even mentioned the issue during a 2016 presidential debate after Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a GOP primary challenger, made jokes about his hand size.

“Look at those hands, are they small hands?” Trump asked onstage. “And [Rubio] referred to my hands: ‘If they’re small, something else must be small.’ I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee.”

At 7.25 inches long, Trump’s hands are smaller than the U.S. male average of 7.63 inches, and 85 percent of American men have bigger hands than Trump, according to neuroscientist Justin Kiggins.

Comey also seems to have a very vivid visual impression about other aspects of Trump’s appearance, writing that his “face appeared slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coiffed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his.”

Comey snarkily adds: “I remember wondering how long it must take him in the morning to get that done.”

Although Trump likes to present an image of strength, Comey was not impressed by the president’s muscles.

WASHINGTON ― After adding more than a trillion dollars to the national debt in the first 15 months of the Trump administration, House Republicans ― still insistent that they care about fiscal conservatism ― tried and failed on Thursday to take a symbolic step toward amending the Constitution to prevent deficits.

The balanced budget amendment fell far short of the requisite two-thirds majority needed for passage, with 233 lawmakers voting for it and 184 against it. Supporting it were 226 Republicans and seven Democrats, while six Republicans and 178 Democrats voted no.

While Republicans will point to the failed vote as another example of the fiscal recklessness of Democrats, the no votes on the Republican side largely came from conservatives. Some of these naysayers argued that the amendment didn’t go far enough. Others said they viewed the vote as an attempt to depict the GOP as the party of fiscal restraint after the Republican-controlled Congress approved new spending and tax cuts that nonpartistan estimates predict will add trillions to the debt in years to come.

“Passing a weak constitutional balanced budget amendment only four legislative days after ramming through massive deficit spending is quite an audacious stunt,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told HuffPost, referring to the $1.3 trillion omnibus passed in late March. “My colleagues have already demonstrated with the passage of the omnibus that they aren’t serious about balancing the budget.”

Massie was among those voting against the amendment.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) voted for the measure, even while terming it political cover after the GOP’s spending spree for this fiscal year. “If you were serious about trying to prevent a very dangerous and debilitating bankruptcy of the United States of America, the votes were in February and March,” Brooks said, referring to the omnibus vote and an earlier continuing resolution setting the spending limits.

Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), the only House Republican to vote against the $1.5 trillion tax-cut bill passed late last year, told HuffPost that while he supported the amendment, Republicans had given up on true fiscal conservatism. “It’s not the party that I joined in ’92,” Jones said.

The amendment would have required Congress to balance the budget in five years, a goal that would require massive cuts to entitlement spending and likely some tax hikes. But, again, the amendment was never intended to be enacted. Instead, it’s a pure messaging vote after a year in which the Congressional Budget Office says Republicans packed on an additional $1.6 trillion in debt over the next 10 years ― and an additional $2.6 trillion if the new tax cuts are made permanent.

But as much as a handful of conservatives were willing to acknowledge the hypocrisy of the GOP’s actual legislative actions amid the party’s stated desires to balance the budget, plenty of Republicans defended voting for the omnibus and the tax cuts and the balanced budget amendment.

Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.), who voted for all three, used the familiar Republican rhetoric that the government has a spending problem and not revenue problem. He said a balanced budget amendment would force both sides to the negotiating table.

“It’s easy to vote for tax cuts,” Woodall said. “It’s hard to vote to cut spending. Voting for a balanced budget amendment allows members to recognize the truth of those things.”

But it’s difficult for lawmakers to recognize those truths when they reject nonpartisan analyses.

Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), for instance, refused to accept the CBO’s new projections, which forecast a return of trillion-dollar deficits and a national debt approaching $29 trillion over the next 10 years. Marshall called the budget scorekeeper “the worst financial adviser I’ve ever seen.”

When HuffPost raised the point that the CBO says the tax bill will add $194 billion just this year to budget deficit, Marshall rejected the claim. “They’re wrong on that one,” he said. “They don’t take into account at all what the growth in the economy is going to do.”

When HuffPost noted that the CBO did, in fact, take into account increased growth, Marshall still contended the CBO didn’t.Morning breaks over an industrial plant in South Carolina. Andrew Lichtenstein via Getty Images

With little notice, President Donald Trump ordered the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to dramatically overhaul national clean air standards and make it easier for industry to pollute in areas where it’s already dangerous to breathe.

The executive order ― titled “Promoting Domestic Manufacturing and Job Creation ― Policies and Procedures Relating to Implementation of Air Quality Standards” ― reverses an Obama-era decision. The 2015 decision allowed the EPA to intervene in states that fail to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards, forcing them to adopt federal regulatory plans to reduce ozone emissions that generally come from power plants, refineries and cement factories.



It opens the door to drastic changes in how science is used to set clean air rules, disqualifying huge amounts of peer-reviewed public health research in favor of industry-backed studies in a move that builds on steps EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has already taken.

The order requires the EPA to speed up reviews of state plans to reduce air pollution, setting a strict 18-month deadline, and complete reviews of all pre-construction permits for industry within a year. Construction permitting is primarily a state-level issue; the language in the order, critics say, appears to be a dog whistle to polluters, suggesting the EPA would pull back on any oversight.

“The purpose is that if states make determinations that are somewhat less than the rigor of what might be expected, EPA won’t second guess it,” Stan Meiburg, a former acting deputy EPA administrator who spent 39 years at the agency, told HuffPost by phone. “It’s a go-ahead for industry that if they take their best shot at states, the EPA won’t be getting in the way.”

The order instructs the EPA to consider what countries that don’t border the United States are doing to reduce pollution, allowing the agency to compare U.S. regulations to those in developing nations like China and India. It also directs Pruitt to allow states to trade pollution permits, a move environmentalists warn could make offsets nearly impossible to track and police.

“This is really just a backdoor attack on national clean air protections,” Frank O’Donnell, president of the environmental group Clean Air Watch, told HuffPost. “It is a polluter’s dream.”

In what could be the most controversial part, the order requires the EPA’s science advisers to consider the downside of cleaner air rules, something for which industry groups have clamored for years. They argue the policies could raise electricity costs and make things like air conditioning more expensive.

That directive is likely to prompt watchdog groups to sue. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2001, in a decision written by late Justice Antonin Scalia, that the EPA cannot consider the costs of implementation when setting air quality standards.

“That’s frankly illegal,” Meiburg said.

The order came as the Senate debated the nomination of Andrew Wheeler, the EPA’s newly approved deputy administrator, and environmentalists picked through a new letter from congressional investigators detailing fresh allegations of corruption against Pruitt.

“This memorandum helps ensure that EPA carries out its core mission, while reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing,” Pruitt said in a statement.

It marks the latest assault on clean air rules, putting poor people and communities of color particularly at risk. People living below the poverty line were exposed to 1.35 times more particulate matter than those living above it, according to a landmark EPA study released in February.

People of color breathe in 1.2 times more particulate matter pollution, and black people, in particular, are on average exposed to 1.54 times more particulate matter pollution than the general pollution. The National Association of the Advancement of Colored People released a report in February that found black people are exposed to air that is 38 percent more polluted than white people on average, and they are 75 percent more likely to live in communities abutting industrial sites.

“People who are most affected by air pollution are the most vulnerable and these policy changes would mean even less protection for those people,” Janet McCabe, who served as the assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation until 2017, told HuffPost by phone. “It could mean yet more pollution in their neighborhoods.”

“It is a polluter's dream.” - Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch

The order came nearly two weeks after the EPA announced plans to gut the only major federal rule to cut greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.

That decision reversed a 2012 compromise between the Obama-era EPA, automakers and California regulators, who have the right to set stricter emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, over tailpipe rules. California officials vowed to defend the existing standards.

The new order could put the administration at loggerheads with California regulators again. But the quiet rollout of the memorandum avoided swift criticisms. The California Air Resources Board told HuffPost the agency had not yet reviewed the ordered by Thursday afternoon.

On Friday, the agency’s chair, Mary Nichols, issued a statement calling the order a cave “to a minority of industries who claim Clean Air Act standards are too strict, too costly and too burdensome.”

“The truth is a large body of research shows the Clean Air Act dramatically improves public health, especially among our most vulnerable populations,” she said. “The consequences of inaction are irresponsible ― unhealthy people, shortened lives, and greater demands on our health care system.”

Ariana Grande and “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson are reportedly dating. According to multiple outlets, their relationship has “just started” and is “very casual.” Bossip was first to report the news.

Grande and Davidson have both recently split from their respective partners. Grande broke it off with rapper Mac Miller earlier this month, after two years together. Meanwhile, Davidson recently announced that he and comedian Cazzie David had gone their separate ways.

It’s unclear how the two first met, but in 2016, Grande hosted the late-night sketch series for the first time ― to much acclaim ― with Davidson by her side. (She’d also been a musical guest in 2014.) Davidson appeared during Grande’s opening monologue, in which she joked about having a “real adult scandal.”

“Do you want to smoke some pot or something?” he asked her on stage.

Davidson reportedly came to support Grande at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night, where she slayed a performance of her new single, “No Tears Left To Cry.”

“After Ariana’s performance, they were backstage and he had his arm around her,” an onlooker told People about the pair. “They seemed very lovey-dovey. He was hanging out with her and her friends with his arm around her. She seemed quite smitten.”

Earlier this month, Grande made a rare comment on her relationship status amid reports that she and Miller had split. In an Instagram post, Grande called the rapper, with whom she collaborated on 2013’s “The Way,” “one of my best friends in the whole world.”If your Uber ride lands you in an emergency situation, you’ll soon be able to alert 911 from within the app.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced the addition in a blog Thursday morning as part of what the company is calling a “safety center” that will live on the home screen during rides.

Critically, the 911 feature will display the car’s real-time location so riders can pass the information along to dispatchers. Uber will eventually provide that information directly to 911 dispatchers automatically, but for now, the ability only exists in Denver, where it’s being beta tested.

In addition to calling the cops, the safety center will let riders share their location and trip data with up to five contacts. Uber will share the company’s process for driver background checks and insurance information in that part of the app, as well as the community guidelines ― Uber’s list of actions that will result in riders getting banned.

Uber customers in India have had access to a similar panic button since 2015 after an Uber driver raped a woman in New Delhi. At the time, Uber said it had no intention of bringing the feature in the U.S.

“In the U.S., 911 is the panic button,” then Uber security chief Joe Sullivan told the Washington Post in 2016, adding it would be “a stretch” for the company to improve on pre-existing emergency alert infrastructure.

That’s the sort of mentality Khosrowshahi wants to move away from as he seeks to burnish Uber’s tarnished public image.

“The first thing that we want to do is really change Uber’s substance, and the image may follow,” Khosrowshahi told the Associated Press in an interview published Thursday. “The announcements that we’re making are just a step along the way of making Uber fundamentally safer for drivers and riders.”House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he had no regrets after announcing Wednesday that he would retire from Congress in January.

But Jimmy Kimmel didn’t quite see it that way. The late-night host, who previously skewered Ryan for pushing a controversial Republican insurance plan to replace Obamacare, figured Ryan will think about one missed opportunity.

“His only regret is not taking health care away from more poor people,” Kimmel said on his show Wednesday. “That will haunt him for some time.”This “A Quiet Place” parody beets them all.

On Tuesday, YouTube channel Media Muse published a fake trailer that splices scenes from “A Quiet Place” and “The Office” to create one hilarious mashup.

John Krasinski’s new horror film, which the former “The Office” actor directed and starred in alongside his wife Emily Blunt, made a lot of noise over the weekend. The mostly silent film about monsters that use sound to prey on humans raked in $50 million at the domestic box office. But, as fans quickly pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t the first time Krasinski has starred in something in which no one makes a peep.

The movie reminded many of an episode of “The Office” called “Trivia,” in which the staff at fictional paper company Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton branch attempt to beat their office’s longest silence streak.

With this in mind, Media Muse created a very funny trailer that combines the two and adds clips of two of the spookiest characters from “The Office”: Dwight and his cousin Mose Schrute on their beet farm.House Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision not to seek re-election has dramatically increased Democrats’ chances of flipping Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District.

And this year, Democrats do not lack candidates capable of mounting a serious bid for the seat.

Chief among them: Randy “IronStache” Bryce, a union ironworker and Army veteran, whose internet fame and fundraising prowess have already nabbed him the endorsement of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Democrats’ head start in a district where their odds have suddenly improved demonstrates the importance of recruiting and supporting strong candidates even in deeply Republican territory.

“Run strong candidates everywhere, because you never know what’s gonna happen. If you do that, you can take advantage of situations like this,” said Mike Mikus, a Pittsburgh-area Democratic campaign consultant who has worked for the DCCC.

Jesse Ferguson, an alumnus of the DCCC as well as Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, noted that even without unexpectedly positive circumstances, there is nothing to lose and everything to gain from running candidates in tough seats.

“You don’t win a fight if you don’t show up for it,” Ferguson said. “By having candidates in these districts, we might have a shot to win in a place we didn’t think we would ― or we might have a shot to make our case and convince some voters even if we come up short.”

This year’s series of fortuitous electoral coincidences make that an obvious takeaway for Democrats.

Months before Ryan’s resignation, Democrats found themselves in a suddenly competitive fight for an open U.S. Senate seat in Alabama after it emerged that Republican candidate Roy Moore had pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls. Having former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones in the contest allowed Democrats to take advantage of changing circumstances. (Jones went on to win his race in December.)

And a state supreme court’s redrawing of the Pennsylvania congressional district boundaries in February suddenly made the Keystone State ripe for a raft of Democratic pickups.

But as recently as 2016, the national Democratic Party did not even try to compete in many districts, including some that were genuinely competitive.

For example, former Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican whose October resignation from Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District paved the way for a Democratic special election win in March, ran unopposed in 2014 and 2016.

Murphy would likely still have won in those election cycles, according to Mikus.

However, if the party had paid more attention to the district and run better candidates against Murphy in “the 2006 and 2008 wave years when other Republicans in the area were being defeated,” he would have been eminently beatable, Mikus ventured.

Hey @SpeakerRyan, I'm a man of my word. Here's an application for Ironworkers Local 8: https://t.co/gKaHh4geZ3 pic.twitter.com/DbKMJOXFkw — Randy Bryce (@IronStache) April 11, 2018

No official Democratic Party organ tried to recruit Bryce, according to Lauren Hitt, his campaign’s communications director. Instead, it was the Working Families Party, an electoral organization that functions as a progressive faction of the Democratic Party, that approached him about running.

Bryce, who was active in his local union’s political work, was initially skeptical of the opportunity, recalled Rebecca Lynch, political director of the Wisconsin Working Families Party. At that point, Bryce had already run for state and local offices three times and lost.

But Bryce, who eventually relented to the Working Families Party’s entreaties, immediately drew a positive response. He became famous overnight in June after announcing his candidacy in a viral introductory video that depicted his struggle to care for his chronically ill mother.

The image of a burly hard hat-clad ironworker taking on a polished Ryan, the GOP’s chief apostle of trickle-down economics, proved to be an irresistible formula for the Democratic Party’s energized grassroots.

Bryce has since raked in $4.75 million in donations ― 75 percent of it in increments of $200 or less, according to his campaign. (The latest official financial disclosures, which date to the end of 2017, show him with a $2.7 million haul.)

“There is a need to make space at the table in the Democratic Party for candidates that represent working people who would normally not be recruited to run for a seat like this by XYZ establishment organization.” - Rebecca Lynch, Wisconsin Working Families Party

And in an era of ideological division, Bryce’s bid has earned the backing of both establishment-aligned groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America and End Citizens United, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and more left-leaning outfits like Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America.

“Was Bryce and his energy and resources the main reason Ryan is calling it quits? Probably not,” said Zac McCrary, a partner at ALG Research, a top Democratic polling firm. “But did it contribute to his decision by putting that seat in play in a way it hasn’t been in decades? Absolutely.”

For Lynch, Bryce’s ability to defy the standard candidate formula not only gives a boost to Democrats, but also the party’s progressive wing, which has sometimes fought for the party to get behind candidates without deep pockets and a more traditional pedigree.

“There is a need to make space at the table in the Democratic Party for candidates that represent working people who would normally not be recruited to run for a seat like this by XYZ establishment organization,” Lynch said.

Democrats still face challenging odds in southeastern Wisconsin’s 1st District, which encompasses the cities of Kenosha and Racine, along with more rural areas and Ryan’s hometown of Janesville.

Barack Obama narrowly won the district, albeit when it had slightly different borders, in 2008. And Donald Trump beat Clinton there by about 10 percentage points in 2016, making it well within Democrats’ reach in a wave year. (By contrast, in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, where Democrat Conor Lamb eked out a win in a March special election, Trump won by nearly 20 points.)

Now the party has the benefit of both an energized voter base and at least one candidate in the district with a sophisticated organization and substantial name recognition, according to McCrary.

“You have now a Democratic candidate there very far advanced in terms of running a race, whereas you have Republicans there back to square one,” McCrary said.

Indeed, with the departure of Ryan, who has held the district since 1998 and had already raised some $11 million, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report downgraded the district from “Solidly Republican” to “Lean Republican.”

With a few short months to go ahead of the Aug. 14 primary, Democrats hope that state Republicans become mired in an expensive contest for the GOP nomination. Prominent Republicans rumored to be considering a run in the district include Wisconsin state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hails from the district, and former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, a longtime Wisconsin GOP power broker.

However, Bryce is also not alone in the Democratic field. Cathy Myers, a public school teacher, school board member and local union leader, is competing in the race, though she has thus far failed to develop anything comparable to Bryce’s level of national attention or campaign funds. Myers has accused the DCCC of sexism for endorsing Bryce as part of the party’s “Red to Blue” program targeting GOP-held seats.

And with a June 1 deadline to get on the ballot, there is still a chance for other candidates to jump in as well.

Let's replace Paul Ryan with a mom & a teacher who can win!

Republicans are eager to paint Bryce as too liberal for the district. Bryce’s support for “Medicare for all” and recent announcement that he backed the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency put him firmly on the party’s left wing.

“With positions like those, it sounds like he’d be a better fit for San Francisco than Janesville,” deadpanned Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens.

Ferguson argued that Bryce’s progressive views at the very least are not a liability.Alton Sterling, left, and Antonio “Tony” Sterling. Reuters/Facebook

A Louisiana man found dead under suspicious circumstances has been identified as a relative of Alton Sterling, a black man whose death sparked heated protests across the country after a white police officer shot him at close range.

Baton Rouge police on Thursday said firefighters were battling an automobile blaze in a vacant lot around 4 a.m. Wednesday when they discovered the body of 34-year-old Antonio “Tony” Sterling. The body, authorities said, was found in the backseat of the vehicle.

Police spokesman Sgt. Don Coppola Jr. told HuffPost Antonio Sterling “is related to Alton Sterling.”

Sandra Sterling, an aunt of Alton Sterling, told the local newspaper The Advocate that Antonio and Alton Sterling are cousins. She said they were often referred to by family and friends as “the Sterling boys.”

Alton Sterling, a father of five, was fatally shot July 5, 2016, outside a Baton Rouge store where he frequently sold CDs. Bodycam footage shows Officer Howie Lake II wrestling Sterling to the ground, and later Officer Blane Salamoni shooting him multiple times at close range in the back and chest.

The Louisiana Attorney General’s Office last month announced it would not pursue charges against Lake or Salamoni. That decision was announced 11 months after the Justice Department, citing a lack of evidence, decided not to pursue federal civil rights charges against the officers.

Salamoni was ultimately fired over the shooting, and Lake had received a three-day suspension.

A cause of death for Antonio Sterling is unknown and pending autopsy results, Coppola said.

Anyone with information on this incident is urged to contact the Violent Crimes Unit at 225-389-4869 or Crime Stoppers at 225-344-7867.An observation made by one eagle-eyed Twitter user has “Star Wars” fans taking note of a heartbreaking connection between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.

Luke’s story in “Episode IV: A New Hope” kicks off with a projection of Leia desperately asking for help. He embarks on a mission to do so with Obi-Wan Kenobi, setting in motion the sci-fi saga as know it today.

(Warning: “Last Jedi” spoilers ahead.)

Forty years later, “Episode VIII: The Last Jedi” ends with Luke using a force projection to help Leia and ultimately sacrifice his life.

Talk about full circle.

Just realized that Luke Skywalker's story begins with Leia sending a projection of herself asking for help, and ends with Luke sending a projection to help Leia. pic.twitter.com/VdMXcFyvco — JM McNab (@jmmcnabagain) April 11, 2018

For more context, those who haven’t seen “A New Hope” in a while might not remember that Leia sends a projection of herself to Obi-Wan Kenobi begging him to take the Death Star plans, which she’s stolen, and bring them back to her home planet of Alderaan for her father to analyze. The projection and the stolen plans were stored in R2-D2, an astromech droid, who then fled and ended up on the planet of Tatooine.

While on Tatooine, he is found by Luke. When R2-D2 goes missing, Luke looks for him and finds Obi-Wan.

In “The Last Jedi”, Luke uses an astral projection in an effort to fool Kylo Ren into thinking he’s actually on Crait instead of the planet Ach-To. When Ren and Skywalker engage in a lightsaber duel, Skywalker’s projection is struck. An exhausted Skywalker, actually on Ach-To, then dies ― all in an effort to help Leia and the Resistance.

The tweet from user @jmmcnabagain pointing out this comparison has gone viral, with many remarking on how good of a catch it was:

If this observation wasn’t emotional enough (because R.I.P., Luke Skywalker), then it only gets worse when you consider that Carrie Fisher’s Leia will never get to come back and rise up with the Resistance as she planned.

Had she lived, Lucasfilm chief Kathleen Kennedy said, the next part of the saga ― “Episode IX” ― would have been “her movie.”

“She was having a blast,” said Kennedy in an interview with Vanity Fair last year.

“The minute she finished, she grabbed me and said, ‘I’d better be at the forefront of “IX”!’ Because Harrison [Ford] was front and center on ‘VII,’ and Mark [Hamill] is front and center on ‘VIII.’ She thought ‘IX’ would be her movie. And it would have been.”AZCHET: As the doctor bills started to come in, me and my wife were worrying on how we are going to pay for these doctor bills.

TRUMP: It’s beautiful.WASHINGTON — Secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo is well-known for his militaristic foreign policy stances and for his cozy relationship with President Donald Trump. As a member of Congress, Pompeo railed against a diplomatic agreement with Iran. As CIA director, he floated the idea of regime change in North Korea. During the early months of his presidency, Trump reportedly asked for Pompeo’s help in scuttling part of the Russia investigation.

But during his confirmation hearing on Thursday to be the nation’s next secretary of state, Pompeo tried to convince Democratic lawmakers that he was a forceful advocate for diplomacy over military action and that he would remain independent from the president. To make this pitch, Pompeo was forced to reverse several of his previous publicly stated positions — or claimed to have forgotten them altogether.

Over and over again, during exchanges with various members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pompeo dodged questions about his most controversial stances, the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference, his relationship with the president, and how he plans to counter America’s adversaries.

Rescinding the Iran Deal

Shortly after Trump won the election, Pompeo celebrated the opportunity to kill the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries. “I look forward to rolling back this deal with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” he tweeted in November 2016.

Following Trump’s lead, Pompeo has since adjusted his stance on the Iran deal. Instead of threatening to walk away from the agreement outright, Pompeo told senators on Thursday that he was committed to working with the other countries that are party to the deal and fix what he and Trump have described as its flaws. Specifically, Trump and Pompeo want to remove “sunset” provisions that allow some of the limitations on Iran’s nuclear program to expire, and to tie Iran’s ballistic missile program to the nuclear deal.

The problem with this plan it requires the United Kingdom, France and Germany to go along with a U.S. effort to unilaterally rewrite the terms of the deal — and for Iran, China and Russia to accept those new terms. So when Pompeo told lawmakers he wanted to “fix” the agreement rather than kill it, he was making a distinction without a difference. That became clear when Sen. Ben Cardin (D- Md.) asked Pompeo what he thinks the U.S. should do if there is no new deal by May 12, the next time Trump has to waive sanctions against Iran or risk tanking the agreement.

“I can’t answer that question,” Pompeo said. “I want to fix this deal. That’s the objective.”

Regime Change In North Korea

As CIA director, Pompeo has openly mused about the U.S. overthrowing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“I am hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system … The North Korean people, I’m sure, are lovely people and would love to see him go,” Pompeo said of Kim last July.

In October, Pompeo answered a question about what would happen if Kim died by making a quip about the CIA’s history of assassination attempts. “Someone might think there was a coincidence if, you know, there was an accident,” Pompeo said, speaking at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish think tank in Washington.

But when Cardin asked if Pompeo advocated for regime change in North Korea, Pompeo appeared offended by the suggestion. “I have never advocated for regime change,” he said.

Questioning The Russia Investigation

In March 2017, during a meeting at the White House, Trump asked Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to intervene and get then-FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the bureau’s Russia probe, The Washington Post reported last year.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked Pompeo on Thursday to confirm the Post’s reporting. Pompeo first refused to answer questions about his private conversations with Trump. Then he said he didn’t “recall” whether Trump had asked him to intervene in the Russia probe. Pressed further, Pompeo said Trump had “never asked me to do anything I considered remotely improper.”

But Pompeo, who confirmed that he has been interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller, did not deny outright that Trump had asked him to interfere in Comey’s investigation.

“Pompeo said he didn’t “recall” whether Trump had asked him to intervene in the Russia probe.”

At the CIA, Pompeo developed a close relationship with Trump and sometimes appeared to support the president’s characterization of the Russia investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt. Last October, Pompeo met with William Binney, a former National Security Agency official-turned whistleblower who claims that the DNC hack was an inside job rather than an attack by Russia. That same month, Pompeo incorrectly claimed that U.S. intelligence agencies had found that Russian election interference did not alter the election’s outcome — a statement that contradicted the intelligence community’s public reporting, which said it considered such a conclusion outside the scope of its investigation. A CIA spokesman later had to clarify that Pompeo did not mean to suggest that the intelligence community’s assessment had changed.

By the end of the hearing, Democrats were practically begging Pompeo to tell them that he disagreed with Trump’s repeated attacks on Mueller. Each time, Pompeo refused to engage.

Asked by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) if he would resign if Trump fired Mueller, Pompeo said, “My instincts tell me no.” Pompeo also declined to comment on the legality of the president firing the special counsel.

Islamophobia And Homophobia

Throughout his political career, Pompeo has worked with some of Washington’s best-known Islamophobes. He has appeared multiple times on a radio show hosted by Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist who has praised white nationalists on his show and said that Muslim members of Congress shouldn’t serve on sensitive committees because they might leak information to the Muslim Brotherhood. Pompeo has also attended events put on by Act for America, a group that opposes the construction of mosques and frets about Sharia law. The group’s founder, Brigitte Gabriel, claims that Islam is an inherently violent religion.

Asked by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) if he ever called out Gaffney or Gabriel for their comments about Muslims, Pompeo said he could not remember every statement he had made in his 54-year-long life. But he assured Booker that he did call out Fred Phelps, the now-deceased anti-gay preacher in Kansas who was behind the website www.godhatesfags.com.

Pivoting to Phelps was a curious strategy for Pompeo, who has made homophobic remarks. When Booker asked Pompeo whether he believes that being gay is a “perversion,” Pompeo said he continues to believe that same-sex couples should not be allowed to get married.

Pompeo told Booker that despite believing that LGBTQ people should have fewer rights than straight people, “his respect for every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation, the respect is the same.”

View Of WikiLeaks

Like Trump, Pompeo was a big fan of WikiLeaks during the presidential campaign. “Need further proof that the fix was in from Pres. Obama on down? BUSTED: 19,252 Emails from DNC Leaked by Wikileaks,” Pompeo, then a congressman, tweeted in July 2016 from an account that is no longer active.

Asked by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) if he agreed that WikiLeaks is a hostile nonstate actor, Pompeo said that he did.

Prospects for Confirmation

It’s too early to tell whether Pompeo’s testimony will convince enough skeptical senators to support his nomination. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has already said he intends to vote against Pompeo. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is battling brain cancer, is not expected to return to the Senate before the vote. That means that if Paul and every member of the Democratic caucus put up a united front against Pompeo, they could tank his nomination.

It’s far from certain that every Democrat will vote against the secretary of state nominee, however. Last year, 15 members of the Democratic caucus voted to confirm Pompeo to run the CIA, a job that is arguably higher-stakes and comes with less oversight. This time, he’s likely to win over at least a few moderates who are up for re-election this year, like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) or Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.).

But Democrats are under intense pressure from human rights groups to block both Pompeo and Gina Haspel, who has been nominated to replace Pompeo at the CIA. There are already some indications that the pressure is working.

“I voted YES on Pompeo for CIA on the theory that he would be the ‘adult in the room.’ I was wrong,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted on Wednesday. “I am voting NO on Pompeo for Secretary of State because our top diplomat should believe in diplomacy. He has an alarming tendency towards military provocation and brinkmanship.”Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in California attempted to force a visibly injured and disoriented man to cross the border into Mexico after deciding he looked Mexican, according to a video obtained by NBC News.

The video was captured by an unnamed videographer at the U.S.-Mexico border in Calexico, California, in March 2017 and published by NBC on Wednesday.

The clip shows two U.S. Border Patrol agents accompanying a handcuffed man, who was barefoot and appeared to have an injured leg, to the border so he could go “back to his country” — but they were stopped by Mexican border agents who insisted the man would have to be processed through the Mexican consulate on the U.S. side before he could be repatriated.

As NBC News noted, a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Mexico mandates that repatriation is done through the consulate, where unauthorized immigrants are fingerprinted and their identities are verified.

“You know you can’t take him out through here,” a Mexican agent is seen telling the two U.S. officers before directing them to take the man to a Mexican consulate.

“Why would I have to call the consulate?” one of the U.S. agents responded. “He’s not in my custody.”

Even as the other officer removed the handcuffs from the man, the first agent continued to insist that he was not in their custody. “He’s not with me,” the agent said, insisting that he was doing the man “a favor.”

It soon becomes clear in the clip that the U.S. agents did not know for certain whether the man, described by NBC as “mentally unstable,” was in fact from Mexico.

“I think he’s Mexican. He’s going back to his country ... He looks [Mexican],” the same U.S. agent said, identifying himself as a 20-year Border Patrol veteran.

According to NBC News, the U.S. agents later left the man “at a park” on the U.S. side of the border and “lost track of his whereabouts.” A month later, border agents reportedly apprehended the same man as he attempted to enter the U.S. from Mexico. This time, the man was taken to a Mexican consulate, where officials confirmed that he was a Mexican citizen who’d been arrested multiple times for unauthorized entry into the U.S.

A Customs and Border Protection official told HuffPost on Wednesday that the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility had investigated the incident shown in the video after the agency was notified of the clip’s existence by the Mexican consulate.

The office then “addressed the agents’ actions,” the official said, without elaborating. NBC News reported that the two agents were “reprimanded” over the incident but remain on the job.

“CBP is committed to treating everyone with professionalism, dignity and respect while enforcing the laws of the United States,” the official told HuffPost. “CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of Vigilance, Service to Country and Integrity.”

Immigrants’ rights activists reacted to the video with horror this week. Kerry Kennedy, president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, called the action of the agents in the clip “reprehensible.”

CBP has characterized the incident in the video as an “isolated” case, but a recent survey by the American Immigration Council suggested otherwise.

According to the survey, which documented the responses of 600 immigrants who were deported back to Mexico between August 2016 and April 2017, almost 60 percent of respondents said they were not given repatriation documents even though officials are required, under CBP policy, to provide them. Many respondents also accused U.S. agents of not advising them of their right to seek asylum and of using coercive tactics to get them to sign deportation documents.

“Mexican migrants suffer a host of violations, abuses, and ill-treatment while in the custody of U.S. immigration authorities,” the American Immigration Council concluded in their report. “Without being fully advised of their rights or having the opportunity to freely exercise them, migrants may face unjust deportation and lose the ability to ever seek legal admission or apply for asylum in the future.”

Activists have expressed concerns that the rights of immigrants will be further impinged upon as President Donald Trump’s crackdown on unauthorized immigration intensifies. On Wednesday, the Southern Poverty Law Center renounced the Justice Department’s decision to temporarily halt a program that provides legal information to detained immigrants.

“Keeping immigrants uninformed and in the dark about their options serves no one except an administration with an agenda to railroad vulnerable individuals out of our country by refusing to provide them with basic information and access to the legal process that is a cornerstone of our democracy,” the advocacy group wrote.“Roseanne” star Emma Kenney is seeking treatment to address her “battles.”

The 18-year-old actress, who’s one of the few newcomers on ABC’s hit revival of the beloved sitcom, revealed that she’s taking time out of the spotlight to deal with unspecified issues.

“I was running with a really fast crowd. I was being naive and very immature, and I was doing things I should not be doing because it was illegal and I’m not 21,” Kenney said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. “It wasn’t healthy, and it was making me feel even worse — anxious and depressed. It was just a slippery slope that I did not want to go down. And I knew that I needed to stop it.”

“I want to be the healthiest, best Emma that I can be, and I know that by going to treatment that’s what’s going to happen, and I’m going to continue on that positive road,” she continued. “I just want to send a message to my fans saying that it’s OK to admit that you need help, and it doesn’t make you weak. I’m going to come out on the other side, the True Emma that I’ve always been.”

Kenney has also starred on the Showtime series “Shameless” for the past eight seasons as Debbie Gallagher, the youngest daughter of William H. Macy’s troublesome brood living on the South Side of Chicago. She was cast on the long-running series when she was just 12 years old and has been acting since 2008.

The actress maintains that her struggles have never affected her work, but admits to In Touch Weekly that she would go to “clubs and bars with older friends in Hollywood” and have the “occasional wild night out” to deal with the stress.

“I’m going to be seeking treatment for my battles,” she said. “I’m going to work through it. I’m going to get help and make better choices.”

On Tuesday, Kenney announced she won’t be posting for the time being on her various social media accounts, writing, “Hello & goodbye (for a bit) I’ve decided to take a break from social media and LA for a minute. This sounds so cliche but this town/industry can really get to you. going to re-find my peace happiness.”

Unfortunately for the Bravo TV personality, using technology to find love is turning out to be harder than he’d imagined.

Cohen dropped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Thursday and revealed that he keeps getting kicked off the gay dating app Chappy for an unlikely reason.

“They think I’m impersonating Andy Cohen,” he told DeGeneres. “They’re like, ‘Your photos don’t meet our guidelines.’ And I keep trying to [explain], 'No! It is me!”

Though Cohen didn’t name the app in the interview, he tweeted Thursday:

DeGeneres reminded Cohen that he did, in fact, have a chance encounter with a prospective suitor recently. On Sunday’s episode of “Watch What Happens Live,” an audience member asked him on a date while on the air.

The 49-year-old Cohen, however, thinks the unnamed male, who hinted that he may be around 25 years old, “might be too young.”

DeGeneres agreed. “It for sure is too young,” she quipped.

Cohen, who’ll return as the host of FOX’s “Love Connection” when the second season kicks off May 29, confirmed that he’d split from boyfriend Clifton Dassuncao ― whom he once referred to as “Brazilian Andy Samberg” ― in March.LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office is reviewing a 1992 sexual assault accusation against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, authorities said on Wednesday.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement that the alleged incident involved an adult male.

The sheriff’s department said it began investigating the matter on Dec. 11 last year and presented its results to the district attorney last week, five months after Spacey was fired from Netflix political drama “House of Cards” over sexual misconduct accusations.

“A case was presented April 5 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department,” Los Angeles District Attorney spokesman Greg Risling said in an email to Reuters. “It’s under review.”

A spokeswoman for the actor, Laura Johnson, declined to comment.

The nature and origin of the sexual assault accusation was not disclosed. It was unclear if California’s statute of limitations on prosecuting criminal sexual assault, which is normally 10 years, would apply.

More than 30 men have said they were victims of unwanted sexual advances by Spacey, one of the most prominent Hollywood figures to be publicly accused of sexual misconduct since accusations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein sparked the #MeToo movement on social media.

Spacey, 58, became embroiled in controversy last year when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14.

Spacey later apologized for any inappropriate conduct while denying any specific memory of the behavior in question. The “American Beauty” actor also came under fire for using the occasion to acknowledge for the first time that he was gay, a statement gay advocates criticized as conflating issues of sexual wrongdoing with sexual orientation.

The fallout resulted in Spacey being dropped from the sixth and final season of the Netflix series “House of Cards,” and erased from the 2017 movie “All the Money in the World.” Christopher Plummer was brought in take over his role and reshoot all of Spacey’s scenes.

Netflix in January reported a $39 million write-off on Spacey-related projects.Now it’s baseball season. The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox just brawled.

The rival teams squared off in the seventh inning at Boston’s Fenway Park on Wednesday after Yanks batter Tyler Austin charged at Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly for throwing a ball right into his back.

The scene got pretty chaotic:

Kelly was retaliating for Austin’s apparently late slide into second base earlier in the game that ticked off Red Sox shortstop Brock Holt, the New York Post reported. Austin cut Holt’s calf with his spikes on that slide, according to MassLive. The benches cleared then as well, but mostly yelling ensued.

Once Austin charged Kelly, though, punches flew and there was plenty of wrestling.

“I didn’t want to let anyone push myself around,” Austin said of his mound charge, per the New York Daily News. “That’s why I went out there.”

The umps ejected Austin, Kelly, Yanks reliever Tommy Kahnle and Yankees third base coach Phil Nevin in an eventual 10-7 New York victory, ESPN reported.“Quantico” star Priyanka Chopra has made it big in Hollywood, but the Indian actress revealed that because of her skin color, she hasn’t always been welcome in the entertainment industry.

Chopra, in an interview with InStyle published on Tuesday, told a story of discrimination she faced just last year, losing a chance for a movie role because she’s an actress of color.

“I was out for a movie, and somebody [from the studio] called one of my agents and said, ’She’s the wrong ― what word did they used? ― ‘physicality.’ So in my defense as an actor, I’m like, ‘Do I need to be skinnier? Do I need to get in shape? Do I need to have abs?’ Like, what does ‘wrong physicality’ mean?” Chopra told InStyle. “And then my agent broke it down for me. Like, ‘I think, Priy, they meant that they wanted someone who’s not brown.’”

Chopra said the incident “affected” her.

The actress, who also holds a Miss World title from 2000, said the issue of skin color extends to pay.

“No one will say that a woman is getting paid less because she’s a woman of color, but the numbers mostly end up reflecting that,” she said.

The enormous pay gap experienced by women of color in Hollywood has plagued the industry for some time. A list of 2017′s highest paid actresses includes not a single woman of color. Taraji P. Henson revealed in her book Around the Way Girl: A Memoir that she was paid less than 2 percent of what Brad Pitt made for “The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.” What’s more, Henson had to pay for three months of hotel expenses out of her own pocket.

Chopra said movie audiences need to support the work of strong women in order to combat the pay gap.

“I want to see the day where female-led movies get as much of a run as the boys do, which means the ticket-buying audience needs to be open to that,” Chopra told InStyle. “People don’t go watch females in movies because they don’t believe that they can be heroes. The world has to change the way they look at their heroes. Specifically how men can help is changing the ‘locker-room talk’ conversation. Nothing will change until we break the stereotypes of gender in our normal, day-to-day life.”

Chopra has acknowledged skin color once was a sensitive subject for her as she struggled with insecurities.

“Everyone in America wants to get a tan, and everyone in Asia wants to get their skin lightened. I straddle both countries,” she told Allure last year. “Girls there are told that they’re too dark or dusky and that lighter skin is better. Because I’m a darker tone, I had issues growing up as a teenager.”

Because of her own experiences, Chopra said all people have a responsibility to show young girls that skin color should not be a hindrance.
