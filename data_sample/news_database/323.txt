Continental is a rather infamous dive bar in New York City’s East Village. There’s a large, hard-to-ignore sign outside promising, in its most recent iteration, “6 shots of anything $12.”

Last week, musician Eden Brower noticed a different sign taped in the window of the bar, announcing that the word “literally” had been banned from the establishment.

Brower tweeted a photo of the sign, which read, in all caps:

Sorry but if you say the word ‘literally’ inside Continental you have 5 minutes to finish your drink and then you must leave. If you actually start a sentence with ‘I literally,’ you must leave immediately!!! This is the most overused, annoying word in the English language and we will not tolerate it.

Seems like a rather extreme solution to that “problem,” but OK. The bar updated the sign days later, throwing shade at one of America’s most famous families by stating, “Stop Kardashianism now!”

Attention! The sign at the Continental Bar has been updated and now includes a nod to @KimKardashian pic.twitter.com/P5TYXxcFcH — EdenBrower (@edenbrower) January 22, 2018

Bar owner Trigger Smith has since told Timeout New York that the sign is just a joke, and that his bar would be empty if he actually enforced the rule. “How could I mean that? How could I be serious?” he said. “I literally feel sorry for anybody who would take this seriously.”

But not everyone was laughing. When the sign went viral, some people on Twitter raised the issue of sexism, saying the sign is an example of the continued policing of how (primarily) women speak. The unnecessary mention of the Kardashians certainly helps make that case.

People like this don't give a shit about language. They're just self-important, generally misogynistic blow hards who get off on feeling superior to (mostly) young women. Anyway, good morning all! https://t.co/gr5A21hcJ2 — Allegra Hobbs (@AllegraEHobbs) January 24, 2018

Before Smith clarified he was kidding, Art Silverman, senior producer of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” encouraged people to “literally test the waters” at Continental by using the word and seeing if they get thrown out.

NPR invites folks literally test the waters @The Continental in St Marks Place -- record your experience at Voice memo and see if Trigger Smith ejects you. https://t.co/TyFdzgmW64 — Art Silverman (@asilverman) January 25, 2018

Even though Smith has clarified the whole thing is a joke, we’d still be interested to see how that experiment ends.

So did Smith do it all for publicity? Continental is closing its doors for good on Jan. 30, after 27 years. Smith wrote on the bar’s website that “if we’re very, very busy for the remainder, it’s possible that we’ll have the funds to relocate!” The new sign has certainly gotten people’s attention.

New Orleans city officials said on Thursday that more than 46 tons - or 93,000 pounds - of Carnival beads were among 7.2 million pounds of trash pulled from clogged catch basins along a five-block stretch of a downtown parade route, the Times-Picayune newspaper reported.

“Once you hear a number like that, there’s no going back,” Dani Galloway, interim director of the city’s Department of Public Works, said during a news conference on Thursday. “So we’ve got to do better.”

A representative from the city’s public works department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

The removal was part of a four-month project in response to heavy flooding in the city in August, the newspaper reported. The effectiveness of the city’s drainage systems came under fire after an Aug. 5 storm dumped up to 6 inches (15 cm) of rain, causing street flooding and underpasses to fill up.

The clean-up effort between late September and late January cleared about 15,000 of the city’s estimated 68,000 storm drains, the newspaper reported. The Mardi Gras beads were found along the St. Charles Avenue parade route.

Mardi Gras is celebrated on Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of Lent, a period of reflection and abstinence on the Catholic calendar.

By tradition, Mardi Gras, which is French for “Fat Tuesday,” is a day that calls for excessive partying in preparation for the somber season of sacrifice to follow.

Mardi Gras falls on Feb. 13 this year.

Partygoers are known to wear and toss beads - known as “throws” in New Orleans - from the streets and balconies in the French Quarter, Bourbon Street and other areas where partiers jostle through crowds.Reddit has an entire “Shower Thoughts” subreddit dedicated to “the miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.” In honor of those weird, wonderful and sometimes profound musings, here are 25 of the best posts from the last week:🎶I'm starting with the man in the mirror. I'm asking him to change his ways. And no message "to the man in the cupboard."🎶



I'm 38, and didn't know it was "no message could've been any clearer," until I was in my early 20s. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #MisheardLyricsIf you can’t laugh, you’ll cry. That seemed to be the eerie message of a scary mashup on “Saturday Night Live” of “Sex and the City” and the terrifying dystopian world of “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

In the skit “Handmaids in the City,” Amy Schumer has an interior monologue à la Carrie Bradshaw and laughs — uproariously — a lot, even when the situation is horrifying. She and her pals are light years from Carrie’s independent life in a dark, anti-feminist future where they’re forced to dress in the white bonnets and red robes of the enslaved remaining fertile women.

Kate McKinnon appears as a handmaid missing an eye for punishment (like Janine in the actual “Handmaid’s Tale”) and has a giggle over the community’s ”under his eye” greeting.

When Cecily Strong tells Aidy Bryant, laughingly, that she’s “bad,” for a naughty joke, Schumer smiles and says, “Yeah but not too bad or ... aaaack,” as she twists her head and neck back in a hanging pose.

“It’s a show critics are calling ‘so brutal’ and ‘more uplifting than the news,’” the voiceover says in a spoof promo.

The promo continues: “You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll say, ‘Oh my God, this so could be me and my friends. You know, with the way things are going.’”

Are readers gradually losing interest in politics — aka “Trump fatigue” — and if so, what stories are they reading now? How are they consuming political content compared to other subjects? Are there factors aside from subject matter that impact reader engagement?

Oath News ― made up of the brands HuffPost, Yahoo News, and AOL ― is the world’s No. 1 digital news group, according to comScore, attracting over 165 million readers in the U.S. and 220 million readers globally every month. Oath News covers a variety of topics, including national news, politics, foreign affairs, business, lifestyle and entertainment.

While politics has always been considered a core aspect of our coverage, Donald Trump’s rise has been an even greater driver of readership and traffic over the past year. Oath News ranked No. 1 in reader engagement for articles about politics among major U.S. digital news outlets during the election season (from October 2016 to March 2017). This ranking placed Oath News ahead of The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, USA Today, The Guardian, and NBC News.

But, what’s been happening after the election?

To better understand the post-election news environment, we explored four questions:

Are readers losing interest in articles about Trump and politics? Are readers engaging differently with Trump coverage compared to other topics? Are there factors besides topic that affect reader engagement? How do younger generations (e.g., millennials) react to stories about Trump and politics?

TL;DR Audiences remain interested in Trump and political coverage, but the way they engage with it varies. Through our analysis, we determined the following:

After the election, despite news outlets significantly reducing coverage of politics, readers’ demand remains strong.

For Trump stories, audiences are willing to go beyond a political context.

Although Trump-related content receives the highest viewership (page views), it’s relatively low in user engagement compared to other topics like gun control, climate change, and racism ― a possible reflection of news readers’ psychological behaviors. They might enjoy reading Trump news, but may be more hesitant to comment or share.

Simple and straightforward storytelling wins, regardless of the article subject.

Younger generations (millennials and Gen Z) who read politics or Trump stories are actually more persistent in political news consumption, equating to greater long-term value to news publishers.

1. Are readers losing interest in articles about Trump and politics?

Many have complained about the barrage of Trump coverage since the election, but are audiences actually tired of this content? Has there been a decline in readership? To answer these questions, we analyzed articles published by eight digital news publishers (HuffPost, Yahoo News, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, USA Today and NBC News) over the course of 2017.

Turns out, content “supply” has decreased. There has been a steady decline in the number of news articles published about Trump and about politics in general.

HuffPost

Content “demand” has dipped, but remains strong. Reader engagement with political content fell sharply from February to April in correlation with the decrease in articles about politics, then leveled off in May. Reader engagement with Trump-related content showed a similar trend until August, when engagement with this type of content increased sharply.

HuffPost

The August data suggests that reader engagement for Trump-related content was higher than engagement for all political content. These results show that while the volume of content related to Trump and other political news has decreased — perhaps due to saturation in the industry — consumption and reader engagement bounced back in May 2017, possibly driven by a few major national events (e.g. the Russia investigation, the health care bill, Charlottesville protests).

Interestingly, our results also show that readers were engaged with Trump-related content regardless of whether it was political or not. For example, news that charities canceled fundraisers at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort over the summer received significant coverage and reader attention.

2. Are readers engaging differently with Trump content compared to other topics?

We analyzed over 2,500 topic tags on Oath News articles produced over the course of 2017 ― particularly, from our marquee news brand HuffPost ― and 10 topics stood out as both highly relevant to current national conversations and highly engaging for our readers. These topics are outlined below alongside coverage, readership and engagement metrics.

HuffPost

Trump-related content ranks highest in both the frequency of coverage and the readership performance (page views per article). This is unsurprising, considering Trump dominated the news cycle in 2017. But while people are avidly reading Trump news, they aren’t engaging with it at the same rate.

On a per view basis, audiences are not commenting on or sharing Trump-related content at significantly higher rates compared to other topics. This suggests readers are reluctant to share their political views against or in support of Trump in public spaces like social media because of the controversy surrounding his presidency and the potential backlash they might face, a finding we validated through focus-group testing. Our data also suggests that this relatively lower sharing and commenting rate on Trump-related content (on a per view basis) has been stable since the 2016 election season began.

Some topics performed just as high. Health care stood out as a topic with a high ratio of page views per article. While the volume of articles on this topic was low, health care articles on average received nearly the same number of page views as Trump-related articles, indicating a strong interest and concern around this topic. Emotionally-charged topics such as gun control, police violence, climate change, abortion and racism had relatively high numbers of shares per page view, suggesting that readers are motivated to share content that evokes an emotional response.

With the exception of abortion, most policy-related topics (e.g., climate change, military) had fewer comments per page view than the average article. This lack of engagement may be a result of the complexity inherent to these policy discussions.

3. Are there factors besides topic that affect reader engagement?

There is a multitude of characteristics that can affect a story’s performance in different ways, and those effects can be impacted by other contextual factors not central to the content itself. For example, when was the article published? Where was it distributed?

Word count is one such factor. Quartz popularized the use of word count as a metric in 2014, after it published research suggesting that articles should either be under 500 words or over 800, with articles in the middle-ground being “the place you don’t want to be.” We looked at a set of over 1,200 HuffPost articles published over the course of 2017 to test this assertion across four metrics.

HuffPost

While there are numerous reports on the more traditional elements of an article, we wanted to explore a factor less understood, but regularly discussed in conversations about the accessibility of news stories: readability, measured as the school-grade level education (6-14) required to read and understand an article easily.

Looking at the same set of articles, we measured readability using a combination of readability indices.

"Readability" measured as the school-grade level education (6-14) required to read and understand an article easily HuffPost

The relationship between readability and engagement is clear. Our results suggest that as reading difficulty increases — at least up until an index value of 14 — engagement on a per page view basis increases. Our results contradict the Quartz research and suggest people tend to share and comment more frequently on long-form, enterprise pieces.

And the relationship between readability and page views lends support to the Quartz proposition of a literary dead zone, with articles ranking below 8 or between 10 and 12 on the readability index driving less traffic.

While the articles with the highest readability (13-14) may have driven higher viewership because of the greater potential engagement described above (i.e., more shares drive more views), there is a readability “sweet spot” where articles with a readability index between 8 and 9 receive high viewership despite low engagement. In other words, simple and straightforward storytelling (only requiring 8-9 grade education to understand) seems to maximize the accessibility of an article without straying too far into banal and uninteresting writing.

4. How do younger generations (e.g., millennials) react to stories about Trump and politics?

We were also interested in looking into the audience demographics of this readership. In particular, what is the audience profile for young generations consuming Trump-related stories? How are they reacting to those stories?

By comparing our content data against multiple internal and external audience databases, we were able to outline the millennial (ages 18-34) and Gen Z (ages 13-17) audiences who read Trump stories. They are:

Majority male (53%), more than the overall group average (42%) Relatively older with 70% of this audience between the ages of 25 and 34 Discover Trump stories mostly by directly visiting news sites (47%) Occupation: more in production (19% vs. avg=14%) and health/medical (19% vs. avg=15%), and less in administrative (19% vs. avg=25%) and sales (19% vs. avg=25%) More single than married (43% single vs. 33% married, while the the broader age group average = 29% single vs. 51% married)

The data suggests that younger readers of Trump content are single, male professionals working in large sectors like manufacturing and health care who prefer finding or reading Trump stories directly via news sites or apps, instead of via Facebook or search.

Another interesting finding is those readers demonstrate a higher retention rate. They tend to return to news sites more frequently than average readers. The retention chart below suggests that 8 weeks after they read their first Trump story, 11% of them returned to the news site organically, which is 3x higher than average news readers. And that retention rate does not drop significantly after Week 3. We see an average 9.7% organic retention rate even after 16 weeks (four months!). This indicates that Trump/politics readers ― even if they’re younger ― have a much more persistent interest in Trump stories and, thus, a greater long-term value to news publishers.

McGahn believed that firing Mueller would only add to speculation over whether the president had obstructed justice by attempting to interfere with the probe.

Mueller, according to the Times, found out about the attempt to fire him “in recent months.”

Trump dismissed the report to a group of reporters on Monday, referring to the article as “fake news. Typical New York Times.”

The White House didn’t immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is leading its own probe on Russian interference, responded to the Times report in a statement Thursday evening.

“I’ve said it before, and I am saying it again: firing the Special Counsel is a red line that the President cannot cross. Any attempt to remove the Special Counsel, pardon key witnesses, or otherwise interfere in the investigation, would be a gross abuse of power, and all members of Congress, from both parties, have a responsibility to our Constitution and to our country to make that clear immediately,” Warner said.

Trump has previously denied that he plans to remove Mueller from the investigation, but said in December he has an “absolute right” to control the Department of Justice.

Top Republicans have also downplayed reports that Trump was considering firing Mueller.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey while the agency was investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

A career prosecutor and former FBI director, Mueller was tasked with investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as any matters that directly arise from that investigation.

In the past months, Mueller’s investigators have reportedly zeroed in on the question of whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice by firing Comey. Trump later admitted during an interview with NBC News that the Russia investigation was a factor in that decision.

In recent weeks, Mueller’s investigative team has interviewed Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, and is looking to interview Trump about Comey and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Trump said on Wednesday he was “looking forward” to speaking with Mueller, and wanted to do it as soon as possible. Trump’s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, later tried to downplay the gravity of the president’s off-the-cuff comments, noting that the president was “speaking hurriedly” before a planned trip.

“He remains committed to continued complete cooperation with the [special counsel] and is looking forward to speaking with Mr. Mueller,” Cobb said.

Trump is currently in Davos, Switzerland, where he will address the World Economic Forum on Friday.

Chamillionaire, born Hakeem Seriki, responded this week to critics who questioned his intentions to help a Mexican-American family after the father, Jorge García, was deported.

García, 39, was forced to leave his wife and two children on Jan. 15 after 30 years living and working in the United States, with no criminal record.

Many accused the “Ridin’” singer of wanting publicity after Detroit Free Press reporter Niraj Warikoo tweeted a screenshot of the email the rapper sent inquiring about how to get in touch with the family.

The artist answered with two videos posted Tuesday, lamenting that Warikoo had made the email public and rejecting any notion that he had reached out to the reporter for the sake of attention.

A post shared by @chamillionaire on Jan 23, 2018 at 4:15pm PST

“I would like to say thank you to the wonderful people on social media that did more than just criticize, the people who helped me get in touch with Jorge García’s wife, Cindy García,” the rapper said in the first video. “We had a dope conversation. I believe she has and will continue to be an amazing advocate for immigrant rights.”

“My parents are immigrants, so I feel some type of way,” he added. He then directed any fans who, like him, believe immigrants are being treated unfairly to Cindy García’s GoFundMe page.

In the second video, Chamillionaire addressed those who said they didn’t understand why a black man would help a Mexican-American family.

“A lot of people here be saying they don’t understand why a black man would want to help Mexicans and nonsense like, ‘They don’t do nothing for us. Black people need to only help black people,‘” he said. “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I’m from Texas, Tejas. I know a lot of y’all have been misled to believe the toxic narrative that ‘Mexicans are doing this, and Mexicans are doing that,’ like they aren’t valuable contributors to our economy and our society.”

A post shared by @chamillionaire on Jan 23, 2018 at 5:26pm PST

The star then explained how it was Mexicans who helped him and his music succeed at the beginning of his career.

“Here’s a little history lesson, ‘Ridin’ Dirty’ was produced by two Mexicans; the manager that took it to the top of the charts: Mexican; one of the retailers that sold the most mixed tapes for me was Mexican ― but he didn’t work at the store, he owned it; and guess who showed up at the shows? You guessed it,” he added. “If you don’t have respect for immigrants or you don’t have respect for minorities or you don’t have respect for women ― it’s going to be very difficult for you, yeah I’m talking to you, to understand why the other side needs to treated fairly.”

García’s story made headlines after cameras captured his family’s emotional farewell at Detroit’s Metro Airport earlier this month.

“Yes, he was brought here at 10 years old and yes, he entered the country illegally, but he has no criminal record and his case needs to be looked at individually because he deserves to be here in a country that he’s known ― not Mexico,” wife Cindy García told CNN at the time.

Warikoo was one of the many reporters to write about the case. Chamillionaire sent the Detroit-based journalist an email explaining he wanted to financially help the García family in Jorge’s absence.

The reporter shared the e-mail via Twitter on Jan. 17.Elton John found out that Prince Harry was in love in the unlikeliest of places last year ― during their time together at a camp in Italy.

“I spent some time with him at Google camp in Sicily last summer and I could tell that he was totally in love,” the 70-year-old singer, who is a longtime friend of the royal family, said during an interview with ITV’s “Lorraine” show on Thursday.

“He didn’t really discuss much personally, but he said ‘I’m in love,’ and I thought, good for you.” he said.

Prince Harry and Prince William both “seem to be ecstatically happy, and that’s all you want people to be, no matter who they are,” John added. “When people get married, you want it to last, you want them to be happy. I’m happy for him, I hope they have a wonderful day.”

When asked if he would perform at the wedding, the entertainer played coy and said he would be playing in Las Vegas, so he wasn’t sure. John added that he hadn’t even been invited to the wedding yet.

“It would be nice” to attend, John said, “because I love him dearly. We’re working very closely on AIDS projects with him. You know, both of those boys are very special to me because of their mother. He’s a good boy, his heart’s in the right place and all you want is for people to be happy.”

John also spoke during the interview about his late friend, Princess Diana, and opened up about what it was like losing her some 20 years ago.

“I loved her because she did so much for AIDS and she was a great friend to me,” he said. “We had a falling out, but we reconciled in the end.”

He added: “It was an extraordinary summer. Gianni Versace was murdered [in July 1997], and then Diana rang me up and we reconciled. And six weeks later, I’m in the same house, and she’s dead. It was extraordinary, and I just couldn’t believe what was going on.”

John has been on a press tour lately, after announcing his retirement from touring just a few days ago. The singer said that he’s going on a three-year, 300-date tour, and insisted this will be the only farewell tour he’ll ever do.

“I’m 71. I can’t physically do the traveling anymore,” he said during a press conference with moderator Anderson Cooper at New York’s Gotham Hall on Wednesday.You gotta hand it to Vanity Fair, this photoshoot is getting attention.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯_/¯ (We are correcting this error​ online​.) https://t.co/QNd74YtSTz — VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) January 25, 2018Every problem plaguing America needs a scapegoat. And for conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren, the cause is usually simple: Liberals.

A case in point is the so-called Tide Pod challenge, an internet meme encouraging teens to eat brightly colored detergent packs as if they are candy, not toxic laundry detergent. Poison control centers have reported 39 cases related to Tide Pods, mostly for ingestion.

Proctor & Gamble, the company that makes Tide Pods, says it’s working with social media networks to remove videos that show people appearing to eat the laundry packets.

Lahren, though, seems to think it’s bigger than teenagers trying to get attention doing something stupid.

No, in a wacko rant Friday on Fox News, Lahren pointed the finger at liberals for making teens want to chomp on detergent packs. She goes into full “you-kids-get-off-my-lawn” mode, seemingly channelling the wisdom of a much older, much crankier (emphasis on “crank”) low-information voter.

”I know what you’re thinking: The Tide Pod challenge couldn’t possibly be political, could it? Actually, yes, it is,” Lahren says. ”It’s just the latest symptom of a larger problem ― the breakdown of the American family. It’s what happens when kids aren’t taught boundaries, respect, consequences or logic.”

Lahren blames modern families with their “loosey-goosey method of parenting” that “doesn’t teach kids right from wrong. Or sane from insane.”

She gripes: “It produces wild animals that think they can do whatever the heck they want ― and get away with it.”

Oh, it gets better.

“Parents used to wash their kid’s mouths out with soap. And now kids are voluntarily eating it. Is this really where we are? Pay attention, parents. And do better.”

Then Lahren lays the blame. First, she puts forth a reasonable theory that social media addiction is a big concern.

“These teens surely know it’s not smart to eat detergent. But because their value and self-worth is determined by video views and Instagram likes, they do it anyway,” she says.

Lahren, who owes much of her own high profile to social media, quickly turns her fire on another villain:

“The left, which dictates popular culture, brainwashes young people into believing they live in a world where 64 gender options are up for selection, everything is free, Beyonce is a God queen, and eating detergent is funny.”

Lahren finishes by switching back to the much older, much crankier person.

“Americans ― we are better than this. Put down the soap, kids, and get a job.”“We all had the same color makeup, it was a very different time,” she recalled. “I remember saying to the makeup man one day ― because it was like putting mud on my face, it was really dark and I’m a fairly fair Hispanic ― and I said to the makeup man one day, ‘My God! Why do we all have to be the same color? Puerto Ricans are French and Spanish.’ And it’s true, we are very many different colors. We’re Taino Indian; we are black, some of us.”

“And the makeup man actually said to me, ‘What? Are you a racist?’” she added. “I was so flabbergasted that I couldn’t come back with an answer.”

That number had gone up even more by 2016, when the name was given to 303 baby boys and seven baby girls.

HuffPost looked at more SSA data to identify other “Star Wars”-inspired names appearing on birth certificates of babies in the U.S.

Of course, many of these names could have become popular for other reasons ― we can’t say for sure that the franchise boosted Luke, Ben or Finn, for example. Names like Leia, Kylo and Jedi seem like clearer tributes.

Here are 30 “Star Wars”-related names parents are giving their babies, plus the number of kids born in 2016 who had each name:

Leia (1,005 girls)

Kylo (238 boys, seven girls)

Jedi (32 boys)

Anakin (303 boys, seven girls)

Rey (254 boys, 63 girls)

Ahsoka (five girls)

Democrats across the nation sent a message to President Donald Trump and his administration in November, winning historic state legislative seats and governorships. Many of them, frustrated with Trump’s policies, decided to run for office in an attempt to energize a disjointed and fractious Democratic Party.

Hanif Johnson is one of those Democrats.

Johnson won the seat in the general election for the Dauphin County Magisterial District in Pennsylvania on Election Day last year, becoming the youngest Magisterial District Judge in the state at 27 years old. The Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, native began his term in January and will preside over cases within the predominately black state capital.

“When you sit back, and you see Donald Trump become president, and you hear about all of these things we are being affected by, it seems like everything happens through the court system,” Johnson told HuffPost, explaining why he decided to run for the seat. “Everybody always says, well, we complain about stuff, but we never get up and do anything. This is me getting up and doing something.”

Johnson is no stranger to the other side of the law. He has been to jail three times and ran through the streets as a teenager before he discovered his passion: track and field. “One day, I decided this ain’t the way I want to live my life, so I started running track. Track actually saved my life,” Johnson said, later becoming a state champion. Johnson currently coaches track and field at Harrisburg High School.

As a student at Penn State University, Johnson ran afoul of the law again, this time as a member of his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi. While he was president of the fraternity, he was charged in connection with hazing allegations. “I went to jail for two weeks, then I went to trial. Thank God I won,” Johnson recalled. “That was one of the happiest days; I just felt like my life was going to be taken from me.”

“It’s crazy because I know how it feels sitting across from that judge and that jury when you’re innocent,” he said.

Now, Johnson has an opportunity to make a difference. “Being that I live in that area, they know me, I know the people, I know what’s going on,” the father of one said. “You have single moms that can’t pay a parking ticket; I have the control to make life easier for her, rather than someone from out of town who don’t understand that $100 ticket might be too much for her and she ends up in jail over that ticket.”

Johnson said his win provided energy to other young people in the area to run for city council, school board and other local positions. “A lot of people came out the house and voted just because I was running,” he said. “If you want to do something and make a change, then just go out and do it.”

A magisterial district judge is a position elected by residents. A law degree isn’t required to take on this role; district judges receive training that prepares them for the legal issues they will face and must pass an examination before taking office. They handle traffic citations, minor criminal cases and determine if cases are either thrown out or go on to the Court of Common Pleas, where major cases are heard.

“Essentially, if you receive a traffic citation and you want to plead guilty to it or you want to appeal it, they are the first line for that,” a spokesperson for Pennsylvania’s Unified Judicial System told HuffPost. “They also hear cases for other offenses as well. It is an elected position.”

The young judge said people closed the door in his face while he was on the campaign trail. Residents were hesitant to cast their vote for someone so young. “They laughed at me in my face,” Johnson They said, ‘Boy, if you don’t get away from my house saying you want to be a judge. You are too young!’ But after the fourth or fifth conversation, I would ask them who they are voting for, and they would say me.”New York police officers arrested a department store security guard on Friday night after he was filmed punching and choking a suspected shoplifter who begged for him to stop.

Witness Brian Fraser recorded the violent confrontation, which involved multiple loss prevention employees, outside of the Century 21 department store at 22 Courtland Street in New York.

In the above footage of the incident, security guards hold down and appear to choke the suspected shoplifter. The man can be heard yelling, “What are you doing? I can’t breathe.”

While the incident involved private security guards, Fraser’s video spurs comparisons with high-profile cases of police violence against black people ― specifically, Eric Garner, the 43-year-old father of six who yelled “I can’t breathe” while dying in a police chokehold in 2014.

Fraser said the alleged shoplifter, 19-year-old Victor Roberson, was “compliant” with the security guards up until they began being violent with him on Friday.

“No matter what accusation, they should not have hit him,” Fraser told HuffPost.

Fraser said he was walking home from dinner when he saw a group of security guards walking a man, whom he described as a “teen,” across the street with his hands behind his back.

“The next thing I see is the boy being tackled to the ground and a struggle ensued,” Fraser said. “They began choking him and putting their hands over his mouth.”

Fraser said the security guards then pulled the suspect off the ground and one guard began punching him in the face.

Roberson “began bleeding from the mouth and a knot appeared on his forehead,” Fraser told HuffPost. “They picked him up and pinned him against the wall when one of the security guards hit him again.”

As seen in videos filmed by passersby, the young man can be heard coughing and yelling multiple times, “I can’t breathe.”

Witnesses on the scene can be heard warning the security guards that the man can’t breathe and pleading for them to stop. All the while, employees were asking the witnesses to stop filming, Fraser said.

Police arrived on the scene after the security guards tried to “drag” the young man back to the store entrance, according to Fraser.

The New York Police Department told HuffPost officers were called to the scene after receiving reports that a 19-year-old male illegally placed store items into his backpack.

Police said a Century 21 employee, identified as 24-year-old Acosta Wilson, followed Roberson as he exited the store and “engaged him in a physical altercation” while trying to detain him.

Officers reviewed witness’ footage of the confrontation and arrested Wilson on an assault charge after determining he used excessive force.

That night, officers also arrested Roberson, who was accused of stealing two pairs of Prada shoes, and charged him with petit larceny and possession of stolen goods.

Roberson was treated at a hospital for neck and back pain before he was placed in custody.

Fraser said Roberson didn’t escalate the situation and didn’t deserve to be treated violently.

“Bottom line, whether he was in the wrong, Century21 security, [who are] civilians, had no right to treat him with that level of aggression. The punching, choking was excessive,” he told HuffPost.

Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver, Canada, have the world’s most unaffordable housing, according to a global survey that compares home prices with income.

The median home in Hong Kong cost 19.4 times the median income, according to housing advocacy organization Demographia’s annual International Housing Affordability Survey, released this week. In Sydney, that multiple was 12.9; Vancouver was 12.6.

The study covered housing prices from the third quarter of 2017 for 293 metropolitan housing markets in Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. Comparing median home prices to the median income in each area shows that the world’s most unaffordable housing continues to be in Hong Kong and in Australia.

Next on the unaffordable list were San Jose, California, with housing costing 10.3 times the median income, and Melbourne, Australia, at 9.9. They were followed by Los Angeles (9.4), Honolulu (9.2), San Francisco (9.1) and Auckland, New Zealand (8.8).

Demographia

Demographia ranks any score above 5.1 as “severely unaffordable.”

“There are no affordable markets in Australia, China (Hong Kong), Japan, New Zealand, Singapore or the United Kingdom,” Demographia reported.

The report states 20 of Australia’s 22 markets, all of New Zealand’s eight markets, and 28 of the United Kingdom’s 33 markets ranked as either seriously or severely unaffordable.

Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver retained their rankings from the the previous year’s survey, but their median multiples increased in 2018. The 2017 survey showed Hong Kong with a median multiple of 18.1, Sydney 12.2 and Vancouver 11.8.

Demographia said Hong Kong recorded its eighth straight year as most unaffordable market, while Sydney hit the highest median multiple outside of Hong Kong.

Demographia

Demographia’s ranking of most-affordable markets is good news for North Americans, with 12 of the top 13 in the U.S. and Canada. Youngstown, Ohio, recorded the lowest median multiple of 1.9, followed by Moncton, New Brunswick, and Utica, New York, at 2.1.

In major housing markets, the U.S. had the top 10 most-affordable, with Rochester, New York, at the top (median multiple of 2.5), followed closely by Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; Oklahoma City; Pittsburgh; Detroit and St Louis.

“Among the 293 markets, Ireland and the United States have the most affordable housing,” Demographia said. “Among the 76 severely unaffordable markets, 30 are in the United States, 16 in Australia, 15 in Canada, 10 in the United Kingdom, seven in Canada, six in New Zealand and one in China.”

Demographia said “there are some signs of progress” by world governments in addressing housing affordability, such as increasing supply of housing stock. But the group said more had to be done to ensure housing remained affordable for all people.

“The key to both housing affordability and an affordable standard of living is a competitive market that produces housing (including the cost of associated land) at production costs, including competitive profit margins,” the report said.

High housing costs, Demographia said, drain other areas of the economy.

“The extraordinarily high house prices have significantly reduced discretionary income in the costly markets that could otherwise be used for other goods and services. Not only would this additional consumption (or savings) increase the standard of living, but it would also lead to higher levels of employment and economic growth,” the report said.

“Further, the higher housing prices feed the demand for more low-income affordable housing, which requires public subsidies. The higher prices make the housing market unaffordable for more households.”LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese scientists have cloned monkeys using the same technique that produced Dolly the sheep two decades ago, breaking a technical barrier that could open the door to copying humans.

Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, two identical long-tailed macaques, were born eight and six weeks ago, making them the first primates ― the order of mammals that includes monkeys, apes and humans ― to be cloned from a non-embryonic cell.

It was achieved through a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which involves transferring the nucleus of a cell, which includes its DNA, into an egg which has had its nucleus removed.

Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai said their work should be a boon to medical research by making it possible to study diseases in populations of genetically uniform monkeys.

But it also brings the feasibility of cloning to the doorstep of our own species.

“Humans are primates. So (for) the cloning of primate species, including humans, the technical barrier is now broken,” Muming Poo, who helped supervise the program at the institute, told reporters in a conference call.

“The reason ... we broke this barrier is to produce animal models that are useful for medicine, for human health. There is no intention to apply this method to humans.”

Genetically identical animals are useful in research because confounding factors caused by genetic variability in non-cloned animals can complicate experiments. They could be used to test new drugs for a range of diseases before clinical use.

The two newborns are now being bottle fed and are growing normally. The researchers said they expect more macaque clones to be born over the coming months.

Since Dolly - cloning’s poster child - was born in Scotland in 1996, scientists have successfully used SCNT to clone more than 20 other species, including cows, pigs, dogs, rabbits, rats and mice.

Similar work in primates, however, had always failed, leading some experts to wonder if primates were resistant.

The new research, published on Wednesday in the journal Cell, shows that is not the case. The Chinese team succeeded, after many attempts, by using modulators to switch on or off certain genes that were inhibiting embryo development.

Even so, their success rate was extremely low and the technique worked only when nuclei were transferred from foetal cells, rather than adult ones, as was the case with Dolly. In all, it took 127 eggs to produce two live macaque births.

“It remains a very inefficient and hazardous procedure,” said Robin Lovell-Badge, a cloning expert at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the Chinese work.

“The work in this paper is not a stepping-stone to establishing methods for obtaining live born human clones. This clearly remains a very foolish thing to attempt.”

The research underscores China’s increasingly important role at the cutting-edge of biosciences, where its scientists have at times pushed ethical boundaries.

Three years ago, for example, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou caused a furor when they reported carrying out the first experiment to edit the DNA of human embryos, although similar work has now been done in the United States.Michael Masters/Getty Images

A planned overhaul of Australia’s national security laws has prompted civil society and the nation’s largest media organizations to warn that the draft laws threaten press freedom and could cause journalists to be jailed for doing their jobs.

Late last year, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a crackdown on spies, foreign donations and lobbyists through a sweeping counter-intelligence package designed to stop interference in Australia’s democratic institutions. It followed a series of warnings from across government and academia about the levels of Chinese Communist Party influence in the country.

The laws would ban foreign political donations, while requiring anyone trying to influence Australian politics to declare whether they’re working on behalf of other nations.

However, the change will also see the definition of espionage expanded to include the possession of classified information (the current definition only outlaws communicating it), which has journalists and anti-secrecy advocates worried.

In a joint submission to the parliamentary committee debating the proposals, 14 of Australia’s major media organizations warned that the laws would put journalists at a “significant risk” of jail time for obtaining or possessing information in the public interest during the course of their work.

“The result is that fair scrutiny and public interest reporting is increasingly difficult and there is a real risk that journalists could go to jail for doing their jobs,” the submission read.

“The proposed legislation criminalises all steps of news reporting, from gathering and researching of information to publication/communication, and applies criminal risk to journalists, other editorial staff and support staff that knows of the information that is now an offence to ‘deal’ with, hold and communicate.”

Press freedom isn’t a constitutional guarantee in Australia. However, the nation’s highest court has ruled that there is an implied freedom of political expression. While Australia enjoys a relatively free press, recent changes to the country’s copyright and telecommunications laws have media freedom and privacy advocates concerned about the potential for misuse.

Australian politicians have been wrestling over the past year with foreign political interference in the country.

In September, Professor Rory Medcalf from Australia’s National Security College in Canberra warned the Chinese Communist Party was “involved in what appears to be multi-faceted campaign to influence our politics and independent policymaking.”

“This includes propaganda and censorship in much of this nation’s Chinese-language media as well as channels of interference through intimidation of dissident voices and the establishment and mobilisation of pro-Beijing organisations on Australian soil,” he said.

“There is also the troubling question of political donations and their motives.”

Medcalf’s comments were followed by warnings in October from Duncan Lewis, the head of Australia’s domestic spying agency ASIO, that the government needed to be “very conscious” of foreign interference in Australia’s universities.

(Lewis was reportedly not willing to say which foreign governments were active on Australian campuses, nor did he provide any examples of intrusions.)

Meanwhile, a prominent opposition senator, Sam Dastyari, quit the Senate following months of fallout over his links to China, including revelations that he tipped off a Chinese political donor that his phone was might be tapped.

In announcing the laws, Turnbull said he took the reports of Chinese interference seriously, but stressed that the laws were not about one country.

“Foreign interference is a global issue,” he said at the time.

“For example, I know you’re all very familiar with very credible reports that Russia sought to actively undermine the integrity of the U.S. election and sought to influence it.”

China reacted to the proposed laws by accusing Australian media of fabricating stories about Chinese influence and “infiltration in Australia.”

The U.S. cautiously welcomed Turnbull’s December announcement, with James Carouso, the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Australia, telling the national broadcaster that “our democracy is facing similar concerns with foreign interference.”

“Our FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) is helpful in finding ways to deal with the problem,” Carouso added.

But the laws have also run into opposition from Australia’s own intelligence community, with the national intelligence watchdog fearing they could deter spy agency whistleblowers from coming forward.

The Law Council of Australia warned the laws would have a “chilling” effect on public debate in the country, while at least one prominent U.S./Australian business group complaining that they would deprive its members of freedom of speech.

Even religious groups have weighed in, with the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference arguing the proposed law was too broad and could affect priests.A controversial new Bollywood movie is causing security concerns in India as it opens in theaters across the country on Thursday.

“Padmaavat” has all the hallmarks of what might have been a universally celebrated Bollywood epic ― a critically acclaimed director, an estimated $30 million production budget, A-list actors dressed in lavish finery, elaborate dance and action sequences, and a love story to tie it all together.

Yet in the months before its opening, the film provoked street protestors to burn effigies of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and prompted a showdown in India’s Supreme Court over whether state governments can ban the movie. Hundreds of women have threatened to commit suicide, and in some states, theater companies scrapped plans to screen the movie for fear of violence.

Watch the trailer for “Padmaavat” below.

“Padmaavat” is a dramatic retelling of the story of the Hindu queen Padmavati, wife of the king Ratan Sen, from the Rajput warrior clan. According to tradition, Padmavati was so beautiful that a Muslim ruler, Alauddin Khilji, waged battle against Sen’s entire kingdom in order to capture her. But Padmavati commits suicide by self-immolation before the ruler could claim her.

Some Hindu groups in India, particularly those linked to the Rajput clan, are outraged at how they believe Padmavati is portrayed in the new film. The protestors, led by the group Shri Rajput Karni Sena, claim the director distorted history and disrespected their legendary queen by portraying Padmavati in an intimate romantic scene with the Muslim ruler. The producers deny that such a scene is part of the film, the BBC reports. Several reviewers who viewed the movie have confirmed this.

The protestors have also complained that the movie cheapens the heroic acts of Padmavati, played by the popular Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone.

The Muslim ruler Alauddin Khilji and his Hindu opponent Ratan Sen are real figures from 14th-century India. Padmavati’s story was immortalized two centuries later, in an epic poem by the mystic Malik Muhammad Jayasi. The filmmakers have said the movie is inspired by that poem.

Bollywood films that illustrate historical encounters between Muslims and Hindus, India’s majority religion, are often controversial, Reuters reports. And, as Hindu nationalism rises in the country, the film has become a symbol of growing cultural tensions.

Bollywood is a “soft target” that generates “instant publicity” for groups or individuals attacking it, said Anjum Rajabali, an Indian screenwriter. The protests around “Padmaavat” have helped further the myth of Hindu sentiments under siege, Rajabali wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times in December.

“Even a fictional queen and a Muslim king have become tools to garner Hindu votes,” Rajabali wrote. “Fabricating a hostile ‘other’ helps retain power. The methodology has been transparent — generate fear and hatred, and use those to legitimate violence.”

Four Indian states, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, imposed bans on the film. India’s Supreme Court stepped in earlier this month to overturn the bans and clear the way for “Padmavaat’s” release across the country.

The protests picked up steam this week, ahead of the movie’s opening.

In a letter to India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a group of Rajput women in Rajasthan expressed willingness to commit suicide over the film. Police in the area told Times Now News that they believe the threats were hollow.

On Wednesday, a mob of protestors threw rocks at a school bus on the outskirts of Delhi.

As the movie debuted on Thursday, protestors vandalized shops in the state of Rajasthan and waved swords and burned tires in Bihar to show their displeasure, Reuters reports.

“If you have freedom of writers, freedom of expression, we too have freedom of protest,” Lokendra Singh Kalvi, head of the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, told Reuters.

Rituparna Chatterjee, an editor at HuffPost India, pointed out the irony of the protests.

“The local groups fighting relentlessly for days now to defend a possibly fictional queen’s honor, have had no qualm in issuing threats to the woman who plays the titular role,” Chatterjee wrote in a blog.

Chatterjee also saw the Karni Sena’s protests as signs that the group is seeking greater political clout and wants to become India’s next “foot soldiers of nationalism.”GLAAD's latest report found 55 percent of LGBTQ people said they experienced anti-queer discrimination last year, compared to 44 percent in 2016. Bloomberg via Getty Images

After years of LGBTQ social advances, acceptance of the queer community in the United States appears to be on the decline.

A new GLAAD survey unveiled Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has found a “swift and alarming” drop in overall acceptance of LGBTQ people. It also recorded a “significant” increase in the number of LGBTQ people who say they’ve experienced discrimination on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity.

The 2018 Accelerating Acceptance report found that 49 percent of the non-LGBTQ respondents identified themselves as LGBTQ “allies” in 2017, down from 53 percent in 2016. At the same time, 55 percent of the LGBTQ respondents said they experienced anti-queer discrimination last year, compared to 44 percent in 2016.

Advocates said it was the first time in the four-year history of the report, which surveyed more than 2,100 Americans over the age of 18, that the results had indicated a drop in LGBTQ acceptance.

Among the other troubling findings in the report, which was conducted in November on GLAAD’s behalf by the New York-based research firm Harris Poll: 31 percent said they were very or somewhat uncomfortable seeing a same-sex couple holding hands (up from 29 percent in 2016). Meanwhile, 30 percent said they felt similarly about learning a family member identified as LGBTQ, up from 27 percent the previous year.

GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis believes the contrast between the figures found in this year’s report and those of previous years is largely the result of President Donald Trump’s anti-LGBTQ platform and a lack of support for the queer community at the national level.

“Year over year, Americans said they were more comfortable with LGBTQ people and more supportive of LGBTQ issues. These results paralleled historic steps in LGBTQ visibility in our culture as well as the passage of marriage equality nationwide and other pro-LGBTQ legal wins,” she wrote in the report.

“This change can be seen as a dangerous repercussion in the tenor of discourse and experience over the past year,” she wrote. Ultimately, however, it wasn’t just legislation that would be responsible for “closing the gap to full acceptance,” she added, but rather “a deeper understanding and empathy for LGBTQ people.”
