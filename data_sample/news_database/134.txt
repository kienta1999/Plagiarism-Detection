Victoria Byfield knows exactly what it’s like to show up to school and get treated as a suspect instead of a student. Now a student at Miami Dade College, she recalls walking to high school in the morning and seeing students getting questioned outside about their recent whereabouts. It felt like she was witnessing an interrogation.

In school, the situation felt similarly precarious.

“Even the slightest attitude coming from girls of color. The slightest attitude ... if they see it they’ll threaten to arrest you,” said Byfield, who has been working on these issues for years as a member of the nonprofit activist group S.O.U.L Sisters Leadership Collective.

Byfield will be unable to attend The March For Our Lives this Saturday, but members of her group will be one of many around the country expected to march on Saturday for school safety and gun control. A group based in Florida, they will also be marching against some of the very school safety measures the state’s legislature recently passed. The Florida bill increases funding for school police, and “school hardening” measures, like metal detectors. But students like Byfield ― namely, students of color ― have been living with these measures for years, and say that they help push students out of school and into the criminal justice system.

Public discussion around increasing police presence in schools has been recently centered on cops’ ability to deter school shootings. For Byfield though, having cops in schools has only made her feel less safe. It made school feel like a prison, instead of a safe haven. And while she’s optimistic and excited about the public activism that has been spurred by the shooting in Parkland, she’s worried that the unintended consequences of these policies will fall hardest on students of color.

“I feel like they will do all these different laws, arming teachers with guns and putting more police officers in schools. It won’t fully impact the upper class schools that are in the predominantly white neighborhoods like it would impact those schools in lower-income neighborhoods. We will have to deal with it,” said Byfield.

Around the country, students of color are disproportionately disciplined in school compared to their white counterparts. They are more likely to get arrested at school. Now, the Trump administration is considering cutting some of the guidelines designed to protect these students from overly harsh punishment. Obama-era guidance called on schools to be vigilant in reducing discipline disparities, and explore alternatives to expulsions and suspensions. This guidance has been on the chopping block for months, but its rescission has gained new momentum as the Trump administration pushes harsher school punishments as a potential school safety solution.

Up the coast, in Philadelphia, high school senior Kaila Caffey and high school junior Camryn Cobia will be marching this weekend, as members of the youth-led Philadelphia Student Union. Their group has released a list of school safety demands, which includes a divestment in school police officers and protections for students from ICE arrests around schools.

Caffey and Cobia both attend the same diverse magnet school in the city. Caffey hasn’t had negative experiences with cops in her school, and Cobia says she’s only experienced nonviolent instances of implicit bias. But they’ve spent years helping to advocate for the students who haven’t been so lucky. Caffey specifically mentions an incident in which an 8-year-old student was allegedly assaulted by a school police officer in December.

Through the Philadelphia Student Union’s activism, Philadelphia schools now have an official system where students and families can submit complaints about school police officers.

For students like Caffey, Corbia and Byfield, this weekend is a moment to come together, join forces with other activists and make their voices heard. But it’s also an opportunity to teach others about what they already know about the consequences of highly securitized schools.Q: "What advice would you give to the 25-year-old Donald Trump knowing what you know today."



Trump: "Don't run for president." pic.twitter.com/I7PsPvHUMq — NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) March 22, 2018

President Donald Trump told a room filled with millennials on Thursday that if he had to give any advice to his 25-year-old self, it’d come down to four words:

“Don’t run for president.”

The crowd erupted in laughter and applause as Trump continued his response.

“All my life, I’ve gotten really — look, we all, every once in a while, get a knock. But I got the greatest publicity,” he said during a White House forum with millennials called Generation Next. “I was getting such great ― until I ran for office.”

He continued, lavishing praise on himself for “exposing fake news” to the public.

“But people get it. People really do get it,” he said. “There is a lot of fake news out there. Nobody had any idea. You know, I’m actually proud of the fact that I exposed it to a large extent, because we exposed it. It’s an achievement.”There’s a tweet for everything. Meanwhile I could’ve swore you ridiculed and belittled George Bush, all Republicans and Democrats that voted for the war in Iraq during your campaign and the debates.

WARSAW, March 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of Poles dressed in black protested across the country on Friday against an attempt by the ruling conservatives and the powerful Catholic Church to ban most abortions.

The “Stop Abortion” draft bill, opposed by numerous rights groups, would remove the main legal recourse Polish women have for getting a termination in a country that already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the European Union.

“I am against treating woman as an inferior type of human being,” Malgorzata, 58, a psychologist who joined the “Black Friday” protest in Warsaw told Reuters. “I support women’s rights to decide about their bodies and their lives.”

Under current rules, abortion is allowed under in three circumstances - danger to the mother’s health, rape or incest, and when prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the fetus.

The bill, already approved for further debate by the lower chamber of parliament in January and by a parliamentary committee earlier this week, would remove the third category, which currently covers more than 90 percent of legal abortions.

It is the second bid by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to tighten abortion rules. In 2016, after about 100,000 women joined protests and support for PiS declined, the party rejected a bill that would have imposed a near-total ban.

HEALTH, RIGHTS

Several thousand protesters gathered near the parliament building in Warsaw, with banners reading: “Woman is a Human Being Not an Incubator” and “We Are Going after Law and Justice.”

The protesters chanted “freedom of choice instead of terror.”

A group of U.N. human rights experts called on parliament to reject the bill, saying it risked causing serious damage to women’s health.

“Preventing women from accessing safe and legal abortion care jeopardizes their human rights,” Nils Muiznieks of the Council of Europe human rights group said.

A survey conducted by IBRiS pollster in January showed that 70 percent of Poles are against the proposed restriction.

But after the 2016 setback for anti-abortion campaigners, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said his party would strive to amend laws to make sure that even severely deformed fetuses were born so they could be “baptized, buried, and be given a name.”

Polish Catholic bishops called in March on lawmakers to show “unconditional respect for every human being in all moments of its existence.”

The PiS party has close ties to the Catholic Church and depends on its support in elections.Actress Asia Argento reportedly surprised festival-goers and organizers with her searing remarks. Pascal Le Segretain via Getty Images

There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday.

Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks.

“I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.”

She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning.

“And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes.

Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior.

Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer.The man who killed at least three people Friday in the course of a multi-city rampage in southern France was himself killed following an hours-long standoff with police at a grocery store, France’s Interior Minister Gérard Collomb confirmed.

The incident, which French President Emmanuel Macron characterized as a terrorist attack, began around 10:00 a.m., according to French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb. The suspect, Redouane Lakdim, a 26-year-old of Moroccan origin, stole a car in the town of Carcassonne, gravely injuring the driver and killing the passenger, Collbomb said during a press conference. He added that Lakdim then trailed and shot at four local police officers, injuring one in the shoulder.

Following the initial two altercations, Lakdim drove to the Super U supermarket in Trèbes, a nearby town, and took several people hostage, killing two, Collomb said. Authorities helped free some of the remaining hostages ― one police officer even offered himself to the suspect in exchange for a woman being held hostage ― and then spent about three hours inside the supermarket with the suspect.

The suspect’s profile, Collomb said, didn’t fit the bill of those who have committed attacks in France in the past. He was under surveillance and known to authorities for petty crimes, but wasn’t thought to have been radicalized.

Several eyewitness reports claimed the suspect said he was acting on behalf of the self-described Islamic State.

After reports of the perpetrator’s death, ISIS took credit for the attack on social media. Later on Friday, authorities announced they arrested one person in connection to the attack.

“A man shouted and fired several rounds of shots,” an anonymous eyewitness told France Info. “I saw a refrigerator door and asked people to come take shelter inside. Ten of us stayed in there for one hour. Amid more gunshots we finally left through a back door.”

In a press conference Friday alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron refused to give any death toll, saying that the situation remained active.

France has seen a number of major terror attacks in recent years, and the country is still under a state of emergency following the November 2015 Paris attacks in which ISIS supporters killed 130 people and wounded hundreds of others at a stadium, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall. Earlier that year, al Qaeda-linked gunmen also attacked satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and took hostages at a Kosher supermarket in Paris.

Subsequent terrorist incidents in the country include a truck attack in the city of Nice, which killed 86 people when a driver plowed into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. Terrorism was a prominent campaign topic in France’s 2017 presidential election, and since then major terror attacks in the country appeared to be on the decline.

Yuri Gripas / Reuters

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday charged nine Iranians and an Iranian company with attempting to hack into hundreds of U.S. and international universities, dozens of companies and parts of the U.S. government on behalf of the Tehran government.

The cyber attack pilfered more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from 144 U.S. universities and 176 universities in 21 foreign countries, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.

The U.S. Treasury Department said on its website that it was placing sanctions on those accused and the Mabna Institute, a company described by U.S. prosecutors as designed to help Iranian research organizations steal information.

“These defendants are now fugitives of justice,” U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at a press conference, warning that they may face extradition in more than 100 countries if they travel outside of Iran.

The action is the fourth time in the past few months that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed a foreign government for major cyber attacks, a practice that was relatively rare under the Obama administration.

The campaign targeted the email accounts of more than 100,000 professors worldwide and compromised about 8,000 of them, the Justice Department said, describing the conspiracy as one of the largest state-sponsored hacking sprees prosecuted.

Hackers also targeted the U.S. Labor Department, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the United Nations, prosecutors said.

Last week, the administration accused the Russian government of cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid. Washington imposed new sanctions on 19 Russians and five groups, including Moscow’s intelligence services, for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other cyber attacks.

The Obama administration in 2016 indicted seven Iranians for distributed-denial-of-service attacks on dozens of U.S. banks and for trying to shut down a New York dam. Those hackers were also accused of working on behalf of Iran’s government.

On Friday, the Treasury department named the Iran-based Mabna Institute and Behzad Mesri, also known as “Skote Vahshat,” who was charged in 2017 with hacking cable TV network HBO.The Trump administration will approve a plan to sell around $1 billion in weapons -- including some 6,700 missiles -- to the Saudi government, the State Department said Thursday. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

The Trump administration plans to approve a $1 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, the State Department announced during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the United States this week.

The White House has signaled its support for the sale, which would include around 6,700 anti-tank missiles and $300 million in parts for the Saudis’ helicopters and tanks, the department said Thursday.

The Defense Department confirmed the deal in its own release. “This proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives by improving the security of a friendly country which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability and economic growth in the Middle East,” the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

“This potential sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key partners in the region with modern systems that will enhance interoperability with U.S. forces and increase stability.”

However, the deal is likely to cause controversy due to the Saudis’ role in Yemen. Saudi Arabia ― the largest foreign buyer of American-made arms ― is a major belligerent in the Yemeni civil war, and since March of 2015 has carried out a deadly airstrike campaign against the Houthi rebel group that opposes the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

The Saudi-led intervention has killed thousands of civilians and contributed to one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. Millions in Yemen lack basic access to food and medical care, while Saudi airstrikes have devastated the country’s infrastructure and prevented aid shipments from reaching those in need.

Human rights groups routinely criticize Western governments, including the U.S. and United Kingdom, for profiting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia. They point to how these bombs are sometimes dropped on residential areas where they have killed young children and families.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended the sale when a reporter asked about the civilian deaths in Yemen, according to The Associated Press.

“We believe that Saudi Arabia is part of the solution,” Mattis said. “They have stood by the United Nations-recognized government, and we are going to end this war. That is the bottom line. And we are going to end it on positive terms for the people of Yemen, but also security for the nations in the peninsula.”WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress voted early on Friday to approve a $1.3-trillion government funding bill with large increases in military and non-defense spending, sending it to President Donald Trump, who was expected to sign it into law.

With Trump’s signature, the bill will avert a threatened government shutdown and keep federal agencies funded until Sept. 30, ending for now Washington’s constant budget squabbles and letting lawmakers focus on getting reelected in November.

The Senate voted 65-32 for the bill, several hours after the House of Representatives passed it 256-167 on Thursday.

The votes capped a long struggle by Congress, which was supposed to have approved the government funding by last Oct. 1.

Since then, several stop-gap spending bills have kept the government open, except for two brief shutdowns earlier this year when Congress deadlocked and funding expired.

Despite Republican leaders urging passage of the bill, some Republicans voted no. Their party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House, but has struggled since taking power in January 2017 to approve budget legislation.

Republican Senator Rand Paul spent part of Thursday on social network Twitter criticizing what he said was unnecessary spending in the sprawling bill.

“Shame, shame. A pox on both Houses - and parties. Here’s the 2,232 page, $1.3 trillion, budget-busting Omnibus spending bill,” Paul declared in one message.

He decried a “monstrous bill” teeming with money for decades-old programs. His last-minute objections played a key role in delaying the Senate’s vote until the dead of night.

On Thursday, Representative Mark Meadows, who heads the far-right Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives, said, “This omnibus doesn’t just forget the promises we made to voters - it flatly rejects them.”

He added, “This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand.”

Not all of the opposition, however, was over fiscal policy.

Before he would let the voting proceed, Republican Senator James Risch insisted on a promise that a wilderness area in his home state of Idaho would not be named after the late former Governor Cecil Andrus, a Democrat.

The legislation has provisions that appeal to conservatives, however, with its $80-billion increase this year to the military budget and more border security funding.

But significantly higher non-defense spending put conservatives on edge. In the House, 90 of the chamber’s 238 Republicans revolted against the measure.

Coupled with recent tax cuts, the government funding bill is projected to lead to budget deficits of more than $800 billion for this year. Conservatives warned it could create problems for Republicans running for re-election in November.

SCALED-BACK TRUMP PROPOSALS

Several Trump initiatives would suffer setbacks. At one point during prolonged negotiations he pushed for $25 billion in funds to fully build his border wall with Mexico.

The president’s severe cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, State Department and other federal agencies would also be scaled back.

White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters the legislation “does a lot of what we wanted – not everything we wanted – but a lot of what we wanted on immigration.”

Trump said on Twitter the bill would allow him to start building the wall, which he calls an essential part of efforts to reduce illegal immigration. “Got $1.6 billion to start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming,” he wrote.

But Democrats, who have long opposed the wall, argued the added funds would help build or restore a range of other barriers, including existing fencing, but not a concrete edifice.

The $1.6 billion would also be used to hire more border patrol agents. But there would not be a significant increase in immigration agents, or in detention beds needed to step up immigrant deportations.

The Department of Homeland Security had sought a big boost in those officers’ ranks to boost deportations of illegal immigrants.

Besides the largest defense buildup in 15 years, the measure includes new funds to improve infrastructure and counter Russian election hacking.

In response to public anger and frustration over mass shootings, it includes modest improvements to background checks for gun sales and grants to help schools prevent gun violence.Late-night TV hosts were incredulous over President Donald Trump’s feud with former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday night.

An escalation in tensions came this week after Biden told a rally he’d have “beat the hell out of” Trump in high school for his treatment of women. Trump responded by tweeting that Biden “would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.”

Both Trump and Biden have received widespread criticism for their aggressive comments.

“Late Night” host Seth Meyers called the whole encounter “embarrassing.”

“This is just what America needs, the ‘Thrilla in Vanilla,’” Meyers quipped. “The last time I saw two old dudes going at it like that, my local Walmart was down to its last bottle of prune juice.”

“Could you imagine these two actually fighting?” Meyers added. “It would end as soon as one of them accidentally stepped on his own super-long testicles.”

AdvertisementOne of the things that distinguished Donald Trump from the rest of the crowded Republican presidential field in the 2016 election was his unflinching criticism of the Iraq War.

“Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake,” Trump said in February 2016.

“We should have never been in Iraq,” he added. “They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none, and they knew that there were none.”

With the exception of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), none of the other Republican candidates were talking like that. They acknowledged mistakes were made, but none was willing to go after the presidency of George W. Bush so directly.

But on Thursday, Trump threw his skepticism out the window and chose one of the loudest cheerleaders for the 2003 Iraq invasion to be his new national security adviser.

I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018

Bolton is a notorious warmonger, calling for the United States to go to war with both Iran and North Korea.

In the run-up to the Iraq War, Bolton was the Bush administration’s top diplomat on arms control, and he pushed the line ― which the country now knows to have been a lie ― that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

“We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities in Iraq,” Bolton said in 2002.

And even though the primary justification for the war was bogus, Bolton has stood firm that he believes the invasion was the right choice.

“I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,” he said in 2015. “I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces.”

Trump gained momentum in part because of his opposition to Iraq. It wasn’t the primary issue in the race, but it was an important one. After all, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was widely considered to be the front-runner for the nomination. He stumbled early in the campaign, however, when he was unable to give a straight answer about whether he thought his brother’s war in Iraq was a mistake.

Trump capitalized on the war issue. He claimed, over and over, that he was against the war all along ― including before the invasion. It was a way that this real estate developer tried to show that he was better on foreign policy than his rivals were.

But there is zero publicly available evidence that Trump opposed the invasion. Instead, there was a 2002 interview with Howard Stern in which Trump tepidly supported the invasion. Trump’s dislike of the endeavor, at least publicly, came well after the war was underway.

Trump saw an opening ― dissatisfaction with the war and the Bush foreign policy legacy ― and seized on it, even if he did so disingenuously.

Like other recent hires by Trump, Bolton is a frequent presence on cable news.

Bolton does not need Senate confirmation. But Paul recently wrote an opinion article counseling the president not to choose Bolton, saying it would be an abandonment of his campaign promises.The U.S. has dropped criminal charges against nearly all of the Turkish security officers accused of viciously beating American demonstrators last year in Washington, D.C., as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sat in a car nearby.

Most of the charges were dropped last month, a day before now-outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met in Turkey with Erdogan, who was furious about the arrest warrants that had been issued against his men, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The attack in May outraged the American public and politicians after the foreign security guards beat up protesters in the nation’s capital. Members of Erdogan’s security entourage, many in suits and some spotted wearing Turkish security badges, can be seen on a Voice of America video rushing into the peaceful demonstration and punching and kicking protesters in the head. Demonstrators were protesting Erdogan’s human rights violations soon after he met with President Donald Trump in the White House.

Local police were overwhelmed by the violence, and nine demonstrators were hospitalized. A police officer and two members of the U.S. Secret Service were also injured.

Turkish officials did not deny the attacks occurred. They insisted guards had to take action to protect the president, and the Turkish-American citizens who had gathered to greet him, from protesters they labeled as Kurdish militants. Videos of the scene do not support that scenario.

Charges against seven of 15 of the officers charges were quietly dropped Feb. 14, the day before the Tillerson meeting. Charges against another four security officers were dropped earlier in November. Charges against only four guards remain.

A U.S. State Department official told The Associated Press on Thursday that the timing of the dropped charges before Tillerson’s meeting was coincidental. An official told CNN that questions arose about the identity of Erdogan’s guards involved in the attack. Several faces of the attackers were clearly visible in the Voice of America videotape.

Another Voice of America video taken of Erdogan sitting in his car indicates that the president himself may have given an order to attack. At one point on the video, an official bends down to apparently exchange words with Erdogan through the open car door as the president waits in the driveway of the Turkish ambassador’s residence near from the rally. The man then rushes from the car, saying, according to language experts, “Come, come! He says to attack,” and a mob of security officers then rushes the crowd of demonstrators.

Two Canadians have also been charged in the attack on protesters. Two U.S. citizens who were charged in the indictment, Sinan Narin and Eyup Yildirim, pleaded guilty to felony assault in December. They’ll be sentenced in April.

“We should throw their ambassador the hell out of the United States of America,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” after the attack in May. “This isn’t Turkey. This isn’t a third-world country. They violated American laws.”

The president has a major business interest in Turkey ― Trump Towers Istanbul.

“I have a little conflict of interest ’cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” Trump said in a 2015 interview on a Breitbart News radio program. “It’s tremendously successful. It’s called Trump Towers ― two towers, instead of one.”

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a rare win for gay rights campaigners in Kenya, its Court of Appeal on Thursday ruled that it is illegal to force people suspected of being homosexual to undergo anal examinations.

The landmark case was brought by the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) after two men were arrested in 2015 on suspicion of having gay sex, which is illegal in Kenya and punishable by 14 years in jail.

The men said they were subjected to forced anal examination by security personnel and a public hospital in Kenya’s coastal city of Mombasa to determine if they had engaged in anal sex and were homosexual. They were also forced to take HIV tests.

“The NGLHRC has long argued that the tests are a violation of rights to privacy and dignity and amount to torture,” said a statement from the charity, which represents the rights of sexual minorities in the conservative east African nation.

“The violating examinations, which include being made to lie with legs up in a humiliating position and having instruments forced into your rectum, are widely accepted to have no medical merit.”

Homosexuality is taboo across Africa and the persecution of gay people is rife. Sexual minorities are routinely abused, assaulted by mobs, raped by police or vigilantes, or enslaved by criminals, campaigners say.

The judgment ends a three-year legal battle by the NGLHRC to prove that the examinations violated the rights of Kenyan citizens. It originally lost the case in 2016 when Mombasa’s High Court ruled the anal tests as constitutional.

The charity then challenged the ruling in the Court of Appeal in Mombasa, which has now ruled in its favor - but many African countries such as Uganda, Zambia, Egypt and Cameroon still conduct forced anal examinations.

“The humiliation and pain caused by these useless anal examinations will follow our clients for the rest of their lives,” said NGLHRC’s head of legal affairs Njeri Gateru.

“However, we are emboldened to see our constitution at work, ensuring that all Kenyans have the right to dignity.”

The NGLHRC is also challenging a British colonial-era Penal Code which criminalizes gay sex. The court is expected to announce on April 26 the date that it will deliver its ruling.When RuPaul announced on Thursday’s “RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 10 premiere that a mystery queen would be returning to the competition, “RDPR” fans (still reeling from last week’s controversial “All-Stars 3” finale, in which many thought Shangela was totally robbed) might’ve thought the Pit Crew was about to wheel out another oversized novelty gift box containing the avenging Shangela herself. But instead, Ru puzzlingly explained that Farrah Moan, an eighth-place contestant from last season, was getting another shot.

Or was she? In the best surprise Ruveal in herstory — or at least since Lady Gaga ambushed the Season 9 queens in Gaga-impersonator drag — Gaga’s “Do What U Want” duet partner, Christina Aguilera, emerged resplendent in flawless Farrah Moan drag, right down to the snatchable cotton-candy-pink wig.

What made this stunt so totally sickening? It was a nod to a hilarious incident when a fashion blogger mistook a photo of Farrah at DragCon 2017 for Aguilera at the Met Gala. Farrah, who’s been known to perform to Xtina songs, was understandably flattered and thrilled — but this was a major compliment for Aguilera as well, since Farrah is one of the prettiest, fishiest queens to ever sashay down the “Drag Race” runway.

Anyway, Aguilera was clearly living her very best life as she took on guest-judging duties this week — I never saw her look this happy when she was sitting in one of the “Voice” chairs! — especially when Kalorie Karbdashian-Williams and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo lip-synced for their lives to her Back to Basics hit “Ain’t No Other Man.” (Another side note: Kalorie and Vanessa’s performances were actually pretty basic. There’s no substitute for the real Xtina.)

Backstage on the “Untucked” aftershow, Aguilera — a longtime supporter of the LGBTQ community (her 2002 video for “Beautiful” earned a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayals of gay and transgender people) — got serious with the contestants, offering them some sage advice about how to pursue their careers as they welcomed her to the “Drag Race family.”

“Just keep living,” she told them. “I am so in awe and inspired by everything I am seeing today. We have all come from some journey; I am sure we’ve all had a painful place or a struggle. I think that’s really relevant, and that’s a part of my music and a part of where I come from: Being taken advantage of created [my anthem] ‘Fighter.’ Growing up in this business at a young age, you could just imagine being around older men a lot and dishonest people, and it’s really hard. Once you do obtain a certain level of success, you can become jaded … but I think as long as you keep remembering who you are as a person, keep remembering the good around you, then nothing can stop you.”

Can I get an amen? Farrah Moan couldn’t have said it better herself.

AdvertisementThe first of the four separate albums Kanye West has promised from his label G.O.O.D Music finally dropped on Friday with rapper Pusha T’s “DAYTONA.”

Produced entirely by Mr. Kim Kardashian West, the seven-song collection has already been hailed as Pusha T’s “best album in years,” but, of course, where West goes, controversy will follow. Look no further than the album’s cover art.

While Pusha T originally intended to use multiple photos for the cover, West apparently insisted that they use a photo of the late singer Whitney Houston’s bathroom in disarray.

Taken by one of Houston’s family members without her permission in 2006, the photo, which includes various drug paraphernalia, was sold to the National Enquirer amid the singer’s well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

And as for the price of licensing such a photo? $85,000, according to Pusha T.

“1 a.m., my phone rings, no caller-ID. ‘Hey, yeah, I think that we should change the artwork. I like this other artwork.’ Now this other artwork is 85 grand,” Pusha T recalled West saying on “The Angie Martinez Show” earlier this week.

“Hey, I don’t want to pay for that. And I wasn’t even going to ask you to pay for that. We picked what we picked. It’s here, it’s ready,” he said responded to West.

“No, this what people need to see to go along with this music,” he said West told him. “I’ma pay for that.”

But the Bronx-born rapper had nothing but positive things to say about the last-minute switch-up.

“I feel like the cover represents an organized chaos. The energy of the album is a bit chaotic, but it’s all in place,” he explained to Entertainment Weekly. “Looking at that cover, I’m sure whoever frequents that bathroom or area knew whatever they wanted to find and knew where it was.”

Houston died at age 48 in 2012, accidentally drowning in a bathtub with additional complications of heart disease and cocaine use. Three years later, Houston’s daughter, Bobbi Kristina, 22, was found unresponsive in a bathtub, and died six months later.

HuffPost has reached out to Houston’s estate for a comment, as it’s unclear whether West paid the National Enquirer or a family member to license the photo.

On Thursday, West celebrated the impending the release of the album, writing that he’s “really proud of what we put together.”

“We’ve spent a year and a half digging for samples and writing,” he continued. “I really appreciate the overwhelmingly positive response that we’ve been receiving. 🙏🙏🙏.”

“It really was the students that began the end of the Vietnam War. It was the students who made all the news, and that noise started, and then the movement wouldn’t stop. I think, maybe, this noise that those students in Florida are making ... will do something of the same nature,” Murray wrote.

“The thing that’s so powerful about students is that, when you haven’t had your idealism broken yet, you’re able to speak from a place that has no confusion, where there is a clear set of values.”

But kids aren’t the only ones with idealism, he notes.

“There are idealists left over the age of 18, I’m sure of it. Idealism is a voice that’s inside of you; it’s your conscience. [It] can really deteriorate along the way ... and it can become almost dysfunctional, but it’s there. Everyone has it. Sometimes it’s just a whisper, but in some people, it’s a shout.”

A letter earlier this month from Barack and Michelle Obama to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a mass shooter killed 17 people last month, also hailed the teenagers’ activism. “Not only have you supported and comforted each other, but you’ve helped awaken the conscience of the nation, and challenged decision-makers to make the safety of our children the country’s top priority,” they wrote.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department is proposing rule changes that will effectively ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machine gun, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday.

“After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,” Sessions said in a statement.

Sessions has been a defender of the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms.

Gunman Stephen Paddock used a bump stock in a massacre last October that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others at a music festival in Las Vegas.

Authorities said Paddock’s ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over a 10-minute period from his 32nd-floor hotel suite was a major factor in the high casualty count.

In February, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum directing the Justice Department to make the regulatory change.

“As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period,” Trump said on Twitter as the announcement was made. “We willBAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.”

The National Rifle Association, the most powerful U.S. gun lobby, supported more regulation of bump stocks but has not endorsed Trump’s ban and said previously it was awaiting the publication of the regulation before rendering judgment.

The Justice Department announcement comes as hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to rally nationwide on Saturday for tighter gun laws in “March For Our Lives” protests led by survivors of the Florida school massacre, which reiginited the debate over Americans’ access to guns.

Students from the Parkland, Florida, high school where 17 students and staff were killed on Feb. 14 will be among the 500,000 people who organizers say could rally on Pennsylvania Avenue near the Capitol in Washington.A big collage with a photo of Marielle Franco is seen in a neighborhood of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Last week’s murder of black Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco has already sparked global protests and calls to hold her killers accountable ― especially if the main suspects are, as various news reports have said, members of extrajudicial militias that often include rogue current and former Rio police officers.

Now, more than three dozen prominent actors, authors, politicians and activists are joining the cause. On Thursday, the group penned an open letter that demands justice for Franco’s murder and calls for an independent investigation to help solve it.

“We are deeply concerned and shocked by this commando-style killing of a woman who was a voice for the voiceless and a symbol of resistance to state-perpetrated violence, militarization and anti-democratic forces,” says the letter, which was published in and first reported by The Guardian and Brazil’s Globo News.

Franco, a 38-year-old first-term councilwoman, was a crusader against police violence in Rio, where one of the world’s deadliest police forces killed more than 900 people ― the majority of them black ― in 2016. A native of Complexo da Mare, a network of informal favela neighborhoods on Rio’s north side, she was also a type of advocate for the city’s poorest residents that they have rarely had before.

Widespread and persistent street protests in Rio de Janeiro and other cities across Brazil have put pressure on police to solve the case. But the possibility of police involvement in the death has also created skepticism among many Brazilians that Rio officials will actually bring Franco’s killers to justice. The bullets that killed Franco were linked to a cache purchased by the federal police in 2006, and militiamen are said to be key suspects in what appeared to be a professional-style killing.

“Given that Marielle’s murder bears all the hallmarks of a targeted assassination,” the letter states, “we call for the creation of an independent commission comprised of prominent and respected national and international human rights and legal experts and tasked with carrying out an independent investigation of the murder of Marielle Franco with the full cooperation of state judicial and police authorities.”

The letter is the latest and loudest call for an independent investigation instead of the probe Rio police are leading, and it comes from a number of prominent celebrities and activists.

“We call for justice for Marielle Franco and the daughter and the partner she leaves behind, and for an end to the killings and criminalization of activists, government opponents and low-income people in Brazil.” - From the group's open letter

Signers of the letter include filmmakers Ava DuVernay and Oliver Stone; actors Danny Glover, Viggo Mortensen, Wagner Moura and Thandie Newton; singer Janelle Monae; model Naomi Campbell; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky; writer and author Ta-Nehisi Coates; and Black Lives Matter movement co-founders Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi.

Rio state representative Marcelo Freixo, one of Franco’s political mentors, and Franco’s sister, Anielle Silva, also added their signatures.

“We call for justice for Marielle Franco and the daughter and the partner she leaves behind, and for an end to the killings and criminalization of activists, government opponents and low-income people in Brazil,” the letter concludes.

Before taking office, Franco had worked on an official investigation into killings by the informal militias, many of which include current or former police officers, that operate across Rio.

In 2016, she won an improbable election to Rio’s city council as a member of the leftist Socialism and Freedom Party, or PSOL. Her victory made her the only black woman on the 51-member council and a powerful voice for Rio’s favela residents ― for whom she was a staunch advocate and defender.

Franco opposed President Michel Temer’s decision to put the military in charge of public security in Rio de Janeiro, and she had recently been appointed to a commission to oversee military intervention. Just days before her murder, she had called attention to the police killings of two young, black Brazilians.

Her sudden murder ― and her status as a black lesbian from the favelas who fought for racial, gender and LGBTQ equality, for an end to police violence, and against Rio and Brazil’s entrenched political establishment ― quickly brought international attention to her cause.

Protests that broke out in Rio and Sao Paulo immediately after her death soon spread to New York, Paris, Buenos Aires, and other cities across Europe and Latin America. In Washington, more than 40 people ― many of them Brazilian expatriates ― staged a vigil outside the White House last week.

On Wednesday evening, they rallied again outside the Brazilian consulate in a joint protest held with activists from D.C.-based civil rights and anti-police violence organizations at their side.

An unseasonable snowstorm had shut down much of Washington for the day and nearly led the activists to postpone the vigil meant to mark the one-week anniversary of Franco’s death.

“But then we thought, ‘Would Marielle stay inside, or would she come outside and fight?’” said Juliana Moraes, from the D.C.-based group Brazilian Expats For Democracy and Social Justice.

So for more than an hour, they chanted and sang in remembrance of Franco and pledged to continue fighting for the causes she believed in.

The protesters held signs that said “Black Lives Matter in Brazil.” They called for an end to military intervention. They demanded an answer to the question, “Who killed Marielle?”

As darkness fell and temperatures plunged below freezing, the crowd dispersed. Left behind was one sign taped to the door of the Brazilian consulate.A New York City firefighter died and two others were seriously hurt in a five-alarm fire late Thursday in a Harlem building where the Edward Norton-directed film “Motherless Brooklyn” was being shot, according to media reports.

Michael R. Davidson, 37, a father of four with 15 years of service in the New York Fire Department, was found unconscious after descending a stairway with other firefighters and becoming separated, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters. Rescuers “were unable to revive him,” Nigro added.

Davidson was transported to Harlem Hospital, “where he succumbed to his injuries,” the fire department said on Facebook.

“Our city lost a hero tonight,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote on Twitter.

“Motherless Brooklyn,” directed by Norton, features a detective (played by Norton) with Tourette’s syndrome who tries to solve the murder of a friend, according to IMDB. The film also stars Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin and Willem Dafoe.

FEC records show that from 2014 through 2016, John Bolton’s super PAC paid Cambridge Analytica $1,152,299 for “research” and “survey research” work.

The company has found itself mired in scandal this week following allegations it illegally used data harvested from 50 million Facebook users to inform its voter targeting operations.

(At the same time, the firm’s CEO Alexander Nix also was caught on camera touting the company’s use of sex workers to apparently entrap rival political candidates in elections around the globe, and using social media to slyly “infiltrate” online communities with political messaging ― including the phrase “crooked Hillary,” which the firm claims to have invented.)

That foisted data was absolutely used to produce reports for Bolton’s group, said Christopher Wylie, a founding team member of Cambridge Analytica.

“The data and modeling Bolton’s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,” Wylie told the New York Times. “We definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.”

Wylie added that Bolton’s PAC wanted to make people more “militaristic” in their worldview and was “obsessed” with the idea that America had become “spineless” on national security issues.

According to CNN, only four other Republican campaign committees paid Cambridge Analytica more than Bolton’s PAC during that time frame: Make America Number 1, a super PAC backed by Robert Mercer, a billionaire who founded Cambridge Analytica in 2014 ($1,476,484); Cruz For President ($5,805,552); and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ($5,912,500).Now this is a story all about how Will Smith brought “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” back on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show.”

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he had signed the 2,232-page, $1.3 trillion spending bill that the House and Senate approved this week, funding the government through September and preventing an imminent shutdown.

The announcement came hours after the president threatened to veto the bill because it did not provide enough funding for his border wall or a solution for immigrants brought to the country as children under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.

Trump called the bill a “ridiculous situation” while speaking at a White House press conference, pointing to a large stack of papers that represented the package. But he said he had decided against a veto because the bill boosts military spending.

“As a matter of national security, I’ve signed this omnibus spending bill,” Trump said.

“There’s a lot of things I’m unhappy about in this bill. There’s a lot of things we should have in the bill,” he added. “I’ll say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I’ll never do it again. Nobody read it. It’s only hours old.”

The bill provides $1.6 billion for border security measures including secondary fencing, levee fencing, pedestrian fencing and replacement fencing. Yet that amount falls far short of the $25 billion the White House had requested to construct a full wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Trump once again blamed Democrats for the delay in finding a solution to DACA, an Obama-era program the president chose to end in September.

The package also provides a 2.4 percent pay bump for the military and a 1.9 percent bump for civilian government employees. It allocates $144 billion for Pentagon spending, along with increases for both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The bill also includes an effort to strengthen the background check process for gun purchases.

The bill landed on Trump’s desk six months after it was due, and around two days after it was first introduced.

Congress passed five continuing resolutions to keep the government funded while Republicans and Democrats negotiated priorities. Gridlock resulted in two brief shutdowns earlier in the year.

The president called on Congress to ban the practice of delaying votes with filibusters and to grant him the power to reject individual provisions of government spending bills so he could prevent future budget problems.

According to Trump, only President Barack Obama has signed a larger spending bill.

“And I’m sure he wasn’t too happy about it, either,” Trump said.

The spending bill passed the House 256-167 on Thursday, and passed the Senate 65-32 early Friday.

Following a tweetstorm Friday, Musk proceeded to remove the official pages for SpaceX and Tesla from the social media platform, each of which had about 2.6 million followers and pretty engaged audiences.

Not done there, Musk also pulled his own personal Facebook page and that of Tesla-owned SolarCity as well.

The actions were well-received on Twitter, where the multibillionaire also sarcastically called out the speaker-manufacturing company Sonos, which pledged Friday to pull its ads from Facebook and other digital companies ― but only for a week.

Wow, a whole week. Risky ... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018

Brian Acton, co-founder of the now-Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp (and no friend of Facebook), endorsed Musk’s digital tirade with the hashtag #DeleteFacebook, to which Musk responded, “What’s Facebook?”

As other followers encouraged him to wipe more and more of his footprint from the site, he happily obliged:

Musk followed through on his promises. Soon after making the statements, all of the pages disappeared from Facebook. In their place, only an error message remained: “Sorry, this content isn’t available right now.”

While his Facebook presence wasn’t worth a second thought, Musk drew the line at deleting his Instagram account, a Facebook-owned platform where he shares updates with just under 7 million followers.Bolton’s espousing those ideas as a pundit on Fox News was dangerous and offensive enough. But as President Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Bolton’s warped worldview could shape U.S. policy.

Here are some of the main responsibilities of the National Security Council and why the role of the national security adviser is so important.

What does the National Security Council do?

President Harry Truman created the NSC in 1947 as an advisory body on national security and foreign policy matters. The council consists of the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense, treasury secretary and a national security adviser, who gets appointed by the president directly.

The NSC serves as the primary coordinator of national security and foreign policy proposals from other agencies around the federal government. Its staff produces intelligence reports, briefings and research on these issues.

But the influence of the national security apparatus varies from administration to administration as it adapts to the personality of the president, David Rothkopf, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, explained in 2008. The national security adviser’s power also depends on the president.

The national security adviser briefs the president on the NSC’s findings and helps to shape policy around them. This official is supposed to manage the national security and foreign policy information going to the president and then communicate the president’s decisions on how to respond to situations around the world to the relevant federal agencies.

How important is the national security adviser’s role?

The clout that he or she wields is heavily dependent on the person’s relationship to the president. In the Nixon and Carter administrations, Rothkopf noted, national security advisers positioned themselves to influence the president more than their counterparts at the State Department. Henry Kissinger was famously close to Richard Nixon. Under George W. Bush, Rothkopf said, the most important foreign policy actor was not national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, but Vice President Dick Cheney.

What kind of relationship Trump will form with Bolton is not clear yet. The two men have reportedly been discussing the possibility of Bolton’s new role for weeks, and Bolton promised Trump “he wouldn’t start any wars” if he was selected, according to CNN. (A source close to Bolton reportedly denied he made any such pledge.) Although Bolton has been a marginal figure in politics for years, he has been a frequent Fox News analyst. A White House official told Politico that the president was impressed by Bolton’s “many appearances on Fox News” and that helped clinch the job.

While Trump is reportedly not a fan of Bolton’s facial hair, he hasn’t voiced any public concern about Bolton’s notoriously hawkish views, which don’t align with the isolationist foreign policy platform that Trump campaigned on.

What troubles the experts about Bolton is that over his three-decade career in government, he largely supported military answers to foreign policy questions, instead of diplomacy. And since Trump reportedly doesn’t read his own daily intelligence reports and largely relies on oral briefings, or cable news, for gathering and assessing information about the world, Bolton may play an outsized role in the formation of U.S. policy.

Who is the typical contender for the job?

There have been 26 national security advisers to the president. The first was Robert Cutler, a lawyer, War Department official and campaign adviser who served twice in the Eisenhower administration.

The position has since been filled by generals and diplomats alike, some lauded and some not ― from Kissinger (who served Nixon and Gerald Ford), to Gen. Colin Powell (under Ronald Reagan), to Condoleezza Rice (the first woman), to Susan Rice (under Barack Obama), to former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s first pick who had the shortest tenure of any of them.
