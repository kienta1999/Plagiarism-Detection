“The road to hell is a lot scarier when you realize you had this chance to get off of it at some point, and you didn’t recognize it,” Bruce Miller, showrunner of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” told me.

It was hard not to wonder whether he was talking about the fictional world of Gilead or America in 2018.

“The Handmaid’s Tale” ― a show that can feel terrifyingly on-the-nose ― is set in a brutal dystopian future in which childbearing women’s bodies are treated as reproductive hosts for the theocratic society’s most powerful (cis, white, male, Christian) leaders. Now in its sophomore season, the Hulu show is exploring what happens to Offred (Elisabeth Moss) and her friends after the events laid out in the Margaret Atwood novel upon which the series is based.

Season 2, which premiered on April 25, offers up more information about the creation of Gilead, the colonies that subsidize it, and the internal dynamics of the punishing society.

Ahead of the premiere, HuffPost spoke with Miller about the pressures of offering definitive answers to a beloved feminist story, the Me Too movement’s influence on the production of the show, and why the show is watchable despite being the most stressful thing on television.

Season one of “The Handmaid’s Tale” essentially ended where Margaret Atwood’s novel did. I’d love to hear from you a little bit about the process of creating Season 2 where there was no Atwood roadmap.

I think there was an Atwood roadmap. We’re certainly living in her world ― the world that she created with the characters she created. Even more important, there’s that kind of Atwood-ness, the way the stories are told and what themes they explore. We tried very hard to get our heads around that the first season so that we could continue that in the second season. Normally, in a television show, you don’t have anything to go on. The other thing [is], I read the book a long time ago. Everybody I know who reads the book is furious when it ends, because they’re dying to know what happens next. I spent 35 years thinking about Season 2, since I read the book.

Well, in Season 2 we get a definitive answer to the question of what happens next. The book, however, ends on a note where you can interpret it in many ways. Were you at all nervous about the responsibility of giving that answer?

I’ll give you two answers. First of all, I’m nervous about everything. I’m a guy adapting one of the great feminist works of forever, who the hell do I think I am? Of course I’m nervous. I’m nervous all the time.

But in this case, I think that Margaret was so encouraging to me and to the writing staff, so enthusiastic about the stuff that we were coming up with, very encouraging to us to break rules and go in this direction and that direction. She’s such a storyteller, such a writer’s writer. In some ways we were more nervous about mucking up her vision of the future, her vision of the world, but in the end, that really gave us a lot of confidence to move forward and say, OK, the person who created this world is not trying to break down our office and beat us with a stick. Maybe we’re coming up with stuff that could be good.

So, yes, you’re terrified. It’s scary to start out adapting such a sacred book, and then it’s terrifying to continue to adapt [it], especially after people liked the first season. If people hate the first season, there’s nothing to lose. People like it, they want to see what happens next, and we want to make sure that they are satisfied.

How much was Margaret Atwood involved in plotting out this season?

As much as I could possibly pull her off her ... [pauses] She has this whole other job as an author.

Right, that.

Margaret and I started talking about Season 2 really halfway through Season 1. Once you start planning in your head how Season 1 might end ― and I knew where it was going to end ― I started to talk to her about things that I thought I might do. She was close to the writers at the beginning of the season. I think she’s a little busier this year, but she still reads every script and every outline and calls with thoughts and sees cuts as they get finished.

I take as much time as I can get. I want to grow up to be Margaret. We’re excited by any involvement she’s willing to bestow upon us. It’s obviously essential. It’s beyond counsel. This is Margaret’s world, we just live in it.

At the Women in the World conference, Margaret Atwood said that her one rule for Season 2, which is obviously the same rule she had for the book, was that everything had to have actually happened somewhere, sometime. Can you reveal any specific examples from Season 2 that you drew from history or current events?

I am a very strict adherent to her philosophy. It was something she used for the book. It’s what keeps [the show] from turning into torture pornography, and we’re not interested in making something that’s torturous for the sake of being torturous. I would be sick to my stomach if that’s what we ended up doing. We definitely try to show as little as possible when we do those things. Just enough to tell the story and make the emotions hit.

But there’s a scene very late in the season where two people get thrown in a swimming pool with their legs tied to weights. It’s a very updated version of a very old concept ― they would have wells where they would throw the witches. They would throw them in there, I think [they were called] dunking wells, to drown them. That’s how they would execute women, [because it] was considered nicer. No hanging or cutting heads off. No blood. Which to me just sounds like a horrible misunderstanding of what it probably feels like to drown.

Our modern version is in a swimming pool and they’re chained to kettlebells. The type you’d find at the gym. It’s updated in a horrible way, but it’s very much tied to a legal remedy that’s been around for a very long time, focused very much on women.

“I always feel like the show is hopeful because our world is not Gilead. It always makes me feel like, wow, if Offred could make a stand and try to change things in her world, what am I doing sitting on the couch? I should be able to change things in my world.” - Bruce Miller, Showrunner of "The Handmaid's Tale"

Are we going to see more about the way that racial dynamics operate in Gilead this season?

Absolutely. When we adapted the book, I made the decision to not make it an all-white world, as it was in the book, but to add diversity into Gilead to make it represent people of color visually and narratively in that world. We’ve been lucky that we have amazing characters and amazing actors and so we’re able to follow lots of different characters and we do that a lot more this season. The first season was so focused on Offred.

I know that there was criticism in the first season [about how the show handled race]. I think me and all the writers took that to heart. It was very reasoned, thoughtful ― the internet gets a bad rap, but boy, they were very thoughtful and smart and polite and interested and seemingly trying to be helpful. It was a very helpful conversation for us to witness.

Moving forward, we’re trying more and more to integrate race into the stories and address race in the stories, and I think we’ll hopefully keep improving. I think we did better this year than last year, and we’re always energized that there’s places to go in the show. The last thing we want to do is ignore something interesting. So, in a show that covers religion and women’s sovereignty over their own bodies and politics, we certainly have a lot of heavy loads. It’s always daunting to take on even those, but we’re thrilled that we have interesting places to go in Gilead still.

Last year, watching the show, it felt sometimes terrifyingly on-the-nose. Do you feel like this season is going to resonate with audiences in that same eerie, prescient way?

God, it would be so lovely if it was completely irrelevant. That would be really, really nice. It’s hard for me to comment on how people are going to consume the show and how they’re going to put it in their life and how it’s going to affect them. [Season 2] certainly affected me more than Season 1.

I think it’s partially because we’re getting revelations all the time about what kind of government we have, and I think those revelations can’t help but make you think about what’s happening in Gilead and how the precursors to an upheaval in government, what they feel like to go through. We cover that a bit more in Season 2, the lead-up to Gilead. I certainly couldn’t watch the season without feeling those connections, but I’m not going to tell anybody else what connections to feel. If they don’t see it and they get something else out of the show, God bless. I just want them to feel something.

The world of “The Handmaid’s Tale” is really bleak in a lot of ways, but the arc of Season 1, in some capacity, felt like it was leading toward hopefulness. Did you worry at all about having to undo that hopefulness for Season 2?

I worried about it and I didn’t want to do it. I don’t like that two steps forward, one step back, just to reset so you can have another season that has the same dynamics. I think that Offred is confronted by moments where she pushes and she has small victories and big victories, and she had lots of them in Season 1. Much of the impossible becomes possible. She never thought she’d see Moira again, she never thought she’d see her daughter again, and those things happened. So I think that even though things get difficult and they ebb and flow on levels of difficulty, I don’t think she was deterred in her hope, in general.

The most inspiring thing about her is that she has her snarky sense of humor, her internal voice. June is very much alive in there and very much strong and still planning and scheming ― and trying to live, not just survive. So as long as we have that, I think we have hope.

I always feel like the show is hopeful because our world is not Gilead. It always makes me feel like, wow, if Offred could make a stand and try to change things in her world, what am I doing sitting on the couch? I should be able to change things in my world. My world’s a lot easier and more friendly and less dangerous than her world. Every time she survives at the end of the episode gives me hope.

As you alluded to, it feels like complacency in the face of rights being encroached upon is one of the themes of Season 2. Is there anything you hope that audiences might take away from seeing the pre-Gilead flashbacks? They sometimes feel more terrifying than the dystopian future.

I agree. Her flashbacks in the book always felt more terrifying. The road to hell is a lot scarier when you realize you had this chance to get off of it at some point and you didn’t recognize it. I’m sure we’re not trying to instruct people on what to do, but you can lay out in a TV show: This is what happened to Offred because she acted in a certain way. That’s the only lesson I can try to lay out, is a lesson for Offred in this particular position.

That I think people extrapolate [from] and generalize to their own lives, is something I don’t feel comfortable doing. That feels like I’m mansplaining the show, trying to shove it down their throats in a certain way and I would hate to do that.

Do you feel like the Me Too movement informed anything about the marketing or the production of this season?

Absolutely. The Me Too movement ― it was our industry. It’s central to who we are, and it’s our friends who were being victimized and our friends who were being accused and having their careers shortened. I know personally as a white guy, I feel like an idiot. You feel like all this stuff was going on in front of your eyes and you didn’t see it and it was happening to the people you are closest to, the people you work with for years and years and you just feel like, how much did I miss?

I go through a lot in my life thinking “what an idiot you’re being,” but this was a particularly bad one. It makes you feel like you’re blind to the stuff that really matters about those people’s lives. Not only was it happening, but they felt, if you didn’t recognize it, they felt like they couldn’t say anything because either [people felt] like it didn’t matter or it was too painful. So the first feeling for me was just shame of being a part of it, a player in a system, and not recognizing how terrible it was being to some people.

I think that our show, we were in a lucky position, because we were already trying so hard for diversity, especially diversity of gender. We had taken a lot of strides for storytelling, narrative reasons that I think would have been the strides I would try to take if the Me Too movement had happened and I had been on another show. We were already trying to hire as many women for as many key positions as possible, just because it was important to our show and our storytelling.

Well thank you so much for chatting with me, I’m excited about this season.

Thank you. Get a bottle of scotch.

I’m stressed out but I’m excited.

That’s perfect. That’s just what I’m looking for.The rapper tweeted on Wednesday that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, had instructed him to make it “clear to everyone” that he doesn’t “agree with everything Trump does.”

He also said he doesn’t “agree 100%” with anyone but himself.

my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018

West said shortly before, “You don’t have to agree with trump but the mob can’t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone.”

To that, Trump quote-tweeted his gratitude, calling the praise “very cool”:

Thank you Kanye, very cool! https://t.co/vRIC87M21X — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2018

West shared a series of stream-of-consciousness thoughts on social media Wednesday.

He also shared an image of a Trump-signed MAGA hat:

my MAGA hat is signed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/DrDHJybS8V — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018

Last week, the “Famous” singer came back to Twitter after a long hiatus to announce new music with Kid Cudi, Nas and his G.O.O.D. Music labelmates. Since then, he’s been sporadically sharing wisdom, snapshots of his upcoming Yeezy season, snapshots of his home, and his thoughts on Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Arguably the most alarming thing West has shared in the last few days has included recommendations to listen to right-wing activist Candace Owens and snippets of a 22-minute video by Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind “Dilbert” and an “alt-right hero” who has previously shared dismissive views about women.

This last behavior by West even prompted a tweet of support from InfoWars’ Alex Jones.

.@kanyewest I admire your bold moves against the thought police. And if you want to see these control-freak vampires really go crazy, please join me on my broadcast!👌 — Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) April 23, 2018

Kardashian West has responded playfully to many of her huband’s tweets, but hasn’t commented on anything said about alt-right-affiliated figures. She also hasn’t indicated whether or not she found her husband’s effort to clarify his views sufficient.

However, she did respond to the media’s reactions to West’s tweets and fiercely defended his expressiveness:

To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 25, 2018

Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye’s mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I’m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 25, 2018

He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 25, 2018

Now when he spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions,even if really different from mine

He never said he agrees with his politics — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 25, 2018

Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that’s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren’t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 25, 2018

Mental Health is no joke and the media needs to stop spitting that out so casually. Bottom line — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 25, 2018

Fans and Twitter users alike have long tried to deduce what West’s odd Twitter habits really mean. Some have even wondered if the musician is preparing to set his sights on the presidency. Thus far, there is no clear-cut reason, but perhaps The New Yorker summed it up the best:

Perhaps what we’re actually learning is something we already knew: that people are complex and inconsistent.There’s basically been one thing on the minds of all of Asian Twitter, and that’s “Crazy Rich Asians.”

Since the release of the film’s trailer on Monday, which preceded a few advanced screenings this week, Asian-Americans are using social media to express just how much the movie means to them.

After all, with a more than two-decade gap since the release of “The Joy Luck Club,” the last Hollywood film featuring an Asian-majority cast that isn’t a period piece, the hype is completely understandable.

#CrazyRichAsians is the kind of big, beautiful, vibrant rom-com Hollywood needs; the kind it hasn’t seen (or done well) in a while. That’s why it works. And it happens to star a big, beautiful, vibrant ensemble of Asians. Global Asians! All kinds of Asians. That’s why it matters. — jen yamato (@jenyamato) April 24, 2018

Some pointed out how refreshing it is to see three-dimensional Asian characters on screen, while others noted the film’s characters depart from stereotypes. A few people even mentioned how the upcoming movie could inspire younger generations to embrace their heritage.

Here's the thing - first Asian American female protagonist in 25 years, since Joy Luck Club. Sure, the storyline was satire on late stage capitalism in Asia, but also gratuitous hot Asian men abs.

For Asian-Americans, securing proper representation in Hollywood has been a struggle. Research on diversity in Hollywood found that barely more than 3 percent of film roles in 2016 went to Asian actors. In contrast, more than 78 percent went to white actors.

It’s about time Hollywood released another movie with an Asian-majority cast because, as sociologist Nancy Wang Yuen points out, inclusive Asian-American representation in media skipped an entire generation.

AdvertisementThe show is no stranger to revisiting other time periods or flashing forward into the future, but the 1980s is a particularly special time for the series.

Season three’s critically acclaimed “San Junipero” took place in 1987 and featured shoulder pads, big hair, and Belinda Carlisle galore.

It’s not clear what the storyline of this episode will be about, but one Twitter user shared this image that may hint at the episode’s name: Bandersnatch.The mother of Michael Brown, the unarmed black 18-year-old who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2014, says she wants to run for City Council in her home city of Ferguson, Missouri.

“What I’m contemplating is running for City Council of Ferguson,” Brown’s mother, Lezley McSpadden, said during a panel on police brutality at Harvard University on Monday.

McSpadden’s announcement was met with a roar of applause from the crowd and a “Run, Lezley! Run!” chant, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

“We have to get behind people who look like us and get them in these elected seats so that they can really do what’s right by the community,” she added. “And I’m going to start with me by running for Ferguson City Council.”

McSpadden’s family attorney, Benjamin Crump, was also on the panel Monday evening, Mother Jones reported. Crump represented Brown’s parents, McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. after he was killed. Currently, Crump is also representing the family of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old unarmed black father who was shot and killed by police in March.

The lawyer pointed out just how powerful it would be for McSpadden to be elected to Ferguson’s City Council.

AdvertisementPolice say a man is in custody who may be responsible for a series of 12 homicides and 45 rapes across California nearly five decades ago.

Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested in Sacramento County on Tuesday on suspicion of murder in two of the unsolved cases, according to The Daily Beast.

Billy Jensen, a co-author of a book about the case, told The Daily Beast that DeAngelo has not been “confirmed” as the man responsible for the serial killings, but that “it looks good.”

The so-called Golden State Killer stoked fears throughout the 1970s and ’80s. The case received renewed media attention earlier this year with the publication of the book I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, by the late Michelle McNamara.

Amazon.com

For years, McNamara immersed herself in the mystery of the Golden State Killer. She visited crime scenes and interviewed detectives and survivors. She died in 2016 at age 46, prior to the book’s publication.

In January, the comedian Patton Oswalt, who was married to McNamara, announced the release of the book, telling his Facebook followers he hoped it would help crack the case.

“I can’t help feeling that somewhere, in her final pages, she left enough clues for someone to finish the job she couldn’t — to put California’s worst serial killer behind bars,” he wrote.

Jensen, who helped posthumously publish McNamara’s book, reportedly told The Daily Beast the identity of the suspect.

Authorities in Sacramento have yet to comment on the development. A press conference has been scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.Reason No. 3489543 to stan Ariana Grande:

The pop star typically isn’t one to clap back or respond to rumors on social media, but a tweet from a fan must’ve seriously rubbed her the wrong way.

On Wednesday, Grande, who recently split with rapper Mac Miller, issued a lengthy response to a follower who called the celebrity breakup “heartbreaking,” given Miller’s legal troubles of late.

Days after their split, Miller was charged with DUI and hit and run after police said he struck a power pole and fled the scene in California’s San Fernando Valley. According to TMZ, the rapper blew twice the legal limit when authorities arrested him later at this home.

“Mac Miller totalling his G wagon and getting a DUI after Ariana Grande dumped him for another dude after he poured his heart out on a ten song album to her called the divine feminine is just the most heartbreaking thing happening in Hollywood,” the fan wrote on Twitter.

Cue Grande with the classiest comeback we’ve seen in a while.

“How absurd that you minimize female self-respect and self-worth by saying someone should stay in a toxic relationship because he wrote an album about them, which btw isn’t the case,” she wrote. “I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be.”

The “No Tears Left To Cry” singer went onto note that she’s been taking care of Miller for years, but never revealed “how hard or scary” things became.

“Shaming/blaming women for a man’s inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem. let’s please stop doing that,” she added. “I will continue to pray from the bottom of my heart that he figures it all out and that any other women in this position does as well.”

The fan later issued a lengthy apology to Grande, explaining that he never intended to blame her for Miller’s “shortcomings.”

Grande responded in kind, thanking him for “hearing” her.

thank you for hearing me, i appreciate your response v much. ☁️ sending u love. — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 23, 2018

Grande this month addressed reports that she and Miller had split, calling “The Way” collaborator “one of my best friends in the whole world.”

“I respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us,” she wrote on social media alongside a picture of the couple in happier times.With the onset of May comes the end of this lingering cold weather (fingers crossed). No more will you have to continue to bundle up in your overpriced apartment for which you can’t afford heat so instead you wear large gloves over your fingers that make it near, but not quite impossible, to use your remote. Watching Netflix is about to become a whole lot easier.

And that’s just great, because Netflix is adding quite a few shows and movies in May that will be worth your time, regardless of how nice it is outside.

As usual, Netflix adds the bulk of new movies on the first of the month. So on May 1, you’ll be able to watch options like “Amélie” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.” You could also try to break the record for watching “Shrek” the most times in a row. There doesn’t seem to be an official record yet, but please write in with proof if you get to an impressive number.

Netflix also adds quite a few Originals. The returns of “Dear White People” and “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” are exciting. John Mulaney has a stand-up special. And Netflix has multiple dystopia stories for you to maybe help you forget about the bad apartment situation thing.

One of those dystopia projects, “Anon,” is a promising-looking movie starring Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried. Netflix has had about a zero out of 1,000 success rate for their big-budget sci-fi/dystopia thrillers actually being good. But maybe, just maybe, this will end up being worthwhile.

Netflix also loses quite a few movies this month, including “Ocean’s 11” and “The Hurt Locker” on May 1. And on May 2, Netflix loses both “Camp Rock” and “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” so watch those while you can.

No, that wasn’t a nostalgia-induced fever dream ― Disney is actually moving forward with a “Kim Possible” live-action movie, and now we know who’ll we’ll have to call or beep if we wanna reach them.

Newcomer Sadie Stanley, 16, has landed the role of high school student by day and international super spy by night ― Kim Possible ― after her first-ever audition. “The Goldbergs” star Sean Giambrone, 18, will play her sidekick and possible love interest, Ron Stoppable.

“Sadie delivers Kim’s confidence, smarts, and agility; most importantly, she’s an everyday girl with an extraordinary spirit,” Disney Channel’s senior vice president of casting and talent relations, Judy Taylor, said in a statement. “Sean is such a magnetic actor; he always finds the right balance of physical comedy and heart. We’re excited for audiences to see Sadie and Sean bring these iconic roles to life.”

The live-action "Kim Possible" film starring Sadie Stanley in the title role and Sean Giambrone as her pal is planned for release in 2019. Disney

Disney announced it was reviving the classic TV show as a live-action movie in February, with series’ creators Mark McCorkle and Robert Schooley penning a script, as well as executive producing the project.

Premiering in 2002, the animated series ran for 87 episodes and proved popular enough to spawn two made-for-TV animated movies, “Kim Possible: A Stitch in Time in 2003” and 2005's “Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama.”

To help drum up excitement for the upcoming film, the network also released a video featuring original “Kim Possible” stars Christy Carlson Romano and Will Friedle jokingly auditioning for the show.

No word yet on who will play Possible’s nemeses, Dr. Drakken and Shego, or the how the rest of Team Possible will shake out, but fingers crossed they find some way to make a naked mole-rat top billing.President Donald Trump repeatedly vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign that he’d only hire “the best people in the world” for his administration. Now, with many of his “best people’ ousted from the Cabinet and other high-level positions, CNN’s Anderson Cooper is wondering what happened to that pledge.

“If the president hires only the best people, why aren’t they still on the job?” Cooper asked on Tuesday night. “Why have so many left the administration? Why are others serving under ethical clouds? Why are some facing so much difficulty getting confirmed?”

Cooper’s comments came amid allegations regarding the conduct of Dr. Ronny Jackson, Trump’s physician and nominee to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson’s confirmation hearings have been postponed while the allegations are investigated.A self-declared Bible “researcher” and conspiracy theorist who has predicted a number of failed doomsday dates is trying a new tack. Instead of giving a date, he’s giving a range.

David Meade, whose views fall well outside mainstream Christianity, told the Guardian that the biblical “rapture” will take place at some point between May and December of this year. When that happens, the world won’t end but rather the faithful will be plucked off the Earth, leaving the rest behind for seven years of tribulation. Then, he said, there will be 1,000 years of peace and prosperity before the world actually ends, which would occur by the year 3025, give or take.

“So the world isn’t ending anytime soon – in our lifetimes, anyway,” Meade assured the Guardian.

Meade previously predicted the world would end on Sept. 23, 2017. At the time, he didn’t offer a specific form of apocalypse. In the past, however, Meade has used “numerical codes” found in the Bible and claimed that a secret planet called Nibiru was on a collision course with Earth.

Zero astronomers believed Meade’s theory.

“There is no factual basis for these claims,” NASA said in a statement when doomsday predictions involving Nibiru made headlines in 2012.

Mainstream Christians have also distanced themselves from Meade.When “ Black Panther” fans first started calling Letitia Wright a Disney princess , the actress admits she was confused: Would her character, Shuri, the teen genius princess of Wakanda, actually qualify for the title? In a conversation with Yahoo Entertainment, the “ Avengers: Infinity War” star said that she soon embraced the label, thanks to the fans who “owned it and celebrated it.”

Not that she was entirely unaware of her connection to Disney’s classic heroines. Back in February, one Twitter user noticed that two of Shuri’s “Black Panther″ hairstyles were very similar to those worn by Princess Leia in the original “Star Wars.” Wright told Yahoo Entertainment that at least one of those homages was entirely intentional. One day on set, Wright’s hairstylist was playing with putting her hair in buns when director Ryan Coogler walked in and remarked, “Hey, you look like Princess Leia! You gonna wear that?” Wright played coy, but says she “turned up on set with my Princess Leia buns — and he loved it.”Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk laughs after President Donald Trump says at a White House youth forum on March 22 that if he could go back in time and give himself advice at age 25, it would be to not run for president. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

Turning Point USA, a nonprofit founded in 2012 by then-19-year-old Charlie Kirk, has exploded in the Trump era. With a stated goal of training “students to promote the principles of freedom, free markets, and limited government” but a practical goal of antagonizing as many of those students’ liberal peers as possible, the group is uniquely poised to capitalize on the fresh belligerence of a new generation of young Republicans.

Such as the group’s former national field director, Crystal Clanton, who once texted a fellow Turning Point employee: “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all . . . I hate blacks. End of story.”

Or the woman who effectively replaced her, 22-year-old Shialee Grooman, who tweeted in 2013, “All I get is nigger dick.”

As its star has risen, Turning Point has found itself constantly beset with its employees’ racist comments. Some people get fired over them. Some simply delete their old tweets — whether to hide them from the public or their own organization, it’s not clear.

There are real stakes now for an organization that styles itself as a grassroots opposition to the supposed monolithic liberalism of college campuses. Turning Point has closely aligned itself with the Trump administration. Kirk interviewed the president at last month’s White House youth forum, while Donald Trump Jr. attended Kirk’s 24th birthday celebration, along with former deputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka.

In December, Jane Mayer of the New Yorker reported that the group engaged in the sort of political activity barred by campaign finance laws governing charitable organizations. Mayer also unearthed the “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE” text from Clanton. Kirk told Mayer that the group “took decisive action” within 72 hours of being told about the texts; presumably he meant firing Clanton, who left the company shortly thereafter. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, Kirk then replaced Clanton with two people: Grooman, installed as field operations manager, and Troy Meeker, 24, who became leadership operations director.

Grooman, it turns out, has plenty of baggage of her own.

Grooman has since deleted her Twitter account entirely. Screenshots of the tweets, which were live as of early April, were given to HuffPost by someone who asked to be identified as an “activist.” Vestiges of Grooman’s Twitter activity can still be found in the remaining halves of the conversations shown in the screenshots. (Grooman went by @FreezingArizona on Twitter before changing her username to @shiiialee.)

Twitter

At the time of publication, Grooman’s LinkedIn profile still listed Turning Point as her current employer, but in a statement to HuffPost, Kirk referred to her as a “former employee”:

This is the only question we will be issuing a statement on and only question addressing: These are unconfirmed tweets, alleged to be written by a former employee of Turning Point USA which predates her employment with our organization.

According to a second source who also asked to remain anonymous, the tweets were concerning enough to Turning Point USA that they occasioned a memo, sent April 12.

TPUSA

According to the person who provided the memo, Grooman has still been answering Turning Point-related calls and emails, after the release of the April 12 memo. HuffPost followed up with Kirk to clarify when, exactly, Grooman left and under what circumstances; we’ll update if we hear back. Grooman has not responded to multiple requests for comment.

Meeker, the other half of the duo who replaced Clanton, has had to delete at least one tweet of his own. According to his LinkedIn profile, he remains employed by Turning Point.

Twitter

Meanwhile, Turning Point’s Midwest regional manager, Timon Prax, was allegedly forced to leave about a month ago. According to our activist source, it was over his use of bigoted language in tweets and texts.

Twitter

Prax, whose Twitter account has been suspended, was worse in text messages, according to the source. “He used the n-word with the hard R nonstop, made fun of black people and referred to them as slaves and made fun of the mentally disabled,” said the source, who shared several screenshots with HuffPost on the condition that we not publish them.

Prax has since publicly posted on his Facebook that he’s accepted a job as social media director at the Rabine Group. The Rabine Group is owned by Gary Rabine, a current member of Turning Point’s advisory council.

Turning Point is a little more comfortable with other kinds of racial provocation. The group has been in the spotlight recently thanks to Kanye West’s praise on Twitter of Candace Owens, the organization’s director of urban engagement and one of its few black employees.

I love the way Candace Owens thinks — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 21, 2018

Kanye was likely responding to a recent video of Owens that had gone viral in which she says: “There is an ideological civil war happening: Black people that are focused on their past and shouting about slavery and black people that are focused on their futures, OK? That’s really what it comes down to, OK? .... And it’s embarrassing that you utilize their history, you utilize their history and you come in here with more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it. You’re not living through anything right now. You’re overly privileged Americans.”

Like Owens, many of Turning Point’s members often lean on the refrain that racism as liberals understand it simply doesn’t exist in the modern world. If only its own employees would stop proving them wrong.Disney fans can now wear their Pride on their ears.

Earlier this month, the company, which has been steadily increasing its representation of the LGBTQ community in television and film, debuted rainbow-colored Mickey Mouse ears for sale at its U.S. theme parks. The ears arrived just ahead of Pride month in June.

The merchandise has been spotted at both California’s Disneyland and the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida.

Images of the ears, officially known as the “Mickey Mouse Rainbow Love” hat, have popped up across social media as of late. However, it doesn’t appear among the items for sale on the official Disneyland or Walt Disney World websites.

A post shared by Joey Graceffa (@joeygraceffa) on Apr 24, 2018 at 2:49pm PDT

Meanwhile, actor, singer and YouTube personality Joey Graceffa wore a pair of the rainbow-printed ears in a video posted Monday that documented a recent trip to Disneyland with his boyfriend, Daniel Preda, and Daniel’s nephew, Luca. The clip, which can be viewed above, had received over 260,000 views as of Wednesday morning.

Travel vlogger Gio Spano also picked up a pair during a recent visit to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. The cap, Spano said, retails at the park for $17.99.

When asked for comment on the ears, a Disney spokesperson told HuffPost, “We offer a wide range of merchandise items that appeal to guests of diverse backgrounds.”

Disney has always enjoyed a sizable LGBTQ following, and its theme parks have been the setting for a number of same-sex proposals and weddings over the years. Still, the company has never officially sanctioned “Gay Days,” an annual Pride-like celebration that draws thousands of queer visitors to its U.S. resorts each year.When you book a hotel room, you know you’re signing up to stay in a space where hundreds and maybe even thousands of people have stayed before you. It’s not news that previous guests leave germs behind, but you might be surprised to learn where those germs are lurking.

With 14 to 16 rooms to clean in an eight-hour shift, hotel staff don’t usually get much time to clean a room, its linens and appliances from top to bottom ― roughly 30 minutes on average, or less during a busy season. (That’s why it’s important to tip the hotel’s cleaning crew if you’re satisfied with your room’s cleanliness.)

It’s also important to note that unless you have an immune deficiency, the germs you’ll find in your hotel room most likely aren’t dangerous. After all, you’re surrounded by bacteria and viruses everywhere you go, and your chances of getting sick from germs left by other hotel guests are low. Still, it’s important to take precautions and wash your hands regularly.

Here are five items in your room to keep your eye on:

The TV Remote

Admit it: Having access to premium TV channels in your hotel room can be pretty exciting. Or maybe you just like listening to the news or weather while you get ready in the morning. Whatever your preference, the TV remote is likely gross. Hundreds of hands have touched the device, and it’s probably not high on the housekeeping team’s long list of things to clean.

Jim Inglis, Valencia College’s program director for hospitality, told Click Orlando in 2015 that the remote control is usually “hands down No. 1” on the list of dirtiest spots in your hotel room.

That’s consistent with the findings of a team of researchers from the University of Houston, Purdue University and the University of South Carolina. After testing a variety of surfaces in hotel rooms in Texas, Indiana and South Carolina, the researchers reported in 2012 that along with the toilet and bathroom sink, the TV remote contained “high levels of bacterial contamination.”

The Bed Comforter or Duvet

Staff typically changes sheets between guests, but the turnaround for checking in new guests can be so fast that washing large comforters isn’t as easy. As we sleep, we release body oils and shed skin flakes, which can get on the bedspread along with bacteria we might be carrying.

Reneta McCarthy, a lecturer at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration, summed up the dilemma in 2011, telling CNN: “If you went through and you had a good system in place and you were trying to deep clean each of your rooms four times a year, is it possible that a bedspread might only be changed four times a year? Yeah, it is.”

Kelly Reynolds, an associate professor of environmental health at the University of Arizona, told Time magazine for a February article that if you want to stay away from germs on the bed, getting rid of the comforter is a good start.

“Your best bet is to avoid contact,” she said. “A lot of people will recommend just folding the bedspread back or throwing it on the chair and don’t use it while you’re there.”

Reynolds also said the carpet can be filled with germs, so maybe bring some slippers.

Drinking Glasses

Many hotels now include plastic cups for their guests. If your room includes glasses though, you might want to wipe them down before drinking from them ― especially if those glasses are kept in the bathroom.

A 2018 study confirmed that flushing the toilet can contaminate many other surfaces nearby. Reynolds told Time that if glasses (and similar items like coffee makers) aren’t properly sanitized with a disinfectant ― not just wiped down with a dry cloth ― they can be havens for germs.

What’s more, a 2008 investigation of hotel cleaning habits by Arizona’s ABC15 found that 11 of the 15 hotels it tested across the country did not remove dirty glasses from the rooms for additional cleaning.

Ice buckets might require a decent cleaning too. In 2007, Condé Nast Traveler found E. coli on ice buckets it tested from hotel rooms.

Lamp or Light Switch

The same research team that discovered bacteria on TV remotes also found heavy bacterial contamination on the bedside lamp switch in many hotel rooms. Similarly, as HuffPost explained in March, light switches, especially in the bathroom, are prone to collecting bacteria because of the many hands that touch them.

Housekeeping Materials

Before you say, “These weren’t in my room for very long,” hear us out.

The University of Houston-led research team found that in addition to the remotes and lamp switches and toilets, the housekeeping carts themselves harbor lots of bacteria. Duh, right?

Demonstrators waved blue and white Nicaraguan flags and chanted “President, get out!” as they rallied in several points around the capital of Managua. But the government kept police back from the demonstrations after the violence of recent days.

Protests began last week after the government of President Daniel Ortega, a former leftist guerrilla leader whom critics accuse of trying to build a family dictatorship, launched a plan to overhaul the Central American country’s welfare system.

The police crackdown on protesters and curbs on some media have fueled broader criticism of Ortega. On Sunday night, in an effort to calm the streets, Ortega said he had canceled the welfare-overhaul initiative.

Monday’s march, led by university students, was the largest seen in six days of protests, according to a Reuters witness. Demonstrators called for protesters jailed in the prior days to be released as well as an end to the Ortega government.

La Prensa, a conservative paper that has been a harsh critic of both Ortega and the previous regime he fought to overthrow, said he had “lost control of the streets.”

“Daniel Ortega no longer has the political capacity or moral authority to continue governing,” it wrote.

Police had clashed with students bunkered down at the Polytechnic University of Nicaragua on Sunday night, and one died after being shot while five others were treated for injuries, Bassett Guido, a Red Cross spokeswoman, told Reuters by telephone on Monday.

Guido said the Red Cross had registered nine deaths since the protests began Wednesday, and attended to 433 injured people. The Nicaraguan Center of Human Rights (CENIDH) said on Monday at least 25 people had died. Marlin Sierra, the director of the CENIDH, said 120 people had been arrested.

On Monday, the U.S. State Department authorized the departure of U.S. government employees and curbed consular services.

A State Department official said the embassy in Managua would shutter many of its operations until further notice but that it would continue to provide services to U.S. citizens and visa applicants.Movies about talking animals are typically innocuous, if not entirely forgettable (except, of course, if your name is Paddington), but “Show Dogs,” which hit theaters on Friday, has sparked criticism from parents and advocacy groups.

The film follows Max, a police dog (voiced by Ludacris) that infiltrates the world of elite dog shows alongside a human FBI agent (Will Arnett) to recover a kidnapped panda.

Some viewers have taken issue with multiple moments in the film when the canine’s genitals are touched in preparation for the final show ― first by Arnett’s character and later by judges, even though he’s clearly uncomfortable.

In these scenes, Max is told to go to a “zen place” while the inspection occurs, which, according to the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, sends “a troubling message that grooms children for sexual abuse.”

The nonprofit group released a statement condemning the messaging of the film, which is rated PG, given the age group of its intended viewers.

“Disturbingly, these are similar tactics child abusers use when grooming children — telling them to pretend they are somewhere else, and that they will get a reward for withstanding their discomfort,” Dawn Hawkins, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Children’s movies must be held to a higher standard, and must teach children bodily autonomy, the ability to say ‘no’ and safety, not confusing messages endorsing unwanted genital touching.”

The NCOSE has called on the filmmakers and studio to halt the distribution of the film until it’s recut without the objectionable scenes.

Concerned parents have also taken to social media to share their reactions to the film and warn others about the scenes in question. Some have called on the actors to speak up about the issue.

I'm sure many people will feel that #parents are being too over-the-top about skipping #ShowDogs, but kids soak in what they see. When I preach that their body is theirs alone, why would I sit & laugh at a movie implying it's OK/funny to "grin and bare" inappropriate touching? — Emily Stopher Joyner (@ItsMEEJYo) May 22, 2018

Please do not take your children to see #showdogs movie. It teaches children that touching of privates is okay and to go to a "zen place" when it happens. Child sex abuse is real. This is not okay. #showdogsmovie @arnettwill — Megan Nau (@NauMegan) May 22, 2018

Is the #Metoo movement going to have rallies and call for a boycott of @ShowDogsMov? Do they not care about children who are victims of pedophilia, or children who could be because #ShowDogs tells kids to accept being inappropriately touched? — Michelle Sabrosky (@3xthreatmomma) May 21, 2018

In response, Global Road Entertainment, the studio behind the film, has defended the scenes as a commonplace practice in these kinds of competitions.

“The dog show judging in this film is depicted completely accurately as done at shows around the world, and was performed by professional and highly respected dog show judges,” it said in a statement to CNN.

“Global Roads Entertainment and the filmmakers are saddened and apologize to any parent who feels the scene sends a message other than a comedic moment in the film, with no hidden or ulterior meaning, but respect their right to react to any piece of content.”

A writer for the film, Max Botkin, however, has since spoken out about the backlash, seemingly siding with concerned parties over the material.

“I absolutely condemn any suggestion or act of non-consensual touching in any form, as well as disassociation as a coping mechanism for abuse of any kind,” he said in a statement. “I understand and empathize with the parents’ and groups’ concerns regarding the message the movie may impart.”

UPDATE: In response to the backlash, Global Roads Entertainment has decided to recut the film without the controversial scenes for a nationwide release this weekend.
