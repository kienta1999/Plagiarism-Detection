Meeting real-life royalty is daunting even for the “Mother of Dragons” herself, Daenerys Targaryen.

“Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke has revealed how she came face to face with Prince William at a Kensington Palace shindig, and completely fluffed her lines.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” the actress said officials briefed her on how to act around the royal.

But “for whatever reason, probably because I was so scared, I couldn’t manage to get out ‘Your Royal Highness.’”

She ended up doing something like this:

Clarke appears in the upcoming movie “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” alongside Thandie Newton, Alden Ehrenreich, Donald Glover and Woody Harrelson. “Solo” hits screens May 25.

The actor-turned-artist seemingly took aim at former FBI Director James Comey with the new picture he shared online Monday:

The road to Trump’s White House was paved with good intentions. ;^\ pic.twitter.com/YzOnLjJsxk — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) April 23, 2018

The portrait shows a man who looks like Comey being told during confession: “Of course God forgives you, my son. But the rest of us aren’t quite there yet!”

The image is captioned: “The road to Trump’s White House was paved with good intentions.”

The caption appears to refer to Comey’s admission in his new book, A Higher Loyalty, that he believed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would defeat Trump in the 2016 election and that expectation may have influenced his handling of the investigation into her use of a private email server.

In recent weeks, Carrey has used his artwork to mock Trump, his allies and various members of his administration ― including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani:

"THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST WING AND PUTIN’S FLYING MONKEYS“ pic.twitter.com/slBG7j1s8d — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 19, 2018“For a long time, I was afraid to ask anyone to help me hold Mr. Lee accountable for how he treated me," said massage therapist Maria Carballo, who claims Stan Lee harassed and grabbed her during an appointment. Lee's lawyer dismissed the claims as a "shakedown." Jun Sato via Getty Images

Marvel Comics icon Stan Lee is being sued by Chicago-based massage therapist Maria Carballo for allegedly sexually harassing and grabbing her during two massage appointments last year.

Carballo’s complaint, filed Monday in Cook County circuit court, names Lee and his assistant Mac “Max” Anderson, who arranged the massage appointments. The complaint lists charges including assault, battery and emotional stress, and Carballo is seeking over $50,000 in damages, according to documents obtained by People.

Lee, 95, denied the allegations through his attorney Jonathan Freund, who told the Chicago Tribune that his client was shocked by the allegations.

“He is a high-profile public figure and I think it’s a shakedown,” Freund told the Chicago Tribune. “The guy is 95, I don’t think he would do that.”

Neither Lee or his attorney immediately responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.

According to the lawsuit, Lee hired Carballo to perform a two-hour massage on April 21, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Chicago while Lee was in town for an annual comic expo called C2E2. About a half hour into the massage, Carballo alleges that Lee “began to fondle himself” while he was face down on the table. Later in the appointment, Lee allegedly began moaning as Carballo massaged his legs. Carballo immediately became uncomfortable and ended the massage, the suit says.

The next day, Carballo says, her boss called her asking that she massage Lee again. She initially refused, but her boss pressed the issue by apologizing for Lee’s behavior and reiterating the importance of “appeasing VIP clients,” according to the complaint. Eventually, Carballo acquiesced because she was afraid she would lose her job, she says.

An hour into the massage on April 22, 2017, Carballo claims Lee began moaning again, at which time she attempted to end the massage. According to the complaint, Lee stood up, naked and angry, and demanded that Carballo continue the massage. She says she agreed to 10 more minutes, fearing what he would do if she did not continue.

Carballo switched to a shiatsu massage method, which uses only the masseur’s feet, in order to keep her distance, the Chicago Tribune reports. According to the lawsuit, “Lee grabbed [Carballo’s] foot and moved it against his penis and scrotum.” Carballo says she immediately ended the massage, collected $240 for the appointment and left. Before she got on the elevator, Lee’s assistant allegedly gave her a big tip in cash.

She did not report the incident because she was “fearful that, in light of Lee’s wealth and status, reporting the incident to police would hurt her job,” the lawsuit states.

“For a long time, I was afraid to ask anyone to help me hold Mr. Lee accountable for how he treated me. He is rich and famous. I am not,” Carballo said in a statement provided to Page Six. “After seeing other women fight to be treated with dignity and respect, I decided, me too. I am still nervous and afraid, but not as much as I was before because I have other people helping me.”

Lee’s business partner, Keya Morgan, told TMZ that Lee is “completely harmless” and “100 percent innocent.”Rihanna sure didn’t have love on the brain when Chris Rock attempted to flirt with her.

The comedian was on “The Tonight Show” Tuesday with Adam Sandler to promote their new Netflix movie “The Week Of” when host Jimmy Fallon mentioned he had seen Rock’s new stand-up act, “Tambourine,” live at Madison Square Garden.

“Every single thing was good. ... I don’t know if you want to tell any one ― the Rihanna story is one of my favorites,” Fallon said to Rock.

“The Rihanna story?” Rock stammered. “About me trying to talk to Rihanna ’cause I thought, ‘Hey! I’m single now! Let me give it a go!’”

Before jumping into the story, Rock took a moment to reflect and figure out how to best articulate the experience. It ended up looking like this:

The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon

“Like, I couldn’t tell how old I was,” Rock said. “Rihanna is so fine if she didn’t sing her life would be exactly the same. She’d have clothing lines, people would be asking for autographs.”

When Fallon mentioned that it would still be cool to be hit on by someone as iconic as Rock, the comedian quipped, “Oh, that did not register at all.”

He then relayed the incident.

“She’s like, ‘Have you seen Ray J?’ [I was like], ‘Who Ray J?’ Like, ‘Fuck Ray J!’ [She looked at me] like I was one of her aunts. Like, she didn’t even register me as a sexual being,” he said.

He went on to explain that when a woman rejects you sexually, “at least she thought about having sex with you.”

“Like, she contemplated sex with you and was like, ‘Naaaaaah.’ But I was like in the uncle zone.”For Kevin Hart, art is imitating life.

The comedian stars in his friend J. Cole’s new video for “Kevin’s Heart,” a song about fighting off the urge to cheat. In the song, the rapper references Hart’s infidelities.

The video alludes to what the famous 38-year-old’s everyday life looked like after one of his cheating scandals broke — from people staring at him in the supermarket and fending off women’s advances, to strangers offering him unsolicited advice in public bathrooms.

While the content of the five-minute video stems from a pretty serious place, Hart manages to inject a good amount of humor into his performance. At the end of the video, the comedian notices something in the sky, laughs and then continues walking. As he exits the frame, it is revealed that the phrase “Choose Wisely” is written in the sky — a nod to Hart’s past bad decisions.Anthony Hopkins is a venerable star of stage and screen, and now of the strangest selfie video you may ever see.

Oscar worthy — Young Curry (@CurryCreworDie) April 23, 2018Jazz musician Bob Dorough, the chief composer of the “Schoolhouse Rock” cartoon series, died Monday at the age of 94.

Dorough died of natural causes at his home in Mount Bethel, Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press.

Born in Arkansas, Dorough was able to make a living as a pianist and composer from the time he moved to New York in 1949.

Although he worked with greats like Miles Davis in the 1950s and ’60s, it was in the early 1970s with “Schoolhouse Rock” that Dorough made his biggest pop culture impact.

In 1971, Dorough was working a day job at a New York advertising company when his boss asked him to set the multiplication tables to music, figuring if kids could remember rock lyrics, it might help them learn math, according to NPR.

“I got the idea that three is a magic number,” Dorough told NPR in 2013. “Then I looked in the magic book and sure enough, three is one of the magic numbers.”

Dorough turned that concept into a ditty called “Three Is a Magic Number,” and it became the first step for a project first known as “Multiplication Rock” and, later, “Schoolhouse Rock.”

Then-ABC executive Michael Eisner turned the songs into a series of animated videos that appeared between Saturday morning cartoon shows for 12 years. The series was revived for five years in the 1990s.

Dorough continued performing, but in the 1990s started noticing adults were requesting the “Schoolhouse Rock” songs at his shows after they recognized his voice.

“I am not surprised at all [that the videos still resonate],” Dorough said, according to WNEP-TV. “I learned, when performing at elementary schools, that they were ‘getting through,’ so to speak, and the children would readily recognize my voice on such vocals as ‘Three Is a Magic Number’ and others that I sang.”

“However, what surprised me most was the impact of network television, which kicked in years later, after we’d been on air at ABC-TV,” he said. “Thirteen years, plus a second round, helped us to reach literally thousands, in a rather broad age spectrum.”

Dorough remained active all his life. Two weeks ago, he was a “scheduled performer” at the School of Visual and Performing Arts in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, according to the Allentown Morning Call.Theo Wargo via Getty Images

NEW YORK ― Patti Smith is a tour de force all her own. But when she brings Bruce Springsteen and Michael Stipe out to join her onstage, you know she means business.

On Monday night, the Tribeca Film Festival hosted the world premiere screening of the concert documentary “Horses: Patti Smith and her Band” at the Beacon Theatre. Immediately after the credits rolled, the large screen rose to reveal Smith and her band ready to launch into a nonstop set list that included “Dancing Barefoot,” “Gloria” and “Pissing in the River.” Smith’s powerful voice filled the room song after song ― her energy infectious as if you had just stepped into CBGB’s in the ’70s.

Smith didn’t hesitate to get political throughout the show, dedicating a version of Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth” to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, highlighting their strength and fight against gun violence in the wake of February’s mass shooting.

“Thomas Paine said that ‘These are the times that try men’s souls.’ And every single fucking day what they do in Washington tries our souls,” Smith told the crowd. “Parallel to that we had five students who magnified as a million … 5 million ... The Parkland Five are the fucking hope of this planet ... We have to be with them, pray with them, march with them. Their cause is ours. Their cause is our future.”

Just when you thought you had seen it all, Smith brought Springsteen ― on his night off from “Springsteen on Broadway” ― to join her on “Because the Night,” the 1978 hit they famously co-wrote together.

But that wasn’t the only surprise. Stipe, of R.E.M. fame, then joined Springsteen, Smith, and the band to perform “People Have the Power.”

“We are moving to a new time and I look at young people to lead us … It is the people who make change,” Smith said, continuing the social theme of the night. “People, we have to make change now!”Donated medicines at a makeshift pharmacy set up at a medical centre in Athens. Yorgos Karahalis / Reuters

Among the things Katerina Kaisari’s grandfather left behind when he died last year was a stockpile of expensive heart medication.

“My mum wanted to throw the boxes away,” said Kaisari from her hometown of Athens. “But I wanted to donate them to people who couldn’t afford to buy their own medication.”

Although Kaisari was keen not to let the drugs go to waste, she had no idea how to actually follow through with her idea until a friend recommended GIVMED, a Greek nonprofit that matches leftover medicines with people on low incomes.

For those based in Athens, where GIVMED is based, people with drugs to donate scan the barcodes of medicines they no longer need using GIVMED’s mobile app. The app then shows which of the 40 listed healthcare organizations around the city need those particular drugs, letting the user choose whichever donation point is most convenient. For donors who live outside the capital, an online map shows the 120 or so donation points across the country.

Within days of downloading the app, Kaisari had delivered her grandfather’s 12 boxes to a nearby social pharmacy, set up to serve unemployed and uninsured Greeks who cannot afford the medications they are prescribed.

Around the world, people struggle to afford medication while drugs worth billions of dollars go to waste. There isn’t detailed data on what happens to these unused drugs, but anecdotal evidence suggests some are thrown in the trash or incinerated. There have even been reports of medical facilities flushing unused medications down the toilet.

In response, a nascent movement of medicine sharing organizations from Greece to the U.S. to Senegal is emerging to tackle the dual problems of waste and unaffordability by redirecting medications to low-income communities.

For GIVMED co-founder Thanasis Vratimos, the idea to set up his organization came seven years ago after a close relative of his died and he realized how difficult it was to re-home unused medicines.

“After a lot of research in my hometown, Tripoli, these medicines eventually ended up in the hands of people who needed them,” says the 25-year-old. “But why should that have been so time-consuming and difficult?”

The former Google intern was convinced medicine-sharing technology was desperately needed. Greece was hit hard by a financial crisis in 2010 which left around two million people living below the poverty line and hundreds of thousands without medical access.

Launched in 2016, GIVMED is funded by a mixture of individuals, private companies and social foundations, and does not charge the healthcare organizations which receive and re-distribute the donated drugs – which they also do for free. According to Vratimos, the app has so far facilitated €200,000 ($246,000) worth of medicine donations.

But some sound a note of caution about medicine sharing. Andy Stergachis, director of the Global Medicines Program at Seattle’s University of Washington, says drug donations can save lives but warns: “There is no assurance that medicines from other healthcare facilities or from individuals are stored properly or not tampered with prior to their donation.”

Some countries, including the U.K., take the position that medicines should not be re-used after they’ve been dispensed to a patient given it’s not known how the products have been stored and consequently how safe or effective they are.

Indeed, soon after GIVMED’s launch, the Greek Association of Pharmacists published a letter that branded the platform “a serious risk to public health”. Vratimos says its concerns are invalid. The non-profit only sends donations to healthcare facilities that have an in-house pharmacist, he says, qualified to inspect each delivery. “I think every time someone has a new idea, people are afraid, especially when young people are behind it,” he adds. “The quality of medicine is our first priority.”

For Dimitra Pipili, manager of the Asylon Aniation hospice that looks after 180 people with neuro-disabilities, there’s no denying the impact GIVMED has had. In the wake of the Greek financial crisis, the hospice was struggling to afford even basic supplies. “It was very difficult to pay for everything: medicine, food, and the large amounts we owed in tax,” says Pipili.

Then two years ago the hospice was approached by GIVMED, offering to integrate it into its network of donation points. Now the hospice sends GIVMED a list of all the medicines it needs every month and, although GIVMED can usually only provide around 20 percent of what’s on the list, it makes a huge difference, says Pipili.

While Vratimos is proud of what GIVMED has achieved, ultimately he wants the government to adopt the organization’s ideas to create a nationwide system that provides free medication for Greeks who can’t pay for their prescriptions, while making the most of resources that would otherwise be thrown away. “Putting leftover medicines to use is important, for the environment and for changing people’s attitudes about their waste – in medicines and in general.”

Mill, also known as Robert Rihmeek Williams, was freed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overruled Judge Genece Brinkley’s prior decision to deny Williams bail last week.

Brinkley, who initially sentenced Williams to two to four years in prison in November, had previously denied a bail request in December.

Williams’ November sentencing stemmed from two arrests earlier in 2017. One was for a fight and another was for popping wheelies on a dirt bike. Based on these new charges and a failed drug test, Brinkley had found Williams in violation of probation from a 2008 gun and drug case.

The rapper tweeted out a statement Tuesday afternoon thanking his supporters.

I’d like to thank God, my family, and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) April 24, 2018

To the Philly District Attorney’s office, I’m grateful for your commitment to justice. I understand that many people of color across the country don’t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) April 24, 2018

In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career. — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) April 24, 2018

Williams’ legal team had filed a petition in February that questioned the credibility of a police officer involved in the rapper’s 2007 arrest. The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office filed a response to that petition in March, saying “there is a strong showing of likelihood of the Petitioner’s conviction being reversed (in whole or in part).”

Williams’ sentencing led many to voice their support both in person and on social media. November’s #Rally4Meek in Philadelphia saw protesters marching through the streets, chanting “Free Meek Mill” and rapping his song “Dreams and Nightmares.”

Rapper Jay-Z, aka Shawn Carter, has been a staunch supporter of Williams, arguing in a New York Times op-ed in November that “what’s happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day ... A person on probation can end up in jail over a technical violation like missing a curfew.”

“As of 2015, one-third of the 4.65 million Americans who were on some form of parole or probation were black,” Carter continued. “Black people are sent to prison for probation and parole violations at much higher rates than white people.”

Most recently, Carter advocated for Williams while speaking to David Letterman for the former “Late Night” host’s Netflix show.

Many on social media, including a slew of celebrities, expressed their excitement Tuesday about Williams’ release.

Williams’ first post on social media after his release was dedicated to the 76ers, posted mere hours before the team would face the Miami Heat in a playoff game.

Many speculated that Williams might appear at the Tuesday night game, especially after 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin said that he would be picking up the rapper from prison.

“Meek Mill is free!” Rubin wrote on Instagram. “Just left visiting Meek with [Kevin Hart] and I’m on the way back to pick him up as we speak.”

A post shared by Michael Rubin (@michaelgrubin) on Apr 24, 2018 at 12:37pm PDT

Joe Tacopina, Williams’ lawyer, said he was “thrilled” that the court released Williams on bail.

“As we have said all along, Meek was unjustly convicted and should not have spent a single day in jail,” Tacopina said, according to 6ABC, later adding, “Meek is excited to be reunited with his family, and we, along with Meek, intend to continue to shine the light on a justice system in need of reform to prevent any other citizen from being put through what Meek has endured.”

A spokesperson for the D.A.’s office told HuffPost that the court’s decision “on Meek Mill being released on bail is consistent with the position of the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office.”

“As this is a pending matter, we have no further comment on what may occur in the future in this case,” the spokesperson said, noting that the office had similarly agreed to withdraw prosecution from three lesser-known cases that were “also tainted by potential police credibility issues by following the same procedures and analysis.”

Even the Philadelphia Eagles celebrated Meek Mill’s release on social media, tweeting not long after the rapper released his own statement. In the tweet, a video shows the team running onto the field during Super Bowl LII, which they would later win, with Williams’ song “Dreams and Nightmares” playing in the background.

Fox’s popular buddy cop comedy “Lethal Weapon” may look very different in Season 3.

Clayne Crawford — who has co-starred as Martin Riggs opposite Damon Wayans’ Roger Murtaugh since the show’s premiere in 2016 — has reportedly created an on-set atmopshere so toxic that it’s threatening the show’s renewal, according to an exclusive report from Deadline.

The entertainment site claims that the 40-year-old actor has a “history of bad behavior” on the series and has been “disciplined several times over complaints of emotional abuse and creating a hostile environment.” His behavior has become so extreme, the report alleges, that other actors and crew members “feel uncomfortable being on set with him.”

Crawford responded to the allegations in an Instagram post on Tuesday, writing that he had been reprimanded twice on set.

“I am sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts,” he wrote. Crawford added that he attended “studio-appointed” therapy as a result of a clash with a guest director and assistant director.

Of the show’s fans, Crawford wrote, “I hope they will stick with me, and stick with the show.”

According to Deadline, the network is allegedly considering recasting its co-lead if the show is indeed picked up for a third season — which the outlet notes that it likely will due to its solid ratings. The current season averages around 4.25 million viewers per episode.

A civilian guard was also critically injured, according to authorities.

Officer Rogelio Santander, 27, died Wednesday morning, the Dallas Police Department told multiple media outlets. The other officer, 26-year-old Crystal Almeida, remains in critical condition. The wounded civilian, a Home Depot loss prevention officer, has not been identified.

The two officers were responding to a call from an off-duty officer to assist in an arrest at the store late Tuesday afternoon, Dallas Police Chief Renée Hall told reporters at a news conference that day. Hall did not disclose details of the shooting, but said the gunman had fled the scene.

Fire Dallas Rescue took the injured officers to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The off-duty officer was not injured.

Hall said at a later news conference on Tuesday evening that the three people who’d been shot were out of surgery. She asked for “continued prayers for them and their families.”

The Dallas Police Department’s helicopter unit said that, after a “lengthy car chase,” a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting about 9 p.m. on Tuesday.

Hall confirmed that police officers spotted a white pickup matching the description of one linked to the shooting and chased the car to an area in northwest Dallas, where police officers were able to arrest 29-year-old Armando Juarez and a female passenger.

Juarez, whom police had identified earlier Tuesday as a person of interest, was arrested and faces “multiple counts of aggravated assault on a police officer,” Hall said, adding that he had an outstanding warrant for felony theft. She did not release details on the female passenger.

The Dallas Police Department worked with other state, local and federal officials to find Juarez, Hall said.

Under President Donald Trump, the United States government has shown an “unprecedented level of government hostility” toward the Muslim religious minority in the country, according to a newly released report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

CAIR’s 2018 civil rights report, “Targeted,” disclosed that federal government agencies instigated more than one-third of anti-Muslim incidents in 2017. Of the nearly 2,599 reports of anti-Muslim incidents CAIR received, 919 involved a government agency ― about 35 percent.

The Customs and Border Patrol accounted for 348 of the reports, making up 38 percent of anti-Muslim incidents involving a federal agency, while the FBI accounted for 270 ― 29 percent of the government’s anti-Muslim incidents.

The Transportation Security Administration accounted for 72 incidents, or 8 percent of the government’s anti-Muslim incidents; Citizenship and Immigration Services accounted for 5 percent, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement accounted for 4 percent. In 12 percent of the cases, multiple federal government agencies were involved.

The overall 2017 figure for anti-Muslim incidents reported to CAIR featuring a government agency represented a sharp increase from previous years. In 2016, these type of incidents accounted for 24 percent of the total reported to the group. The figure was 22 percent in 2015 and 2014.

“It demonstrates how Islamophobia is further being institutionalized,” Zainab Arain, CAIR’s research and advocacy department coordinator and author of the report, told HuffPost.

“It’s partially attributable to Trump, not only his presidency, but even his campaign prior to his presidency,” Arain said. “Just seeing all the anti-Muslim bigots that are now part of his administration who are further pushing forward anti-Muslim policies which result in this state-sanctioned discrimination.”

The damning report also revealed that 464 reported incidents were specifically related to the Trump administration’s series of “Muslim ban” executive orders that began last year. They represented 18 percent of the total number of anti-Muslim bias incidents documented in 2017.

The first version of Trump’s executive order, which he signed in January 2017, barred the entry of individuals from several Muslim-majority countries into the U.S. CAIR documented a case where an American Muslim father was separated from his noncitizen daughter as a result of the travel ban. The woman later successfully sought legal permanent residence status to join her father.

In another incident, a Muslim man who had been residing in the U.S. as a visa holder and was married to a Muslim U.S. citizen found himself stuck abroad because of the travel ban. With the help of CAIR, the family was eventually reunited in the U.S.

Responding to the report, a Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson told HuffPost that the U.S. “has been and continues to be a welcoming nation.”

The spokesperson said the agency “not only protects U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents in the country but also wants to ensure the safety of our international travelers who come to visit, study and conduct legitimate business in our country. CBP does not discriminate on the entry of foreign nationals to the United States based on religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.”

Officials with the TSA told Huffpost in an email that its officers and contracted screeners “are trained to treat all passengers with dignity and respect, and receive periodic training regarding cultural and religious sensitivities.” The agency has “long made clear that profiling is not only discriminatory, but it is also an ineffective way to identify someone intent on doing harm.”

The FBI declined to comment.

The most common form of abuse against Muslims last year in the CAIR report was harassment ― defined by the group as a “non-violent or non-threatening incident.” CAIR categorized 14 percent of abuse against Muslims as harassment, another 13 percent as harassment and targeting specifically by the CBP, and 10 percent as harassment by the FBI. Hate crimes made up an additional 12 percent of anti-Muslim abuse, and employment discrimination accounted for 9 percent.

Noting that government agencies were found to be major contributors to anti-Muslim bias in 2017, CAIR wrote: “It is possible to attribute this to the unconstitutional Muslim Ban executive order.”

“How do we now protect ourselves when the source that we would otherwise seek to guarantee our rights is no longer guaranteeing our rights, but rather, is infringing upon [them]?” Arain asked.

Air, bus and train terminals were documented as the most common location for anti-Muslim incidents, accounting for 20 percent of total incidents by location.

Another report, released earlier this year by the nonprofit group South Asian Americans Leading Together, found that 1 in 5 perpetrators of hate violence in the United States against various South Asian and Middle Eastern communities invoked Trump’s name, his administration’s policies or his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” during the attacks.

Each year, CAIR complies thousands of reports through methods including telephone calls, emails, online submissions, its mobile application and media reports. CAIR’s civil rights staff members review the material and conduct interviews to determine whether a case demonstrates anti-Muslim, ethnicity-based or other biases and should be added to its national databases and reports.

Black students and students with disabilities routinely receive harsher punishments at school than their peers. But the Education Department is considering eliminating civil rights guidance designed to stymie these disparities ― even as data released Tuesday illustrates the scope of the problem.

The data comes from responses to a survey sent to all of the nation’s public school districts as part of the Education Department’s Civil Rights Data Collection, reflecting information from the 2015-2016 school year. The survey is conducted every other school year, and is intended to paint a picture of the different opportunities afforded to different groups of students.

This year, as in years past, the numbers show wide gaps in terms of how vulnerable students are treated when compared to their white peers. The Obama administration often cited numbers from this survey when designing civil rights guidance intended to reduce racial disparities. But the Trump administration has put pieces of Obama-era guidance on the chopping block. Specifically, under Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Education Department has signaled it may scrap guidance that is supposed to reduce racial bias in school punishments.

Indeed, even more than in years past, the latest figures show that a growing number of black students are disproportionately subject to school-based arrests and referrals to police. This issue is particularly relevant amid new federal efforts to increase the number of police officers in schools after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.

Black students are also disproportionately suspended and expelled. At the same time, the data shows that high schools dominated by black and Latino students have less access to high-level STEM coursework, compared to all high schools.

Students with disabilities are likewise subject to high rates of suspension and expulsion, and are also more likely to be restrained and secluded in school. While students with disabilities make up just 12 percent of students enrolled at public schools, they make up 28 percent of those subject to school-based arrests.

For the first time, the 2015-2016 survey asked about school-related shootings and homicides. Only 0.2 percent of schools reported having at least one incident related to a school shooting, and even fewer reported a school-related homicide.

The latest data reflects patterns recently found in a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, which noted stark disparities in terms of how black students are disciplined compared to their white peers.

In response to the release of the survey results, DeVos said in a statement that “protecting all students’ civil rights is at the core of the Department’s mission.”As a mom of two, Jillian Michaels can wish for the occasional parenting redo.

The fitness trainer and multimedia personality recalled one of those moments for a new People interview. In it, she explained what happened when her daughter, Lukensia, made an unintentionally disparaging remark about LGBTQ people ― and how, in retrospect, she wished she would’ve reacted differently.

“One evening, when my daughter was maybe 6, she said to me that she thought gay people were gross, or gay was gross,” Michaels recalled in the interview, viewed above. “I freaked out.”

“When people talk about parenting being hard, I don’t find that it’s all the sleepless nights and, oh, you know, the poopy diapers,” she said. “It’s these kinds of moments that bring you face to face with all of your deep, dark issues, where you don’t handle it well. I really wish I had handled it differently in the moment.”

When The B-52s go on tour, they don’t go their separate ways after each night’s gig. Members of the group actually hang out together after the show, even after all these years.

“We still raise a glass to each other,” singer/keyboardist Kate Pierson told HuffPost.

The longtime act, often considered one of the best “party bands,” will get a chance for plenty more post-show toasts while on the road this summer. The current touring lineup features three of the band’s five founding members: Pierson, Fred Schneider and Cindy Wilson. Fellow founding member Keith Strickland, though still in the group, retired from touring in 2012, and Wilson’s brother, guitarist Ricky Wilson, died from complications related to AIDS in 1985.

Despite those challenges and changes, Pierson is impressed that The B-52s have managed to stay together without ever officially breaking up. Next year will mark 40 years since the release of the band’s debut album, and 43 years since forming in Athens, Georgia.

“Chrissie Hynde [from The Pretenders] once said to us that her band and our band never quit. We never quit and reformed. And she said we ought to get a medal for that,” Pierson said. ’It’s pretty great that we stayed together and we still love each other and we still have fun.”

We caught up with Pierson about life on the road, what made “Love Shack” a hit nearly 30 years ago, and how it feels to turn 70.

What has been the biggest change, touring today versus 30-some-odd years ago?

Before, we’d tour behind whatever record. We’d just go out and do most of that record. ... Now we add a few songs, and our set list has certain songs we have to do. If we didn’t do “Rock Lobster,” there’d be a mini-revolution.

There’s some sort of expectation, I’m sure, from the audience to play certain songs at this point of your career.

Yes, we love doing those songs. Many people say, “I can’t bear to sing that again,” but there’s something about the beat and the fun in the music and the guitar part and the rhythm that propels us. And seeing the audience reaction gives us energy because we could see that they are dancing, and when we play “Rock Lobster” they just go a little bit nuts. No matter where we play it. And if we play in Europe people form a mosh pit on that song. It propels people to let their inner-freak fly. Something about that song gives people a license to let loose and do the craziest dances, and it’s very entertaining to us.

Many groups break up. Was there ever a time when you guys were like, “It’s time, we’re going to throw in the towel”?

Well, definitely after [guitarist] Ricky [Wilson] died in 1985. There was a big question mark. None of us said, “This is it,” but we certainly all thought that this might be it. We could not even dream of starting up and also we were expected, the record company thought we would tour and get another new guitar player and we were like no, that’s not going to happen. We are all in really deep grief. And Ricky is Cindy’s brother. Anyway it couldn’t happen ... We just didn’t have the energy, we were grieving. But then after a few years we realized like wow, we have something great here. ... Being together conjured up, “Ricky’s here,” really in a lot of ways, and a lot of [the 1989 album] “Cosmic Thing” was a tribute to him because there’s a lot of, I don’t want to say nostalgia, but there was a lot of looking back, that kind of thing. “Deadbeat Club” really just came out of a jam. That’s usually how we write ― by jamming, and then it just popped out ― “Deadbeat Club.” That’s something we used to call ourselves when we used to hang out. Didn’t have any money and we would just drink iced tea and get free refills and hang out at some place for three hours. We’d make plans, make big plans.

“Cosmic Thing,” of course, featured the hit song “Love Shack.” What did it take to pull that song together?

I remember when we were writing there was a point where Keith Strickland said, “This can’t go on the album, it’s not ready and it’s not going to make it.” He was right, it wasn’t ready. The chorus part, “The Love Shack is a little old place,” that was only happening once. I was lobbying to have it happen more. [Producer] Don Was said, “Well that’s the chorus. We have to have that.” He really made it come together and then once we put the chorus in, we had it. A lot of our old songs don’t have a typical song structure. They don’t have a verse-chorus, verse-chorus-bridge. With “Love Shack,” once we put that chorus in, it did have more of a song structure. Even though the verses are all kind of different, the chorus was there along with “The Love Shack” ― I think that really made it a hit. Once we heard it in the studio, we played it for R.E.M. and they were like, “Yes this is a hit.” We had something there. That kind of went through an evolution. It wasn’t immediate, like some songs we just pretty much wrote it and that was it. “Love Shack” went through several [iterations] and I’m curious to hear the first evolution of it, which I don’t really know where that is. Probably Keith Strickland has a version of it.

I’m sure you’re really glad that one made it on the album because it still gets played today on radio, which I think that says a lot about the longevity of that song.

Yes, it’s great for a band. We have longevity here. It’s great to have a song that’s a classic, really. It’s lasted and taken its place in front of the iconography of whatever you want to call it, it’s on the list.

It is and the video, I feel like is on the list in pop culture too. With a pre-fame RuPaul in it as well.

We won an MTV Video Award for that.

What do you remember most about that video shoot in upstate New York?

Our friends Phil Mayberry and Scott Walker had this house [in Highland, New York]. We didn’t know them yet, but our other friend Tom Rubin said, “You have to film this video there, it is the Love Shack.” I went to look at it, I was like, “This is a Love Shack.” It has a checkerboard roof and it had goats named Kate and Cindy, and they had a garden, and it just had everything. Inside it was just a riot of color ... We convinced the director, he didn’t want to leave, he wanted to film it in New York City in a soundstage, but once he saw this he was convinced. We dragged everybody up on a bus to the country and I remember really distinctly RuPaul getting this dance line going and just sort of directing in his most wonderful commanding way. He’s RuPaul. He was a total beauty drag and just had everybody do a line dance It really became a party. You could almost forget that it was a video shoot because it really was a party. We were dancing. We were outside, the goats were jumping around.

Personally, for you, you just turned 70. How does it feel?

It’s kind of weird. Before, any number below that ― even 69, it seemed like you’re climbing the top of the mountain. You’re looking down now. I don’t like that feeling [laughs]. ... I certainly don’t feel it. I just had a birthday party. We had a dance party. I found myself just dancing. I wanted a dance party. I was just jumping up and down. I have a lot of energy. I hope to maintain that. It’s definitely a different feeling. Even I have friends that are in their 20s. I keep thinking, “Oh, yeah. They’re my age.” I’ll make some reference, and they’re like, “What?” Age is just a number. Until you hit 70. Then it’s more than a number [laughs].

You released a solo album a couple years ago. Do you think you will do another solo album? Are you working on any music?

Yes, absolutely. I have the second one almost done. ... I’ve continued to write some songs with Chris Braide. I have three or four new songs. I just wrote a song with Aleks Syntek. He’s a really famous Mexican artist since. It’s about the wall. It’s the metaphor about [Donald Trump’s proposed] wall, and it’s political. He sang a part of it in Spanish. I want to release that as a benefit ― going toward the benefit of immigrants. I haven’t chosen what organization yet. ... I want to release the single in October, and get the solo album going as soon as we finish this tour. I have most of it written.

I know with your last solo album, there was a lot of confusion over the song “Mister Sister,” and a lot of the transgender community was upset about it. Is that something that you regret?

Well, it was, actually interestingly enough ― The Huffington Post. I had said that I hoped it would be a trans anthem. At the time, trans was used ― I even had looked it up, trans was used as a general term for anyone who was LGBTQ. Huffington Post, when they quoted me, it said, trans and they put in parentheses “gender,” and I never said that. That’s what really sparked this huge controversy because I never said that I hope it will become a transgender anthem. The song is about ― it was inspired by a friend of mine who was gay. When he was growing up, he used to wear his sister’s clothes and it’s just about that or anyone who feels betrayed by the mirror kind of thing. It’s meant to be empowering. I learned a lot though. I really got schooled. It’s also the height right then of transgender people fighting for recognition. … Anyway, there was a lot of misunderstanding. I think that through it, my wife Monica [Coleman] and I, we had some dialogues with different transgender people. I feel like we became more enlightened. I hope we came to some understanding, but I certainly meant no harm. It was really a misunderstanding. In the end of it, I felt good. It came out to be something that I grew ― in my understanding. …Things get really ugly on the internet. That’s the first time that ever happened to me.

You’ve been married a couple of years now, congratulations. How’s married life treating you?

Fantastic. Actually, our anniversary is Aug. 3. We were together since 2004. We were together a long time before we got married. It was really beautiful, we were married in Hawaii. We keep wanting to go back there. ... Actually, the first time The B-52s played in Hawaii on our very first tour, we played in this little club in Honolulu. We got there. The promoter met us, and put leis around us, and when we left, they had pulled guns on us. We played some little tiny club, and the microphones weren’t grounded. We got, as Cindy would say, the “electric kiss.” I was playing guitar and all of a sudden I was like, “Aaahhhh!” People thought it was part of the song but I was getting a shock. We all got shocked. We had to cut the set short but they continued to sell tickets through the night. So, people were really angry. Cindy and I literally took our wigs off, and we ran. They pulled a gun on the crew and said they were going to keep our equipment. Anyway, we had interesting experiences. … But Hawaii’s always been a place to me that’s magical. So, the wedding was beautiful. I think it really changes things when you’re able to get married. I mean the Marriage Equality Act was super important. I think you cannot believe it happened as fast as it did. For a lot of gay people ― it’s very surprising. You thought that this is going to be a struggle forever. I think that people really accept this. I think younger people accept it. Even when Ricky had AIDS, it was so much negativity, so much ignorance surrounding LGBT, the whole thing. There was a lot of negativity and laws still in place. Just fear. Things have come a long way ― that’s one positive thing in this crazy political world. Hopefully it won’t be rolled back.

“I hope our legacy will be of enduring, and that people think of us as an important band.” - Kate Pierson

The B-52s’ legacy ― what do you want it to be?

I feel like we want to be taken seriously. I know being a band that’s mostly gay and has women in it, I just think that there are the male icon bands, they are always, and they deserve it, but they are always touted as: “These guys are heavy-duty.” I think bands, because we have a sense of humor, we are not always taken as seriously. Not that I want people to be serious, but to be serious about us as a legitimate band. We were one of a kind. I think for that reason also, it’s kind of hard to understand us. We can’t really be put in a category. I hope our legacy will be enduring and that people think of us as an important band. But I think Ricky’s guitar playing, our style of writing, the fact that we had men and women in the band and gay and straight. I think it’s an important band and the way we wrote by jamming, we really had a different approach. And I think we really made a difference in the way, certainly Athens music, went and we were the first kind of band to come out of Athens, of that kind of era.

The B-52s kick off a tour on June 1 in Philadelphia.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed into law on Tuesday an array of bills ushering in one of the most comprehensive packages of gun-violence legislation passed by any state this year.

The legislation includes a ban on bump stocks and other similar devices that allow semi-automatic firearms to simulate automatic fire. Another bill expands law enforcement’s ability to confiscate guns from individuals labeled an “extreme risk,” a measure known as a “red flag” law.

Both of those measures have garnered support in a number of states following deadly mass shootings in Las Vegas last year and Parkland, Florida, in February, but Maryland is one of the first to put both on the books.

The Las Vegas gunman had outfitted bump stocks to a dozen semi-automatic rifles, allowing him to spray over 1,100 rounds into a crowd of concertgoers over the course of his 10-minute onslaught, killing 58 and injuring hundreds more.

The Parkland shooter was known to local police as a gun owner with violent tendencies, but because he hadn’t been convicted or even charged with a crime, law enforcement had no authority to confiscate his weapons before the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in which 17 people died.

Red flag laws, also known as gun violence restraining orders, allow family members or law enforcement personnel to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be dangers to themselves or to others.

In the signing ceremony, Hogan hailed the new laws as “common sense bipartisan measures that will keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and those with criminal backgrounds.”

Hogan also signed a bill to provide at least $5 million for public health and community-based gun-violence prevention programs. And other measures will strengthen an existing restriction on the purchase or possession of firearms by individuals convicted of domestic violence and revamp the appeals process for certain handgun permitting decisions.

In the Republican wave that marked the 2014 elections, Hogan was one of the surprise winners in a heavily Democratic state (Hillary Clinton carried Maryland in 2016 presidential race by more than 26 percentage points). He is seeking a second term this November.

The new laws build upon previous legislation that had already made Maryland’s gun statutes some of the nation’s strongest. In 2013, the state enacted a ban on a number of semi-automatic rifles including certain types of AR-15s and AK-47s, often referred to as assault weapons, as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The slate of laws will address gun violence in a variety of forms, said Jen Pauliukonis, president of Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence.

Pauliukonis said a bump stock ban is necessary to try to prevent the type of mass slaughter seen in Las Vegas, but she acknowledged that such a measure would do little to address the sort of shootings that take place across Maryland each day. She said the “broad spectrum” nature of the gun bills suggests lawmakers were eager to look beyond the issue of mass shootings. And she said she believes the red flag law will be particularly valuable.

“It can stop those high-profile mass shootings, it can stop school shootings, it can stop interpersonal gun violence on the streets and it can stop gun suicides,” she said of the legislative package.

She added that suicides using firearms account for “two-thirds of all gun deaths that occur in this country; there are over 22,000 gun suicides every year.”

The investment in community-based organizations and public health initiatives that already exist to stem gun violence also marks a different direction for Maryland. Only five other states have established this sort of fund, which is designed to give a financial injection to evidence-based services that address the root causes of gun violence.

Some programs may work to identify at-risk youth and provide a path for them off the streets, or deploy mediators who can work to de-escalate violence before it erupts. Other programs are based in hospitals and provide continuing care to gun violence victims to prevent them from engaging in revenge violence or being re-victimized once they’re discharged.

It can be hard to get official support for this sort of approach, even though the data suggests it can be effective, said Mike McLively, director of the Urban Gun Violence Initiative at the Giffords Law Center, a gun violence prevention group launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.)

“When states are thinking about the problem of gun violence, they’re usually thinking about law enforcement,” he said. “They think of this as a crime problem and really the main solution that comes to policymakers’ minds is investing more in law enforcement.”

A recent study by Giffords’ group calculated that about 1,672 shootings occur in Maryland each year, many of which are nonfatal. Together, they result in a direct measurable cost of over $1.3 billion.

This bloodshed disproportionately affects communities of color based in a few urban areas, Baltimore and Prince George’s County. With those trends often ignored in the media or by policymakers claiming to be interested in putting forth solutions to gun violence, advocates say this sort of effort is long overdue.
