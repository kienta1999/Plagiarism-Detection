.@donlemon on President Trump: "He is a racist ... but it's more important to be strategic than outraged" https://t.co/YhQrjiIOKr — CNN (@CNN) January 12, 2018

CNN’s Don Lemon called out Donald Trump’s supporters on Thursday for continuing to defend the president despite his “bigoted behavior.”

“How many examples do you need of this?” Lemon asked, hours after the president reportedly used the word “shithole” to describe Haiti and African countries. “But he is a racist.”

The following day, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”

Lemon blasted those who’ve attacked the president’s critics for pointing out his racist behavior.

“You know what you can go do?” Lemon asked.

He paused for a moment.

“I can’t say that,” Lemon said. “But you can go read a book, a history book. Because you might learn that some of the people from those shithole countries were slaves who were brought here by force to help build this country, and then start your learning process from there.”

Lemon also called on Trump supporters to do some self-examination.

“What does it say about you that no matter what ― no matter what ― you continue to make excuses for this man, for his vile behavior?” he asked.

“Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‘peanuts,’ only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars,” Trump tweeted, before continuing: “Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!”

The process to move the embassy actually started during President George W. Bush’s tenure.

“This has been a long and careful process,” Robert Tuttle, former U.S. ambassador to Britain, said in October 2008. “In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility.”

Trump’s comments come amid reports in British media that the White House was worried about mass protests during the president’s visit. Multiple outlets say Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may travel to the U.K. instead.

British Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump to visit the country last year during her sojourn to the White House after the U.S. election. But the specter of such a invitation has been increasingly contentious.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, an outspoken Trump critic, welcomed the trip’s cancellation.

“Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda,” Khan said in a tweet. “It seems he’s finally got that message.

Khan had previously called on May to cancel the invitation after Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos from a far-right Twitter account in November, accusing the U.S. president of promoting a “vile, extremist group,” The Associated Press reported at the time.Celebrities are angrily calling out President Donald Trump’s reported description of Haiti and nations in Africa as “shithole countries.”

Movie stars, comedians, musicians, chefs and late-night talk show hosts condemned Trump over his comments, which he reportedly made during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers on Thursday.

According to The Washington Post, Trump asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” as he pushed against reinstating protections for immigrants from those areas. Trump then suggested the U.S. welcome more immigrants from countries like Norway.

The following day, Trump claimed on Twitter that he hadn’t used those specific words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― who was in the room at the time ― swiftly contradicted him, saying that the president had in fact “said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly.”

Musician John Legend used Twitter to call Trump a “racist,” chef José Andrés said the people of Haiti deserved an apology and TV personality Jerry Springer indicated Trump was putting “our own citizens in danger”:

The aircraft doesn’t actually exist; it’s a plane used in the “Call of Duty” first-person shooter video game.

Trump made the gaffe during a joint press conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg at the White House on Wednesday.

“In November, we started delivering the first F-52s and F-35 fighter jets,” Trump bragged about the reported $10 billion order. “We have a total of 52 and they’ve delivered a number of them already a little ahead of schedule.”

Norway purchased 52 F-35 jets and Trump appeared to “misread a written statement and combine the figure of 52 planes with the F fighter designation,” the BBC reported.

The “Call of Duty” Wiki page described the fictional jet as being “equipped with afterburners for greater speed to outrun aircraft, as well as air brakes, which provide the fighter with additional maneuverability in tight corners or for avoiding enemy fire.”

Here’s how “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert broke down the fake news:

People on Twitter also had some thoughts:

So ... according to Trump, apparently America is selling Norway a bunch of F-52s?



The F-52 being a fictional airplane from Call of Duty.

Carrie Sheffield attempted to argue that Trump isn’t as anti-immigrant or racist as those comments suggested.

The president “said he would welcome immigrants from Asia so he is open to accepting people from other countries.” Sheffield said, referencing information from a White House official.

Fellow panelist Keith Boykin, a liberal commentator, fired back at her, noting how highlighting Asian immigrants in contrast to others reinforces a myth about them.

“This is not good because it’s playing into the stereotype of the model minority,” Boykin said.

The idea of Asians as the “good immigrants” ― wealthier, better educated and higher skilled ― is a harmful stereotype that pits Asians against other communities of color, often only to the benefit of white people. The model minority myth keeps serious issues in the Asian-American community, which is majority immigrant, from being addressed and ignores the diversity of experiences within the group.

A December 2016 report from the Center for American Progress shows the wealth gap among Asian-Americans is great, larger even than that among white Americans. And data averages hide the particular needs and histories of immigrants from different Asian countries.

“It doesn’t really make sense to compare recent Chinese, Korean or Pakistani immigrants who are working in tech and engineering jobs to people who came as refugees in the 1980s and their working-class descendants,” Philip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, told The Washington Post at the time the report was issued.Jimmy Kimmel made fun of President Donald Trump’s upcoming physical during his Thursday night broadcast.

“We’ve heard so many things from him via Twitter and otherwise that have been extremely troubling to our humanity,” the activist and daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King said via a Facebook live video.

Bernice King said that she hopes that on Monday’s national holiday, Trump will attempt to “suspend any effort at tweeting something negative or insulting.”

She said she hoped “that he will use his Twitter account on the King holiday to really respect the spirit, the heart and legacy of Dr. King by tweeting positive and uplifting messages.”

Her remarks followed Trump’s signing of a a proclamation honoring Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and work. During the signing, the president praised the civil rights leader’s “faith and love for humanity” while telling Americans “no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God.”

A day prior, Trump had asked lawmakers during an Oval Office meeting why immigrants were coming from “shithole countries” instead of what he views as more desirable places, like Norway, according to a report from The Washington Post.

Bernice King spoke out on Twitter in response to the report.

“I’m not surprised when I hear President Trump has said something else insulting [racist, bigoted, hateful] about a group of people or a nation of people,” she wrote. “I’m more troubled by the silence from people who are supposed to be men and women of righteousness.”

Well, we’ve made it to Week 2. Arie Luyendyk Jr. put his foot on the gas pedal during his race for love on “The Bachelor” in a major way. (Get it? Get it? Racing puns?)

This week, “The Bachelor” showed us two very intense one-on-one dates. On one, we were sold Arie the Family Man ― an inordinately tidy condo, lots of family photo albums, and parents who have been married 30-plus years. On the other, we got Arie the Sugar Daddy ― Neil Lane diamond earrings, Rachel Zoe gowns and twirling requests. It all felt a bit ... off?

“Bachelor In Paradise” alums Derek Peth and Taylor Nolan (who also hosts her own podcast, “Let’s Talk About It With Taylor Nolan”) sat down with Claire Fallon and Emma Gray, the co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Bachelor” podcast, “Here to Make Friends,” to recap the episode ― and talk about the weirdness that was Becca Kufrin’s gifting suite date. Below are our thoughts:

Taylor Nolan: The first date felt like an ad to me.

Emma Gray: Yeah, it was a gifting suite.

Derek Peth: And then they sent her back to the mansion to show everybody what she got!

Claire Fallon: I thought the date was over, and it completely disoriented me. I was like, are they doing roses later? Is there no night date?

Derek: She’s the one that got the mafia guy that Neil Lane sent, right? [mafia voice] “Neil sent this. It will self-destruct in 5 seconds if you don’t open it right now.”

Claire: Yeah I felt really weird having Arie take a younger woman out and just give her a bunch of stuff. And even the way he acted during it was very [off]. He was like, “I’m just gonna sit back here and eat.”

Emma: And watch her.

Taylor: Someone tweeted, “This is the perfect date, start to a great relationship because you get treated like a princess, but then also get to talk and get to know each other.” And I was kinda like, I wouldn’t wanna be treated like a princess. That almost ... not only is he placed so highly on this pedestal being “The Bachelor,” but he’s also giving you all these things. And that would just feel kind of uncomfortable to me.

Derek: What did you think this date should have been renamed from “The Bachelor” to?

Taylor: “Sugar Daddy.”

Claire: That’s really what it felt like. It’s just kind of icky to watch. The part where he kneeled down and opened up the box with the shimmery Louboutins in it...

Emma: And then there was the asking her to twirl, which I just had a visceral reaction to. The whole thing ... set up an odd power dynamic. Like, she’s almost a decade younger than him, which, that’s fine, she’s an adult. But add that to the fact that he’s the lead, they don’t know each other at all at this point and he’s just gifting her things and then watching her enjoy them.

Derek: That was the part that made me feel weird. That he’s just observing and watching her.

Taylor: I feel like if I was her, I’d feel this weird sense of “I owe you something now.” And the only thing I can really give you in this [situation] is just being so enamored and infatuated with you. So now it’s kind of like, I owe this to you. That would have made me feel really weird.

Claire: I always remember that on our second date, my husband took me to accidentally a really nice dinner. It was just a restaurant nearby and he was like, “I’ve always wanted to go here!” And I was like, “It’s New Year’s Eve, this is gonna be intense!” It was prix fixe, it was really expensive, and I was so nervous I downed three margaritas right away. It just feels weird. We’re getting to know each other as equals, and suddenly he’s like, “I’m spending $300 on you,” and you’re, like, “Not cool anymore! I feel like things are expected of me. Like, I have to perform and you’re paying me for your company and I have to...”

Emma: ...deliver in some capacity!

Taylor: Like, I have to give you the best twirl. [Laughs.]

Claire: And I think that women are socialized to respond to that, so some women are comfortable with it. And Becca seemed comfortable with it, but it was really weird to watch.

“Fuck the NRA,” Pat Davis says in the 15-second ad. “Their pro-gun policies have resulted in dead children, dead mothers and dead fathers.”

Davis is an Albuquerque city council member running for the Democratic nomination in New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, and his provocative spot is an attempt to distinguish himself in his crowded primary. It’s a six-way contest, with no clear frontrunner. Deb Haaland ― who would be the first Native American woman elected to Congress ― and former U.S. attorney Damon Martinez are attracting a fair amount of national attention, while Antoinette Sedillo Lopez is leading the field in fundraising and cash on hand.

Davis’ ad ran around 12:30 p.m. local time on KRQE, the local CBS affiliate in Albuquerque. The station’s general manager, Bill Anderson, explained that the ad would run with the profanity because the station is not allowed to censor political spots. But the station also planned to run a warning beforehand.

“We received a request for airtime from a legitimate federal candidate for office, and according to federal election rules, we are required to give him the same access as his opponents,” he said. “This station, by law, is not permitted to censor or in any way edit this commercial.”

Instead, the station ran a warning right before the ad appeared, advising viewers it may contain “inappropriate language.”

KQRE viewers saw a warning before Pat Davis' ad aired. KQRE

Davis is a former police officer and was executive director of ProgressNow New Mexico, a progressive organization.

On Friday evening, the NRA responded to Davis’ ad.

“Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‘peanuts,’ only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars,” he tweeted late Thursday. “Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!”

While he’s correct that the construction of the new building was an unusually costly undertaking, most of his assertions, including placing the blame on President Barack Obama, majorly miss the mark, and lack decades of nuance and historical context.

The decision to move the embassy move predated Obama.

The decision to move the embassy from London’s Grosvenor Square actually took place during President George W. Bush’s tenure, though construction on the new site, located across the Thames river in an area called the Nine Elms Opportunity Zone, began in 2013.

“This has been a long and careful process,” Robert Tuttle, then-U.S. ambassador to Britain, said in October 2008. “In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility.”

The U.S. didn’t own the land the old embassy sits on.

The Duke of Westminster owns the plot of land in Mayfair where the current embassy is located. It’s created somewhat of a sticky situation for the U.S., which owns most of the land that accompanies its embassies around the world.

Legend has it that when construction finished on the Eero Saarinen-built structure in 1960, the two countries agreed to a long-term lease that cost the U.S. one golden peppercorn annually.

The Duke reportedly refused to sell the land to the Americans, once even joking that he would only do so if the U.S. promised to return land belonging to his family that was confiscated during the war for U.S. independence.

Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund bought the building in 2009, winning approval in 2016 to turn the property into a luxury hotel.

It’s not as simple as the embassy being bought for “peanuts.”

The price tag on the construction of the new building, about $1 billion, makes it the most expensive project of its kind. But, as the embassy’s website notes, the U.S. managed to fund it entirely through the sale of other U.S.-owned properties in London, including, according to The Washington Post, the current embassy. So, while we don’t know exactly how much the U.S. gained from the sales, we do know that the new construction happened at no cost to U.S. taxpayers.

The embassy’s current location is hardly, as Trump claimed, “the finest.”

The current embassy’s location in a busy square makes it difficult to secure, and attempts to do so weren’t popular with the neighbors. The U.S. spent £8 million (about $11 million) on security upgrades following the September 11, 2001, attacks, because local residents protested having to live near what they felt was a terror target.

“We will be sorry to see the U.S. embassy leave as the current security arrangements we negotiated are working well,” Robert Davis, deputy leader of the Westminster City Council, said in 2008. “But we understand their desire to be in a more secure compound.

The highly congested area also subjected some U.S. diplomats to a congestion tax, which they seemingly have refused to pay. People who drive through central London on weekdays are required to pay a fee in an effort to cut down on traffic. According to official figures, embassy staff owe about $15 million to the city.

The new embassy is hardly in an “off location.”

Located near the river on London’s South Bank, the new Nine Elms location actually fulfils one of the core missions of an embassy ― a connection with the given country’s government.

“As the United Kingdom is our best friend and best ally, we wanted to be as close to parliament and government buildings as the current site and we have achieved that,” Tuttle said in the same 2008 statement. The new building is walking distance from London’s MI6 foreign intelligence headquarters.

The move also appears to be creating big benefits for the surrounding community.

“The embassy has been a magnet for new investment and a vital catalyst for a regeneration program which is delivering tens of thousands of jobs and homes,” local councillor Ravi Govindia said.

The fear of protests could have also been part of Trump’s calculation.

There may be more to Trump’s decision that he isn’t letting onto. Namely, a trip to London could have done further damage to the president’s public image.

“His visit next month would without doubt have been met by mass peaceful protests,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Friday in a statement. “Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda. It seems he’s finally got that message.”

In fact, tens of thousands of people have already shown interest in a protest that was scheduled in anticipation of Trump’s visit.

Facing sexual abuse accusations from multiple women, the actor skipped the Critics’ Choice Awards Thursday night, where he won a Best Actor accolade for his work in “The Disaster Artist.”

His award was not presented in the televised ceremony, but in an online-only segment prior to the main event in Santa Monica, California.

After Franco was spotted at Sunday’s Golden Globes wearing a Time’s Up pin ― for the campaign aimed at combating sexual misconduct following the #MeToo movement ― women called him out over social media for apparent hypocrisy. He won a Best Actor award for the same film at the Globes.

In a tweet, actress Violet Paley said Franco once attempted to force her to perform oral sex in a car. Actress Sarah Tither-Kaplan suggested Franco’s practice of encouraging women to perform fully nude was “exploitative,” and Ally Sheedy also appeared to suggest he had something to do with why she “left the film/tv business.”

In response, The New York Times canceled an event it had scheduled with the actor.

Cute #TIMESUP pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old? — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 8, 2018

Franco denied wrongdoing in a Tuesday night appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,” he said, “but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn’t have a voice for so long.” The actor added that if he has “done something wrong,” he will “fix it.”

But his accusers didn’t go silent. Five women, including Paley and Tither-Kaplan, then shared troubling experiences with Franco in an explosive Los Angeles Times article published early Thursday. Four of the women were students in Franco’s acting classes and one is a filmmaker who considered him a mentor. Together they detailed a picture of Franco attempting to coerce them into performing sexually explicit scenes.

An unnamed source “close to the situation” told People the actor is “in a really bad place” and only speaking to a “select” group of people.Jeff Bezos, along with his wife MacKenzie, announced on Friday that they’d be donating a $33 million dollar grant to the country’s largest scholarship program for “Dreamers,” a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.

The Amazon CEO’s donation to TheDream.US program will give “1,000 undocumented immigrant graduates of U.S. high schools with [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] status the opportunity to go to college,” he said according a statement published on the fund’s website.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DACA, is an Obama-era program that protects those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as minors from deportation. The program helps roughly 700,000 Dreamers, but the Trump administration is currently phasing it out. There has been a six-month delay for recipients in 2017, and the Department of Homeland Security will allow previously issued permits to expire starting on March 5.

Bezos also noted in the statement why this cause is important to him and his wife ― highlighting that his adopted father was an immigrant who fled from Cuba.

“My dad came to the U.S. when he was 16 as part of Operation Pedro Pan,” Bezos said.

Bezos’ announcement comes just a day after President Donald Trump made insulting remarks about immigrant groups, calling their respective homelands “shithole countries.” He also singled out Haitian immigrants, saying that they specifically should be left out of any deal.

Candy Marshall, president of TheDream.US, said in the statement, the grant from the Bezos family “is a shot in the arm for Dreamer students at a time when some are questioning whether they should be in the United States at all. We would invite anyone who questions the value of Dreamers to please come meet some of our students.”Scholastic is one of the world's largest publishers of children's books.

A conservative “pro-family” group is trying to rally mothers against the Scholastic Corporation for publishing children’s books that honor diverse gender identities.

One Million Moms, an advocacy group that has largely focused its efforts on condemning progressive ideology in the entertainment industry, on Wednesday aimed its sights on Scholastic, one of the world’s largest publishers of children’s books.

In a post on its website, One Million Moms took particular issue with one book, George, a chapter book intended for kids in grades 3 to 7. Written by the queer activist and author Alex Gino, George tells the story of a transgender fourth grader. The 10-year-old hopes that by playing Charlotte in her school’s upcoming production of Charlotte’s Web, she’ll finally get her parents and teacher to look past the gender that was assigned to her at birth and accept her as a girl.

George, which was published by Scholastic in 2015, was praised by critics as a “profound, moving” book. But One Million Moms doesn’t think the book is “family-friendly” material.

“Scholastic is not safe for your child and parents should be warned,” the group wrote. “Scholastic does not have our children’s best interests at heart.”

One Million Moms asked its supporters to warn Scholastic that they would boycott the company unless it stops “publishing and promoting pro-homosexual and pro-transgender books for children.”

Gino declined to comment on the One Million Moms campaign, while Scholastic did not reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

When George first came out, Gino told NPR that they hoped the book would help transgender kids feel less alone.

Studies show that people who identify as transgender and face rejection from their families are at increased risk for depression and suicide. According to a survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, the majority of transgender people who were out or perceived to be transgender between kindergarten and 12th grade experienced some form of mistreatment, including being verbally harassed (54 percent), physically attacked (24 percent) and sexually assaulted (13 percent).

As part of its pitch against Scholastic, One Million Moms cited a statement from the American College of Pediatricians that claimed accepting kids’ transgender identities amounted to “child abuse.” According to the Human Rights Campaign, the American College of Pediatricians is a small, socially conservative organization that holds extreme views about LGBTQ people.

On the other hand, the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is composed of 66,000 pediatricians in the United States, has expressed support for transgender children and adults and condemns attempts to stigmatize or marginalize them.

One Million Moms is a division of the American Family Association, which the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as an extremist group for its anti-queer ideology.

In addition to its campaigns against diverse gender identities, One Million Moms has also expressed outrage over companies that showcase same-sex relationships in their advertisements and television shows ― such as Disney, for featuring a two-mom family in the kids’ show “Doc McStuffins,” and Campbell’s Soup, for featuring gay dads in an ad.A couple in front of the Santa Monica Pier.

Most days, Ari Hahyar sets out from his home in a middle-class neighborhood of Santa Monica for a leisurely stroll. Tracking his route and calculating his steps is a new Fitbit bracelet on his wrist.

Hahyar, a 63-year-old recently retired from his job as a special education teacher, credits his daily walks with keeping him active and lifting his mood. Motivating him, he says, are the many public parks and tree-lined streets in this beachfront city in western Los Angeles County.

Healthy living habits might be precisely what you expect of residents in this sunny Californian city. The data, however, paint a different picture. According to the city’s latest Wellbeing Index, only 38 percent of Santa Monica’s population of 92,000 are active for 20 minutes or more per day. Hahyar is one of 200 residents who were given Fitbits for a six-month government initiative created as a result of these findings, in the hope the tech will nudge them to increase their exercise levels.

The Wellbeing Index, introduced in late 2013, marks an attempt to go beyond economic criteria as the sole focus of a city’s success. The initiative reflects a growing conviction among U.S. social policy experts that positive economic figures often hide growing inequalities and pockets of deprivation.

Alongside economic opportunity, the Index analyzes how citizens are faring in terms of their general outlook on life, their sense of community, their interaction with their environment, their health and their access to learning.

Santa Monica is not alone in trying to break the monopoly that hard economics enjoys in public policy. Other U.S. cities experimenting with broader ways of defining urban health and happiness include Seattle, Jacksonville, New Haven and Somerville.

Where Santa Monica differs is the extent to which its well-being calculations are informing government activities. Most other indices of this type are run as policy prototypes or research experiments, says Julie Rusk, who carries the daunting job title of chief civic well-being officer for the city.

“Here in Santa Monica, it’s different. We’re embedded right in city hall,” Rusk said. Her team sits within the city manager’s office, giving them prime access to both the mayor and the city council.

With this policy focus in place from the outset, the need for hard, credible data has always existed, Rusk added. In addition to traditional data sets, the Index team has developed a survey to tease out residents’ everyday experiences in a range of areas.

The latest survey findings, which draw on the views of over 3,800 residents, confirm the general view of Santa Monica as a relatively affluent and progressive place to live. Some key factors of life satisfaction are above average: levels of trust among neighbors (84 percent of respondents agreed “people in my neighborhood could be trusted”), average household incomes ($76,000, compared to a national median of $55,775) and rates of volunteering (around one third of the city’s residents regularly volunteer, against one quarter nationally).

Yet, as with almost any U.S. city, pockets of economic deprivation and social alienation exist. Many of these run along ethnic or race lines. Santa Monica’s population is predominantly white, although it also counts significant Latino (15.4 percent) and Asian (9.3 percent) communities.

Education attainment among minority groups in Santa Monica is consistently lower than among their white counterparts, for instance. The same is true for levels of health, with black and Asian residents getting the least sleep, and Latino residents eating the least healthily, according to Index results.

The point of the Wellbeing Index is not to collect information for information’s sake, but to inform government decision-making, stressed Rusk: “It’s really about better reflecting who the community is so we can better understand those we are here to govern and partner with.”

Helping in this is the ability of the Index’s administrators to splice the aggregated data according to gender, race and ethnicity, or ZIP code. Hence the decision to target the Fitbit program on Hahyar’s mid-town district, where residents were revealed to be especially inactive.

To gain an even more granular understanding of residents’ lived experience, the city government is experimenting with the mining of social media. One current pilot, for example, sees it tracking job-seekers on Twitter to determine local attitudes toward employment opportunities. Another crunches data from the location app Foursquare to work out how many people are visiting Santa Monica’s parks.

The Index has revealed a number of surprises, said Lisa Parson, a project manager in the city government’s Wellbeing division. Fresh fruit and vegetable consumption in the city, for instance, is only around half that of the U.S. average, according to the Index’s findings. The statistic was all the more unexpected given Santa Monica’s numerous, well-attended farmers markets.

The Wellbeing division convened community leaders and residents from the worst-performing neighborhood in an attempt to discover the reasons behind this. They found that many customers came from other municipalities to shop at the farmers markets. In contrast, local people — especially those on low incomes — felt that the markets were “not for them,” Parson said.

In response, the city worked with the farmers market nearest to the targeted neighborhood to make it more welcoming. Among the initiatives were a vegetable scavenger hunt for kids and a community cooking competition for their parents.

The biggest boost to local dietary habits came through a reform to a publicly funded food subsidy program. It was found that only one-third of the 1,200 eligible individuals had subscribed, with most put off doing so because of the cumbersome online application process. The Wellbeing team asked the county government, which administers the benefits, to fund an employee to sign people up in person.

“The individual was given a station in the park to address the problem of signing up online ... and since the beginning, their appointment book has been pretty much booked up consistently,” Parson said.

These are one-off interventions, however. The real challenge will be integrating the Index’s findings into decision-making processes across city government. As a first step, all city departments now have to show how they intend to progress the city’s well-being agenda. The results will feed into how departmental budgets are divvied up.

This change in institutional thinking marks a “big shift,” Parson said. “It takes a long time to get appropriate buy-in and appropriate movement to turn this into an operating system for the city, but we’re on our way.”

Asking people about the quality of their own lives, ideally before and after implementing programs, “provides a powerful bottom-up measure of the quality and success of a community or country,” Professor John Helliwell, a University of British Columbia economist and editor the United Nations World Happiness Report, said. He praised Santa Monica as “one of the leading participants in this worldwide innovation.”

Community leaders have responded positively to the efforts of the city government as well. In meetings with city officials, having hard data on social and environmental issues on-hand helps reinforce residents’ arguments, says Irma Carranza, a longtime advocate for Santa Monica’s Latino population.

“Before, government was mostly focused on buildings, traffic and the like. But we believe government’s job is also people, their well-being and quality of life ... The Wellbeing Index now provides the data to support our testimony [and] can help guide the city’s focus and those of us working in the community,” she said.

Carranza said particular concerns among the predominantly Latino residents in the city’s Pico neighborhood are around changes to immigration rules and affordable housing. In response to the Index’s findings, the city government is looking into ways to keep residents in their homes.

“The Wellbeing Index reminds us of some things we already knew but also about many things we didn’t know,” Carranza said. “ And now that we know, we can look to address those burdens and challenges so residents are able to focus on their well-being, their families and things that matter and bring them joy.”WASHINGTON ― Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Friday that President Donald Trump’s comments about African nations being “shithole countries” are “beneath the dignity of the presidency,” and if he can’t take his job seriously, he shouldn’t have it.

“If the president can’t control himself and lead this country with the authority, dignity and leadership it requires, then he shouldn’t be the president,” she said in a scathing statement. “There’s no room for racism in the Oval Office.”

Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said people need to be clear about what Trump was really saying when, during a Thursday meeting with senators, he rejected their idea of cutting the visa lottery in half and allotting the rest to underrepresented countries in Africa and nations like Haiti that have temporary protective status. That designation lets people stay in the U.S. after natural disasters or other crises in their home nations.

Trump reportedly said no to that proposal, referred to African nations as “shithole countries,” asked why the United States needs any more Haitians, and then said people from Norway would be more welcome.

“The president’s expressed desire to see more immigrants from countries like Norway must be called out for what it is: an effort to set this country back generations by promoting a homogenous, white society,” Feinstein said. “We all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society.”

The Washington Post first reported Trump’s “shithole” comments. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who was in the meeting, later publicly confirmed them.

But Trump on Friday insisted the reports were inaccurate. He denied that he criticized Haiti, but said nothing about his reported comments on Africa.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have overwhelmingly stayed silent in response to Trump’s comments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had said nothing as of Friday afternoon, and his office did not respond to requests for comment. The office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also did not respond to requests for comment.

Ryan was asked directly about the president’s remarks in a Friday interview. He offered only a light rebuke.Georgina Chapman is keeping her fashion line, Marchesa, strutting despite husband Harvey Weinstein’s far-reaching disgrace.

Marchesa and Marchesa Notte released photos of their pre-fall 2018 collection this week, with 38 new looks. A statement from the Marchesa brand, which is run by Chapman and her partner Keren Craig, described the collection as a visit to “a nocturnal garden party, boasting dramatic silhouettes and colors.”

Chapman, 41, announced that she’d be splitting from Weinstein, 65, in October 2017, amid explosive reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker that accused Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein denied the allegations.

Since then, the couple have privately reached a settlement to end their 10-year marriage and give primary custody of their two children to Chapman. They have not yet formally filed for divorce in court.

“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,” Chapman previously said of Weinstein’s deeds in a statement to People magazine.

In the past, Weinstein reportedly supported his wife’s fashion business by forcing stars like Felicity Huffman and Sienna Miller to wear her brand on the red carpet. With Weinstein now deluged by accusations of sexual misconduct, many speculated that Marchesa would suffer unless Chapman cut ties. Now that she seemingly has, we can only wait and see what will happen.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump signed a proclamation honoring Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and civil rights work on Friday, just a day after reportedly making racist remarks toward Haiti and African countries.

During the signing, Trump, joined by HUD Secretary Ben Carson and King’s nephew Isaac Newton Farris in the White House, praised King’s “faith and love for humanity” while urging Americans to walk in his legacy.

“Today we celebrate Dr. King for standing up for the self-evident truth Americans hold so dear that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God,” Trump said of the civil rights leader. “While Dr. King is no longer with us, his words and vision only grow stronger through time. Today, we mourn his loss, we celebrate his legacy and we pledge to fight for his dream of equality, freedom, justice and peace.”

Before signing, Trump wished a “congratulations to [King] and to everybody.” As he smiled and greeted those standing beside him, reporters erupted with questions about his statement on African and Haitian immigrants.

“Mr. President, are you a racist?” April Ryan of American Urban Radio Network asked. “Mr. President, will you respond to these serious questions about your statement, sir?”

Trump ignored all questions and exited the Roosevelt room.

On Thursday, Trump held an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers during which he referred to African nations and Haiti as “shithole” countries, as first reported by The Washington Post. He also rejected the idea of restoring protections for immigrants from those countries, suggesting that those from nations like Norway would be more welcome in the U.S.

“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump said. NBC News, BuzzFeed and CNN confirmed the reports.

Trump has since denied that he made the remarks via Twitter.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has since gone on the record to confirm the president made these remarks.

The comments, which occurred on the eve of the anniversary of Haiti’s devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake, are the latest in the president’s history of racial controversies.

In August, Trump defended white supremacists involved in the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally by calling them “very fine people.” Prior to his presidency, the longtime businessman was accused of discriminating against black applicants attempting to rent his properties and black employees of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.So on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” host Jimmy Fallon read out some of his viewers’ more excruciating experiences.A Sikh Canadian politician said he was subjected to inappropriate security screening at an American airport last year — which prompted the Canadian government to contact U.S. authorities for an explanation.

Navdeep Bains, Canada’s minister of innovation, science and economic development, revealed to French-language Canadian paper La Presse on Thursday that Transportation Security Administration agents at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport repeatedly asked him to remove his turban, even after he reached his boarding gate. He said he was finally allowed to fly after he showed agents his diplomatic passport.

“I was very frustrated and disappointed that this occurred, but ultimately I was allowed to fly,” Bains told The Associated Press. “But it was because of who I was, and that should not be the case. It doesn’t matter what your status is and what your position is.”

Like many other Sikh men, he wears a turban as a sign of devotion to his faith. He said that when he travels, he tries not to reveal his Cabinet position so that he can see how things go for people who aren’t public figures. This was reportedly the first time he was asked to remove his turban while traveling in the U.S.

Bains said the episode occurred while he was returning to Toronto in April 2017 after an economic meeting with Michigan’s governor and Ohio’s lieutenant governor.

Bains told La Presse he was asked to undergo a swab test, an additional security procedure, after he passed through metal detectors at the airport. He said he had no issues with that. But when the officer had trouble with the machine, Bains said, he was asked to remove his turban. He refused.

“I will never be asked to take off my clothes. It’s the same thing. It’s a piece of linen,” he told La Presse, according to a translation provided by the CBC.

The security agent ran the swab test again, and when it did not detect anything, he was allowed to proceed to his boarding gate.

But shortly before his flight’s departure time, he said, a security agent approached him and tried to take him back to the screening area for more checks. The agent insisted that Bains take his turban off.

He said the agent asked for his name and ID, and it was then that he showed his diplomatic passport. Once the agent realized his identity, he said, he was allowed to board his flight.

Bains told La Presse what while security is important, “proper process needs to be followed.”

“I’m about to embark, and you tell me to take off my turban. But, by knowing my diplomatic status, you tell me that everything is correct? This is not a satisfactory answer,” he said.

He added that the security agents were “very insistent and very difficult” throughout the episode.

Canada’s foreign minister complained about the incident to officials at the U.S. Homeland Security and Transportation departments, the CBC reported. Bains said he accepted those officials’ apologies.

TSA spokesman Mike England told HuffPost that the department reviewed closed-circuit video of the episode and determined that the agent conducting the screening did not follow standard operating procedures. The officer has been given additional training.

“We regret the screening experience did not meet the expectations of Mr. Bains,” England wrote in an email.

England said that all travelers wearing head coverings may be subjected to additional security screenings to ensure that prohibited items are not concealed beneath the clothing. He said passengers who are unwilling to remove headwear for religious, medical or other reasons should expect to undergo additional screenings, which may include officer-conducted or self-conducted pat-downs.

“This policy covers all headwear and is not directed at any one particular item or group,” he said.

In 2007 the TSA updated its protocols to allow passengers to keep turbans on during security screenings. The agency says on its website that passengers “wearing head coverings, loose fitting or bulky garments” may undergo additional measures, such as a pat-down by an agent of the same gender. If there are unresolved issues, passengers “may ask to remove the head covering in a private screening area.”

The Sikh Coalition, an advocacy group, has compiled guidelines for Sikh passengers at airports. The organization also has an app that Sikh travelers can use to file complaints about TSA screening discrimination.

A spokesperson for the group told HuffPost that according to current TSA rules and regulations, Sikh passengers may pat down their own turbans or refuse to remove their turbans in public.WASHINGTON ― Most news networks reporting on President Donald Trump’s remarks about restricting immigrants from “shithole countries” notably didn’t shy away from using the vulgar word, and called the president’s insult what it was ― racist.

But over at Fox News, Trump’s network of choice, hosts and panelists were defending the president’s crude comments before shifting to other topics.

Fox News

After The Washington Post on Thursday afternoon first reported Trump’s remarks at a White House meeting with lawmakers, “The Five” co-host Jesse Watters shrugged off the slur as the way ordinary Americans talk about “Haiti people.”

“If it’s true, this is how the forgotten men and women in America talk at the bar,” Watters said. “This is how Trump relates to people. If you’re at a bar, and you’re from Wisconsin, and you’re thinking, ‘They’re bringing in a bunch of Haiti people, or El Salvadorians, or people from Niger.’ This is how some people talk.”

Watters’ defense was reminiscent of the way the president and his allies downplayed Trump’s videotaped boast of being able to “grab [women] by the pussy” as simply “locker room talk.”

Later Thursday evening, prime-time Fox host Tucker Carlson kicked off his show by questioning what all the fuss was about.

“For some reason virtually everyone in New York, Washington, and LA considered this a major, major event,” Carlson said. “Why is that?”

Then he launched into a defense.

“So, if you say Norway is a better place to live, and Haiti is kind of a hole, well, anyone who’s been to those countries or has lived in them would agree,” Carlson said. “But we’re jumping up and down, ‘Oh, you can’t say that.’ Why can’t you say that?”

Later in his show, Carlson turned to what he said should be “a big news story”: “are UFOs real?”

Fox News

Panelists on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show defended Trump as being “authentic.” But, as usual, Hannity’s main focus was Democrats and the Russia investigation.

Changing the subject is a classic Fox strategy in the face of unflattering Trump news.

In October, when Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted Trump’s former campaign chief Paul Manafort in the investigation into possible election collusion with Russia, “Fox & Friends” made a passing reference to the developing story, then followed up ― with an update on Google’s “cheeseburger emoji crisis.”

Fox & Friends is on a commercial break right now, but here is what they were discussing a few minutes ago. pic.twitter.com/gqpgtwx7XH — Marina Fang (@marinafang) October 30, 2017

Speaking of “Fox & Friends,” which the president regularly watches and live-tweets during scheduled “executive time,” co-host Brian Kilmeade began Friday’s show acknowledging that Trump’s comments were “disparaging” and “ham-handed.”

“It steps on a message, when he is legitimately on a roll,” Kilmeade said, adding that the president needs to at least “clarify” his comments “before noon” so that he doesn’t hamper congressional immigration negotiations.

Later in the show, Kilmeade again said Trump “made a mistake … no question,” and should “walk it back.”

“He’s not gonna,” co-host Steve Doocy interrupted.

“Maybe he does. Maybe this is the time he does,” Kilmeade responded.

Less than 30 minutes later, Trump did clarify his comments ― sort of ― saying “this was not the language used.”

Fox News contributor Steve Cortes suggested Trump’s tweet puts the matter to rest.

“I would point out, first of all, anonymous sources and The Washington Post, in the past, have been a recipe for dishonesty,” Cortes said. “I take the president at his word if he says he didn’t use those terms. He acknowledges he talks tough.”

“If he’s saying that,” Kilmeade interjected, still seeming a bit skeptical. “Just trying to interpret the tweet.”

“Sure,” responded Cortes. “I think, here’s the bigger point: He acknowledges he talks tough. He spoke in a way which any American would, who speaks plainly, who doesn’t speak in a lawyerly or political manner about these countries.

“That’s not racist. That’s being sensible.”

“Absolutely,” contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy said.

“Fox & Friends” then shifted to another story: “Something really disturbing that Nancy Pelosi said.” Turns out the House minority leader called the bipartisan group of lawmakers negotiating immigration “the five white guys.”

Later in the show, Doocy informed viewers that Fox News had confirmed Trump’s comments, but noted they were “leaked” by someone who probably “was trying to damage the president.”

The hosts lamented that “the mainstream media” was not discussing the reason for the White House meeting, and that the deal congressional Democrats were pushing “was so bad for the president.”

“I think what the Democrats have done is they’ve latched onto these sort of colorful remarks from the president, and I think it’s their excuse to racialize this, which is a safe space for Democrats,” Campos-Duffy said. “They don’t want to talk about the actual deal or finding a solution.”

Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, conceding that Trump’s slur was “not particularly smart,” argued that it was “fair” because “some countries are really crappy.”

Then he offered another defense of Trump’s comments: They were made privately, so they were acceptable.
