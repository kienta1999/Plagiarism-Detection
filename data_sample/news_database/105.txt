Forget “Black Panther.” Comedian Tracy Morgan has his own superhero, “Black Bobcat.”

In a goofy bit on “The Tonight Show” Monday, “The Last O.G.” star told host Jimmy Fallon that the hit movie stole his idea. He then introduced a cardboard cutout of his caped alter ego.

Morgan’s crime-fighter seems a bit more pet-like than the central character in “Black Panther.” Black Bobcat sleeps 20 hours a day and drinks a lot of milk. He also possesses a unique superpower.

“He can hear things on porno that you can’t hear,” Morgan said.Jesse Hughes, the frontman for U.S. rock band Eagles of Death Metal, has issued a groveling apology for inflammatory criticism of teens who organized the March For Our Lives advocating stronger gun laws.

The staunchly pro-gun singer — whose band was caught up in the deadly November 2015 terror attack by Islamic State militants on Paris’ Bataclan theater — was widely criticized last week after he accused student survivors of the Parkland, Florida, high school mass shooting of “exploiting” their friends’ deaths.

“It might be funny if it wasn’t so pathetic and disgusting,” Hughes wrote in a series of Instagram posts, since deleted.

Following a major backlash on his band’s Facebook page, Hughes over the weekend appeared to have softened with this video apology:

“What I had intended to be a statement about the hijacking by any side of the aisle of the beautiful agenda of a movement of our nation’s youth came off seeming like a mean-spirited personal attack and slight of the youth themselves, and even a personal attack of its leadership,” Hughes said in the clip.

Hughes claimed he was “not attempting to impugn the youth of America and this beautiful thing they’ve accomplished.”

The Mormon church has selected its first-ever Latin American and Asian-American apostles, diversifying a leadership group overwhelmingly made up of white men from the United States.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced the addition of Ulisses Soares, a Brazilian Mormon, and Gerrit W. Gong, a Chinese-American, to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on Saturday. The quorum is the second-highest governing body within the church. Its members, called apostles, help set policies for the global religion.

Before Saturday, the quorum was made up of Americans and one German, Dieter Uchtdorf. Soares and Gong are filling vacancies left by the recent deaths of former President Thomas S. Monson and Elder Robert D. Hales.

Mormons believe that their leaders are chosen by divine revelation. But succession in the church also follows a set of predictable guidelines. Within the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the longest-serving member is traditionally appointed as the president of the entire denomination.

This means that either Soares or Gong could someday become the church’s president. Women are not allowed to join the Mormon priesthood.

Both men previously served on a lower-ranking church body, the Presidency of the Seventy. Soares, 59, was born in Sao Paulo. He was an accountant and auditor for multinational corporations before being selected for a church leadership position, according to a biography on the LDS church’s website.

Brazil has one of the largest populations of Mormons outside of the United States. Church figures indicate that the country is home to more than 1.3 million members.

Gong, 64, was born in California and attended the Mormon-owned Brigham Young University. He worked for the U.S. State Department and the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies before becoming a church leader.

Although the Mormon church was founded in the United States, it has experienced dramatic growth outside the country, driven partly by the work of Mormon missionaries. Today, more than half of the LDS church’s 16 million members reside outside of the U.S., according to The Associated Press.

The new additions to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles reflect the “rising focus of church leadership on the world outside the United States, where the church is growing most rapidly,” Mormon scholar Matthew Bowman, of Henderson State University, told the AP.

The announcement about Gong and Soares came during a twice-yearly general conference in Salt Lake City, where the Mormon church is headquartered.

At the two-day conference, which was broadcast in more than 90 languages to viewers around the world, the church confirmed its new president, the 93-year-old Russell M. Nelson, and two top counselors.

Nelson announced proposals to build seven new temples, which would bring the total number of planned temples to 189 worldwide. Nelson said one of the new temples will be constructed in a “yet to be determined” major city in Russia. Mormon missionaries are banned from publicly proselytizing in that country, the AP reports.

Speakers at the conference did not directly address controversies about sexual harassment and abuse that have captured some Mormons’ attention in recent days.

One day before the conference began, hundreds of Mormons and former members of the church marched to the church’s headquarters in Salt Lake City to demand an end to the practice of allowing local church leaders to hold one-on-one interviews with youth. The organizers claim the leaders are able to ask the youth deeply personal questions about sex during these interviews.

The church recently changed its policy on the interviews by giving kids the option of bringing a parent or adult with them. But protesters say that the new guidelines don’t go far enough ― and that the church should require adults in the room during the personal interviews.

A heckler reportedly interrupted the conference three times by shouting, “Stop protecting sexual predators!”

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has made his promise of aggressive immigration enforcement the centerpiece of his domestic agenda. But two agencies tasked with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — have long attracted criticism for failing to release documents and data in a timely manner, if at all. That makes it hard for journalists, advocates, lawyers and the public to keep tabs on what the administration is doing.

Under the law, the government is supposed to grant or deny Freedom of Information Act requests (which any member of the public can file) within 20 working days, with some exceptions, and provide records unless the information is legally exempt from disclosure.

But if you file a FOIA request with ICE or CBP, you may find yourself in a bureaucratic morass: Fighting a faceless online portal (with CBP), watching your request ping-pong between agencies or sub-agencies, getting summarily rejected, struggling to talk to a human (ICE switched to an email-only system about two years ago), and waiting months — or more than a year — to get back a document that may be heavily redacted, according to HuffPost interviews with requesters. Some say they must resort to litigation to get any meaningful response.

Despite progress, “there are key FOIA program challenges that remain,” acknowledged Philip Kaplan, the chief FOIA officer at the Department of Homeland Security, (which encompasses CBP and ICE), in a report dated February 2018. He cited technological limitations, staffing and budget constraints, and a spike in litigation as some of the issues.

ICE’s response times are “terrible” and “unpredictable,” in the experience of Susan Long, co-director of the TRAC Research Center at Syracuse University, which provides comprehensive data about federal enforcement activities. CBP, she’s found, is “somewhat better” and “actually attempting to provide useful information.”

Starting in early January 2017, shortly before Trump’s inauguration, ICE “stopped providing a lot of the key indicators that would allow you to examine the agency’s performance,” she said — and the agency’s responses have “gone downhill from there.”

The co-directors of TRAC filed a lawsuit last year charging ICE with unlawfully withholding certain records.

Complaints about delays and secrecy at ICE and CBP — as well as other federal agencies — long predate Trump. But his administration set a new record last year for censoring, withholding or claiming not to find records across the federal government, according to the Associated Press.

And with immigration policies shifting quickly, FOIA is “more critical than ever as far as understanding ... what policies this administration is pushing and why,” said Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which provides legal services to immigrants.

“Even if you disagree with them, as a democracy, we need to know why,” he added.

Under Trump, requesters say they have run into challenges using FOIA to get information about issues key to his immigration platform. For example:

Requests about communications related to Trump’s proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border have gone unfulfilled. Requests for records illuminating CBP’s local implementation of the “Muslim Ban” executive orders led to lawsuits; over a year later, requesters say they are are still awaiting a complete response from the agency.

Another requester said he wasn’t able to get information about the companies that responded to a call for providing a new detention center for undocumented immigrants — or the location of the proposed facility. Still another couldn’t get copies of more than a dozen “commonly used” immigration enforcement documents — and says he still hasn’t received them after winning an appeal.

Last month, TRAC received a response from ICE that withheld all requested records identifying the law enforcement agency that was sent an ICE detainer request, and another response that withheld the name of the DHS program responsible for taking the immigrant into custody, Long said.

Multiple requesters told HuffPost they believe ICE has short-circuited requests quickly of late.

The agency’s practices and policies are “in line with federal FOIA law,” an ICE spokeswoman told HuffPost. She also said ICE “works diligently to complete requests in a timely manner,” but acknowledged that “given the sheer volume of requests received coupled with their complexity, delays are inevitable.”

On average, the ICE FOIA office receives 1,400 to 1,500 requests per week, the spokeswoman said. The agency has contracted with a service to assist with the backlog of requests, with the goal of eliminating those cases before the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30).

ICE has about 50 employees responsible for FOIA processes, and the agency granted at least partial information in the majority of cases during the 2017 fiscal year, according to the recent DHS report.

John Sandweg, who served as ICE’s acting director in the Obama administration, said he found the agency to be “pretty good” in responding to FOIA requests, in that sometimes the agency would disclose a lot of information ― sometimes more than he expected. In many cases when ICE didn’t provide data, it didn’t have the information, he added.

“Whether you’re pro-enforcement or you’re anti-enforcement, the public debate could be much better informed if ICE’s data collection and reporting operation was improved,” Sandweg told HuffPost.

A CBP spokeswoman said that “due to the large volume and increasing complexity” of requests the agency receives, “delays are inevitable.” She said that requests to CBP’s FOIA office increased roughly 88 percent from the 2014 fiscal year to fiscal 2017.

The office has about 55 employees and granted full or partial information in about 42 percent of its cases in fiscal 2017, according to the DHS report.

Many requesters don’t blame hard-working FOIA officers for the troubles with FOIA responses, but say that transparency needs to get the same focus that other parts of an agency do.

“Congress should be deeply concerned when an executive agency basically flouts federal law,” said Mitra Ebadolahi, a Border Litigation Project staff attorney with the ACLU. She said that, among other reforms, there needs to “potentially be more robust sanctions for delay and obstruction, and that would need to be legislated, so that there’s an enforceable remedy.”

Under FOIA, agencies are also supposed to put frequently requested information online. With certain documents related to issues like the travel ban or separating families at the border, “they should just post that on their websites, it shouldn’t even be a FOIA process because you know that’s what people want,” said Ron Nixon, The New York Times’ homeland security correspondent.

Melissa del Bosque, an investigative reporter who has covered the U.S.-Mexico border since 1998, said journalists face significant obstacles shedding light on Trump’s immigration policies, as more and more people are put in detention.

“We’re just going to see a lot more abuse, hunger strikes, people with much, much longer detention sentences probably, who haven’t had their cases heard yet ... and it’ll be harder and harder for us as journalists to find them, or to be able to document their stories,” del Bosque said.

“It’s pretty bleak,” she added.But looking back, there may have been hints of marital trouble over the past few months. In an interview with Health magazine in February, Dewan Tatum revealed their marriage wasn’t perfect.

“When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.”

She added: “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.

Some outlets also pointed out that Dewan Tatum stepped out without Tatum at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party, and instead brought along her girlfriend, actress Emmanuelle Chriqui. Dewan Tatum insisted that Channing was “so happy to have a night off.”

People pointed out that the couple, who generally gush over each other on social media, have been relatively mum the past few months. Instead, Dewan Tatum posted what some now see as “cryptic Instagrams:”

After meeting on the set of “Step Up” in 2006, the two married in Malibu, California, in 2009 and welcomed their only child, Everly, in 2013.

The couple said they remain devoted to their 4-year-old in a statement they released about their split on Monday.

“We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together,” the statement said.

“Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now,” it continued. “There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.”

AdvertisementJay-Z documented his mother’s coming out as a lesbian for posterity on “Smile,” a track on his acclaimed 2017 album, “4:44.”

On the next episode of Netflix’s “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,” the rapper reveals his mom Gloria Carter opened up to him about her sexuality just one day before he hit the studio to record the album.

Though Jay-Z told host David Letterman he “knew” the truth about his mom, “This was the first time we had the conversation,” he said.

“Imagine having lived your life for someone else. And you think you’re protecting your kids,” Jay-Z explained in the clip above. “And for my mother to have to live as someone that she wasn’t and hide and like, protect her kids ― and didn’t want to embarrass her kids, and you know, for all this time.”

As for how he took the news, Jay-Z said, “I mean, I really cried. I cried because I was so happy for her that she was free.”

This was “the first time I heard her say she loved her partner. Like, ‘I feel like I love somebody.’ She said ‘I feel like.’ She held that little bit back, still,” he added. “And I just, I cried. I don’t even believe in crying because you’re happy. I don’t even know what that is. What is that?”

“Smile” went on to become one of the most buzzed-about songs on “4:44,” and features a spoken-word outro from Gloria Carter herself.

“Mama had four kids, but she’s a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she’s a thespian,” Jay-Z raps on the song. “Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate / Society shame and the pain was too much to take.”

Gloria Carter talked about the track in an interview with the D’usse Friday podcast in September, saying that although she was “never ashamed” of her private life, it was “never discussed” among her family members.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday aimed at blocking the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, saying such a question violates the U.S. Constitution’s mandate to count all persons.

In a statement, Schneiderman’s office said the suit was filed on behalf of 17 states plus the District of Columbia, six cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. It comes a little over a week after the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, announced it would add the question. Schneiderman said the decision to add a citizenship question “blatantly” undermined the Constitution’s mandate to count all people.

“The prospect of someone saying, ‘I am from the Trump administration’ knocking on your door to ask a question about citizenship would understandably provoke real fear,” Schneiderman said during a Tuesday press conference, flanked by members of New York’s congressional delegation.

The numbers from the census are used to determine how many seats each state gets in Congress, as well as how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated. Democratic members of New York’s congressional delegation said Tuesday that the decision to add a citizenship question was an attack on states, like New York, with high immigrant populations in an attempt to cut their congressional representation and share of federal funding.

“It is being added to harm states and cities like New York both politically and financially,” said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). “We are being unfairly targeted because we have large, diverse immigrant populations which we welcome and support.”

Civil rights groups voiced loud opposition to adding the question, noting that the bureau has not tested the question and that immigrant groups will be afraid to respond out of fear about their immigration status. In September, census researchers reported they were already seeing an unprecedented amount of concern about the confidentiality of census responses amid the Trump administration’s harsh immigration rhetoric and policies.

The census already asks Americans about their citizenship as part of the American Community Survey, a smaller annual survey that goes out to about 3 million people. The Department of Justice asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying it needed better information to better enforce Section 2 the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 law designed to protect the voting power of minorities. Section 2 prohibits discriminatory voting practices.

The census has not asked about citizenship on the decennial form since 1950, and former top Justice Department officials say that the ACS provides adequate data to enforce the law.

On Tuesday, Schneiderman questioned whether U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was really interested in better enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

“Jeff Sessions has not brought one case under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act since he’s been Attorney General,” he said.

A Commerce Department spokesman expressed confidence that the decision to add the citizenship question would withstand legal scrutiny.

“We are not going to comment on the specifics of pending litigation, but these cases are without merit. We look forward to prevailing in court and continuing to work with the Census Bureau to conduct a complete and accurate 2020 census,” the spokesman said.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Tuesday continued his attacks on the media by implying that U.S. journalists are “fake news” during a joint press conference with leaders from the Baltic countries.

“Pick a reporter, please. You can pick a reporter ― a Baltic reporter, ideally,” he told Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis, while taking questions from journalists. “Real news, not fake news.”

His remarks generated laughter from the audience.

Trump called on only one American reporter, Steve Holland of Reuters, at the beginning of Tuesday’s news conference.

Trump has issued a number of tweets in recent days attacking various news organizations, from CNN to The Washington Post, as “fake,” part of an ongoing pattern of denigrating the press.

At other joint news conferences with foreign leaders, where each leader will typically select two reporters for questions, Trump has often called on reporters from right-wing outlets.

Political and media analysts have repeatedly warned that Trump’s constant attacks on journalism put him in the company of antidemocratic strongmen like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In August, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights, noted that “freedom of the press, not only sort of a cornerstone of the U.S. Constitution but very much something that the United States defended over the years, is now itself under attack from the president.”Employers who stiff their workers or discriminate against them just got a big lift from the Supreme Court, which issued a major ruling Monday making it easier for companies to avoid employee lawsuits.

The 5-4 ruling upheld employers’ use of class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. By signing these controversial provisions, workers give up their right to band together and sue in court for back pay or damages, and are instead forced to take their disputes to arbitrators individually.

Arbitration agreements have become a common way for employers to stifle lawsuits that could lead to large plaintiff classes and big payouts. Workers backed by employee groups and labor unions challenged their employers’ use of these agreements, claiming they ran afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, which guarantees workers the right to join forces in “mutual aid and protection.”

The employer-friendly conservative majority on the court decided against the workers. They ruled that collective bargaining law does not supersede federal law that established the arbitration process, therefore making the class-action waivers in employment contracts legitimate.

Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying Congress did not write the NLRA to “displace” federal arbitration law.

“The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,” Gorsuch wrote.

The high court has previously ruled that companies can force consumers into arbitration agreements with class-action waivers, which are tucked into the fine print when you buy a plane ticket or sign up for a cell phone. The latest ruling effectively sanctions the use of these waivers in the workplace, a practice that has grown increasingly common over the last two decades.

The Supreme Court ruling will have long-lasting implications for workers. Class-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws.

It’s harder to pursue these cases as a single worker than as part of a group, which is why employers prefer arbitration. Lawyers can be reluctant to file individual complaints in which the judgments or settlements will be small and not worth their time. Many workers are also hesitant to file their lawsuits as individuals, fearing their employers will ostracize or retaliate against them.

In a strong dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision of the majority “egregiously wrong.” She argued that the rights under the NLRA include the right to pursue litigation collectively, and that an employer-dictated waiver would violate it.

“Employees’ rights to band together to meet their employers’ superior strength would be worth precious little if employers could condition employment on workers signing away those rights,” Ginsburg wrote.

During oral arguments last year, Justice Stephen Breyer said the case could undermine “the entire heart of the New Deal” by weakening collective action by workers.

According to a report last year from the Economic Policy Institute, an estimated 25 million workers ― just under one-quarter of non-union employees in the private sector ― give up their right to join class-action lawsuits as a condition of employment. The report anticipated that waivers would become an “even more widespread practice” in the event the Supreme Court sanctioned them.

“Class-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws.”

The Supreme Court case, National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., consolidated three separate cases involving different employers: the software company Epic Systems, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young, and the oil company and gas station chain Murphy Oil.

A former Murphy Oil employee, Sheila Hobson, claimed that when she worked at one of the company’s retail stores, she and her colleagues were required to do off-the-clock work they weren’t compensated for. They got together to sue the company for back pay. But when they consulted a lawyer, they learned they couldn’t take Murphy Oil to court as a group because they had already agreed to arbitration when they accepted their jobs.

The National Labor Relations Board, the independent agency that enforces collective bargaining law, argued that the forced arbitration clause interfered with Hobson’s right to join together with other employees to improve their working conditions. The Obama White House agreed, filing a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Hobson.“I want to thank the White House Historical Association and all of the people that work so hard with Melania, with everybody, to keep this incredible house or building, or whatever you want to call it — because there really is no name for it; it is special — and we keep it in tip-top shape. We call it sometimes tippy-top shape. And it’s a great, great place.”Denmark just got its first public monument to a black woman, and it flips the script on the country’s dark colonial past.

The nearly 23-foot-tall statue titled “I Am Queen Mary” made its public debut in Copenhagen on Saturday. It is a tribute to the 19th-century rebel leader Mary Thomas, who led a revolt against her Danish overlords on the Caribbean island of St. Croix. She was known as “Queen Mary.”

Artists Jeannette Ehlers of Denmark and La Vaughn Belle of the U.S. Virgin Islands ― which St. Croix is now a part of ― created the work to “memorialize Denmark’s colonial impact in the Caribbean and those who fought against it.”

“This project challenges Denmark’s role in slavery and the commemoration of its colonial past. It aims to change the narrative around this history and demonstrates how artists can be leaders in this conversation,” the artists’ statement says.

While most public statues in Denmark represent white men, this tribute was directly inspired by the best known of the “three rebel queens.” Alongside “Queen Agnes” and “Queen Mathilda,” Queen Mary helped lead the 1878 St. Croix labor rebellion known as the “Fireburn.”Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are splitting up after nearly nine years of marriage, the couple announced on social media.

The couple also said they would not have any further comment and asked for privacy.

The two met on the set of the 2006 film “Step Up,” and quickly became known for their adoring social media tributes, jokes for each other and posts about their child. They also reenacted a classic “Step Up” scene on the 10th anniversary of the film’s release:

Universal Studios announced Tuesday that “Stranger Things” will be the star of its annual spookfest, “Halloween Horror Nights,” in Hollywood, Orlando and Singapore.

Fans of the Netflix sci-fi smash hit will get to enter the Upside Down, an eerie parallel universe swarming with Demogorgons. The demonic beasts haunted the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the show.

Universal Studios collaborated with the streaming service, series creators Matt and Ross Duffer and executive producer Shawn Levy to create themed mazes. The environments will replicate characters, scenes and storylines from the show’s first season — so we wouldn’t recommend that you dress up as Barb, if you know what we mean.

“From the menacing Hawkins National Laboratory, under the U.S. Department of Energy, to the Byers home adorned with an erratic display of flashing Christmas lights and the eerie Upside Down woods oozing a shower of floating orb-like spores, the chilling new mazes will offer surprising twists and unexpected turns around every corner,” Universal Studios said in a statement.

The first season of the series focuses on a group of middle school boys whose friend Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears. The show has been renewed for a third season.

AdvertisementFour people are injured after a woman opened fire at YouTube headquarters on Tuesday afternoon.

Police identified the suspect as Nasim Aghdam, 39, of San Diego. She died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police said Aghdam was “upset with YouTube,” and she had expressed frustrations with the company in the months before the shooting.

A woman opened fire at the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, on Tuesday afternoon, injuring several people with a handgun before killing herself, authorities said.

Police identified the shooter as 39-year-old Nasim Aghdam, a resident of San Diego. She appears to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said during a news conference.

Four others were injured, officials said. Three victims sustained gunshot wounds and one apparently injured an ankle while fleeing the attack.

“At this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,” the San Bruno Police Department said in a statement.

Dr. Andre Cambpell, a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General, said all the patients were awake and aware of what happened.

“Once again we are confronted with the specter of a mass casualty situation in the city of San Francisco, where we now have three victims that we have taken care of,” Campbell said. “This is unfortunate and continues. To think that after we’ve seen Las Vegas, Parkland, the Pulse nightclub shooting, that we would see an end to this, but we have not.”

Aghdam was a prolific social media user and had several YouTube channels in multiple languages, including English, Farsi and Turkish. Her videos often showed her dancing or cooking vegan recipes, and her Instagram account had more than 55,000 followers.

All of Aghdam’s YouTube and Instagram accounts were shut down on Tuesday evening.

In recent months, Aghdam was openly critical of YouTube’s policies and even accused the company of intentionally restricting her channel’s growth, according to a website apparently created by her.

“There is no equal growth opportunity on YOUTUBE or any other video sharing site,” Aghdam wrote. “Your channel will grow if they want to!!!!!”

“We know she was upset with YouTube,” Barberini told reporters Wednesday. “That’s the motive we’ve identified.”

In February 2017, Aghdam posted a photo on Facebook of her holding a sign that accuses YouTube of discriminating against its users and censoring its users’ content. A page appearing to be Aghdam’s personal website also listed her frustrations with YouTube, saying, “there is no free speech in real world & you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system.”

Aghdam’s family told reporters on Tuesday night that they feared she might try to target the company.

“She was always complaining that YouTube ruined her life,” her brother, Shahran Aghdam, told The Mercury News from the family’s home in Menifee, California.

The Aghdam family said they felt “shock” and “can’t make sense of what happened yesterday” in a statement provided Wednesday to Jason Martinez, a local ABC reporter, and Craig Fiegener, a reporter for local radio station KNX 1070.

“We are praying for speedy recovery of the injured and ask God to bestow patience upon all persons hurt in this horrific senseless act,” the statement read.

The shooter’s father, Ismail Aghdam, said he reported his daughter missing on Monday after family members were unable to contact her and that he told police he suspected she might be going to YouTube. Police in Mountain View ― about 30 miles from the YouTube campus ― said they had found Aghdam sleeping in her car around 2 a.m. Tuesday.

Aghdan went to a local gun range later that morning, police said Wednesday. They did not identify which range she went to. Hours later, police would discover Aghdam’s body inside the YouTube office following the shooting.

One of the videos posted to Aghdam's channels last year accused YouTube of suppressing her account. YouTube

Graeme MacDonald, a 41-year-old product manager for Walmart eCommerce, watched the scene unfold from the fifth floor of his office building, roughly 1,000 feet away from YouTube HQ.

“I had come back from lunch and there were a couple people running in to get on the elevators,” MacDonald told HuffPost. “They were visibly shaken. They had heard gunshots.”

MacDonald said he saw an estimated 20 people evacuate YouTube with their hands over their heads around 1 p.m. local time.

“They looked scared,” he said. “There are helicopters are going by overhead. Evacuees were brought over behind our building. They’ve been telling us to stay away from the windows. ... It’s Silicon Valley. It’s a high-stress sort of area, but it still shocks me because there’s not a gun culture here at all.”

Law enforcement officials received numerous 911 calls around 12:45 p.m. local time reporting gunshots at the YouTube offices. Upon arrival, officers discovered a “very chaotic” scene as numerous employees fled the building.

“One person had a gunshot wound as we arrived,” Barberini said. “Several minutes later, while conducting a search of the premises, officers encountered a second individual with a gunshot wound that may have been self-inflicted. We are still working on confirming that. Two additional victims were located several minutes later at an adjacent business.”

The active shooter situation was resolved by 2:20 p.m. local time, San Bruno City Manager Connie Jackson told HuffPost. “The situation is safe, although the public has been asked to stay away.”

Vadim Lavrusik, a product manager for YouTube Live, and Dan Afergan, a software engineer for the company, both tweeted about the shooting on their campus.

Lavrusik said he heard shots and was barricaded inside of a room with his co-workers. Less than 20 minutes later, Lavrusik said he had been safely evacuated from the building.

Google, which owns YouTube, said it was working with authorities. There are about 1,700 people who work in the YouTube office, according to ABC 7 San Francisco.

Security at the Google office in Mountain View, California, 30 minutes south of YouTube’s headquarters, is typically strict. Employees who bring in guests are required to sign them in before entering the building.

At YouTube’s San Bruno office, people can freely enter the reception area, but need to be signed in before entering employee areas.

In a series of tweets, Todd Sherman, a product manager for YouTube, said he was in a meeting when he heard people running in the offices.

He said he first thought it was an earthquake, then he saw more people running.

“We headed towards the exit and then saw more people and someone said that there was a person with a gun,” Sherman wrote.

“At that point, every new person I saw was a potential shooter,” he added. “Someone else said that the person shot out the back doors and then shot themselves.”

While heading toward the building’s exit, Sherman said he saw “blood drips on the floor and stairs.”

Outside, he said, police officers had hopped out of their cruisers with rifles ready.

“I told them where the situation was as I headed down the street to meet up with a couple team members,” Sherman said.

YouTube CEO Susa Wojcicki thanked first responders and law enforcement for reacting quickly to the shooting in a tweet shared hours after the shooting.

“There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter at YouTube today,” Wojcicki wrote. “Our hearts go out to all those injured and impacted today. We will come together to heal as a family.”

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, which owns YouTube, released a statement Tuesday to employees, thanking first responders and the company’s security team for their quick actions that helped to keep people safe.

“I know a lot of you are in shock right now,” Pichai’s statement said. “Over the coming days, we will continue to provide support to help everyone in our Google family heal from this unimaginable tragedy.”

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), whose district includes the YouTube headquarters, said she was “shocked and saddened to hear about another mass shooting.”

“We must take action and #EndGunViolence,” she tweeted.

President Donald Trump tweeted his “thoughts and prayers” to everyone involved.

Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018

This article has been updated with the shooter’s identity as announced by law enforcement and her suspected motive, along with a family statement.In a March 28 tweet, Ingraham accused David Hogg, 17, of “whining” about having been rejected by four of the colleges to which he’d applied. Her tweet backfired and prompted Nestlé, Hulu, Rachael Ray and other advertisers to distance themselves from the conservative pundit, whose Fox show, “The Ingraham Angle,” is off the air this week on a pre-planned break.

Ingraham, meanwhile, has apologized for the incident, while Fox News re-released a statement from co-president Jack Abernethy pledging to support her. Amid the media firestorm, a controversial moment from her past has resurfaced. During her senior year at New Hampshire’s Dartmouth College, she served as the editor of an independent conservative newspaper, The Dartmouth Review, and sent a reporter to secretly record a support group for LGBTQ students.

Ingraham published excerpts of the Gay Students Association meeting, which “included people describing their sexual experiences and talking about their sexual identities,” according to a 1984 report in The New York Times weeks after the incident. The contemporaneous Times report said the Review’s article named two association officials but “did not identify” the meeting’s participants.

At the time of the controversy, The Dartmouth Review had been “criticized in the past for articles deriding blacks, women and minorities” and was defended by a New Hampshire civil liberties group “against a libel suit filed by a black music professor,” according to The New York Times.

Ingraham defended her decision to have the reporter record the meeting because the Gay Students Association had refused to reveal how it spent funding it had received from Dartmouth.

“It is a freedom of the press issue, obviously,” she said at the time.

Rabbi David Seidenberg also outlined the incident in a Newsweek article Monday, writing that a friend of his was outed by the meeting transcript and “was terrified about what would happen to her prospects” as a result.

Comparing Ingraham’s 1984 controversy to the one that broke last week following her comments on Hogg, Seidenberg wrote, “I hope the day comes when [she] treats people the right way every week, adults and liberals included, without being threatened with a boycott.”

Ingraham went on to renounce her actions as editor of The Dartmouth Review in a 1997 Washington Post op-ed. In it, she said that her “views and rhetoric about homosexuality have been tempered” after learning that her brother, Curtis, is gay, and watching his partner, Richard, die of an AIDS-related illness.The lead designer of a waterslide that killed a 10-year-old boy in Kansas City, Kansas, in 2016 has been taken into custody, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.

Marshals detained John Schooley, 72, at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Monday after he arrived on a flight from China, the Marshals Service said in a release. He faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated battery, and aggravated endangerment of a child.

Schooley played a major role in the creation of Verrückt, a 168-foot-high waterslide that decapitated Caleb Schwab on Aug. 7, 2016, at Schlitterbahn Waterpark, authorities alleged. He was responsible for doing “the math” that went into Verrückt’s design, but had “no engineering credentials relevant to amusement ride design or safety,” according to a lawsuit against the park filed by the state of Kansas last month.

At least 10 other Schlitterbahn customers had been hurt riding Verrückt before Caleb’s death, according to the lawsuit, including broken toes and concussions.

A Kansas grand jury last month indicted Schooley along with the water park, its construction company, park co-owner Jeffrey Henry and former director of operations Tyler Miles on criminal charges in Caleb’s death. Miles pleaded not guilty last month to involuntary manslaughter. Henry is scheduled to enter a plea to a second-degree murder charge on Thursday, according to The San Antonio Express-News.

Schlitterbahn has denied wrongdoing, and defended Miles, Henry and Schooley in a statement last week.

AdvertisementSeth Meyers couldn’t resist ridiculing President Donald Trump over his bizarre speech during the White House Easter Egg Roll.

On Monday’s broadcast of “Late Night,” Meyers dissected the weirdest elements of Trump’s address, which included boasts about his supposed accomplishments and a strange struggle to describe the White House.

“Now remember, this is to an audience of young children who are just there to play games with eggs,” said Meyers. “What are you talking about? I’m shocked the children didn’t start booing.”Fox News’ Shep Smith was quick to pounce on President Donald Trump Tuesday, who followed up his series of tweets criticizing Amazon with a rant about how the online retailer costs the United States Postal Service and American taxpayers “billions of dollars a year.”

The president, speaking at the White House Tuesday, seemed to be referring to “last-mile deliveries,” in which Amazon, along with other delivery giants like Fed Ex and UPS, drop packages off at post offices and use local USPS drivers to deliver parcels to the door.

But, as Smith pointed out, the postal service, which has faced revenue declines for years with the rise of email and fewer individuals sending first-class mail, says it actually makes money by delivering packages for Amazon and other delivery services.

“As for taxpayers,” Smith continued, “the post office’s own website points out, and I quote, ‘The postal service receives no tax dollars for operating expenses.’” Instead, the service “relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.”

USPS is described as a partially independent agency, or a quasi-governmental agency, as The Wall Street Journal pointed out. Much of its financial woes over the years have stemmed from changing consumer behavior and a 2006 mandate from Congress that the service prepay benefits for future retired employees, according to NPR.

Still, Trump claimed Amazon was responsible for the post office’s financial troubles. He added, “A report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government, meaning the post office, loses $1.47.”

Smith fact-checked Trump some more, saying the number the president cited likely came from a Citigroup study released last year that showed the postal service was charging $1.46 below market rates for package delivery.

“But our researchers point out, if that discount exists, it’s not just for Amazon ― it’s a bulk rate discount,” he said.

Turning to Fox News reporter John Roberts, Smith continued, “There is a great deal of confusion or something here regarding Amazon and the post office because none of that was true.”Don’t expect Perez Hilton to be signing up his 5-year-old son for dance classes anytime soon.

The celebrity blogger and multimedia entrepreneur sparked criticism by saying he wants his son, Mario Armando Lavandeira III, to grow up to be straight because it’s “easier.” As a result, Hilton said he was reluctant to enroll Mario in a dance class, because “like 50 percent or more of little boys who take dance class end up being gay.”

“If I had my preference, I would prefer my son to be heterosexual because that’s easier,” Hilton said in an April 1 YouTube clip posted to his website, which can be viewed above. “As a gay man, I’m not ashamed of being gay, but if I could go back in time and when I was 18, be given a choice ... I would’ve chosen, then, to be heterosexual.”

He continued: “Being a gay man, or even a gay woman or a transgender man or a transgender woman in America and around the world is still a harder road to travel on. We are still discriminated against, and I don’t want my son [or daughters Mia, 2, and Mayte, 5 months] to have a harder path in life.”

I already clarified that what I think happens is... gay boys are more drawn to dance class than straight boys. BUT, having said that, I’m not signing him up for ballet! Thankfully, he hasn’t asked! https://t.co/pIXqRY9TJR — Perez (@ThePerezHilton) April 3, 2018

Sunday’s video statement clarified similar comments Hilton made in an episode of “The Perez Hilton Podcast” last week.

“This might get me in trouble, [but] I purposefully would not put my son in dance class, because dance class might make your kid gay,” he told co-host Chris Booker. “I would prefer if my son was heterosexual. If I had to choose, I would be heterosexual, too. It would be easier. I’ve said that before.” (Hilton’s comments come at about 26:51 in the “Chippendales” episode of the podcast.)

Both the podcast and the subsequent video drew scathing responses from many on social media. They also prompted a lengthy rebuttal from Dance Magazine’s Courtney Escoyne, who wrote Tuesday, “Are there gay men in dance? Yes. Did dancing make them that way? No.”

Hilton didn’t back down on his original remarks in the video Sunday, noting, “I don’t think it’s a homophobic thing to say that a disproportionate amount of male singers, actors [and] dancers on Broadway are gay. There are more gay men drawn to that profession. That’s not homophobic ― that’s just a fact.”

“If he really wanted to take dance class ― which he hasn’t expressed that ― if he begged and pleaded and I saw that would him truly happy, I would do that,” he said of his son. “But I’m not just going to sign him up for one.”Demonstrators face off with California Highway Patrol officers as they protest the police shooting of Stephon Clark, in Sacramento, California, on March 30, 2018.

When former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem in August 2016, it was in protest of unjust police killings of black Americans.

For his courage, Kaepernick lost his job, the NFL lost its mind by forbidding the peaceful action ― and meanwhile, at least 378 black Americans have lost their lives in police killings.

That most recent estimate of black police violence victims comes from data compiled by The Washington Post and analyzed by HuffPost.

Last August, HuffPost reported that based on the Post’s data, at least 223 black Americans had been killed by police gunfire in the year since Kaepernick first sat, then took a knee, to protest police violence. Less than a year later, that number has increased by at least 155 people.

It’s likely that the real number of victims is higher. Between Aug. 14, 2016 ― when Kaepernick first sat out the national anthem ― and now, at least 253 of the people listed in the Post’s database did not have their race confirmed. Furthermore, the database only includes shooting deaths, so people like Eric Garner, a black father who was unarmed when an officer put him in a fatal chokehold, would not be included.

In total, 3,357 people have been fatally shot by police since 2015, according to the Post’s data.

The sobering numbers come just after the NFL announced its cowardly decision on Wednesday to ban kneeling during the national anthem. The league can now fine teams that participate in protests, with the punishment of individual players left up to their team.

In a statement, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that “on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.” (He did not seem to understand that silencing a peaceful protest might also come across as unpatriotic.)

Say their names...

Polling has shown that views on the NFL protests are deeply polarized, but most Americans polled last fall said they believed the players were protesting police violence, not the American flag. Kaepernick also made it clear that he was protesting racism, police violence and inequality.

Yet President Donald Trump has called the protests a “total disrespect of our heritage,” and “a total disrespect of everything we stand for.”

Trump even suggested that protesting players should leave the country.

“You have to stand proudly for the National Anthem or you shouldn’t be playing,” Trump said. “You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.”

Trump also said he’d like NFL owners to say, “get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired” if a player protested.

Despite the vitriol, Kaepernick did reach out to veterans to make sure his protests were respectful. Initially, the former quarterback simply sat out the anthem, but former Green Beret Nate Boyer says he persuaded him to kneel.

“That’s how it all started with Colin and I, neither of us knew that kneeling would be the result of our conversation,” Boyer wrote in an open letter to both Kaepernick and Trump last October. “Colin wanted to sit, I wanted him to stand, and so we found a common ground on a knee alongside his teammates. I believe that progress and real change happens in this world when you reach across the divide, you build a bridge, you swallow your pride, you open your mind, you embrace what you don’t understand, and ultimately you surrender.”

One person killed by police since Kaepernick began protesting was 22-year-old Stephon Clark, who was shot at 20 times by two officers in his own backyard in Sacramento, California, earlier this year. He was armed with only a cellphone.

Clark’s death sparked a wave of protests across the city. And why not? The killing was sickening, and Clark deserved more than to be another statistic.Former Rep. Blake Farenthold could lose his new lobbyist job because of the weird way he was hired. Bill Clark via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― Disgraced former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) may have been hired illegally at his new job at a Texas port authority, and a local newspaper on Monday filed a lawsuit that could result in his being ejected.

Farenthold, who abruptly resigned from Congress last month while under investigation for sexual harassment, announced last week that he landed a gig as a lobbyist for the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca, Texas.

The problem is that the local government entity did not give public notice that it was hiring Farenthold or that it was creating a job for him that pays $160,000 a year. Under the Texas Open Meetings Act, public entities must give notice of actions being taken at upcoming meetings and allow for public comment. The port did give notice of its May 9 meeting, after which Farenthold was hired, but it used vague language about personnel matters.

“They didn’t even talk about the fact that they were hiring a lobbyist, much less that it was Blake Farenthold,” said Joe Larsen, a Houston-based attorney who serves on the board of directors for the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Specificity has to match the level of public interest.”

The Victoria Advocate, a local Texas newspaper, filed a lawsuit with the Calhoun County district court on Monday arguing that the port violated state law and demanding that the law be upheld.

If the newspaper prevails, Farenthold will be out of a job. The port could always rehire him, but it would first have to hold a public meeting letting anyone in the community weigh in.

“He is an ex-congressman, with the history he has, and his position is unprecedented,” said John Griffin, a lawyer representing the newspaper. “Those details are of high public importance.”

Here is a copy of the complaint:

Farenthold did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A request for comment from the port authority’s attorneys was not returned. They have asked the Texas attorney general for an opinion on whether Farenthold’s hiring was illegal, though that process could take up to a year, and the attorney general’s opinion won’t matter if the court rules in favor of the paper.

Chris Cobler, the editor of the Victoria Advocate, wrote an editorial on Sunday laying out the paper’s reasoning for taking legal action. He emphasized that the lawsuit isn’t about whether the port should or shouldn’t have hired Farenthold, but about open government.

“This is about reminding our elected officials that they work for the public,” Cobler told HuffPost.

But it is a mystery why the port authority brought on Farenthold. His job is to lobby Congress, where he has burned bridges with his former colleagues. Not only did he get sued for sexual harassment by a former aide, but he never paid back $84,000 in taxpayer money he used to settle that lawsuit ― even after publicly vowing in December to repay it immediately. Lawmakers in both parties have been badgering him for months to pay it back, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to no avail.

The port authority’s board of directors is meeting Thursday to decide what to do about Farenthold’s job, according to a public notice issued Monday.

Griffin, who said he personally knows all the board members, couldn’t say why they hired him in the first place. But he proposed a relatively easy way for the port authority to move past the mess that has come with Farenthold.

“They could discharge him,” Griffin said. “If they decide he reneged on his commitment to repay taxpayers for a settlement in a case against him and that his brand name clearly has been tarnished, that would give the port good grounds to let him go.”
