Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, now has a permanent security clearance after longstanding scrutiny over his alleged meetings with foreign officials, multiple outlets reported Wednesday.

Kushner had been operating under a temporary security clearance while the FBI performed a background check.

He has been the subject of scrutiny in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and other congressional probes for revising his SF-86 form used to gain a security clearance and retroactively reporting interactions with foreign officials, including Russians.

“With respect to the news about his clearances, as we stated before, his application was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and underwent the normal process,” Abbe Lowell, a personal attorney for Kushner, said in a statement. “Having completed all of these processes, he’s looking forward to continuing to do the work the president has asked him to do.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

White House officials stripped Kushner’s top-secret-level clearance in February, in response to a scandal over former staff secretary Rob Porter. Porter, who resigned after allegations surfaced that he had abused his two ex-wives, also had been granted a temporary clearance pending the completion of a prolonged FBI background check.

Scrutiny over the White House’s handling of Porter’s abuse allegations exposed that numerous other officials also had only temporary clearances.President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen withdrew lawsuits against BuzzFeed News and Fusion GPS on Wednesday to focus on the investigation against him that led to an FBI raid last week.

Cohen filed a pair of defamation lawsuits against BuzzFeed and political intelligence firm Fusion GPS in January after BuzzFeed published an unverified dossier, commissioned by Fusion GPS, that claimed Cohen had met with Russian operatives in Europe to cover up Trump’s ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Cohen’s attorney David Schwartz said Cohen is dropping the lawsuits so he and his legal team won’t have to split their focus after special counselor Robert Mueller enabled the FBI to seize documents from Cohen’s home, hotel and office last week. According to Politico, Cohen and his lawyers will now be devoting their resources to recovering the files seized during the raid.

“The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,” Schwartz said in a statement to Politico. “We believe the defendants defamed my client, and vindicating Mr. Cohen’s rights was — and still remains — important. But given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention, and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.”

BuzzFeed continues to stand by the decision to publish the dossier and maintains that the lawsuits were without merit.

“The lawsuits against BuzzFeed over the Steele dossier have never been about the merits of our decision to publish it,” the company said in a statement. “If there’s one thing that Democrats and Republicans agree on today, it’s that the dossier was an important part of the government’s investigation into potential collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia.”

BuzzFeed News published the 35-page dossier in January 2017 and caused a national uproar. The document, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, contained a number of sensational claims about Trump and his campaign team.

Mueller is reportedly looking into the dossier’s claims as a part of his investigation into possible collusion between Trump and Russia to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential elections. CNN reported in October that investigators on Mueller’s team had met with Steele to inquire about the documents last summer.

The dossier includes allegations that Trump hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him” while visiting Moscow and that Russian officials have a tape of the incident. Former FBI Director James Comey has written in his memoir that the president was obsessed with disproving the tape’s existence.

“I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the ― the ― current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013,” Comey said in an interview with ABC Sunday night. “It’s possible, but I don’t know.”

WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday narrowly confirmed Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), a former Navy pilot with no scientific credentials and who doesn’t believe humans are primarily to blame for the global climate crisis, to lead NASA.

Bridenstine will become the first elected official to hold the NASA administrator job. He joins a Cabinet already loaded with people who question the near-universal scientific consensus that climate change is real and that human activity is the primary cause.

The final vote ― which was 50-49 along party lines ― came one day after the Senate narrowly advanced Bridenstine’s nomination, thanks to an about-face from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and a key vote from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Rubio, who in September told Politico that he worried about Bridenstine’s nomination “could be devastating for the space program,” said in a statement Wednesday that he decided to support the nominee in order to avoid “a gaping leadership void” at NASA.

Today, the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Jim Bridenstine as our 13th administrator. Once sworn in, he will oversee our ongoing mission of exploration and discovery. Welcome to the NASA family! pic.twitter.com/r1Eiyb13PY — NASA (@NASA) April 19, 2018

Much like the procedural vote on Wednesday, which was temporarily deadlocked at 49-49, Thursday’s confirmation ultimately hinged on Flake, who voted in favor only after a bit of drama that included a long discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and stepping out for a phone call, as CNN’s Manu Raju reports.

Bridenstine will replace Robert Lightfoot Jr., who has been serving as acting administrator since previous NASA administrator, Charles Bolden Jr., resigned from his post in January.

In a statement following Thursday’s vote, Bridenstine said he is humbled by the opportunity. “I look forward to working with the outstanding team at NASA to achieve the President’s vision for American leadership in space,” he said.

The Senate confirmation comes more than seven months after President Donald Trump tapped Bridenstine for the post. Democrats skewered Bridenstine during the confirmation process, pegging him as “extreme” and unqualified to oversee a scientific agency with an annual budget of more than $18 billion.

Echoing previous statements, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday that he finds Bridenstine’s behavior in Congress “as divisive as any in Washington.” And he called Bridenstine’s previous comments about climate change “troubling.”

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said before Thursday’s vote that it is “downright dangerous” to put someone without the appropriate expertise in charge of NASA.

“And quite frankly it is even more frightening to have a leader who has made a career out of ignoring scientific expertise,” he said.

There is simply no excuse for voting for someone so unqualified to run NASA. They aren’t even bothering to make the argument that he will be a good administrator. They are just voting yes and getting out of town. For me this is a good reminder that elections have consequences. — Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) April 19, 2018

In a June 2013 speech, Bridenstine peddled a debunked argument made by climate change skeptics, claiming that global temperatures “stopped rising 10 years ago.” He said “the people of Oklahoma are ready to accept” an apology from then-President Barack Obama for what Bridenstine called a “gross misallocation” of funds for climate change research instead of weather forecasting.

Critics have also pointed to Bridenstine’s history of opposing equal rights for same-sex couples ― in 2013, he suggested LGBTQ people are sexually immoral ― and voiced concern about his ability to manage an agency of more than 17,000 employees. Bridenstine has no formal background in science or engineering.

The former Navy Reserve pilot previously served as executive director of the Air and Space Museum & Planetarium in Tulsa, Oklahoma. During his tenure, the nonprofit suffered financial losses, and an investigation by the Project On Government Oversight found that Bridenstine used the nonprofit’s resources to benefit a company he co-owned, according to a report from The Daily Beast this week.

Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and James Inhofe (Okla.), have flocked to Bridenstine’s defense.

On Wednesday, Cruz called Bridenstine a “strong leader” and said he could think of few people more inspirational or qualified. And he blasted “cynical politicians” for “attempting to malign his character.”

.@NASA will have that strong leader in Jim Bridenstine. Having spent his entire adult life in public service, first in combat as a fighter pilot, then in the House of Representatives, he is a principled and effective leader who I count as a dear friend. pic.twitter.com/RSjFg2muAU — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) April 19, 2018

In a Twitter post, Inhofe said Bridenstine “has the experience to take our space program to new heights b/c of his background as an aviator, passion for space & work to modernize our nation’s space program.”

At his confirmation hearing in November, Bridenstine said NASA was “at a critical time in its history” and that he would build off the hard work of the previous administration.

“Humanity is ready to go to deep space for the first time in 45 years,” he said.The trailer for Pixar’s “Incredibles 2” hit the internet last week, and while everyone is happy to see the return of their favorite family of supers, one character is conspicuous by her absence ― at least, her visible absence. And no, it’s not Violet.

Honey Best (Kimberly Adair Clark) had a small but memorable role in the first “Incredibles,” arguing with her husband, Lucius ― aka the superhero Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) ― as he’s searching for his super suit. We never see Honey in that scene, only hearing her voice.

Honey will be in “Incredibles 2” ― but once again, apparently, we won’t actually be seeing her.

“She’s funnier as a voice,” writer and director Brad Bird reportedly said during a press conference at Pixar, according to SlashFilm. (ComicBook.com says the press event happened sometime this month.) “We actually went through all the trouble of designing a character and the design appears in the movie but not as Frozone’s wife,” Bird said. “We have used her design and she is a hero but there’s not a lot of screen time though.”

Honey is generally thought to be a woman of color. Given the overall dearth of diversity in Hollywood films, some critics think a character like Honey should exist in “Incredibles 2” as more than just disembodied dialogue.

“It’d be great if we could get richer characterization for Honey, something that showcases her as rounded, fleshed-out character instead of just a sassy black voice,” Monique Jones writes at Shadow and Act. Some social media users voiced similar concerns.

What kind of rock have you been under, Brad, that you think it's okay to say the only named black woman in both films is "funnier as a voice"? SMH — Tere Kirkland 🦀 (@TereKirkland) April 17, 2018

We hear Honey’s voice in the new “Incredibles 2” trailer ― but, evidently, we won’t be seeing her face. Unless maybe if there’s an “Incredibles 3” at some point.Trevor Noah gave President Donald Trump credit where credit was due on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show.”

The late-night host does not shy away from regularly criticizing the president. But after explaining how CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to prepare for a summit between Kim and Trump, Noah offered sincere praise.

“I know our first instinct is to hate,” said Noah. “But if it wasn’t for his craziness, North Korea would never have come to the table.”

“You know, that’s what he did. Trump is like the near-death experience that makes people forget why they were fighting in the first place. That’s who he is,” he added.Prince fans got a little taste of the artist’s royal badness just a few days before the two-year anniversary of his death.

On Thursday, the artist’s estate in collaboration with Warner Bros. Records, released the original studio version of his iconic song “Nothing Compares 2 U” — originally composed, arranged and performed by Prince.

This previously unreleased rendition, which was recorded Flying Cloud Drive Warehouse in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, in 1984, was committed to tape six years before it became a worldwide hit in 1990 for singer Sinéad O’Connor.

Susannah Melvoin and Paul “St. Paul” Peterson help with backing vocals while Eric Leeds is featured on saxophone, according to a press release.

A video brimming with previously unseen footage of Prince and The Revolution rehearsing “Nothing Compares 2 U” in the summer of 1984 was also released Thursday in conjunction with the song. In the video, you can see Prince doing a number of very Prince-like and very badass things.

Like making a mic stand look a thousand times cooler than any mic stand has ever looked before:

And clearly serving someone in his band some straight up shade:

Fox News host Laura Ingraham cut off a guest who taunted her about the boycott that prompted some two dozen advertisers to ditch “The Ingraham Angle.”

“Where’s your sponsors? David Hogg got rid of half of them,” said Enrique Morones, an immigration advocate and the founder of Border Angels. “A high school kid shut you down!”

The Fox News host appeared to reach her limit with Morones before he even made the crack, saying he was being dismissive of fellow guest John Cox, a Republican candidate for governor in California, during a debate over immigration.

“You’ve been so incredibly rude and nasty since almost the first second of this appearance,” she said, according to footage posted online by Media Matters.

Moments later, Morones vanished from the screen.

Ingraham has been losing sponsors since last month, when she mocked Hogg, one of the teen survivors of the Parkland, Florida mass shooting.

Hogg called for a boycott of Ingraham sponsors after she accused him of “whining” for not getting into some of the colleges he had applied for. One of those sponsors, Ace Hardware, later returned to the show. Another sponsor, My Pillow, actually increased its advertising.The tricky task of educating President Donald Trump about what really constitutes “fake news” fell to a third-grader on Wednesday’s broadcast of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live! ”

The late-night show recruited a 9-year-old named Noah to explain, in simple words that the president may understand, what the term really means ― as opposed to how Trump often incorrectly deploys it in his tweets and speeches.TONIGHT: Our host is still riding high off last night's interview with James Comey, and the amazing new friendship that blossomed backstage. #LSSC #ComeyOnColbert pic.twitter.com/zoEsSbmNdu — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 19, 2018

The “Late Show” host wondered if the president watched his Tuesday interview with former FBI Director James Comey.

“I hear he doesn’t watch TV hosts who don’t share his lawyer,” Colbert quipped.

But maybe Trump was watching after all.

Colbert thinks he may have found proof in a presidential tweet.President Donald Trump’s legal team has a new member: Rudy Giuliani.

The former prosecutor and New York City mayor told The Washington Post that he plans to help the president navigate Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation.

“I’m doing it because I hope we can negotiate an end to this for the good of the country and because I have high regard for the president and for Bob Mueller,” Giuliani told the Post.

In addition to his status as a personal friend of Trump’s and a former campaign advisor, Giuliani may add value in another key area: He served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, where Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen is currently the subject of a far-reaching investigation. Trump allies fear Cohen might flip on the president.

Giuliani reportedly angled to be appointed attorney general in the Trump administration but withdrew himself from consideration for both that position and secretary of state as Trump made it clear he’d look elsewhere.

Giuliani’s decision was confirmed to multiple news outlets by Jay Sekulow, another of Trump’s lawyers dealing with the Mueller probe. Trump’s previous lead attorney on the case, John Dowd, resigned in March.

Sekulow added that two more lawyers, Jane Serene Raskin and Marty Raskin, have also joined the team.

Trump has struggled to attract attorneys willing to handle the matter following Dowd’s departure. Late last month, Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush, told news outlets that many Washington lawyers are intentionally steering clear of the “turmoil” and “chaos” in the White House.

The president hit back at the claim in a series of tweets, saying numerous lawyers wanted to represent him, but he didn’t want to add to his legal team because it would take them too long to familiarize themselves with the case:

Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2018

It’s been six whole months since the first public allegations against Harvey Weinstein kicked off the Me Too movement. That’s half a year of introspection, important dialogue and frightened men worrying that feminist harpies/witch hunters have killed office romance forever.

Naturally, a handful of the most high-profile accused sexual predators are ready to make their triumphant returns.

Some might believe that six months is a pitifully short amount of time to spend outside the spotlight, forced to retreat into a multi-million dollar home to think about the women you’ve harmed over the course of years or even decades. But the menz are sad and the media loves a comeback story, so here we are.

I see we’ve reached the Sexual Predator Redemption Arc™️ phase 😐 pic.twitter.com/twxD7OzGmg — Sarah Lerner (@SarahLerner) April 18, 2018

If you find yourself wondering whether you, too, should write about a sad man overcoming his wealth and loneliness to regain his former glory, perhaps … don’t.

But if you push past the inner voice telling you no one wants or needs to read that story and maybe it’s best to direct time, energy and monetary resources elsewhere, we’ve put together a handy-dandy editorial guide.

Set the scene ― preferably on a bad-weather day, when X alleged sexual predator is dining at a ritzy restaurant and/or hotel.

“On the night of April 2, Charlie Rose walked into Gabriel’s Bar & Restaurant, a Lincoln Center eatery that’s popular among New York’s media elite.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Charlie Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)

“Notoriety won’t stop you from getting a table at Omar at Vaucluse on the Upper East Side. It might even help.” (Page Six on Matt Lauer, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting up to eight women.)

“On a gloomy Friday afternoon in February, Mario Batali sat down for coffee at the Marlton Hotel, a few blocks from Babbo, his restaurant in Greenwich Village.” (The New York Times on Mario Batali, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women.)

Mention X alleged sexual predator’s sprawling real estate holdings, specifically the property he retreated to in shame after being publicly accused of sexual assault/misconduct/harassment and from which he will now emerge like a butterfly from its chrysalis.

“Lauer is said to be testing the waters for a public comeback by coming out of hiding from his Hamptons home.” (Page Six on Lauer, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting up to eight women.)

“Rose decamped to his four-bedroom, 5,500-square-foot Long Island home in Bellport, from January through much of March.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)

Remind readers that X alleged sexual predator has been very sad and lonely without his lucrative career and widespread public adoration.

“Dressed in a dark suit, Rose projected dishevelment: his hair messy, his notebook’s pages askew, his gait shuffling. He headed to his table by himself and completed his dinner alone in under an hour. Previously one to take his time and glad-hand, Rose beat a hasty retreat. Perhaps out of a desire to give a struggling man his space — or worse, as a sign of indifference — no one in the restaurant approached Rose nor seemed to notice him.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)

Ask the big question.

“Is a comeback from such disgrace possible?” (The New York Times on Batali, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women.)

“...the question is not really whether C.K. will eventually come back but when, where and how.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Louis C.K., who has been accused of sexual misconduct by five women.)

Remind readers that X alleged sexual predator once apologized.

“Mr. Batali, 57, said he didn’t recall all the reported episodes, but immediately apologized.” (The New York Times on Batali, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women.)

“On Nov. 20, when salacious details of his alleged sexual misconduct surfaced, he issued a Twitter apology that admitted errors in judgment but stopped short of a full mea culpa. ‘I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,’ he wrote.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)

Be sure to name drop the Very Powerful People who are speaking to and counseling X alleged sexual predator. If you can quote said Very Powerful People, even better!

“‘[Charlie] plays tennis most mornings, which I think keeps him in shape and together,’ says Daily Beast co-founder and author Tina Brown, who says she has reached out to Rose in recent months.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)

“Christine C. Quinn, whom Mr. Batali supported during her 2013 run for New York City mayor, is now the president and chief executive of Win, the city’s largest provider of shelter for homeless families. She is a friend of Mr. Batali’s, and one of the advisers he sought out this winter.” (The New York Times on Batali, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women.)

“Rose has dined at Cipriani with power couple Joel Klein and Nicole Seligman — Klein is ex-chancellor of the New York City public school system and a top executive at insurance company Oscar Health; his wife, Seligman, is the former president of Sony Corporation of America.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)

“‘I don’t think people want this to be a life sentence,’ says Comedy Cellar owner Noam Dworman.” (The Hollywood Reporter on Louis C.K., who has been accused of sexual misconduct by five women.)

Drive home that X alleged sexual predator has been doing some serious *~self-reflection.~* Restorative justice achieved!

“Mr. Batali is examining what he has called his blind spots and considering how life might look when he is not, as he told one person he consulted over the winter, ‘the lead singer.’” (The New York Times on Batali, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women.)

“With his marriage to Annette Roque now over, he’s ready to restart his life, pals say.” (Page Six on Lauer, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting up to eight women.)

“Rose has taken on his ultimate assignment: ‘He’s one of the best interviewers in our lifetime, and he is now asking questions of himself.’” (The Hollywood Reporter on Rose, who has been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting 11 women.)Love actually turned to matrimony for Hugh Grant.

The 57-year-old actor married his longtime girlfriend, Anna Eberstein, in London on Friday, according to reports.

The couple was photographed celebrating with friends and family outside the Chelsea Register Office after a civil ceremony. Their intent to wed had already been posted in a public notice.

Eberstein, a 39-year-old Swedish TV producer, and Grant have three young children together ranging in age from 5 to a few months old.

It is the first marriage for Grant, who had a long-term romance with actress Elizabeth Hurley. The “About A Boy” and “Notting Hill” star also had a relationship with Tinglan Hong that produced a son and a daughter, ages 5 and 6.

Grant’s official vows may surprise some, given his public stance on marriage.

“I think there’s something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off,” he said on “The Howard Stern Show” in 2016.Paisley Face Mask

Arizona Republican congressional candidate Wendy Rogers. Wendy Rogers / Facebook

A Republican running for Congress in Arizona compared abortion to the Holocaust this week ― a trope that has a long history in the pro-life movement.

Wendy Rogers, a retired Air Force pilot seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st congressional district, made the comparison during a campaign event in Maricopa, Arizona, on Monday after she was asked about restricting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.

“The callousness that our country has for life is very disturbing,” Rogers said, according to audio captured by a tracker for Democratic opposition research firm American Bridge. “I have visited Auschwitz twice — maybe three times; three times. I have visited the killing fields in Cambodia. This is what happens to a country when the callousness for life erodes to that depth.”

She further called Planned Parenthood a “despicable organization,” and criticized “crooks” in Washington for failing to defund it.

“As someone who is 100% pro-life, I think what the Democratic Party has done to promote a Culture of Death is very much like the Holocaust - Planned Parenthood and other abortion doctors have killed millions of babies this decade alone - barbaric!” Rogers told HuffPost in response to a request for comment.

Rogers is one of four GOP candidates vying to challenge incumbent Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz.) in November. This is her fourth run for Congress, falling short in the primary each time. The National Republican Campaign Committee this year added her to their ‘Young Guns’ program.

Comparing abortion to the Holocaust is commonplace within the pro-life movement. Conservatives have similarly warned that other hot-button issues, like gay marriage or gun control, could lead the U.S. down the road of Nazi Germany.“Westworld” is about to turn into a s**t show.

Season 1 of the sci-fi thriller did a good job of providing fans closure on a number of questions — for example, yes, William (Jimmi Simpson) is indeed the same dude as the Man in Black (Ed Harris) and Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) is actually a robot.

But there’s still a litany of mysteries that need solvin’.

Is Ford (Anthony Hopkins) really dead? Did Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) truly solve the maze? Why is everyone always drinking milk?

(Dairy goes again ... )

There’s another mystery that originates deep down in the bowels of the park, and though it may not be your biggest unanswered question, it’s at least No. 2.

Do the robots poop?

Dolores and William about to lose their shit. HBO

The hosts in the “Westworld” park are made to appear like humans in almost every way. It’d make sense that they have the same bodily functions, too. But if Season 1 taught viewers anything, it’s that we can assume nothing.

In Episode 2 of the first season, we get the answer to the No. 1 mystery — Hey, do the robots urinate? — when the Man in Black tells an android named Lawrence (Clifton Collins Jr.), “I know the tune you whistle when you’re taking a piss.”

OK, so they have to poop, right?

HBO has been strangely coy about the whole issue. While HuffPost’s own Ashley Feinberg was writing for Deadspin, a rep told her shortly after the first season ended, “We don’t have any info to share.”

The lack of response shook her trust in the show.

“I think that, if you’re going to create a show about robots designed to fulfill humans’ most base desires, you should have to be prepared to answer some uncomfortable questions. For instance, what about people who like to be pooped on?” Feinberg told me. “What I discovered is that HBO is clearly not prepared to answer those questions, and I’m not sure my faith in them as a brand can ever be restored.”

Thankfully, one of the hosts from the park has finally cut the crap.

In a recent interview, I asked actor Steven Ogg, who plays villainous host Rebus, the all-important poop question. He didn’t give the info up easily, asking for clarification multiple times. Do hosts poop?

Do what?

(Louder) Do hosts poop?

That’s why I had to ask again. Do hosts poo? That’s what you said, right?

Then he revealed the hot, stinking, truth.

“Hosts take the biggest dukes of all, man, huge robot shits,” he said, continuing like he had taken a truth laxative.

“You think that steaming three-coiler of a dog in the middle of winter on a snowy bank is nasty? Good God, when you see a host lay one down, it’s like a sandcastle, motherfucker!”

I’m not sure I’ll be able to look at sandcastles, or even the Beyoncé song “Sandcastles,” the same way again. But, at least, finally, there’s an answer.

Robot turds just seem natural, especially after all the aforementioned milk that some hosts — in particular, Ogg’s Rebus — consumed in the early parts of Season 1. A few episodes in, however, the milk oddly disappeared. Ogg still doesn’t know what that was about.

“Yeah, I’m curious. I’m gonna ask [series co-creator Jonathan Nolan] about that. I was like, ‘What the fuck’s with all the milk?’ And then the milk disappeared. It seemed to be like Rebus’ thing.”

Season 2 apparently won’t have a “hell of a lot” of Rebus (though if you see any sandcastles, you know what he’s been up to), but there will be a small twist coming with the character.

“I’m excited and I’m super happy with [Nolan and co-creator Lisa Joy’s] direction ... because it was a turn. It was something different for Rebus, and I’m super excited about that.”

Shit’s about to go down in more ways than one.Ellen Burstyn is good at talking.

Seated in her living room overlooking Central Park on a brisk February afternoon, a wire-haired pooch perched at her feet, Burstyn registers as thoughtful, engaged and exceedingly well-read. Cluttered bookshelves line the walls. Crystals garnish the windowsill near our armchairs. A white piano sits across the room. Art from all corners of the globe hangs throughout her apartment, evincing an 85-year-old life full of adventures.

As quickly as we delve into the annals of her career ― from an auspicious Broadway debut to defining roles in “The Last Picture Show,” “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” “The Exorcist,” “Requiem for a Dream,” “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” “Interstellar” and “House of Cards” ― the conversation shifts to Burstyn’s spiritual fortification. She’s as infatuated with the cosmos and metaphysical ideology as she is anything to do with Hollywood, where she has gone from primo leading lady to venerated elder stateswoman.

In the next several weeks, Burstyn will appear in two movies: “The House of Tomorrow” (opening April 27) and “The Tale” (premiering May 26 on HBO). In the former, she’s an environmentally conscious grandmother obsessed with Buckminster Fuller, an architect and theorist who popularized the term “Spaceship Earth” (and a real-life friend of Burstyn’s; more on that later). In the latter, which was one of the most renowned films at Sundance this year, she’s a mother whose globetrotting daughter (Laura Dern) is reinvestigating a sexually abusive episode from her childhood. Onscreen, Burstyn has always had a crisp elocution that wobbles only to reveal characters’ vulnerability ― a trait seen in both “The House of Tomorrow” and “The Tale.”

For an hour, Burstyn and I had a conversation so articulate and wide-ranging we must have solved at least some of the world’s problems. We discussed the state of American politics, her Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, the injury she sustained on “The Exorcist,” the evolution of Hollywood and, yes, the mysteries of the universe.

“The Tale,” which I saw at Sundance, is going to be a big conversation starter about sexual abuse. It’s a weird movie to love because it’s so difficult to process, but it’s really remarkable, especially because it’s autobiographical.

I think so, too. I think the way [director Jennifer Fox] mixed the two — documentary and narrative — is so unusual and innovative. It’s a lot of things. It’s an exploration of memory and it’s an expose of the seduction of children and young people. I think we always have an idea of an abuser as being ugly. I mean, when I met [Fox], she was still referring to [the predator seen in the movie] as her first boyfriend. So it was the whole process of investigating it and reawakening the memory when she started to think about it. I immediately liked her. Have you seen her?

Oh yes, I saw her speak at the Sundance premiere.

You know, I got in such trouble for that remark.

For speaking out against Trump during the Q&A afterward? What kind of trouble?

Oh, just Twitter outrage.

Oh, of course. Do you pay attention to all of that?

I’ve never experienced anything like that before. My remark just came out because I was so unsettled by the film. It’s a little elusive.

How does social media fodder get filtered to you? How do you find out people are saying certain things about you in certain contexts?

People tell me.

People being —

My family. My son. I try not to get into that too much. I just say, “OK.”

Not that you’re someone who’s stoked a lot of outrage throughout your career, but do you have a more zen approach to that now than you did in the past?

Probably. Probably I would have been more upset when people say bad things about me, but I have learned over the years how to separate it — not taking it personally, necessarily, not letting the knife go in, just saying, “That’s them. OK.” I probably shouldn’t have said anything.

From where I was sitting, it seemed invigorating. The audience certainly responded to it.

Well, the thing is, I always forget that what I say in a room is going to leave the room. If I had been on TV, I probably wouldn’t have said it. But I was with like-minded people, so I didn’t censor myself. But no, I should know that lesson by now. It always gets out somehow. Whatever.

Was there a time in your career when you didn’t handle criticism as well?

Oh yeah, when I first started out, I started with a lead on Broadway [in “Fair Game”]. In my first interview for a newspaper, I had lunch and I talked. And then when I read it, I went, “Oh my god.” I had to learn that what you say actually gets into print. It’s easy to forget.

Before that Broadway debut, you’d been a nightclub dancer and a model. Did you feel welcomed among the serious theater crowd?

Well, I auditioned and I got the part. It was the part of a model, so there was some reasonable decision-making. And Moss Hart was there. He was the one that told me I got the part, so if it’s OK with Moss Hart, it should be OK with everyone else. And then when I did the play, there were people in the play — one guy in particular — who were very resentful of me doing a lead on Broadway when I hadn’t studied or anything. There was resentment, but that was my journey and that was how it started. What are you going to do?

You’ve talked about deciding you weren’t ready to be a lead actress while making “Goodbye Charlie” in 1964. But fast-forward a decade and you were one of, if not the, primo actresses of the ’70s.

Well, I had that moment when I auditioned for “Fair Game.” I said, “OK, I’ve decided to be an actress. I’m going to do a Broadway play this fall. Does anybody know how I get an audition?” It was that moment. The thing with “Goodbye Charlie,” I was on the set and I had that thought, OK, next step is I play Debbie Reynolds’ part. And then this voice in my head that speaks to me every once in a while said [in a low, guttural tone], “I don’t want it.” I was shocked. I mean, when that voice speaks, I don’t budge.

What does that voice sound like?

It doesn’t sound like my voice, or a male or a female voice. It’s just a voice, and it’s always flat. Just, boom. When it speaks, I don’t have any doubt that that’s the truth. Sometimes I think of it as an inner teacher, but I don’t know if that’s really what it is. I don’t know what it is. So that was the moment when I left Hollywood and went back to New York and studied with Lee Strasberg. That’s what it meant to me: I didn’t want that career when I saw I was on that track. I wanted to learn how to really act.

Studying was the reaction to the voice?

Investigating the art form, as opposed to doing what comes naturally and getting by on whatever comes without really knowing.

Or chasing the fame, knowing that a lead role in a Hollywood production often equates some level of fame. You never set that as a goal. The fame followed the craft.

That’s a good way to say it.

The New York Times did once say you were the most honored and respected actress of the 1970s. Did you feel that at the time?

No. Somebody asked me once, “Well, what was it like to be working in the golden age of Hollywood?” I said, “Nobody told me it was the golden age.” I was on the jury of the Cannes Film Festival, and I was reading about the festival in a newspaper, and they were writing about the jurors. They said, “Ellen Burstyn, considered the most intelligent actress in Hollywood.” I said, “I am?! I didn’t know that! Why doesn’t somebody tell me these things?” I don’t know, it’s weird.

And who is on the committee that lines up every actress and ranks her according to intelligence?

Right, exactly. Who considers? And how did you hear about that?

What did you do with your first big paycheck?

What comes to mind is my piano. That was in Detroit. I was very happy to be able to buy a piano. I took it with me. When I went to New York, it came with me. When I went to California, it came with me. I finally sold it. I think my son was 2, and I’d finally let go of this piano.

At 85, do you find yourself yearning for anything?

You know, I yearn for things. I’d like to understand the cosmos better. I spend a lot of time thinking about, “What is dark energy? What could be it be? What could it mean that we know it’s there but we don’t know what it is? And if we don’t know what it is, then maybe it’s an alternate universe.” So I spend a lot of time out there. I’m yearning to know, I’m yearning to understand.

And religion is important to you.

Spirituality.

How has that evolved over the years? How would you have answered the question “What does spirituality mean to you” in 1970 compared to how you answer it today?

Well, I was brought up Catholic, and I rejected that around 17. For a few years, I just read about science. I wasn’t religious at all, but I felt this yearning. It felt like something was missing. So then I started reading various kinds of spiritual books, and then I came upon — have you ever heard of Gurdjieff? Gurdjieff was a teacher who came from the Caucasus between the two wars in Europe. He had a school, and people went there and did work on themselves. And I read his books and books by other people who studied with him, and I got interested in that work because it was really work on getting conscious.

And then I found out that he was a Sufi, and then I got interested in Sufism. And then I found a Sufi teacher — an Englishman — and I went to Europe and studied with him for a while, and then I met somebody he was associated with, and he became my teacher. Now, Sufis traditionally are Islamic, but my teacher wasn’t. He welcomed all, so there were Jewish Sufis and Catholic Sufis, and it was spiritual work without being identified with a religion. I notice that on the internet they say I’m Islamic. I’m not. I’ve never been, nor do I want to be, associated with any one religion. I’m interested in all of the various approaches to the divine, to the sacred ground, whatever that is.

I want to understand the whole thing. I want to understand what it’s all about.

And where has that led you today?

Right now I’m reading an ecotheologian. His name is Thomas Berry. I was introduced to him by a woman who’s a professor at Yale University. He’s into the sacred connectedness to nature, or in nature, as opposed to separate from nature. Because we’re separate from it, that’s why the earth is suffering so much. That’s why we can abuse it so badly. I’m just into exploring all these realms, being open to them and not saying, “This is what I believe and everything else is wrong.”

Maybe you don’t think about it this concretely, but how much do you think that spiritual quest has informed you a storyteller, as an actress inhabiting others’ lives, in terms of both the roles you’ve chosen over the years and how you piece those roles together?

Well, I’ve never thought about it, but thank you for asking that question. I think it would have to. You know, empathy is such a large part of an actor’s work — feeling into the character and into other human beings. Empathy seems to me to be one of the virtues that we’re blessed with. I think it’s a large part of my work. Now, how that connects with the spiritual explorations, I’m not sure — except that I do feel compassion for my characters, whatever their story is. I try to offer that up. I do think whatever makes us deeper as human beings makes us richer as artists.

Thinking back to the Twitter outrage from the Sundance premiere, how are you working through the current political turmoil and what led us to a Trump presidency, in light of having educated yourself about larger forces influencing the world?

You know, my first Sufi teacher used to say, “Everything manifests in reverse.” So we achieved the first black president, and this is the reaction. It’s a pendulum swing. I trust that we will survive it and will get back to some center. It’s very painful.

When “Requiem for a Dream” opened in 2000, you talked about a conversation with a doctor friend of yours, saying you both felt like the state of medicine and other professions —

The standards were lower?

Yes. And then in August 2016, you said, “I don’t believe Trump’s going to win. I don’t believe the universe will allow it.” We all said that around August 2016. But those two ideas seem to work hand in hand: the degradation of professional standards and Trump’s ability to become president. Do you think there’s a connection there?

Probably. When I think about my childhood, we didn’t lock the doors when I was in Detroit. So in the years that I’ve spent on the planet, there’s been a huge change. Social media has made it possible for the alt-right to speak to other alt-right people on the other side of the country that they didn’t know were there. They’re more organized, there are more of them. There are a lot of things that, as we developed technology, have advanced us in many ways, but at the same time the reverse goes along with it. So how we handle it and get out of it and grow with it, I don’t know. It’s very scary and we’re in the midst of it.

When there was the Industrial Revolution, that was such a huge change in the culture. We’re in that kind of revolution — social revolution — and we don’t know how it’s going to come out.

Do you know — oh, what’s that word? The moment where technology advances to the point where it takes over. I lose this word a lot. The singularity! And when we get there — we’ve never been there in the history of the planet — we have no idea what’s going to happen. Somebody has suggested that possibly we will become pets to the technology, however it’s manifesting. We’ll be the dogs of the robots. We have no idea what we’re in for.

Did you consider yourself politically active in the ’70s?

Well, don’t forget there was the Vietnam War. I was very active during that. I was in the streets in Los Angeles. At the first Women Strike for Peace march, I was pushing my kid in a baby carriage. And I was with a group called STOP, Speakers and Talent Organize for Peace. We went out speaking to Rotary Clubs against the war. I was at the Democratic Convention in 1968. I was at a fundraiser for Eugene McCarthy when Martin Luther King was assassinated. We were supporting Martin Luther King, and we expected when Bobby Kennedy got California that he would get the nomination and we would then change our votes to Kennedy, and then he got assassinated. So I’ve always been political, and I’ve always been a Democrat.

How much do you think being around Hollywood at the time further galvanized your activism? Obviously Jane Fonda is a figurehead for celebrity politics in the ’70s, but the decade’s upheaval really defined Hollywood, on-screen and off.

I don’t know, it’s hard to say. I think, if I were still living in Detroit, I would have been against that war. We were in an unjust war, just like we are now in the Mideast. I think I just happened to live in Los Angeles at the time, but I think wherever I was that’s what I would have been doing: fighting.

Let’s talk about a few movies. Did you pay attention to the news about Uma Thurman’s injury on the set of “KiIl Bill”? Her lack of protection sounds similar to what happened to you on the set of “The Exorcist,” where you permanently injured your spine after being pulled to the ground for a stunt. You had asked your director, William Friedkin, to have the stuntman pull you more gently, but he didn’t listen.

Well, I wasn’t talked into doing it. I was telling him, “No, he’s pulling me too hard.” I was aware that I was in danger, and I said it. [Friedkin] went behind my back. So I didn’t agree to it. I think finally Uma did — I don’t know that for a fact, but from what I understand, she got talked into it. One does have to finally be able to say no, which I did. I mean, people have died making movies, especially stunt people. So one has to really learn how to protect oneself. I wouldn’t ever be in that position again.

Did you ever have any experiences like that again, where you were taken advantage of on a set?

No.

Do you think it’s because that experience firmed you up?

Maybe. Possibly. People don’t mess with me too much.

That’s good. You’ve talked many times over the years about having a hand in selecting a young Martin Scorsese to direct “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” If that movie were being made today, there might be some sort of conversation about whether a woman should make it. I assume there were no women for you to lobby for at the time?

No. Absolutely not. Although I have to say, an executive did ask me to direct it, and I said I didn’t want to act and direct at the same time. That’s what I’m doing now [with the comedy “Bathing Flo”]. And I was right. It wouldn’t have been as good a movie.

There’s a scene in “House of Tomorrow” where your character watches footage of your younger self and processes her former life. It made me think about what it’s like for you to be interviewed. Is it cathartic to be asked to recall the details of your younger self? Is it redundant? Intrusive?

Well, I shot that footage and had it to offer to the director, which he didn’t know when he asked me to do the film. He didn’t know that I knew [architect and theorist Buckminster Fuller, who appears in the footage] and that I had shot the film with him. It was pretty serendipitous. When people ask me, “Well, why did you shoot that film?” I don’t know. I just did. I have no explanation for it. I shot that 40 years ago. Forty? Thirty anyway. Between 30 and 40. And of course I don’t know if everybody knows it’s real when they see it.

It was wonderful to be able to offer it to the director when he offered me the part not knowing I was friends with Bucky. He was an amazing man. I was really grateful to know him. He was a great mind. Have you ever read any of his books?

I haven’t.

He’s a very strange writer. He makes up languages. He combines words into new words. I’ll show you. [Burstyn rises from the seat and retrieves a well-worn hardback book from a bookshelf.]

I have a lot of his books, most of them. Well, no. He wrote 30 books, and I don’t have 30. This one is actually autographed to me by him. [She opens to a passage called “Intuition: Metaphysical Mosaic,” written in verse, and hands me the book.] Read this.

[I proceed to read the two-page passage, which concludes with the line “This is why consciousness identified the basic increment of time as being a second.”]

That’s the way he writes. And by the way, that’s his definition of God: the a priori mystery, the mystery that exists before anything. He defines “universe” as a series of partially overlapping, simultaneous events. That’s the way his thinking is multidimensional. With his writing, I’m like, “What, Bucky?! What are you saying?”

How did you meet him?

I was interested in Margaret Fuller, who was an associate of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. I thought she was a great 19th-century woman writer and editor of their newspaper, The Dial. I was thinking about her and reading about her — I had many books — and I was also reading about him. He gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall while I was shooting “The Exorcist.” I went to the lecture, and while I was sitting there, I went, “Margaret Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, Boston.” I made the connection, and I wrote to him and told him I was interested in talking to him about his aunt. His secretary called back and said, “You can have two hours in the Boston airport at this date, or you can have five hours in the Chicago airport on this date.” So I picked the Chicago airport and flew there, and we had five hours together. Then we became friends. He was an amazing man.

You mentioned earlier not knowing the ’70s were a golden age. Today when we talk about the ’70s, we talk about the decade’s movies in very political terms. They were responses to the Vietnam War and social change and second-wave feminism and so forth. In thinking about “The House of Tomorrow” and “The Tale,” as well as the other movies you’ve made in recent years, do you think today’s movies, or more specifically today’s studios —

[Burstyn shakes her head.]

OK, maybe not the studios. Let’s say today’s filmmakers. Do you think the type of filmmakers you’re involved with — the type whose movies premiere at festivals, for example — are making movies that respond to today’s political and social mores the way we say movies in the ’70s did?

Well, “Mudbound” did. “Get Out” did. “Shape of Water” kind of does. “Florida Project” did. “Three Billboards,” kind of. “The Post.” So I think the answer’s yes.

We both shook our heads when I mentioned studios. But most of the movies you named are not getting the type of attention that “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” got when Warner Brothers released it in ’74.

No. No. No, the studios are doing “Spider-Man 12.” That’s the brand. The filmmakers are in the independent film world. It’s a different business.

You had an Oscar nomination in 1981 and then a gap until your next, for “Requiem” in 2001. By that point, Oscar campaigning had ballooned into an entire industry. Did you notice that shift?

Well, I know, for instance, with “Requiem,” that we didn’t have money for a campaign, and that made a huge difference. I still have people go by me on the street and go, “You were robbed.” I’ve had that experience more than once. And it wasn’t originally a problem not to have money for a campaign.

It hurt the movie’s chances in a way that it might not have 20 years earlier.

Right. I think. Not to take anything away from Julia Roberts, who was wonderful in “Erin Brockovich.” But they had a wonderful campaign, and we didn’t. It’s not reasonable to think you can get by without a campaign, not anymore.

I recently watched the pilot of “The Ellen Burstyn Show,” which only lasted 13 episodes. What happened with that show?

You know, I was put together with a partner who was the head writer, and we never saw eye-to-eye. We were making two different shows, or trying to. And it just didn’t work. It was a bad marriage is what it was. It just couldn’t work with him.

It’s such a good cast: you, Elaine Stritch, Megan Mullally. Writer drama aside, just on name recognition alone, how could that show have flown by?

I gave Megan her first job on that show, and Elaine playing my mother was a hoot. She’s only seven years older. But it never occurred to either one of us until much later. It just wasn’t right. I’ve never looked at those shows again.

Would you want to?

Maybe not. It hurt.

Well, even if not for that show, you’re forever enshrined in television history. The Emmys changed its eligibility rules after you were nominated for a 14-second cameo.

Yeah, that’s kind of funny. And I think it’s called the Ellen Burstyn Rule. It’s a funny claim to fame.

I was nominated for something, and I happened to tune into a show where they were predicting who would win. I think it was my last Oscar nomination, I’m not sure. And then they said who should win, and they said I should win and I would win, and the other person ― “Oh, well, that would be very controversial.” And the first person said, “Why?” And he said, “Because she wins everything.” But it’s not true!

Yeah, have you ever in your life thought, “Well, I just win everything?”

No! And I didn’t win! What was that for? Oh, I know. It was for my “House of Cards” nomination [in 2016].

OK, I’m exhausted.Cardi B performs on the Coachella stage. Scott Dudelson via Getty Images

Fresh off the debut of her new record, “Invasion of Privacy,” Cardi B addressed reactions to her revelation on “Saturday Night Live” that she is pregnant. These things were intertwined, the album and the baby, if not in reality then in the hyperreality Cardi B inhabits. Both were treated by certain corners of the public as bits of creative output to be consumed and judged, and last week on the ”Ebro in the Morning” radio show on New York’s Hot 97, Cardi B seemed annoyed with this arrangement.

It’s just like, you know what? I’m a grown woman. I’m 25 years old. I’m going to say this in the most humblest way: I’m a millionaire. And I’m prepared for this.

She went on a little later:

I see a lot of women online like, ’Oh, I feel sorry for you, oh your career is over.′ And it’s like, why can’t I have both? As a woman, why can’t I have both? Why do I gotta choose a career or a baby? Like, why can’t I have both? I want both.

Cardi’s frustration is understandable, but so, too, is the public preoccupation with her rise to fame. For the first time there was tension in what had been an unprecedentedly sunny relationship between Cardi and her fans, and it told us something about stardom based the sort of authenticity Cardi embodies. People cherish authenticity in a celebrity, it seems, until the celebrity is too authentically a person of her own.

The affection for Cardi isn’t hard to understand. Everybody loves an underdog story. In fact, there’s a science behind our need to root for the underdog, the unlikely hero, the rags-to-riches story. Psychological studies exploring this phenomenon, specifically in sports, have found that people are more likely to root for teams they perceive to be putting in “more effort with less ability,” because it creates a compelling narrative.

A post shared by Black Ink Crew Chicago FanPage (@blackinkcrewchicago) on Apr 9, 2018 at 10:38pm PDT

Cardi B is the ultimate underdog. She is, by her own description, just a “regular degular girl from the Bronx,” a former stripper who leveraged her charisma and humor and authenticity on social media into a rap career.

Throughout a three-year trajectory, from Instagram star to reality TV star to hip-hop princess, Cardi surmounted obstacles. She was dismissed as a rapper because she is a woman and a former sex worker. She was too unapologetically ratchet ever to win over the respectability crowd. She was too Dominican and too 161st Street ever to be taken seriously by the country at large. Classism, racism, misogyny — she seemed to fly directly into all the usual cultural headwinds and wound up a superstar anyway.

But having her own life constantly served up for the purposes of vicarious identification brought its own set of problems, as evidenced by the conversation about Cardi’s pregnancy. On blogs like The Shade Room and Industry on Blast, indeed in the comment sections of her own Instagram, people reacted with pity, confusion, even downright disdain toward Cardi’s pregnancy. The comments have come from haters and fans alike.

Cardi B really pregnant I’m disappointed 😢 that’s career suicide — ＪＡＳ👸🏻💅🏽🦄✨ (@IamPrettyJas) April 8, 2018

Cardi B dumb why the fuck would you get pregnant in the prime of your career 😑🤦🏽‍♂️.... — TheGod✈️ (@_D_Mason) April 8, 2018

The give and take of fame is always tricky, especially in the age of social media. Cardi gained popularity, after all, by sharing nearly every aspect of her life on the ’Gram, something she’s always been proud of. On the song “Best Life” from her new album, she raps, “Never been afraid to show y’all the real me/hair when it’s fucked up/crib when it’s filthy.”

Part of Cardi’s charm is how transparent she’s been about her past, about the fact that she is, essentially, winging this fame thing. This quality is also what makes “Invasion of Privacy” such a great record ― an album that hops from thot anthems like “Bickenhead” to confessional ballads like “Be Careful” in which Cardi admits that Offset, her (allegedly) cheating fiancé, has ”got me trippin’/got me lookin’ in the mirror different/Thinkin’ I’m flawed because you inconsistent...”

But she gives so much of herself that it has created a sense of ownership for her fans, not just over her work but over her personal choices. This has always been an aspect of the transaction of fame, but it has been intensified in the digital era, in which people mistake what they are shown or indeed what they share for actual intimacy.

Cardi’s life itself is seen now as a performance in which her fans have a stake. This is how we wound up with people evaluating Cardi’s pregnancy as if it were a new album — as if it were something about which aesthetic objections could be made.

The misogyny of criticizing Cardi’s decision to have a child should go without saying, as should the misogyny of the double standard whereby some people question how she will juggle a baby and a career, but never ask the same of her fiancé, Offset, who already has three children from previous relationships. There’s an irony in this. She has soared beyond the sexism of the champagne room and the recording studio, only to find some of her own fans throwing it back at her in the comments of her own Instagram.

Cardi’s crime was undermining other people’s illusions. She had conjured a fantasy for people — anyone can make it on one’s own terms; anyone can find fame and fortune without losing oneself. And now the very real obligations of a child had intruded on that illusion. An unplanned pregnancy? That was too messily commonplace for anyone’s vicarious daydreaming. Fans want Cardi to be authentic, sure, but not to herself. They want her to be authentic to their fantasy.
