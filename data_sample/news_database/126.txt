A veteran Washington, D.C., lawyer who reportedly turned down an offer to join Donald Trump’s legal team has criticized the “turmoil” and “chaos” in the White House. He also indicated that attorneys aren’t as eager to work for Trump as the president has claimed.

Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration, rejected an offer to join Trump’s legal team and represent the president in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference, CNN and The Washington Post reported last Tuesday.

Asked Sunday on MSNBC about ongoing Cabinet shakeups and “government by Twitter” in the Trump administration, Olson criticized the White House for turmoil “beyond normal.”

“I think everybody would agree this is turmoil, it’s chaos, it’s confusion, it’s not good for anything,” Olson told Andrea Mitchell. “We always believe that there should be an orderly process, and of course, government is not clean or orderly ever. But this seems to be beyond normal.”

Olson characterized his job offer to Mother Jones as a “trial balloon” shot down. Asked if any attorneys have reached out to him for a referral to the White House, Olson responded: “Not at all.”

That seems to contradict Trump’s declaration that “many lawyers and law firms want to represent me” for “fame and fortune.” He urged Twitter followers not to believe “fake news” saying otherwise. Trump said he ultimately decided not to bring in new lawyers because it would take them a long time to “get up to speed.” Besides, he said, he was “happy” with his team.

Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2018

....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2018

Prior to those tweets, the White House had asked Olson, as well as lawyers Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, to join Trump’s legal team.New details about Prince’s death have been revealed — and they’ll raise a brow.

The Associated Press obtained a confidential toxicology report on Monday that found that the music legend died of an “exceedingly high” amount of fentanyl, according to multiple experts who aren’t tied to an investigation into Prince’s death.

On April 21, 2016, Prince was found unresponsive in his Paisley Park home in Minnesota at the age of 57. A report released by the Midwest Medical Examiner’s Office in June 2016 found that the “Purple Rain” singer died of an overdose of fentanyl — a synthetic opiate that is hundreds of times more potent than heroin, per the Centers for Disease Control.

According to the report the AP obtained, fatalities due to fentanyl have been documented in people who have had blood levels as low as 3 micrograms by liter or as high as 58 micrograms per liter. Prince’s blood, the report found, had a stunning 67.8 micrograms per liter.

It also found that the fentanyl in Prince’s liver was 450 micrograms per kilogram, which far exceeds the amount that can “seem to represent overdose or fatal toxicity cases,” which is 69 micrograms per kilogram.

“The amount in [Prince’s] blood is exceedingly high, even for somebody who is a chronic pain patient on fentanyl patches,” Dr. Lewis Nelson, chairman of emergency medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, told the AP. He added that the fentanyl concentrations were “a pretty clear smoking gun.”Calling it “a relic of the 18th century,” retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens called Tuesday for the outright repeal of the Second Amendment, saying it would achieve “more effective and more lasting reform” than other efforts to curb the country’s scourge of gun violence.

In a New York Times op-ed, Stevens ― who as a high court justice dissented on a key gun rights case in 2008 ― praised the student demonstrators at Saturday’s March for Our Lives protests, saying that the thousands of marchers, led by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, “demand our respect.”

Beyond pushing for stronger legislative measures, such as banning assault-style weapons and mandating background checks, he advised the movement to “demand a repeal of the Second Amendment:”

That simple but dramatic action would move Saturday’s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform. It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world. It would make our schoolchildren safer than they have been since 2008 and honor the memories of the many, indeed far too many, victims of recent gun violence.

In 2008, the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller was widely considered a victory for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun rights advocates, helping to cement a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and limiting legal grounds for gun control measures.

The ruling barred Washington, D.C., which has among the country’s strictest gun laws, from enforcing a ban it had on handguns and other gun requirements because they violated the Second Amendment.

Stevens, among the four justices in the court’s liberal wing who dissented in the case, wrote Tuesday that he still believes the ruling was “wrong and certainly was debatable,” arguing that it “has provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power.”WASHINGTON ― A long-awaited Republican food stamp plan would partially shift spending from benefits to training programs, according to Democratic House staff who’ve seen a draft of the legislation.

The proposal to reauthorize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would subject more enrollees to “work requirements,” and would require states to set up training programs for 3 to 5 million people who might be unable to find suitable private sector work. Such programs currently serve 700,000 SNAP recipients.

“A new, massive nationwide bureaucracy is not good policy,” a Democratic summary says.

The author of the bill, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who’s been holding hearings on overhauling food stamps since 2015, said this week that nobody would be kicked off food stamps under his plan.

“Either they got a job that’s paying more money,” Conaway told the “Adams on Agriculture” podcast Wednesday, “or they decide for themselves that meeting these requirements to get the training or get a job is not worth working 20 hours a week on and they self-select and get off.”

Conaway has said in recent weeks that his SNAP overhaul wouldn’t reduce federal spending on the program. According to the Democratic summary, “the billions of dollars in cuts to food benefits would be used to create state bureaucracies.”

Democrats say the work requirements proposal could potentially deny benefits to 3 percent of enrollees in 2028, which could amount to nearly 1 million people that year.

With roughly 42 million beneficiaries, SNAP is one of the biggest safety net programs in the U.S. Monthly benefits average $125 per person and can be redeemed for almost any food item in a grocery store. Thanks to existing work requirements and an improving economy, enrollment has been declining since 2013. Budget experts expect it to continue to fall by another 10 million if current trends hold for the next decade.

Agriculture committees in the House and Senate traditionally reauthorize food stamps as part of a “farm bill” every five years. The bill also includes farm subsidies, but nutrition assistance makes up the bulk of the spending.

The draft of the Republican plan includes other proposals that Democrats dislike. One such proposal involves stricter eligibility standards, like requiring more SNAP applicants to document their income and expenses even if they already qualify for another means-tested federal program. Democratic staffers also say a proposal to crack down on noncustodial parents who fail to pay child support would cost more than it would save.

It’s not clear how Conaway’s legislation could become law without significant Democratic support, since Democrats control enough Senate seats to block any legislation outside of a special budget process that will probably be unavailable this year. And potential opposition from conservative Republicans could make it difficult for Conaway even to get the bill through the House.

When Conaway started holding hearings on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program three years ago, he said he had no “preconceived notions” about how he wanted to change the program. Conaway has apparently ignored a Trump administration proposal to replace some SNAP benefits with boxes of canned goods, Democrats said.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has tightly controlled House legislation during his speakership, has previously proposed increasing “work requirements” while holding funding constant for food stamps and other programs.

Agriculture Committee member Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) told HuffPost last week that testimony during Conaway’s 23 hearings on SNAP didn’t support the idea of increased work requirements.

“I think this title is being written in the speaker’s office,” McGovern said. “It certainly is not a product of the Agriculture Committee.”

This story has been updated to include Conaway’s remarks Wednesday.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly planning to testify before Congress about the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working with the social media company to determine a date and time for the executive to appear, a spokeswoman for the committee told HuffPost.

Zuckerberg has received a barrage of such requests by lawmakers in both the U.S. and the U.K. since it was revealed that personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users had been shared with the political research firm without users’ consent.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Friday requested Zuckerberg’s testimony in a letter that detailed its concerns about Facebook’s use and protection of user data.

“As the Chief Executive Officer of Facebook and the employee who has been the leader of Facebook through all the key strategic decisions since its launch, you are the right person to testify before Congress about those decisions and the Facebook business model,” the letter addressed to Zuckerberg read.

“The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy,” it continued. “The hearing will also explore broader questions about Facebook’s policies at the time Facebook Platform was launched, today, and in the future regarding both Facebook’s use of user information and the access to user information Facebook provides to others.”

In the U.K., a Facebook official on Monday turned down Parliament’s request for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said it will instead provide a senior deputy to testify and answer questions, an offer that was criticized by a Parliament member.

Similar requests have been made by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who on Monday invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Google and Twitter, to attend a hearing on data privacy and social media.

That hearing, scheduled for April 10, “will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use,” Grassley’s office said.

Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) last week sent a letter to Grassley asking that he hold a judiciary hearing with Zuckerberg and fellow social media CEOs.

Klobuchar appeared to celebrate news of Zuckerberg’s plans to testify on Twitter on Tuesday.

“Next up, Cambridge Analytica must testify,” she tweeted.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Zuckerberg’s testimony plans.A post shared by Yes, I'm Hot In This (@yesimhotinthis) on Mar 6, 2018 at 2:35pm PST

Huda Fahmy, an American Muslim artist, often gets questions from non-Muslims about her hijab, the headscarf she chooses to wear as part of her faith.

Fahmy lives in the suburbs of Houston, and one question she hears a lot ― especially in the summer ― is whether she’s hot in her hijab.

When she was younger, Fahmy said, she always felt like she needed to say “no.” She didn’t want people to feel sorry for her, or to think the hijab was somehow oppressive. She also didn’t want to “seem like a weirdo” for covering up in hot weather.

But as an adult, Fahmy said, she’s done trying to appease other people.

“What do I care if they think I’m hot? I’m proud of my hijab. I’d wear it no matter what,” Fahmy told HuffPost in an email. “But also, YES, I’M HOT. It’s 112 degrees out here, WE’RE ALL HOT.”

The 33-year-old is now the artist behind the popular Instagram account @YesImHotInThis, where she posts comics about life as an American Muslim woman. Fahmy’s comics, which are often inspired by her own experiences, poke fun at married life and cultural taboos. She also uses humor to address misconceptions people have about women who wear the hijab.

Huda Fahmy is a 33-year-old artist from Texas. Huda Fahmy

American Muslim women who wear the hijab often experience bigotry and hate. It’s important to tell their stories, Fahmy said.

“Muslim women don’t often get a platform to tell our stories or share the silly ― sometimes stressful ― idiosyncrasies of our day-to-day lives,” she said.

A post shared by Yes, I'm Hot In This (@yesimhotinthis) on Mar 1, 2018 at 11:04am PST

Fahmy has found web comics an “incredibly useful” way to share stories about Muslim life.

“They’re short, to the point, and usually get people to chuckle,” she said. “They make people laugh and think.”

The self-taught artist started posting her comics online in March 2017. A year later, she’s accumulated more than 145,000 followers on Instagram.

Fahmy has recently started reaching out to other Muslim women cartoonists on Instagram in an effort to elevate more women’s voices. With these collaborations, she’s hoping to highlight the themes of solidarity in sisterhood, fighting Islamophobia, and breaking misconceptions about women who wear the hijab.

“One thing I hope my comics do for my audience is to make them more aware of the marginalized folk around them,” she said. “Awareness gives way to understanding, which gives way to empathy, which gives way to compassion. And the world could definitely use a little more compassion.”

realDonaldTrump appears to be following @CNN. (This bot cannot tell if it was a new follow or the result of the account being reactivated.) — Trump Alert (@TrumpsAlert) March 26, 2018

The @TrumpsAlert Twitter bot, which tracks who the Trump family follows and unfollows on the social network, tweeted the news at 7:10 a.m. Just 50 minutes later, however, the feed reported that the president was no longer following CNN:

realDonaldTrump appears to no longer follow @CNN. (This bot cannot tell if this was an unfollow, suspension or block.) — Trump Alert (@TrumpsAlert) March 26, 2018

It’s unclear if Trump unfollowed the account himself by accident or intentionally, or if CNN blocked the president from reading its tweets. Needless to say, Trump’s brief dalliance with the media outlet he appears to detest did not go unnoticed:

When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”Florence and Paris are beautiful and all, but it’s not like we’re the only ones who think so. If you’re dreaming about a romantic European getaway that doesn’t involve a gazillion tourists, then consider these beautiful isles. (Just don’t tell us anyone else, OK?)

PONZA, ITALY

Vacation like the Romans do and check out this beautiful, volcanic isle in the Tyrrhenian Sea (accessible by a one-hour hydrofoil journey from the mainland). Don’t let the mega yachts gliding into the harbor fool you — the vibe here is relaxed and unpretentious. But the turquoise waters, hidden grottos, and fabulous local seafood and wine will definitely make you feel like a million bucks.

BELLE-ÎLE-EN-MER, FRANCE

The island’s name (“Beautiful Island in the Sea”) definitely doesn’t disappoint. Located just off the coast of Brittany in northwest France, this destination is known for its unspoilt beaches, pastel-painted houses and mouthwatering seafood. And while there’s plenty to do (surfing, sailing and sightseeing, to name a few), give yourself time to just relax and soak up the picturesque views — so beautiful that they inspired many of Monet’s greatest works.

GRINDA, SWEDEN

No trip to the Scandinavian capital is complete without a boat trip around Stockholm’s archipelago. And while there are thousands of islands to see, peaceful Grinda is one of the easiest to reach (it’s about an hour and a half from the city) and offers a variety of accommodation options (hotels, cabins, a hostel and a campground). There are no cars allowed on the island, but plenty of sandy beaches, walking paths and rustic charm.

HYDRA, GREECE

Cars and scooters are banned on this laid-back island that’s located about two hours from Athens, which means that you’ll have to rely on donkeys to carry your luggage up to your hotel. Poet-musician Leonard Cohen fell in love with the pebble beaches, winding cobblestone streets, whitewashed houses and quaint cafés and bars, which might explain how this relaxed isle got its boho reputation.

TEXEL, NETHERLANDS

Pronounced “Tesse,” this northern island boasts multiple cycle routes that will take you by quaint villages, colorful tulip fields, a national park and an iconic lighthouse. Get your culture fix at one of the many museums (there’s a strong nautical history here) and then reward yourself after with a tour around Texel’s only craft brewery.

STROMBOLI, ITALY

Just north of Sicily lies this fiery spot — best for intrepid travelers only (the sputtering volcano that towers above the island is still active). Spend the day relaxing on black sand beaches and swimming in shimmering waters, then enjoy nature’s fireworks show in the evenings (from a safe distance, of course).

COLONSAY, SCOTLAND

If peace and quiet is what you’re after (with a side of adventure) then this remote northern isle is just the ticket. Small enough to be completely accessible by foot or bicycle, get back in tune with nature by exploring the rolling hills, grazing goats, basking seals and beautiful flora. Ah, so relaxing.

THE AZORES, PORTUGAL

It’s hard to pick a favorite out of this string of volcanic islands in the Atlantic, but we’re partial to São Miguel. Its remote location means that you’ll see relatively few tourists here and have all the geothermal pools, stargazing and rugged inlets largely to yourself. Don’t miss whale watching and dolphin watching, too.Who could bite this face? Brooks Kraft via Getty Images

The most important question in the world right now is also its most simple: Which Hollywood actress bit Beyoncé’s face?

In an interview with GQ that ran Monday, Tiffany Haddish tells of an as-yet-unnamed actress walking up to Beyoncé’s at a party Haddish once attended and just kind of, well, biting her in the face.

“Can you believe this bitch just bit Beyoncé?” Haddish remembers one of Beyoncé’s friends telling her.

“Near the end of the party,” Haddish continues, “Beyoncé’s at the bar, so I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.’”

(When GQ reached out for comment to Beyoncé rep Yvette Noel-Schure, she said, “I absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge.”)

So now the obvious question is: Who? Vulture, working off an Instagram photo of Haddish and Beyoncé, speculated that The Bite occurred at an after-party in Los Angeles following a Jay-Z concert last December. The site whittled down the list of potential biters to the celebrities who were said to have been there that night.

We approached the mystery from the other direction: Which celebrities did not bite Beyoncé? Perhaps, by a process of elimination, we will arrive at an answer.

We reached out to around 40 actresses, actors and musicians to find out what went down. Some were at the after-party in question. Some were just names we came up with. Nearly all, to this point, have remained silent. We will update this post as we learn more (and we’ll include celebrities who issued their denials in other forums). But until then, here’s what we’ve got.

Jennifer Aniston

“What? I have no idea what this means,” said a spokesperson. After some explanation, the spokesperson replied, “Why in the world would you think Jennifer Aniston would do such a thing? It’s absurd.”

Julie Andrews

“Have no idea what you are talking about,” a spokesperson wrote over email.

Kathy Bates

“I have no clue,” a spokesperson said.

Shirley MacLaine

“No, Shirley did not bite anything. She’s 83 years old, for God’s sake,” a spokesperson said over the phone.

Amy Adams

“Hahaha, NO. So funny that you would ask if Amy Adams did this?” said a spokesperson for Adams.

Jodie Foster

“The article says Sara Foster — NOT Jodie Foster,” a spokesperson said when we sent her The Cut article, which referenced Sara Foster being at the Jay-Z concert.

Charlotte McKinney

“Charlotte McKinney was NOT involved in the incident whatsoever, as she didn’t even attend the after-party,” a rep for the actress and model said.

Queen Latifah

“No comment,” a spokesperson said.

Jennifer Lawrence

When we reached out to ask if Jennifer Lawrence could be ruled out, a representative replied, “Yes remove her please.”

Frances McDormand

“Seriously?!”

Natalie Portman

Let’s just say we have been informed we can cross her off the list.

The 17-year-old from Langhorne, Pennsylvania, appeared on Monday’s show, gushing about the cute boys in the competition and unleashing her super-bubbly optimism. “She doesn’t care what anyone thinks and I admire her for that,” fellow contestant Zach D’Onofrio said.

Oh yeah, she gets “geek flashes.”

But she can sing, too. A segment that highlighted her unbridled enthusiasm finally got down to her performance. And she nailed it, singing a soulful acoustic version of The Beatles’ “Come Together.”

She expressed hope that she and new bud D’Onofrio could advance together during Hollywood Week to the next round.When it came time for Maryland lawmakers to redraw the state’s congressional map in 2011, then-Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) felt he had an obligation to come up with a redistricting plan that gave his fellow Democrats the best possible chance of winning as many seats as possible.

There wasn’t anything particularly controversial about O’Malley’s position back then. Courts have never said it’s illegal to draw electoral boundaries to benefit a political party, and a Republican governor would likely have done the same for his side.

O’Malley and a redistricting advisory commission drew up a plan, and the state legislature passed it. The new map gave Democrats one additional expected seat ― the 6th Congressional District. The change increased Democrats’ advantage over Republicans in the U.S. House delegation from 6-2 to 7-1.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge from Republican voters in the 6th District who say state officials violated the U.S. Constitution in redefining the district’s borders. The plaintiffs argue that by drawing the boundaries based in part on political data, Democrats essentially punished voters for their past support of GOP candidates, violating their First Amendment rights.

This case, Benisek v. Lamone, and another from Wisconsin are being watched across the country because they give the Supreme Court the chance to set limits, for the first time, on when partisan gerrymandering goes too far. Such a standard has the potential to reshape American politics by forcing states to draw districts that are more competitive.

In October, the Supreme Court heard argument in Gill v. Whitford, which was brought by Democrats challenging Wisconsin’s GOP-drawn state legislative map. They contend it violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause and the guarantee of freedom of association.

The Maryland case is different from the Wisconsin one in a few key ways. While the Wisconsin lawsuit challenges an entire map, the Maryland suit seeks to redraw just one district (though obviously that would affect other districts). The Maryland case is being brought by Republicans, who were the main beneficiaries of congressional gerrymandering after the 2010 Census. And the Maryland plaintiffs are advancing the novel legal idea that partisan gerrymandering amounts to an unconstitutional retaliation based on voters’ past choices.

A district is unconstitutional, they contend, when officials take voters’ past support for candidates into account and draw a map in such a way that dilutes their votes with no justification other than partisan gain. Richard Pildes, an election law expert and professor at New York University, wrote in a blog post that the plaintiffs were suggesting a way to evaluate partisan gerrymandering claims that is similar to the way the Supreme Court already looks at claims of race-based gerrymandering ― an area of law the court is active in.

Maryland’s lawyers responded in their brief to the Supreme Court that the plaintiffs were offering an unworkable standard that would make any district that gave either party an edge susceptible to a lawsuit from a voter in the losing party. They said the standard fails to clarify to what degree lawmakers can take politics into account when drawing electoral boundaries. They said that the 6th District ― which stretches from Montgomery County, just outside of Washington, in the east to more rural parts of the state in the west ― joins together communities of interest along I-270. And they noted that elections there remain competitive even if a Democrat has represented the area since the new map was put in place.

Both sides are targeting their arguments at Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is seen as the key swing vote in the case. In a 5-4 ruling in 2004, the Supreme Court declined to strike down Pennsylvania’s congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Four of the justices said there was no way for courts to evaluate that claim, but Kennedy, writing separately, said that such a standard may exist.

The Maryland case could offer the court a more palatable way to set a legal standard for partisan gerrymandering. During oral arguments in the Wisconsin dispute, Chief Justice John Roberts dismissed a statistical method those plaintiffs offered for evaluating the unfairness of a gerrymander as ”gobbledygook.”

Roberts also worried aloud that assessing partisan gerrymandering would diminish the credibility of the courts because people would see them as biased every time they ruled in favor of Democrats or Republicans. By taking the Republican challenge from Maryland and the Democratic one from Wisconsin, the justices could be trying to defend themselves against such accusations.

Still, the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the Maryland case when the Wisconsin one was already teed up was somewhat of a surprise. Michael Li, redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said partisan gerrymandering must be weighing on the justices’ minds.California quickly filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Commerce Department announced that the 2020 census would ask people whether they were U.S. citizens.

The citizenship question, announced Monday night, will discourage people from responding to the census and will violate the Constitution’s mandate for “actual enumeration,” the state’s lawsuit argues, according to The Washington Post.

“The Census numbers provide the backbone for planning how our communities can grow and thrive in the coming decade,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “What the Trump administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is an unconstitutional attempt to discourage an accurate Census count.”

The census hasn’t included a question about citizenship since 1950. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the question would allow better enforcement of voting laws.

Adding a citizenship question is likely to make people more wary of filling out the survey, causing undercounts ― especially in communities with large immigrant populations, HuffPost and The Washington Post have previously reported. An undercount could cost states like California seats in Congress, federal funding based on population and electoral college votes in presidential elections.

“It is long settled that all persons residing in the United States — citizens and non-citizens alike — must be counted to fulfill the Constitution’s ‘actual Enumeration’ mandate,” California’s lawsuit states.

Eric Holder, a former U.S. attorney general who now heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Tuesday his group also will sue Trump’s administration.A U.K. newspaper tried to turn a trans couple’s wedding day into a horrible joke with a front-page photograph of the pair and a really offensive headline.

The Sun, one of Britain’s largest papers, headlines its Tuesday article about the nuptials of Army officer Hannah Winterbourne and actor Jake Graf, “Tran and wife.” The cover of the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid also features pictures of the couple before they transitioned.

Graf called the display “sensationalised and misleading,” while Winterbourne defended their identities, saying she has “always been a woman and Jake has always been a man.” Other people on Twitter denounced the newspaper.

The couple took no issue with the paper’s article about them, which Graf called “lovely” and “positive.”

Graf told HuffPost UK that he and Hannah “only had the intention of putting out a hopeful, happy and honest story about a couple who happen to be transgender finding love.

“Hopefully that will still be the case and their [The Sun’s] readers will be able to take something good away from it,” he said.

Many people defended the couple on social media:

The Sun “put this story on a front page in order to celebrate a wonderful modern romance,” a spokesperson for the paper said in a statement to HuffPost UK.

“I want to emphasize that there was no intention to offend, and we wish them both the very best for the rest of their happy lives together,” the spokesperson said. “We are confident that our readers, especially after reading the piece, will join us in wishing them the same.”

Or at least that’s what Arnold ― who worked as an audience warm-up guy, writer, producer and actor on the original sit-com ― wrote Monday in his review of the “Roseanne” reboot.

“I’ll full-on admit to Laurie Metcalf superfandom, personally and professionally,” he wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.

“One night while partying during pilot week in 1988, Roseanne, who was in the front seat with [John] Goodman, noticed me holding Laurie’s hand in back. The next morning she called me into her office and told me, ‘Writers cannot date actors. That’s a rule of show business.’ Who was I to break a rule of show business?’”

Arnold then pointed to the odd nature of this confrontation in the next line.

“Never mind that Roseanne and I got married two years later (and lasted four),” he wrote.

Arnold and Barr have had a rocky relationship since their divorce in 1994. In fact, 20 years later, the two comedians got into a heated fight on Twitter after Barr assumed that Arnold had donated an old tape of their wedding to Goodwill.

Yet despite that fiery past, Arnold gave the “Roseanne” reboot a positive review — mostly, however, because of Metcalf’s performance.A well-funded Pennsylvania Democrat with deep establishment support withdrew from the state district’s Democratic primary Tuesday, after reports that she was going to face a challenge to her eligibility to appear on the ballot.

Christina Hartman was running in Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District. Her decision to leave the race follows news that her rival Democrat George Scott planned to join a complaint questioning whether she received the required number of signatures under state law to appear on the ballot. The deadline for ballot challenges is Tuesday.

A separate forthcoming challenge was also going to call into question the ballot signatures, as well as the veracity of an affidavit saying Hartman lived in the district, according to a Pennsylvania Democrat familiar with the challenge.

“There appears to have been a larger and much more broad challenge coming from other candidates in the race that may have indicated the beginning of the end for Christina’s campaign,” the Democrat said.

Hartman’s departure opens up the field in a newly competitive district that includes the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg.

Hartman had raised over $350,000 for a run in the neighboring 11th Congressional District, which includes Lancaster. But after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ordered the redrawing of the state’s congressional districts, the 11th district became much more Republican and the 10th became more favorable to Democrats.

Seeking to remain in a district where she would be competitive, Hartman announced in late February that she would be moving to the new 10th district and running there.

“When the new districts were announced, I had to make a quick and difficult decision to continue my campaign in a new district,” Hartman said in a statement. “After further consideration, I’ve decided that this is not the right time for me, and I will support the Democratic nominee in November.”

Four Democrats remain in the race for Pennsylvania’s 10th: Scott, a former U.S. Army officer; Eric Ding, a public health scientist; Alan Howe, a retired career Air Force officer; and Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson, a former Obama administration official.

The winner of the May 15 primary will take on three-term incumbent Rep. Scott Perry (R).

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s February decision to draw new congressional district boundaries, after concluding that the previous lines were unconstitutionally gerrymandered, has roiled the Keystone State’s politics.

For the most part, the changes have benefited Democrats, making the party more competitive in several districts, including the 4th Congressional District, which was redrawn to become the current 10th district.

President Donald Trump won Rep. Perry’s 4th district by 21 percentage points, but he would have won the new 10th district by just 9 points.

Pennsylvania’s 11th Congressional District, by contrast, went from a district that Trump won by 7 percentage points to one where he would have won by 26 points.

Prior to moving to the new 10th district, Hartman’s bid had already attracted national scrutiny as an example of what some activists considered questionable Democratic establishment intervention in primaries.

Despite underperforming Hillary Clinton’s margin in the district in 2016, Hartman had lined up the support of national and state-level Democratic leaders, as well as fundraising powerhouses like EMILY’s List and End Citizens United PAC. Some progressive activists lamented that the party was trying to stifle the bid of Jess King, a well-funded Lancaster-based nonprofit leader who was battling Hartman from the left.

But if Hartman came to the 10th district seeking greener pastures, she encountered stiff resistance from the get-go. Corbin-Johnson’s campaign blasted Hartman in early March for a phone call in which Hartman allegedly offered Corbin-Johnson a job if she withdrew from the race. Although Hartman denied that characterization of the call, Corbin-Johnson’s team maintained that the call was the “disrespectful” gesture of a well-heeled carpetbagger.

Corbin-Johnson’s status as an African-American heightened the symbolism of the flap. Collective PAC, which backs black Democratic candidates, argued that the affair reflected the national party’s unwillingness to empower black candidates like Corbin-Johnson.

Even before Hartman formally withdrew, EMILY’s List told HuffPost Tuesday that it had re-opened its endorsement process in light of the new district boundaries. The pro-abortion rights group left open the possibility that it would endorse Corbin-Johnson.

“Given the change in Pennsylvania’s district lines, we are taking a new look at every district with fresh eyes to determine our involvement,” an EMILY’s List spokesperson said.

For its part, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the House, hailed Hartman’s departure as win for the GOP.An aerial view of the Amazon Rainforest at the Bom Futuro National Forest in Port Velho, Brazil. Nacho Doce / Reuters

Felix Finkbeiner is a young man in a hurry to get the world to plant trees. The 19-year-old from a small Bavarian village near Munich, now studying at a university in London, has founded a global youth movement, Plant For The Planet, which has spearheaded the planting of over 15 billion saplings, signed up 75,000 children as climate ambassadors.

Alongside setting up Change Chocolate, a successful fair-trade chocolate company to raise money, the tall, spectacled teenager has joined with three of the world’s biggest conservation charities to launch the most ambitious reforestation project in history.

The Trillion Tree campaign aims to get the world to plant 1 trillion trees in the next 30 years. To put that into context, scientists calculate there are currently 3 trillion trees growing worldwide.

Each mature tree absorbs about 22 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, Finkbeiner says, “so one trillion could capture 25 percent of all human-made CO2 emissions and help to keep global temperature rise below the crucial 2-degree C limit. It does not replace the need to avoid carbon emissions, as agreed in Paris, but is a necessary addition.”

Finkbeiner thinks big. He has spoken at the United Nations and European Parliament, and reels off numbers like the politicians, who he says have mostly failed to act.

No one paid him much attention back in 2008, when, at age 9 and inspired by Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize winner and tree-planter Wangari Maathai, he announced at his primary school assembly that he intended to get children to plant 1 million trees in every country.

But his motto, “Stop talking, start planting,” went viral. Competition between schools, “pester power,” and slick social media saw the million-tree target reached within two years.

Since then, Plant for the Planet has grown into a well-funded NGO backed by the World Wildlife Fund, the German government and others, and has taken over a U.N. environmental campaign to get the world to plant 1 billion trees. An estimated 15.2 billion trees have been planted since 2006 by individuals, governments and businesses.

While adults talk about addressing climate change, Finkbeiner says, young people act. “Children could plant 1 million trees in every country on earth and offset CO2 emissions all on their own, while adults are still talking about doing it,” he says.

Some people doubt it is possible to plant so many trees in such a short time. In Mexico last month, talking at a world sustainable development conference, Finkbeiner was challenged by journalists about the practicalities of planting on such a scale, and was questioned whether it would mean giant plantations and a reduction in the amount of land available for growing human food.

Some researchers point to the social consequences of planting on such a vast scale, and say the massive, managed plantations of trees needed to hold temperatures below the 2-degree C limit from pre-industrial levels could trigger potentially irreversible changes in the planet.

Lena Boysen, now a researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, is lead author of a study investigating the potential of trees as carbon sinks. Extensive tree plantations “would require a major fraction of the global land surface with intolerably large environmental and social costs,” Boysen says. “Our results showed that extensive terrestrial carbon dioxide removal measures are unable to counteract business‐as‐usual emissions without eliminating virtually all natural ecosystems and compromising food production and biosphere functioning.”

But Finkbeiner is undeterred, and says he is also backed by science. Research shows the world has space for up to 589 billion mature trees without competing with agricultural lands, he says.

“We need to plant at least a trillion trees to get 600 billion, since many will not survive,” he says. “Additionally, we must protect the 170 billion trees in imminent risk of destruction.”

Most of the planting, says Finkbeiner, should be in the so-called Global South, because trees generally grow faster than in Europe or North America, and are cheaper to plant and maintain.

Tom Crowther, a professor at Swiss university ETH, who led the Yale University study that calculated the number of trees on the planet and advises the U.N. environment program, says the trillion-tree target is a good goal. “Given enough support from the thousands of restoration efforts around the world, it is possible to make a massive dent in this goal,” Crowther says. “They must understand which soils to restore, which species to plant, how to manage the ecosystem following restoration, along with many other ecological questions.”

Trees are far more than CO2 sinks, says Finkbeiner. “They can provide millions of jobs and other benefits. The use of local timber-intensive materials in construction substitutes CO2-intensive materials like steel and concrete, and the timber industry can create hundreds of millions of additional jobs and wealth in the Global South, thus reducing population growth and migration.”

Besides, he says, the initiative’s timing is good. One-quarter of all the emissions reductions pledged by countries in the 2015 Paris agreement will come from tree planting and land restoration. Countries, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany, have promised to plant and restore large areas of degraded forest and other land as a response to the climate crisis.

Finkbeiner is immensely proud of the 13,500-hectare (33,359-acre) Plant for the Planet ranch in Campeche province, near Cancun, Mexico, which his foundation bought in 2014 and which now employs 78 people. The land had been deforested, and the aim is to plant 10 million trees there by 2020.

The climate crisis does not need technological intervention to resolve it because trees are by far the simplest and most efficient way to absorb the world’s emissions, Finkbeiner says. “Why not use them? Sometimes adults are really difficult to understand.”

In Mexico last month, he pressed his argument: “We know it is a complex challenge and no, we don’t have all the answers. But in the end, If we follow the scientists and we act and in 20 years find out they were wrong, well we didn’t make any mistakes. But if we follow the skeptics and in 20 years we find out that they were wrong, it will be too late to save our future.”The Commerce Department announced late Monday that the 2020 census would ask people whether they were U.S. citizens, a controversial decision that civil rights groups say is unnecessary and could jeopardize the accuracy of the entire survey.

The decision comes after the Department of Justice requested in December that the 2020 census include the question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

But former Justice Department officials, including Eric Holder and Vanita Gupta, the former head of the civil rights division under President Barack Obama, said such an addition was unnecessary because the Justice Department already gets data about citizenship from the census’ separate American Community Survey. The decennial census has not asked about citizenship since 1950.

“Having citizenship data at the census block level will permit more effective enforcement of the VRA, and Secretary [Wilbur] Ross determined that obtaining complete and accurate information to meet this legitimate government purpose outweighed the limited potential adverse impacts,” the Commerce Department said in a statement.

Advocates worry that adding a question about citizenship to the census will only make people less likely to respond to the survey during a time of growing mistrust between President Donald Trump’s administration and minority communities. Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, told HuffPost in January that officials already had trouble getting people to respond and convincing them the census would not share their information with other agencies.

In a September memo, census field researchers reported that they were seeing unusually high concerns about confidentiality from respondents, particularly those in immigrant communities. Many people were falsifying the information they provided to researchers out of concern for their own immigration status or that of someone they knew.

“This is a clear attempt to politicize the process by discouraging minority communities and immigrant communities from participating in the count.” - Kristen Clarke, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law

An inaccurate census would have drastic consequences. The survey is not only used to determine how electoral boundaries are drawn, but also to determine how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grant money are allocated.

“This is a clear attempt to politicize the process by discouraging minority communities and immigrant communities from participating in the count,” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement. “This decision comes at a time when we have seen xenophobic and anti-immigrant policy positions from this administration. This is an arbitrary and untested decision that all but guarantees that the Census will not produce a full and accurate count of the population as the constitution requires.”

The Commerce Department’s decision comes just days before the deadline to submit questions for the 2020 census. Census advocates say that adding a citizenship question is extremely risky because it is untested and because the Census Bureau, which methodically tests changes to the survey, doesn’t have a good sense of how it will affect response rates.

“This untimely, unnecessary, and untested citizenship question will disrupt planning at a critical point, undermine years of painstaking preparation, and increase costs significantly, putting a successful, accurate count at risk,” Gupta, now the president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. “The question is unnecessarily intrusive and will raise concerns in all households – native- and foreign-born, citizen and non-citizen – about the confidentiality of information provided to the government and how government authorities may use that information.”

In a memo explaining the decision, Ross wrote that the Commerce Department had not seen any empirical evidence that adding the citizenship question would actually depress response rates. The question has been well-tested, he said, because it was included on the decennial census until 1950 and has been part of the annual American Community Survey since 2005. The Community Survey goes out to 2.6 percent of the U.S. population.

The responses from the Community Survey aren’t reliable enough for the Justice Department to use, Ross said. The Commerce Department also considered using citizenship data from other federal agencies, but did not consider it reliable enough, he added.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Tuesday said the census has asked about citizenship since the mid-20th century. It’s true that some census questionnaires have asked about citizenship, but the main decennial census survey hasn’t asked a question on the subject for more than 50 years.

Civil rights groups say that the citizenship question has nothing to do with enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which is a powerful tool to preserve the voting power of minority groups. They are concerned that adding it is the beginning of an effort to draw electoral districts counting only the number of citizens in them.

J. Christian Adams, the president of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation, suggested the Commerce Department’s decision could help realize that goal.

“Only citizens should be given political power. Our current system leads to noncitizens being allocated political power in legislatures at the expense of citizens,” Adams, who served on Trump’s now-defunct Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, said in a statement. “I applaud the Trump Administration’s decision to include the citizenship question in the 2020 Census. It’s critical that the next redistricting cycle account for the citizen residents of districts so urban centers do not unfairly profit from the political subsidy that higher noncitizen populations provide.”

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who has advised Trump on voting issues, also suggested in June that it was necessary to change the way districts are drawn.

Adding the question was sure to draw legal challenges. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) filed one Monday evening, and former Attorney General Eric Holder also tweeted Tuesday that he plans to sue.

“We’re prepared to do what we must to protect California from a deficient Census. Including a citizenship question on the 2020 census is not just a bad idea — it is illegal,” Becerra said in a statement.One of the first actions I took upon my appointment as interim president of Michigan State University in early February was to pursue revocation of tenure and removal of former Dean William Strampel. As explained then, it was plainly evident he had not acted with the level of professionalism expected of an MSU employee, particularly one holding an office that involves student and patient safety.

MSU will continue to cooperate with all official investigations related to sexual assault or other misconduct. But we have and will do more. With our action to revoke tenure, we are sending an unmistakable message that employees who do not treat students, faculty, or anyone else appropriately are subject to administrative discipline up to and including firing. Allegations about Strampel’s own behavior as well as lack of attention to the conduct of Larry Nassar now have resulted in criminal charges against him from the Michigan Attorney General. Some of the allegations about his personal conduct, especially conduct toward students, are disturbing. Today’s charges confirm our belief that he has fallen short of what is expected and required from academic leadership. They are not in alignment with this university’s values and they never have been.

His failings are unacceptable and that is why our work to change procedures, strengthen accountability and prevent sexual misconduct is so important. While the crimes of one doctor and the misconduct of his dean do not represent our university, they do demand the scrutiny of everyone in order to assure individuals like these can never be in a position again to harm others.HAVANA (Reuters) ― Cuban authorities said the fiery crash of an aging Boeing passenger jet on Friday shortly after takeoff from Havana had killed 110 of the 113 on board, making it the Caribbean island’s deadliest air disaster in nearly 30 years.

Flags flew at half-mast in Cuba on Saturday, marking the start of two days of national mourning while authorities worked to recover evidence from the site of the crash and to identify the crash victims.

Fifteen have been identified so far and one black box retrieved, officials said.

Allegations of previous safety complaints against the little-known Mexican company called Damojh that leased the nearly 40-year-old Boeing 737 to Cuban flagship carrier Cubana also began to surface.

Damojh declined to comment while Mexico’s Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics said a new audit of the company would be undertaken to ensure it was still “fulfilling norms.”

Meanwhile, Cuban authorities told a news conference on Saturday at Havana airport that 99 of the passengers killed on the domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin were Cuban, while three were foreign tourists ― two Argentines and a Mexican ― and two were Sahrawi residents in Cuba.

Six Mexican crew members were also killed.

Ten Nazarene pastoral couples returning home after a retreat were among the victims, the Cuban Nazarene Church said.

Three Cuban women survived the crash, but are still in critical condition, said the head of the hospital where they are being attended.

Cuban officials identified the women as Mailen Diaz, 19, of Holguin; Grettel Landrove, 23, of Havana; and Emiley Sanchez, 39, of Holguin. Sanchez was conscious and communicating, Diaz was conscious and sedated, and Landrove was in a coma, reported the Washington Post.

“My daughter is a fighter, she’s strong, she’ll save herself,” said Amparo Font, Landrove’s mother, with a trembling voice and tears welling.

Outside the morgue, distressed relatives cried and hugged one another, as they gave authorities information on loved ones to aid in the identification process.

“This is a very unexpected death, she didn’t deserve it. My grandmother was a strong person,” said Katherine Lucia Martinez, 18, bursting into tears and clinging to her father.

Her 60-year-old grandmother was among the dead, and she was waiting with other relatives of the deceased at a Havana hotel for an update from authorities.

President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday visited the morgue, a day after reviewing the site of thecrash, which is the first big test of his presidency after taking the reins from Raul Castro last month.

Some locals who saw the crash say one of the engines appeared to have caught fire before the plane hit the ground.

“The plane was on fire, it flipped and then nosedived,” said farmer Marino Perez Alvaredo.

RECORD OF SAFETY COMPLAINTS?

Cubana leased the jet less than a month ago, Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo said on Saturday. The carrier was struggling to meet demand for flights and was serving many domestic routes by bus instead.

Cuba often resorts to leasing due to the decades-old U.S. trade embargo which makes it difficult to acquire newer aircraft, Yzquierdo said. Damojh operates three planes, according to the Mexican government.

Ovidio Martinez Lopez, a retired Cubana pilot, wrote in a widely-shared post on Facebook thatCuban airlines had leased planes from Damojh in 2010 and 2011, but one of its aircraft dropped off the radar while over the city of Santa Clara.

Cuban officials suspended the captain and co-pilot of that flight for “problems and serious lack of technical knowledge,” he said, and Cuba’s aviation security authority had recommended Cubana no longer lease from them.

Separately, a pilot who used to work for Damojh was quoted on Saturday by Mexican newspaper Milenio criticizing the company for lack of adequate maintenance of planes.

“I experienced several incidents at this company, like engine failure or the electrical system went when we took off from Mexico on one occasion,” Marco Aurelio Hernandez was quoted as saying.

Cuban investigators have so far recovered the cockpit voice recorder in “good condition,” Yzquierdo said, and are still looking for the flight data recorder.

The crash was the worst in Cuba since a Soviet-built Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana in 1989 killing all 126 people on board and another 14 on the ground.

“For the love of god, I never thought I would see this,” said Caridad Miranda, 45, whose sister and niece died in the crash.

“They should have checked that plane well.”$84,000? What $84,000? Joshua Roberts/Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) may be hoping that you forgot that he owes you $84,000 in taxpayer money that he used to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, but at least one congresswoman has not.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) privately pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last week to do more to make sure Farenthold does not weasel out of paying back the taxpayer money he spent to settle a lawsuit involving gross allegations by a former female aide three years ago. Among other things, Farenthold allegedly told a staffer that the female aide could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to” and that he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about her.

Details of his settlement weren’t public until last December, at which point he said he would retire at the end of 2018 and immediately repay the money. He never did.

“I urge you to make sure that Congressman Farenthold keeps his promise to the American people and reimburses the U.S. Treasury immediately for the full amount of the settlement,” Speier wrote in a March 15 letter to Ryan, which HuffPost has obtained.

She describes the GOP congressman’s changing justifications for refusing to repay the money, and says that while an ongoing House Ethics Committee probe into his office is important, it’s not relevant to the $84,000 he vowed to pay back “for which taxpayers have already been on the hook.”

Here’s her full letter:

It certainly appears that Farenthold is trying to get out of paying back the money. He’s gone from saying he would repay it immediately, to saying he would do it after the House passed a bill related to workplace protections on Capitol Hill, which it did, to saying that he wanted to see what the Senate and President Donald Trump do with that bill.

“Once the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds,” Farenthold’s chief of staff Bob Haueter told HuffPost in February.

The guy is not hard up for money, either. He’s worth millions of dollars.

A Farenthold spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on when, or if, the lawmaker plans to repay the money.

Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said only that “The speaker has reiterated to Mr. Farenthold that he needs to keep his promise to repay taxpayers for the settlement.”

Politico reported last week that Farenthold may be planning to resign from Congress sooner than the end of the year. That would allow him to dodge the House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations that he sexually harassed other members of his staff, used official money for campaign purposes, and lied or omitted details in previous testimony to the committee.

Speier, a leading voice in the push to crack down on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill, told HuffPost in February that GOP leaders could be doing more to demand that Farenthold repay the $84,000 ― or compel him to step down.
