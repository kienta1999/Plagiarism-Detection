Disgraced Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein is keeping a low profile these days, but a satin-robed sculpture of him seated a golden “casting couch” is making an appearance at Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles.

Weinstein’s right hand is clutching an Oscar (The 90th Academy Awards ceremony will take place on Sunday).

The statue is a collaboration between street artists Plastic Jesus and Joshua “Ginger” Monroe, known for their avant garde installations. Plastic Jesus usually does Oscar-inspired works to show the underbelly of Hollywood, while Monroe is responsible for creations like this:

Plastic Jesus, whose real name is unknown, told The Hollywood Reporter that the Weinstein piece, which took two months to make, was intended to be interactive and allow passersby to sit next to Weinstein.

“For many years the exploitation of many hopefuls and established names in the industry was brushed under the carpet with their complaints of harassment and sexual abuse being ignored or worse,” said Plastic Jesus told the publication.

“Hopefully, now in the light of recent allegations against many leading figures in Hollywood the industry will clean up its act.”

Monroe told The Hollywood Reporter that the Weinstein statue’s couch suggests a “visual representation of the practices and methods that are used in Hollywood with these big powerful people.”

“They have money and power to give jobs and they use that for their own sexual gratification and there’s no better way to visualize this than the way we did with the casting couch,” he said.

The best way to take down powerful people is to “poke fun,” Monroe added.

“As Mark Twain once said, ‘Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand.’”

People on Twitter had mixed reactions to the statue:

He’s in charge of the music at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony.

Although Wheeler has been part of many Oscars telecasts, this is only his third time as musical director for the awards show, which means he supervises all of the music and conducts the entire evening. The Emmy- and Tony-nominated orchestrator and record producer has an impressive background that ranges from Broadway to several seasons as band leader on “Dancing With the Stars.” He has played major roles in producing the Emmys and the People’s Choice Awards, and he received the Lifetime Achievement honor at the NAACP Theatre Awards in 2008.

It was 2010 when Wheeler started to figure “an awards show is an awards show.” It wasn’t a big deal anymore ― until he received an email from a high school teacher.

“She said one of her students came in after the Oscars and said, ‘I know what I want to do now, and I didn’t know an African-American could do that,’” Wheeler told HuffPost. “Seeing me conducting the orchestra was an inspiration and I said, ‘Wow, this is the reason to accept this grand show on a different level.’ I ended up going and talking to the class, and they went gaga hearing about everything. It made me say, ‘This is a big deal, be proud of it.’ And that moment was something very special to me.”

We talked to Wheeler about why the musical director is so important, what makes a good show and, yes, what it’s like playing people off the stage during their acceptance speeches.

What exactly does it mean to be the musical director for the Academy Awards?

Anything musically that happens during the show, I’m the boss of it all. The producers talk to me about what they want, and I give them what they want ― the talent, the performing numbers, whatever. I supervise all of that. I’m also one of the orchestrators on the show so it’s sort of a double function. Nothing happens on the show musically without me knowing about it, and ultimately nothing that I do happens without the producers knowing about it. I’m constantly talking to them about their ideas and stuff that I want to do to make sure that it’s OK with them.

This production has to be a huge collaborative effort. Do you get to pick who plays in your orchestra?

Oh yeah, absolutely. There are 41 pieces in the orchestra this year, which is about the norm. We have one more than we had last year. These are people on my team and I handpicked them for their proficiency, for their versatility. We have to deal with all styles. We’re playing anywhere from hip-hop all the way to the John Williams and Hans Zimmer scores, so they have to have the ability to do all of that. The year that “Straight Outta Compton” was nominated, it was the only year that there was actually the hip-hop type feel, but I knew I could trust my musicians in the rhythm section.

Talk me through the preparation timeline.

The time frame is about three weeks to prepare all the music, one week to do the recordings and the rehearsals. The recordings we do at Capitol Records, and then we have backup recordings in case a singer loses their voice, we have their voice on tape. The show is basically live. We’re using Capitol as a rehearsal hall and to record anything that we need to record.

You’ve worked with the Oscars for a while. Is there anything you do differently now that you maybe didn’t do years ago?

I think the first time I did it in 2004 was the one that was a shock to the system. In 2010 I said, “I think I got this down.” And nothing has changed basically in the procedure. It’s just that you get used to it, and you get very comfortable with it. It’s like, “Here we go again, another year.” There are surprises that happen every year, but the procedure is the same. And once you get used to that, the pressure is always pressure, but you’re just used to the pressure now.

You’re on your feet a lot during the show. How do you prepare for that? Do you get breaks at all?

During the show I never leave the conductor stand. There is one commercial break in there where I thought, “Well, this is the longest commercial break.” But at the Dolby, with the size of the theater, if I wanted to go the restroom for a second, I couldn’t do it. There’s no time.

Plus, we’re playing music for the house for most of the commercial break to keep them entertained. They used to do this all the time, and then they stopped doing it for a while. The producers last year said, “We’d like to go back to that.” So if a commercial break is three-and-a-half minutes, we’ll play the first two minutes of it. Then we have a minute-and-a-half to get ready for the music we’re going to play when we come back. It’s nonstop. There are approximately 140 pieces that we have to be prepared to play. For the categories, there are some shows where we have to rehearse about 40 pieces of music even though maybe only 20 of them get heard.

Do you do anything special the morning of the big show?

We have a dress rehearsal on Saturday evening and another rehearsal on Sunday morning. Everybody in the orchestra that I use are the ones that I have used for the last three years so they know the routine. I try to make them as comfortable as possible and to have no fear in my face ― because if I show fear, they’re going to show fear. They’re used to it, and I’m used to it. We have the two dress rehearsals just to iron out any last-minute kinks before we go live.

The chemistry has to be so good between you and your orchestra.

Having your own people there, you’ve got your back covered every time. If I make a mistake, they actually cover for me. I brought my hands down once to start the orchestra, and nobody played because they knew I was putting my hands down in the wrong place. And I just laughed. Now technically speaking, they should have played. I’m the leader, you follow me, right or wrong. But they didn’t. And then I brought them in five seconds later when I was supposed to. I laughed, and I bowed and said, “I thank all of you for covering me.”

I know a few years ago you and the orchestra were actually not playing at the Dolby Theatre during the show.

We actually did the show fiber-optically from Capitol, and the only difference is that I wear a tuxedo all the way through the show, bow tie and all ― and it gets stuffy. At Capitol, I could take the bow tie off, I could take the jacket off and relax. And the director would say, “We’re going to be coming to the orchestra when we come back from commercial.” So I put my bow tie on, I put my jacket on, and I tell the orchestra. Some of the orchestra, those that you can only see from the waist up, they would have their tuxedo jackets, shirts and so forth ― and then have on jeans and sneakers.

That’s hilarious! I don’t blame them though.

Out of a three-and-a-half-hour show, we were seen maybe for one minute. You know, 10 seconds here, another 10 seconds there, and then maybe 20 seconds when they introduce the orchestra.

Now, of course, everybody is fully dressed at all times. They are so proud to have the orchestra back in the pit, which for me is a big difference because you are really part of the show, you’re involved in the show. It’s almost as if the audience is watching every movement you do. While at Capitol, once you stop playing you can step down. I’m listening to the show, but I don’t have to be on point as much.

They have cameras stationed in the pit so throughout the night there will be camera shots of us when we’re going into commercial and going out of commercial. Sometimes they shoot the audience, but sometimes they just spend time on the orchestra ― just reinforcing the fact that, yes, the orchestra is right here and we are playing live.

What is it like playing people off the stage if their acceptance speech goes on too long?

First of all, I never start the music myself. I get the cue from the director. He’ll say, “Stand by. Get them off, Harold.” And I tell the orchestra to stand by. We have two or three pieces of music to play, and they start softly. They build and build and build until they’re so loud that if it weren’t for microphones, you wouldn’t be able to hear [the people on stage] over the orchestra. And sometimes they’ll look down in the pit and they’ll see me. They’re blaming me for bringing the orchestra in, but it’s the director.

Only once, I played them off on my own. This is a funny story. It was the People’s Choice Awards, and the producer said, “It’s eight minutes until 11, and the network is saying they’re going to pull the plug if we’re not right on time so stand by, Harold,” which means we got to get these people off. So we get down to the next-to-the-last award. The speech went on and on and on, and I said, “Oh God, they’re going to take us off the air.” So I started the music quietly and the director said, “Stop the music, stop the music! What are you doing?” And I said, “But you told me ...” And he said, “But this is Walter Matthau. You don’t play off Walter Matthau!”

I learned from that. I don’t care if they have 45 seconds and they talk for three minutes. I don’t do anything without first a warning from the director to stand by and play them off. But the conductor always gets the blame for it.

That has to be a difficult position to be in.

Especially being in the house because I’m standing right there. They can look at me and say, “What are you doing? I’m not finished!” I don’t look at them when I do it. I just keep my head down toward the orchestra.

What to you makes a good show?

First of all, we have excellent writers, scripts, presenters, fans and so forth. The key to it is an excellent host. Jimmy Kimmel has done a wonderful job. I’ve done it when he was the host, I’ve done it when Billy Crystal was the host, and a few years ago when Chris Rock was the host. It really starts there because of that energy, and it goes back to the days of when [Johnny] Carson was doing it. A standard was set.

It’s also the quality of the stardom, and I think the quality of the music. Music is a subliminal thing. People are having a good time, and they don’t know that the orchestra has helped that. I know when to keep their energy up. I know when they need to take a breath. The choice that I play two hours into the show is different than what I would play in the first hour of the show. And hopefully in terms of entertainment, however many nominated songs you have, you know there are wonderful performances. It takes a lot to do it. It’s not one person.

After a good show, how do you celebrate?

First of all, I take a deep breath and I sit back in my chair. I have a chair on my conductor’s podium which I rarely use during the show. I sit back, I thank the orchestra and ― you’re not going to believe this ― I get in my car, drive home, have a vodka on the rocks and ask my family, “How did it look on television?” I have no desire to go to the Governors Ball [after-party]. I’m so spent by that time. That is not my way of winding down. My daughter said to me this year, “Dad, you’re going to Uber home after the show.”

You deserve it after a long night!

I said, “No, I’m not because the Uber isn’t going to get through the barricades.” I told her, “I’ll drive. I’ll be fine.”Daniel Handler, author of the famed Series Of Unfortunate Events children’s books, is stepping down as Wesleyan University’s commencement speaker after reports surfaced that he made sexually inappropriate comments to women.

Female authors and librarians accused Handler, who uses the pseudonym “Lemony Snicket,” of making derogatory jokes at their expense, according to the Pacific-Standard.

In one example, Kate Messner said that on a bus taking her, Handler and other authors to a children’s book festival in Rhode Island, he overheard someone else wondering if she was from the Midwest. Handler shouted, “Are you a virgin, too?” Messner said.

She said that later, in a hotel lobby, Handler said, “These children’s book events always turn into orgies!”

Wesleyan’s student newspaper, The Argus, reported on Thursday that Handler, a 1992 alumnus of the Connecticut school, would be replaced by women’s right’s icon Anita Hill as the main speaker at the commencement ceremony.

“Daniel Handler has chosen to withdraw as Wesleyan’s Commencement speaker this May,” university President Michael Roth said in a statement. “We’ve agreed that the focus of the event should be on the Class of 2018, their families and the celebration of graduation. I’m pleased to share that Anita Hill has graciously agreed to deliver the Commencement address.”

Handler publicly apologized in a blog where the accusations came to light, but a representative for Handler did not comment about the Wesleyan ceremony.

Hill is best known for putting an early spotlight on sexual harassment in the workplace during Senate confirmation hearings on Clarence Thomas’ nomination to the Supreme Court. Hill testified that while working for Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he made a number of sexually explicit comments to her.

Hill was publicly vilified by several of the politicians questioning her and in some media reports. Thomas was confirmed, and still serves on the court. Allegations have continued to surface, though, accusing Thomas of sexual harassment.A nun cleans the main altar before the start of the first mass of German Pope Benedict XVI at Saint Peter's Square in the Vatican April 24, 2005.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A Vatican magazine denounced widespread exploitation of nuns for cheap or free labor in the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, saying the male hierarchy should stop treating them like lowly servants.

The article in the monthly “Women, Church, World”, remarkable for an official Vatican publication, described the drudgery of nuns who do work such as cooking, cleaning and waiting on tables for cardinals, bishops and priests.

The article, based on the comments of several unnamed nuns, described how some work in the residences of“men of the Church, waking at dawn to prepare breakfast and going to sleep once dinner is served, the house is in order and the laundry cleaned and ironed”.

It said their remuneration was “random and often modest”.

In many cases, the nuns, who take vows of poverty, receive no pay because they are members of female religious orders and are sent to the residences of male Church officials as part of their assignments.

In the past, most of the nuns working as domestic help in male-run residences or institutions such as seminaries were local nationals. But in recent years, many have come from Africa, Asia and other parts of the developing world.

The author of the article wrote that what most saddened one of the nuns she talked to was that“they are rarely invited to sit at the table they serve” and made to eat in the kitchen by themselves.

One nun said she knew of fellow sisters who had PhDs in subjects such as theology and had been, with no explanation, ordered to do domestic work or other chores that had“no relationship to their intellectual formation”.

The experiences of such nuns, the article said, could be transformed“into a richness for the whole Church, if the male hierarchy sees it as an occasion for a true reflection on power (in the Church)”.

The magazine, a monthly supplement to the Vatican daily newspaper Osservatore Romano, is written by women journalists and academics.

Only a handful of women hold senior positions in the Vatican hierarchy, including Barbara Jatta, who last year became the first woman to head the Vatican Museums.

Several nuns have senior roles in Vatican departments that look after religious issues.

Unlike his predecessors, Pope Francis lives in a Vatican guest house which is run like a hotel and takes his meals in the main dining room which is staffed by paid waiters.

By contrast, the late Pope John Paul, who reigned from 1978 to 2005, had a team of five Polish nuns who ran his household in the papal apartments in the Vatican’s Apostolic Palace.

The household of former Pope Benedict, who resigned in 2013 was looked after by about eight female members of a lay Catholic organization known as Memores Domini.

The entire March edition of the magazine is dedicated to the theme of women and work.President Donald Trump announced a new tariff Thursday that beer producers and other beverage companies say will drive up their production costs by more than $250 million annually.

Slated to go into effect next week, the tariff imposes a 25 percent tax on all foreign imports of steel and a 10 percent tax on foreign imports of aluminum. It’s intended to encourage U.S. production of those materials, but beverage companies that produce canned drinks say such a high aluminum tariff will deal their industry a blow.

MillerCoors, one of the U.S.’s largest beer producers, released a three-part statement on Twitter shortly after Trump’s announcement. The tariff will likely force MillerCoors and other beer companies to lay off workers, it said, hinting that the cost would be passed on to consumers.

While we won’t know the details for a week, the Department of Defense recently reported that aluminum does not cause any national security issues. (1/3) — MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018

Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminum cans, and this action will cause aluminum prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. (2/3) — MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018

We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available, however, there simply isn’t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us. American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of

this misguided tariff. (3/3) — MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018

Khawaja Mamun, chair of the business and economics department at Sacred Heart University, said the beverage industry isn’t exaggerating the likely negative effects of the new tariffs.

“The tariffs will benefit steel and aluminum producers ― the people who actually make it ― but the people who use steel and aluminum to make other products will get hurt,” Mamun told HuffPost.

He also predicted “the price increases are going to hurt consumers,” noting that “if a beer company has to raise prices to match demand, consumer demand will be reduced as the product gets more expensive.”

Mamun said it’s certainly possible that beer companies will lose hundreds of millions of dollars and shed jobs, as MillerCoors argues.

“Yes, surely [they will lose money],” he said. “Any policy helps one group and harms the other group. In this case, the harm will outweigh the benefit as a total.”

Several beverage companies, including MillerCoors’ parent company Molson Coors, signed a letter to Trump early last month urging him not to place a tariff on aluminum imports, particularly the types known as cansheet, primary aluminum and scrap.

“A tariff or quota will immediately disadvantage these domestic businesses since foreign competitors would have the advantage of not paying an artificially inflated raw cost,” the letter read. “We estimate a tariff of 10 percent on this aluminum would cost beer and beverage producers $256.3 million, a 20 percent tariff would cost $512.5 million and a 30 percent tariff would run $768.8 million.”

AdvertisementOlympic gold medalist Aly Raisman has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Olympic Committee. Here, she speaks at the sentencing hearing for Larry Nassar, a former team USA Gymnastics doctor, in Lansing, Michigan, Jan. 19. Brendan McDermid / Reuters

Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman filed suit against the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to take action to prevent former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar from molesting hundreds of young athletes, according to news reports.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in California but announced Friday, accuses the committee of bungling its response to sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, who is now serving a long prison term for sex crimes.

“After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented,” Raisman said in a statement, according to NBC. “I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.”

A USA Gymnastics trainer was sometimes present during treatment sessions where Nassar abused young athletes at the Karolyi Ranch, Raisman alleges in the suit, according to NBC News.

Raisman, in recent interviews, has accused the USOC of ignoring allegations against Nassar and threatening her not to tell how he molested her under the guise of treatment.

“I was told [by USA Gymnastics] to be quiet,” Raisman told ESPN in January. “And I think that when somebody in high power is telling you to be quiet, right when they realized you are abused, I think that that is a threat. USA Gymnastics just said, ‘We’re handling this. We got this. Like, stop asking us questions.’”

Raisman, a gold medalist who competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, was among more than 100 women who alleged Nassar sexually abused them. He pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms.

The USOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group’s CEO, Scott Blackmun, resigned on Wednesday after a cancer diagnosis.Jimmy Kimmel, griddle master. Kevork Djansezian via Getty Images

Jimmy Kimmel is hosting the Oscars for the second straight year on Sunday, but he’s already earning bad reviews from his wife for his performances at breakfast.

In an amusing essay for The Washington Post on Thursday, Molly McNearney called her talk-show host husband’s pancake art “annoying.”

Kimmel began making “normal” pancakes about a year ago, and graduated to “realistic, totally edible portrayals” of beloved children’s characters and other fun shapes, she wrote. No stencil, mind you. She’s impressed ― in an irritated sort of way.

“The adorable pancakes my husband, Jimmy Kimmel, cooks for our kids are making my life hell,” the headline reads.

McNearney, the co-head writer of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” often serves Cheerios, so the griddle masterpieces make her feel like she isn’t stacking up. “Now I feel inadequate,” she wrote.

“His artistic ability has become my burden,” she said. “When he isn’t home, our daughter sits at the kitchen table, glares at me and says, ‘I want a pancake. Peppa Pig. She doesn’t even know that pancakes are round.’ ”

This month, “Hamilton” gets the pure parody treatment, teaming up with Weird Al and his accordion to create “The Hamilton Polka.”

These are just a few of the everyday activities that black people in America do not have the luxury of doing without being perceived as a criminal, recent headlines prove. We want to hear your stories of driving while black, walking while black, partying while black, etc., through our project “____ While Black.”

Stories of people calling the police on black people for just being in white spaces have increasingly dominated the news cycle and reminded us of the stereotypes and implicit bias that society projects onto black skin.

Though these stories have caught nationwide attention, they are by no means a new phenomenon. Dating back to before Jim Crow, many black people in America have had to justify our existence in places we’ve had the right to be simply because others rejected our presence.

According to a 2015 Reuters poll, only 30 percent of black Americans “trust the police to be fair and just” compared to 54 percent of all Americans. An overwhelming 69 percent of black Americans agreed that police “tend to unfairly target minorities” while only 29 percent of white people agreed. These attitudes are no surprise given that black people made up 24 percent of all police killings in 2015 despite being just 13 percent of the population.

Meanwhile, those who call the police on black people face no legal repercussions and ignore the fact that their irresponsible report can quickly turn deadly. John Crawford III, 22, and Tamir Rice, 12, are examples of this.

Getting policed for being in spaces we should be entitled to shouldn’t be a fear that black people have. But it is. And it’s a part of a larger issue rooted in racism and the policing of black bodies. Lolade Siyonbola, Darren Martin and Donisha Prendergast are recent victims to this, but so are plenty of black people across the country whose stories aren’t being told. And more than likely, if you’re black, it’s happened to you or someone you know.

HuffPost wants to make sure this conversation doesn’t stop at just a headline. We’re asking our readers to share stories of their experiences dealing with or witnessing this kind of racial injustice through “______ While Black.”

Has someone called the police on you for merely existing in a space you have every right to be in? Have cops ever used your complexion as a reason to question your presence? Do you constantly find yourself explaining why you deserve to occupy space without having to be interrogated by it? We want to hear your stories.

Think a real-life version of the movie “Mean Girls,” according to one business writer.

Brendan Greeley, appearing on MSNBC’s “Velshii & Ruhle” Friday, explained how the 2004 Lindsay Lohan comedy is the perfect way to understand the complex financial and geopolitical issues associated with Trump’s decision.

“It’s all a question of how much power the U.S. has in the international trade system,” Greeley said. “Up until about 2000, the U.S. was, as far as international trade goes, Regina George at the beginning of the movie ‘Mean Girls.’”

“We set the rules, everybody else lived by the rules. We chose who our friends were. Japan tried to keep the yen devalued. They tried to make ‘fetch’ happen, we said stop trying to make ‘fetch’ happen. They did what we asked.”

Things changed around 2000, Greeley said, when “we invited a new pretty girl into the group.” That would be China, aka Lohan’s character in the movie.

“We said we can trade with China because it’s going to be good for us. … That did not work out as we planned,” Greeley said. “The Lindsay Lohan character …gains power, and she’s not really a good person in the middle of that movie. That’s where we are with China. … The question is, how do we respond, right?”

Trump’s tariff tirade is exactly the wrong approach according to Greeley and the movie.

“This tariff is lashing out in an indiscriminate way. It’s a way to prove our power again, and like Regina George in the middle of that movie, we don’t have the power we think we do,” he said.This week, you have likely seen Delta in coverage of the national debate over gun control and security in U.S. schools. I want to take the opportunity to update you on how we got here and where we stand.

On Saturday, Delta rescinded a one-time group travel discount for the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting, and asked the organization to remove our name and logo from their website. This decision followed the NRA’s controversial statements after the recent school shootings in Florida. Our discounted travel benefit for NRA members could be seen as Delta implicitly endorsing the NRA. That is not the case.

I have heard from many of you over the last few days. Our people and our customers have a wide range of views on how to increase safety in our schools and public places, and we are not taking sides. Our objective in removing any implied affiliation with the NRA was to remove Delta from this debate.

While Delta’s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course. Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale. We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.

None of this changes the fact that our home is Atlanta and we are proud and honored to locate our headquarters here. And we are supporters of the 2nd Amendment, just as we embrace the entire Constitution of the United States.

I have tremendous respect and admiration for Governor Nathan Deal, and thank him for the work he has done on the jet fuel tax exemption. He is a great friend to Delta. I know this action by the state legislature troubled him as it does all of us.

I know it is not comfortable to be caught in a highly emotional debate, and many of you have received questions from customers. We are at our best when we bring our customers and our world closer together. Hopefully, our decisions this week will serve this ultimate cause.

I want to thank every one of you for your professionalism and continued focus on taking care of our customers every day.So how did Schumer comfort her bestie? A hug? An understanding ear?

“The next day I got a bouquet of flowers delivered and I was like, ‘What is this?’ I bring the bouquet of flowers in and there was a note that says, ‘I’m so sorry to hear you’re gonna die alone. Love, Amy,’ ” recalled Lawrence in the clip above.Dave Jamieson/HuffPost

Striking teachers and other public employees in West Virginia have shut down schools across the state for more than a week, flooding the capitol in Charleston each day to rebuke their lawmakers. The workers are demanding significant raises to their stagnant pay and a clear plan to curb rising premiums in the state employee health care program.

If only someone could have foreseen such a state of affairs.

“They’re saying we can’t afford it,” Ted Boettner, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said of legislators. “Well, we can’t afford it because we’ve done these large tax cuts.”

A decade ago, West Virginia began gradually winding down certain business taxes that could have helped pay for the across-the-board raises that teachers haven’t seen in four years. They also could have helped fill the funding shortfall in the Public Employee Insurance Agency, or PEIA, which many workers list as their top concern.

Instead, lawmakers are staring down budget gaps as they try to resolve a historic strike that has shuttered schools in all 55 counties and galvanized austerity-weary residents.

A tentative deal to end the walkout was hatched earlier this week by Republican Gov. Jim Justice, who promised raises of five percent for school personnel and three percent for state employees. But workers doubted lawmakers would follow through on the deal and vowed to continue their walkout.

Their skepticism was well-founded. Three days later, the state Senate still hasn’t approved Justice’s proposal. Many lawmakers have doubted the governor’s numbers and questioned whether the money is there for the raises.

Although Republicans now control both chambers of the statehouse, the tax cuts that squeezed the state budget were a bipartisan undertaking. Then-Gov. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who’s now one of the state’s two senators in Washington, had urged legislators to pursue the tax cuts in 2006, arguing that West Virginia needed to slash taxes on corporations in order to be competitive with other states.

Over the following years, the state wound down its corporate net income tax rate from 9 to 6.5 percent, and phased out its business franchise tax. It also slashed its tax on groceries from six to three percent, and later did away with it entirely under Manchin’s successor, Democrat Earl Ray Tomblin. Over the same span, the state also created a family tax credit, increased its homestead exemption and got rid of an alternative minimum tax and corporate charter tax, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy.

All told, those cuts diminished state revenue by more than $425 million each year, the center estimates.

“They’re saying we can’t afford it. Well, we can’t afford it because we’ve done these large tax cuts.” - Ted Boettner, West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy

As the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported in 2016, Manchin later questioned the wisdom of the tax cuts he’d championed once the state was facing a budget hole of $353 million. “I don’t know if you say they’re the right or wrong move, but you’ve got to be competitive,” Manchin told the paper. “I couldn’t be at 9 percent corporate tax and expect corporations to stay here if they didn’t have to.”

Much like the Republican leaders who recently fast-tracked federal tax cuts through Congress, West Virginia leaders sought their cuts at a time when their economy was doing relatively well, with strong coal prices. But coal operators got battered by the shale boom and cheap natural gas, driving down demand for coal production. The industry’s travails have closed mines and crimped tax revenue.

In the meantime, teachers and other public employees have been asked to tighten their belts. While some teachers have received pay increases based upon length of tenure, the state has not boosted the overall payscale since 2014. West Virginia now ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, according to the National Education Association. The average teacher pay in the state is $45,622, though many educators interviewed over the past week said they earn well below that amount.

One teacher, Rebecca Diamond, told HuffPost that she has 19 years on the job and earns just $39,000. She has to work weekend shifts handling a register at Hardee’s for $8.75 an hour in order to support her family. The lack of raises combined with rising health care costs has meant that some workers have watched their take-home pay go down in recent years. Employees have insisted that the state come up with a long-term plan to curb PEIA premium hikes.

As of Friday, teachers across the state were still on picket lines and protesting at the state capitol. County by county, they will determine if schools remain closed into next week. So far, not a single one of the state’s 55 counties has reopened its schools ― a clear sign of the strike’s backbone and the pent-up frustration of workers.A group of investors led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, reached a deal to buy The Weinstein Company, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman confirmed.

“Our office will support a deal that ensures victims will be adequately compensated, employees will be protected moving forward, and those who were responsible for misconduct at TWC will not be unjustly rewarded,” Schneidermann said in a statement.

Contreras-Sweet and her backers, including billionaire investor Ronald Burkle, bid $500 million on the film production company, which included assuming $225 million worth of debt, according to Variety. The deal, which Schneiderman said was reached Thursday, also features an $80-million compensation fund for victims of Weinstein’s harassment and abuse.

TWC announced Monday that it would have to file for bankruptcy, following Schneiderman’s decision last month to sue the studio for violating anti-discrimination and harassment laws.

The studio views the deal as “a positive outcome under what have been incredibly difficult circumstances,” it told The Guardian in a statement.

TWC began sliding toward bankruptcy when its board of directors fired co-founder and chairman Harvey Weinstein in October amid dozens of sexual assault allegations against him. Weinstein has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex.

The Weinstein Company, founded in 2005, is behind several blockbuster films and popular TV shows, including “Lion,” “Django Unchained” and “Project Runway.”

Contreras-Sweet, a Hollywood outsider and Mexican-American immigrant, reportedly plans to keep the studio’s employees, projects and assets. But she intends to give the company a new name, according to multiple media outlets.

In her November proposal letter to the company’s board of directors, Contreras-Sweet said she hoped to transform the studio into a “woman-led venture.”

“The recent events at The Weinstein Company have put focus on how women in the entertainment industry have been treated,” she wrote. “We believe that reorganizing the Company as a woman-led venture will be an inspiration to the industry, and a new model for how an entertainment company can be both financially successful and treat all its employees with dignity and respect.”

Other bidders included entertainment company Lionsgate, as well as New York-based production company Killer Content in partnership with philanthropist Abigail Disney.

George Kieffer, who previously served with Contreras-Sweet on the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce’s board of directors, told Vanity Fair that Contreras-Sweet didn’t have experience running a film company but that she would “figure a way to figure it out.”

“I think that she’s had enough experience in enough positions by now to know that you hire great people and manage them well, and when she needs to be engaged directly she will be,” Kieffer said.Seth Meyers called out what he described as the “cartoonishly corrupt” dealings of Jared Kushner.

On Thursday’s broadcast of “Late Night,” the host asked how much more suspicious can President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser get?

“He took millions in loans from companies he met with in the White House, tried to set up a secret channel to talk to Russia, can’t get a security clearance to complete a background check,” said Meyers.

“And lurks ominously in the background of every White House photo like he’s the ghost of a boy Trump killed with an errant tee shot,” he added.

With Kushner’s security clearance being downgraded, Meyers was prompted to ask: “Why does Jared Kushner still have a job in the White House?”Rep. Shirley Chisholm was also the first black candidate for a major party’s presidential nomination. Getty Images

“Shirley Chisholm deserves a permanent place among other defining figures in the Capitol,” Clarke tweeted on Tuesday. “Representation matters.”

Shirley Chisholm deserves a permanent place among other defining figures in the Capitol. Representation matters. My sister-colleague, @SenKamalaHarris, and I are going to make sure it happens. #ChisholminUSCapitol https://t.co/aluXHXScuj — Yvette D. Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) February 28, 2018

Multiple Democratic senators are already co-sponsoring the measure, including Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Tim Kaine (Va.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is also on board. The bill would direct the Joint Committee on the Library to enter into an agreement to obtain a statue within five years of the bill’s passage.

On the heels of Black History Month and at the beginning of Women’s History Month, Chisholm is perhaps the perfect candidate for the honor. Over her groundbreaking political career, she became the first black candidate for a major party’s presidential nomination and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party’s nomination. She served seven terms in the House from 1969 to 1983Kylie Jenner’s latest pictures are causing a Stormi on the internet.

The new mom released the first two photos of herself holding Stormi Webster, her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott, Thursday on Instagram.

The pictures show Jenner wearing a black patterned sweatsuit with what looks a pair of Yeezy Mud Rat 500s, which are part of Kanye West’s Spring 2018 collection. Little Stormi wears a cream onesie with animal ears, and white socks.

“my angel baby is 1 month old today,” Jenner captioned the post.

The second photo gives a better look at her daughter, though Jenner has managed to keep Stormi’s face somewhat hidden in pictures since her birth.

The reality star also posted an Instagram story that marked one month since she gave birth:

Of course, new dad Travis Scott made sure to mark Stormi’s one-month milestone as well. The rapper on Thurseday posted a picture on Snapchat showing his daughter wearing a “daddy” shirt.

“My lil mama one month today,” he wrote, referencing the “daddy” on her shirt as “her favorite [parental] unit of course.”

Stormi was born on Feb. 1, weighing 8 pounds, 9 ounces. Jenner publicly announced the birth a few days later in a message to fans and a sweet, 11-minute long video called “To Our Daughter” that looked back at her pregnancy.

“Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Jenner said in the announcement. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”

The lip kit mogul broke the internet last month when she posted her first photo of Stormi and announced her name:

The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has also shared a Snapchat of the baby’s cute little toes, along with updates on how she’s doing.Amandla Stenberg put a lot of thought into not entering the Marvel cinematic universe.

Last week, “The Hunger Games” actor (who uses they/them pronouns) explained to CBC Arts that they were in the running for a lead part in “Black Panther” but decided to back out because they didn’t want to take the role from a darker-skinned actor.

“One of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from ‘Black Panther,’” the 19-year-old said in the interview published last week. “I got really, really close and they were like, ‘Do you want to continue fighting for this?’ And I was like, this isn’t right.”

Amandla Stenberg backed out of being considered for a role in "Black Panther." Instagram

The biracial actor said they put a lot of thought into rejecting a role playing a purely African woman.

“These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I’m the same color as everyone else in the movie,” Stenberg said. “That was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up and when I do take up a space, it’s because I’ve thought really, really critically about it and I’ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.”

Stenberg, who will star in “The Hate U Give,” which is based on the Angie Thomas young adult novel about Black Lives Matter, has purposely accepted roles in which they feel they physically resembles the character. In 2017, the actor played a biracial character in “Everything Everything” and accepted the role of Rue in “The Hunger Games” — who is described in the novel as having “dark brown skin and eyes” — despite receiving backlash for being cast in the role.The top lobbyist for the National Rifle Association hinted late Thursday that President Donald Trump had cooled on his own plans to support gun control measures.

Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA’s lobbying arm, said on Twitter he had a “great meeting” with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday and reaffirmed neither “want gun control.”

“We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people,” Cox said after the meeting. “POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control.”

I had a great meeting tonight with @realDonaldTrump & @VP. We all want safe schools, mental health reform and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS & VPOTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process and don’t want gun control. #NRA #MAGA — Chris Cox (@ChrisCoxNRA) March 2, 2018

The president himself followed up the note with a tweet saying he had a “Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office” with the group.

Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Friday that Trump promised the NRA he would “continue to support the Second Amendment” but that “the background check system is something that he’s still very much interested in improving.”

Sanders didn’t clarify what specific gun policies the president would support but said that “conceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21 [for being able to purchase firearms]. But he also knows there’s not a lot of broad support for that.”

The move may signal that Trump has already taken an abrupt about-face from his own proposals to widely expand gun control legislation, including the adoption of more stringent background checks on some weapon purchases and the restriction of firearm purchase for some young people. The president first announced those plans in a surprising meeting with a group of lawmakers on Wednesday, which included his suggestion that law enforcement be able to seize guns from the mentally ill without first going to court.

“I like taking the guns early,” the president said. “Take the guns first, go through due process second.”

He also accused Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) of being “afraid” of the NRA.

Trump’s proposals were a vast departure from the stance taken by the NRA, which has long opposed any legislation meant to rein in access to firearms. Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, appeared delighted at the president’s suggestions.

“You saw the president clearly saying not once, not twice, not three times, but like 10 times, that he wanted to see a strong universal background check bill,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said after the meeting, according to The New York Times. “He didn’t mince words about it. So I do not understand how then he could back away from that.”

It’s unclear how Trump now feels about such proposals after his meeting with the NRA. HuffPost has reached out to the White House for comment.Black women staged a bold protest at the Cannes film festival this week to call out racism in French cinema.

On Wednesday, 16 French black and biracial actresses stood together on the red carpet of the international film festival to denounce the lack of representation of black actors in French films, reported Agence France-Presse.

The women ― led by French actress Aïssa Maïga, of the 2006 critically acclaimed film in France “Bamako” ― linked arms as they marched under the rain toward the red carpet. Once on the steps before the media, they stood together and raised their fists in the air.

The actresses recently collaborated on a book called Noire N’est Pas Mon Métier, or Black Is Not My Job, in which they provide anecdotes of the racism they’ve faced in their movie careers.

Actress Nadège Beausson-Diagne ― who starred in 2008 in France’s biggest-ever box office hit “Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis” (“Welcome to the Sticks”) ― recounts in the book how a director once asked her if she spoke “African.” She was also once told at a casting call: “For a black, you are really very intelligent. You should have been white,” reported Variety.

Another actress involved in the book and protest, Rachel Khan, wrote a HuffPost blog in March, describing how casting directors often offer her roles of stereotypical characters, like house cleaners or prostitutes.

“We can’t be silent anymore,” Khan wrote. “Our own children already ask us ‘why?’ when they look at our screens.”

Recent statistics have highlighted the stark lack of representation, and recognition, of black people in French cinema. The first black person to win best actor in France’s César awards (an Oscars-like annual ceremony started in 1976) was Omar Sy in 2012 for the hit film “Les Intouchables.”

A 2016 analysis from France Info looked at the previous decade of César awards ― specifically the top eight award categories from 2005 to 2015 ― and found that only two black people had ever won: actor Omar Sy in 2012 and filmmaker Abderrahmane Sissako in 2015 (for the hit film “Timbuktu”). There were only eight black nominees out of 479 over that decade.

After the Cannes protest this week, Maïga told reporters that quotas “could become one of the possible options” to fight against the “invisibility” of people of color on screen ― though, she noted, people will be resistant to the idea.

Wednesday’s protest came on the heels of another female-led demonstration days earlier at Cannes: On Saturday, 82 women, including director Ava DuVernay and actress Cate Blanchett, linked arms and stood together on the festival’s red carpet to protest gender inequality in the film industry.WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration has yet to prove it is fully complying with new Russian sanctions legislation just over one month after the State Department sparked a wave of criticism by announcing it would not yet apply any of the new penalties the law permits it to enact.

The legislation, passed last summer in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election, requires the State Department to work to curb Moscow’s income by discouraging foreign countries and companies from doing deals with the Russian defense and intelligence sectors and sanctioning those who go through with major purchases.

But the department has refused to give reporters specifics on what ― if anything ― it’s doing. And it has given lawmakers no new details on its work since a classified briefing on Jan. 29, the day the decision was announced, according to aides for two of the Senate’s top foreign policy figures, Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).

Since that briefing, members of Congress have been publicly fuming against the administration for its apparent inaction, highlighting subsequent warnings from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency head Mike Rogers that Russia’s desire to meddle remains strong as fresh elections loom.

“It’s like telling Russia, ‘You were welcomed in 2016 to interfere in our elections, and we look forward to your interventions in 2018,’” Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on CNN last month. “That cannot stand.”

Democrats have deliberately made the Russian sanctions issue one of their top talking points over the last month. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and three congressional committees are still investigating whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian scheme to boost Trump in the 2016 election. For those who believe there was a quid pro quo, the administration’s approach to the law ― passed with a veto-proof majority in part because both Republicans and Democrats worried the new president would go easy on Moscow ― looks like one more piece of evidence.

The State Department maintains that it has already made progress in trying to deter potential Russian military customers through private discussions with foreign officials and by instructing all missions abroad to closely monitor talk of arms deals with Moscow.

“This administration has consistently shown that it will levy costs on Russia in response to its malign behavior,” a department spokesman told HuffPost. “Already since the passage of the legislation, several billion dollars in planned or announced Russian arms deals have been abandoned, imposing increasing financial costs on the Russian government.”

The spokesman did not provide particulars.

U.S.-friendly countries that have publicly considered purchases of Russian equipment over the last few months include Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, India and the Philippines. The embassies of all but Qatar did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A Qatari spokesman noted that his defense minister recently told a Washington audience his country had not yet finalized a deal to buy Russia’s S-400 missile defense system and said it would follow all U.S. laws.

The Trump administration’s defenders say the lack of new sanctions against Russia could be a sign the system to prevent Russian arms deals is working, as sanctions only need to be applied to foreign companies or countries if an agreement is completed. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement at the end of January that that month’s deadline only marked the beginning of the period when sanctions can possibly be applied.

But the lack of even a slap on the wrist so far could suggest to foreigners that the United States is not serious about the law, experts argue.

“If they want to stop these kinds of sales, they are going to have a find a couple of companies to sanction to send a signal,” said Peter Harrell, a former top State Department sanctions official now at the Center for a New American Security. “When you make public some of the deals you’ve gotten turned off it puts pressure on the remaining countries to exit too.”

The administration’s announcement in January of no new sanctions, and the public unveiling the same day of a list of significant Russian oligarchs cribbed from Forbes magazine ― rather than a detailed list of possible future Treasury Department sanctions targets ― made it look weak on the question of Russian money flows, Harrell added.

Trump ”made a mockery of the entire legislation,” said Max Bergmann, another former State Department official now at the Center for American Progress.

The classified briefing convinced members of Congress that the State Department has begun some work on Russia but lawmakers are still unsure if it is a priority, an aide to Menendez told HuffPost. He said that the administration has also yet to apply other sanctions mandated in the law, including those targeting Russian cyber actors for attacking individuals or democratic institutions around the world.

Two days after the briefing, 20 Democratic senators wrote to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to demand more information, including about personal work on the issue that might prove crucial in dealing with some governments. They have yet to receive a response, according to the Menendez aide.

The aide and the former officials all noted that there are limits on how public the State Department can be about this kind of diplomacy and that Trump has expanded sanctions on Russia established by authorities predating the 2017 law. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also publicly promised some separate sanctions on Russian oligarchs under the legislation soon.

As a result, there’s a clear risk the attack line on Trump’s sanctions policies could mislead the public on how U.S policy functions if serious work is being conducted behind the scenes.

And even among Democrats inclined to distrust the Trump’s administration’s foreign policy aims, there is a push from some in the party to talk less about Russia altogether because of the sense based on polling that voters care far more about issues like health care and economic justice, a Hill aide told HuffPost. The aide noted that members have been paying close attention to recent polling suggesting that conclusion from the Democratic PAC Priorities USA.

But congressional staff and influential members in both parties are still paying close attention to how Trump implements the new law, and concern about it will likely grow as the midterms get closer.

“If we haven’t seen more action over the next month or two, I certainly would expect more pressure” from Capitol Hill, Harrell said. “I think Russia doesn’t particularly care about U.S. public statements at this point. If you want to deter them you need pain.”

The Trump administration could at least indicate which potential Russians arms sales abroad it sees as significant so Congress can have a benchmark by which to judge its work preventing the deals, the aides to Menendez and Murphy said.

And it could even start its work of pressuring those dealing with Russians with relatively uncontroversial targets, the Menendez aide added, citing Russian airstrikes and personnel helping the Assad regime in Syria. The administration could use the new law to sanction specific figures or entities involved in outrages like the ongoing bombing of a starving rebel-held enclave outside Damascus.
