Artist Emanuel Santos gained worldwide notoriety last year when he unveiled his bust of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Not the good kind of notoriety.

The piece is stationed in Ronaldo‚Äôs birthplace of Madeira, Portugal, at the airport that now bears his name. You might describe it as an ... interesting interpretation.

The internet meme machine was savage to say the least, and Santos took the negative response very hard. Santos and his family had a rough time in the weeks and months that followed the unveiling, telling Bleacher Report that he suffered from feelings of humiliation and isolation.

The actor on Thursday submitted his latest artistic rendering of Donald Trump to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery for consideration as the official presidential portrait.

Dear Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery @NPG, I know it‚Äôs early but I‚Äôd like to submit this as the official portrait of our 45th President, Donald J. Trump. It‚Äôs called, 'You Scream.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs early,‚Äù Carrey wrote in a tongue-in-cheek tweet.

His artwork shows a nipple-fingering Trump screaming as he eats from what appears to be a bowl containing two scoops of ice cream.

It‚Äôs titled: ‚ÄúYou Scream. I Scream. Will We Ever Stop Screaming?‚Äù

People who responded on Twitter appeared to enjoy the piece:

Should Carrey‚Äôs Trump portrait not be to the gallery‚Äôs taste, maybe it would consider some of the actor‚Äôs other recent politically charged pieces:

But when there‚Äôs nary a single nook or cranny of the entire country that‚Äôs not absolutely stunning, we figured it would be worth it to venture beyond our familiar Italian horizons (yep, even beyond Cinque Terre and Positano). So here are some of Italy‚Äôs lesser known towns and tiny hamlets that you probably haven‚Äôt heard of before but are so worth the trip.

1. CEFAL√ô

Region: Sicily

That beach vacation you‚Äôve been dreaming of? Plan it in this picturesque Sicilian port town. The city abounds with culture and history and is also home to some of the island‚Äôs most serene beaches. The Duomo di Cefal√π, for one, is an Arab-Norman masterpiece with one of Sicily‚Äôs oldest mosaics. But if it‚Äôs proximity to the water you‚Äôre after, nothing beats a leisurely stroll down the lungomare, the seafront promenade, followed by a dip in the warm waters.

Where to Stay: The Ai Mulini Resort‚Äôs peaceful and lush surroundings, on-site Sicilian restaurant and pool are a must for some serious R&R.

2. ISOLA SAN GIULIO AND ORTA SAN GIULIO

Region: Piedmont

The tiny, magical island on Lago d‚ÄôOrta is about a quarter mile (or a 20-minute ferry) from the lake town of Orta San Giulio. Both are so small, they‚Äôre mostly pedestrian only, which has its way of turning a visit here into a romantic throwback the likes of which Friedrich Nietzsche, Honor√© de Balzac and Robert Browning all enjoyed. Unlike Lake Como, the international tourists haven‚Äôt really been tipped off to this sparkling body of water yet, making it a particularly tranquil getaway.

Where to Stay: Built where a monastery once stood, Hotel San Rocco maintains those baroque-yet-updated vibes all while overlooking the shores of the Lake Orta (from the pool if you choose, to boot).

3. BURANO

Region: Venice

No, that‚Äôs not Disney World; it‚Äôs the rainbow-colored island town about 40 minutes from Venice on the same lagoon. It‚Äôs world-renowned for its lace-making‚Äîthere‚Äôs even a lace museum ‚Äî and glassblowing (the island of Murano, aka Murano glass, is nearby), which means finding all those little gifts you need to bring home can probably be done here in one fell swoop. Beyond being a DIY-er‚Äôs dream vacay, Burano is also a seafood haven, so bring an appetite. (The local risotto de g√≤ is a must.)

Where to Stay: Since the island is so small, you‚Äôre better off staying somewhere like the Liassidi Palace Hotel in Venice, about an hour ferry ride from Burano.

4. ALBEROBELLO

Region: Puglia

This may look like one small, adorable corner of a Hobbit town, but Alberobello is actually composed of 1,500 of these traditional trulli, aka white cone-shaped houses made of limestone. So yeah, no surprise here that Alberobello is deemed a Unesco World Heritage Site. While the town can dip into tourist trap territory, perusing the one-of-kind locale for a day or so is truly a unique, memorable experience.

Where to stay: Trulli Holiday Resort (because, duh, you have to stay in a trullo, of course).

5. CASTELMEZZANO AND PIETRAPERTOSA

Region: Potenza

The best way to get from one of these mountaintop towns to the other? By zip line, of course. The Volo dell‚ÄôAngelo is one of the longest and highest zip lines in the world. While thrill seekers, mountain climbers and hikers are certainly drawn to these Dolomite-cradled villages, a stopover at these twin towns is so worth the elevation ‚Äî if not for the scenic selfie alone.

Where to Stay: The best option is to stay right outside town, like at the family-owned Grotta dell‚ÄôEremita, just a couple miles from Castelmezzano.

6. BERGAMO

Region: Lombardy

The northern city sits right between the sublime Alps and the Po River Valley, making for a distinctly gorgeous 360-degree backdrop. But the dual-nature of Bergamo doesn‚Äôt end there. The city is essentially made of two parts: Citt√† Alta (Upper City), which is built into cliffs and surrounded by its 16th-century Venetian walls, and Citt√† Bassa (Lower City), the modern center. While you should take your time exploring both areas (get between the two via cable car), an excursion to Serio Falls, Italy‚Äôs highest waterfalls, is definitely worth the day trip (and you might recognize them from Call Me By Your Name).

Where to stay: After hopping between two cities, you‚Äôll want to indulge in the luxe accommodations of the five-star The Relais San Lorenzo. Trust us.

7. LUCCA

Region: Tuscany

The Renaissance-era walled city is just about an hour away from Florence by train, making it perfect for a day trip. But with its rich history (um, remember learning about the First Triumvirate with Julius Caesar, Pompey and Crassus? It formed in Lucca), scenic setting and delicious Tuscan food, Lucca is well worth a longer stay. We also have to recommend renting bicycles to spend an afternoon riding along the wall.

Where to Stay: If you‚Äôve always wanted to stay in an old Tuscan mansion, Hotel Fabbrica di San Martino should be right up your alley. And for all the oenophiles out there, its wines are organic and biodynamic certified. Under the Tuscan sun, here we come.

Related:Rapper Fabolous is facing charges of third-degree aggravated assault and third-degree terroristic threats after he allegedly attacked his longtime girlfriend Emily Bustamante (aka Emily B).

Fabolous, whose real name is John Jackson, turned himself in to the Englewood Police Department in New Jersey Wednesday evening and was booked on two felonies.

The 40-year-old didn‚Äôt spend time in jail, but was cited for the charges and given a notice for his court appearance, according to TMZ.

The charges stem from an alleged incident on March 7, when Jackson was in Los Angeles on a business trip. Court documents said Jackson ‚Äúbecame enraged‚Äù when he found out via Instagram that Bustamante, best known for her work on the VH1 reality show ‚ÄúLove and Hip Hop: New York,‚Äù was in the same city.

Bustamante told police that the rapper sent a text message while she was flying back from LA, telling her he wanted to hit her in the head with a baseball bat. He allegedly told her that he would kill her but he ‚Äúdid not want to go out like that,‚Äù according to NorthJersey.com.

Jackson allegedly later punched Bustamante seven times in the face, ‚Äúcausing severe damage to her two front teeth,‚Äù which she ended up losing, according to court documents.

Bustamante and Jackson have two children together and have dated since 2002.

After Jackson allegedly attacked her, Bustamante asked her father to remove two handguns from the Englewood residence she shared with the rapper.

She feared the guns might be used against her, according to a probable cause affidavit.

Jackson came to the home where he confronted Bustamante, her brother and her father and then went upstairs to look for the handguns, which weren‚Äôt there.

‚ÄúWhen he could not locate the guns, the defendant left the house, but not before informing the victim, her father and her brother that he had a bullet for them,‚Äù court documents read.

The entertainer‚Äôs attorney, Alberto Ebanks, told Billboard the charges are out of character.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Fab close to 20 years and believe he is incapable of engaging in the alleged conduct,‚Äù Ebanks said.

NJ.com notes that Bustamante has said her relationship with Jackson has been challenging at times.LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Deadpool might not consider himself a superhero, but its latest installment is off to a powerful start.

The Marvel Comics film from 20th Century Fox debuted in North American with $125 million in 4,349 locations. That wasn‚Äôt enough to match the debut of its predecessor, 2016‚Ä≤s ‚ÄúDeadpool,‚Äù which had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film with $132.4 million. The Ryan Reynolds-starrer bowed overseas with $176 million for a global weekend total of $301 million.

Although it debuted under estimates, ‚ÄúDeadpool 2‚Ä≤s‚Äù launch was nothing to complain about. It still secured the second-best opening for an R-rated film, as well as the third-biggest debut of the year behind Marvel blockbusters ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Panther.‚Äù It also secured Fox its second-highest opening weekend in history.

The sequel is still boasting a promising critical consensus, with an 84 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and an A CinemaScore.

‚ÄúDeadpool 2‚Ä≤s‚Äù strong debut is a testament to Reynolds, according to Fox‚Äôs president of domestic distribution Chris Aronson.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt say enough about him,‚Äù Aronson said. ‚ÄúNot just the character, but promoting it. I feel great about this opening.‚Äù

Its opening was enough to crush ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War‚Äôs‚Äù reign on the domestic box office. After securing the No. 1 spot for three weeks, the Disney and Marvel superhero tentpole dropped to second place. Its fourth weekend haul was still impressive, reeling in $29 million from 4,002 screens. ‚ÄúInfinity War‚Äôs‚Äù domestic tally currently sits at $595.4 million.

‚ÄúInfinity War‚Äù was followed by Paramount Pictures‚Äô new release, ‚ÄúBook Club.‚Äù The romantic comedy ‚Äï starring Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen ‚Äï came in slightly ahead of expectations, earning $12.3 million on 2,781 screens.

The weekend‚Äôs other newcomer, Global Road Entertainment‚Äôs ‚ÄúShow Dogs,‚Äù landed in sixth place, only digging up $6 million from 3,212 locations. The family-friendly comedy garnered an A CinemaScore. Its Rotten Tomatoes critical score didn‚Äôt fare quite as well, averaging a 26 percent.

Rounding out the top five are two film‚Äôs sophomore frames. Warner Bros.‚Ä≤ ‚ÄúLife of the Party‚Äù rallied in $7.5 million from 3,656 locations. Domestically, it has made $30.9 million. Universal‚Äôs ‚ÄúBreaking In‚Äù secured $6.5 million on 2,537 screens. In two weeks, it‚Äôs earned $28.8 million.

In the specialty market, Focus Features‚Äô ‚ÄúPope Francis - A Man of His Word‚Äù opened with $480,000 on 346 screens for a per-screen average of $1,389.

‚ÄúRBG,‚Äù the documentary on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is still holding strong. In its third weekend, it expanded to 375 locations for a three-day total of $1.28 million. That‚Äôs a per screen average of $3,413. Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media co-produced the film with Storyville Films and CNN Films.

Thanks to a trio of superhero powerhouses, the domestic box office is up 6.3 percent from 2017, according to comScore. The weekend-to-date is up a staggering 62.9 percent, compared to 2017 when ‚ÄúAlien: Covenant‚Äù was the No. 1 film.This is Part 2 of a two-part series on the ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù meme‚Äôs legacy. Read the other side of the story.

On June 14, 2015, Sergeant Sean Fenner laced up a brand new pair of bulky, black (objectively awful) work boots. Little did he know that the fashion faux pas, which he thought looked ‚Äúpretty sharp,‚Äù would follow him for years to come.

Fenner is the unsuspecting star of the massively popular ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù video, which was recently referenced in Marvel‚Äôs record-breaking superhero movie, ‚ÄúBlack Panther.‚Äù

Originally filmed in Berkeley, California, in 2015, the famed video captures the moment an Instagrammer named Young Busco, aka Brandon Moore, approached a police officer, Sgt. Fenner, in the middle of arresting someone to comment on his particular choice of boots.

‚ÄúOfficer, I‚Äôve got one question for you,‚Äù Busco declares from behind his camera phone. ‚ÄúWhat are thooose?‚Äù he bellows, as he zooms in on Fenner‚Äôs feet.

The video was later uploaded to Vine, and it took off from there, garnering millions of views and inspiring imitators far and wide. Even Michael Jordan was sucked into the meme‚Äôs popularity when a kid interrupted a question-and-answer session at his Flight School summer camp in August 2015, asking the NBA legend, yep, ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù

In an interview following the premiere of ‚ÄúBlack Panther,‚Äù Busco told HuffPost he can‚Äôt stand the meme now, but Fenner is reveling in the fact that he‚Äôs become ‚Äúlightweight famous‚Äù because of it.

‚Äú[A kid] called me lightweight famous,‚Äù he explained in an interview this month, his first since the meme hit the internet. ‚ÄúSo all around the police department, that‚Äôs what they say.‚Äù

He gets recognized all the time, he added.

‚ÄúI go along with it, and I take photos with [people],‚Äù he said.

Now that ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù is in ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù ‚Äî an ‚Äúiconic movie,‚Äù according to Fenner ‚Äî his notoriety has only risen. And for that, he‚Äôs thankful.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna live forever. So it‚Äôs pretty cool,‚Äù he said.

The ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù reference occurs early on in the film, as Shuri is showing her brother T‚ÄôChalla around her lab, and constitutes one of the first big laughs in the movie. But, according to ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù director Ryan Coogler, it it serves a pragmatic purpose, too.

‚ÄúThe idea with Shuri is that she rarely leaves Wakanda,‚Äù Coogler told HuffPost. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs connected to the outside world through the internet, through youth culture on the internet.‚Äù

But for Fenner, the joke is much more than a minor plot point.

‚ÄúFor them to put it into ‚ÄòBlack Panther,‚Äô which right now is the first black superhero movie, the No. 1 grossing movie of 2018, and maybe as it‚Äôs going, of all time...‚Äù Fenner said, ‚Äúfor them to just go ahead and put this bead in there, it‚Äôs like it enshrined it in pop culture.‚Äù

These days, as the police officer contemplates retirement, Fenner said the ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù video stands as the most memorable moment of his career. All in all, he was happy to finally answer the question on everyone‚Äôs minds: What exactly are those shoes?

Read our full interview below:

What‚Äôs it like being a meme?

I‚Äôm not from the social media era. When the meme came out, my son texted me and says, ‚ÄúHey, Dad, do you know you‚Äôre a meme?‚Äù And my daughter goes to college so everyone on her college campus had already seen it before I saw it, and I just played along with it. I just thought it was fun. What happens when you‚Äôre a police [officer] and when we police, a lot of things we see every day are dark. To have a moment that was just fun ... I even went and put it on my license plate: ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù

You‚Äôre kidding. You had ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù on your license plate?

One of my friends said to me, ‚ÄúYou should get the license plate ‚ÄòWhat are those?‚Äô‚Äù So I went ahead, put the little numbers in, and sure enough they had it, so I had that on my vehicle for a little.

When did you realize the meme was blowing up?

When the meme came out, I was still in my 40s, but all the guys that work for me, they‚Äôre in their 20s, and they live with social media as an anchor to them. It was almost daily that I would get, ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù if I was in lineup, if I was in a restaurant locally. I worked from Richmond down to Berkeley when that meme came out, and everywhere I went, people would say, ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù They were pointing at my boots. They wanted to take photos. If I did a career day, all the kids, when they found out I was the ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù guy, they didn‚Äôt even want to ask me questions about policing. It was all about ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù

And the boots. ‚ÄúWhere did I get the boots from? Why did I wear those boots?‚Äù

So, what are those?

I have them boxed up, but I [had] just bought those shoes like a day before for work, because I like to keep a brand new pair of shoes. As soon as they get scuffed, I get a new pair. I‚Äôm a military guy, so I like to keep the boots shiny, and I got them from Work World. I don‚Äôt remember the exact name of them. I did, but I don‚Äôt now, because I‚Äôve had so many pairs since then.

I can‚Äôt believe you just bought them.

Well, it‚Äôs funny, because I thought the shoes were pretty sharp. I‚Äôm an old guy, so you know the young people ‚Äï they wear all the new fashionable tennis shoes. Most of the officers that work for me, they wear really lightweight ‚Äî they‚Äôre almost like sneakers or tennis shoes-type boots ‚Äî so they could run. I‚Äôve been in policing over 22 years, so when I came on, you‚Äôd wear a nice pair of rugged boots, because you never know what you were going to get into. I‚Äôve been wearing those type of combat boots for the last 20 years.

Did you ever change your shoes?

No, no, I continued to wear them. It was funny, because what started out to be a little joke, a little slight, turned out to be [big] and for that first year [after the meme], it was like the most popular YouTube, Vine video of 2015.

Take us back. What happened that day?

I was responding to an officer who was attempting to take an intoxicated female into custody right at that corner of Adeline and Ashby. If you know that area, there are some steps and a ramp for handicap that go down into the Ashby BART station. She was sitting on the steps, and the officer had some dialogue with her, and she was not necessarily listening to him, didn‚Äôt necessarily go along with the demands that he was giving her. So a little crowd ensued, and so in this crowd ... we‚Äôre in the times of when everybody records, so everybody out there had their camera going.

You can see in the little meme video that we were walking the woman to the car, trying to get her in the car. I was just at the end of the car, just trying to keep the crowd back, because maybe there was a crowd of 10, 15, maybe 20 that were piping off and saying different things: ‚ÄúWhy are you arresting her?‚Äù All the different things that go along with an arrest. The officer was putting the female in the car, and that‚Äôs when Young Busco came up to me and says, ‚ÄúHey officer, I have one question for you,‚Äù and then he panned down to my shoes and said, ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù

When he did that, what did you think?

I had to catch myself, because during that time period we had just went to a camera system, and so I was going to say something to him, and then I thought, ‚ÄúOh, I have my camera on. I can‚Äôt say just anything that I want to say,‚Äù and so that was the look [you] got when you saw my face and my tongue was out of my mouth, and I looked like I was bedazzled. That instant moment that I was like, ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

Oh, wow, so have you seen the bodycam footage?

No, generally we look at the bodycam video when we‚Äôre writing our reports or we have some type of evidence or something we need to pull from it for our reports. But usually if it‚Äôs not a significant case ... I was there, like I said, just to approve the arrest.

Will you ever release the bodycam video?

I don‚Äôt know what happened with the lady that was arrested, but if she hasn‚Äôt had her case adjudicated, BART generally doesn‚Äôt release video.

[A representative for BART denied HuffPost‚Äôs request for the video‚Äôs release. Sorry, we tried.]

Do people recognize you?

I was just last year at the [Golden State Warriors] parade in downtown Oakland, and I was standing in a crowd of thousands of people me, and a lady looked at me and she said something to the group of friends that she was with, asking, ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúAre you talking to me, because you know I‚Äôm the ‚ÄòWhat are those?‚Äô guy?‚Äù And she looked at me, and she said, ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù And she pulled [the video] up on her phone, and she looked at me and she looks at the phone and she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù So everybody in her group wanted to take selfies with me. It‚Äôs just cool being in the police department and getting such a bad shake all the time, then to have a fun memorable moment that has just struck pop culture.

Were you self-conscious of your shoes after that?

Oh, no. Like I said, I play along with it. The shoes that I wear are functional, and I‚Äôm from the era where you want to be ominous. You want to look like you can handle business, and the boots actually give you an inch-and-a-half lift, so I‚Äôm already 6-foot-1, so it makes me look like I‚Äôm 6-foot-2-and-a-half.

If you were a shoe, what shoe would you be?

I‚Äôd probably be an athletic shoe because I‚Äôm an athletic person, but I‚Äôm a functional person, so I believe in protecting yourself. You‚Äôre on your feet as a police officer for most of your day, so you want to have comfortable shoes. You want to have comfortable shoes, durable shoes, waterproof shoes, and those boots were all of that.

Describe your style in one word.

Charismatic.

What‚Äôs your advice to others who‚Äôve had ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù said to them?

AdvertisementWith President Donald Trump renewing his attacks on online retailer Amazon this week, conservatives are directing their ire at another web giant: Netflix.

Former Obama administration official Susan Rice is joining the streaming company‚Äôs board of directors, Netflix announced Wednesday. The news prompted outrage from conservatives who claim Rice misled the public about the 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Rice, who was serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time, initially attributed the attacks on the U.S. mission to an anti-Muslim YouTube video. Former President Barack Obama named her his national security adviser in 2013.

The National Center for Public Policy Research, a right-wing think tank, lambasted Netflix‚Äôs move in a press release, calling Rice an ‚ÄúObama Crony‚Äù and urging the company‚Äôs investors to oppose her addition.

‚ÄúThis Obama Administration influence only serves to enforce corporate America‚Äôs leftward tilt,‚Äù said Justin Danhof, director of the group‚Äôs Free Enterprise Project, in the statement.

Conservative media outlets were quick to criticize the announcement.

‚ÄúNoted Story Teller [sic] Susan Rice Named To Netflix Board,‚Äù read a headline on the conservative website Daily Caller.

This isn‚Äôt the first time that Netflix has provoked right-wing consternation. The streaming service is reportedly negotiating a content deal with Obama, which conservatives see as evidence of the service‚Äôs left-leaning slant.

‚ÄúRight now, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is available on Netflix,‚Äù wrote Philip Wegmann in an op-ed criticizing the negotiations for the conservative Washington Examiner. ‚ÄúNot available on that streaming site? The YouTube video the Obama administration falsely blamed for inciting the 2012 terrorist attack on our embassy in Libya‚Ä¶‚Äù

Rice‚Äôs appointment has prompted some conservatives on social media to say they are canceling their Netflix subscriptions, with the #BoycottNetflix hashtag gaining steam this week.

Ralph Zazula, a Massachusetts-based conservative political consultant is participating in the boycott.

‚Ä≥[Rice] certainly seems to be somebody that, if you‚Äôre a conservative, would not have the best interests of the country at heart,‚Äù Zazula told HuffPost.

Zazula, 64, added he also doesn‚Äôt buy French wines ‚Äúbecause of the way Jews are treated in France,‚Äù stopped following his beloved Boston Celtics because NBA players have become ‚Äúhoodlums‚Äù who all ‚Äúseem to be beating up their girlfriends‚Äù and usually borrows DVDs to avoid supporting a supposedly liberal Hollywood studio.

‚ÄúThe world, by and large, is a liberal bastion,‚Äù Zazula said.

Chris McCoy, a civil litigation attorney in Lakewood, Colorado, and another participant in the boycott, expressed similar sentiments to HuffPost. McCoy says he has previously stopped eating at McDonald‚Äôs, because a franchise in Linwood, California, flipped the iconic ‚ÄúM‚Äù to a ‚ÄúW‚Äù in honor of International Women‚Äôs Day. He also cancelled his subscription to the music-streaming service Spotify after it banned white supremacist bands.

McCoy, 46, says he isn‚Äôt offended by International Women‚Äôs Day and opposes white supremacy, but he is put off by what he perceives as a larger trend of companies exhibiting a liberal bent.

Media companies, McCoy added, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care about the third of the country that are Trump supporters. Media companies in the Bay Area don‚Äôt believe that there are people who do support the Trump agenda.‚Äù

Requests for comment from Netflix were not returned, though conservative frustration with the service doesn‚Äôt appear to be adversely affecting its business too much ‚Äï the company‚Äôs stock is up over 50 percent in 2018.Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) speaks at the National Press Club on Jan. 15, 2014, in Washington, D.C. Win McNamee via Getty Images

Teachers in Oklahoma still plan to walk off the job next week after state legislators passed an education funding bill that fell apart within hours.

Initially it seemed the legislation, signed Thursday by Gov. Mary Fallin (R), would quell the statewide walkout that educators had set for April 2 to demand more money for schools. But not even a day after the state Senate approved the first tax increase package in years, legislators in the state House voted to undo one of its main provisions, a tax on hotel and motel stays.

After applauding legislators for approving the funding bill, the state‚Äôs leading teachers union, the Oklahoma Education Association, renewed its call late Thursday for teachers around the state to stay out of school and descend on the Capitol in Oklahoma City on Monday.

‚ÄúYesterday, the Legislature passed a historic education funding increase,‚Äù the union said Thursday in a Facebook post. ‚ÄúToday, they started dismantling it by cutting millions out of the plan. Now they‚Äôre gone for the weekend. Oklahoma: we‚Äôll see you at 9 a.m. April 2 at the Capitol.‚Äù

Oklahoma is one of a wave of red states now facing a teacher revolt after years of anemic funding for education.

Over the past decade, Oklahoma carried out a series of tax cuts that, combined with falling energy prices, have left the oil- and gas-rich state with little money to steer toward teachers or textbooks. It‚Äôs more or less the same story that played out in West Virginia, where tax cuts forced educators to forego raises while their health care costs increased. Teachers there walked off the job for nine days in February and March, prompting the state legislature to fund pay increases for public employees.

The historic and successful strike in West Virginia has inspired a burgeoning uprising among austerity-weary teachers around the country. In addition to Oklahoma, Arizona could soon face a strike by teachers, who are demanding the state boost pay by 20 percent and return to pre-recession funding levels for education. (Meanwhile, teachers in Kentucky shut down public schools in 25 counties on Friday to protest proposed cuts to the state pension plan.)

Teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona are all among the lowest-paid in the country, with schools facing growing teacher shortages. Republicans control the statehouse and governor‚Äôs office in all three states.

‚ÄúAfter ten long years in a lot of these conservative states, the chicken is finally coming home to roost,‚Äù said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the 3-million member union with which the Oklahoma Education Association is affiliated. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve given tax breaks to big corporations, defunded public schools, and said, ‚ÄòWhat could go wrong?‚Äô‚Äù

After Oklahoma legislators passed the tax hike, it seemed the walkout could turn instead into a one-day rally on Monday. Now nobody knows for sure what next week will bring. The mixed actions by Oklahoma‚Äôs legislature could lead to a situation where some school districts close only for Monday or not at all, while others engage in a work stoppage for days. Many Oklahoma teachers on Facebook have called for keeping schools shut down until all their demands are met.

‚ÄúWe have buildings that are falling apart and textbooks that need to be taped together.‚Äù - Beth Wallis, assistant band director

To a certain degree, their walkout will require the cooperation of their largely sympathetic superintendents, who decide whether schools are formally open or closed. If schools are open and teachers refuse to return to work, the state could consider it an illegal strike. Several districts announced Friday that their schools would not be open on Monday.

Beth Wallis, an assistant band director who teaches in a Tulsa suburb, said teachers in her district voted unanimously to stay off the job beyond Monday. Although the legislation passed this week includes average pay raises of $6,100, Wallis said the lack of state funding guaranteed in the bill could leave local districts on the hook to pay for them. She also said securing teacher pay raises is secondary to increasing general school funding.

‚ÄúThe school funding in the bill is laughably small,‚Äù Wallis said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough to buy every kid in my district a single textbook. We have buildings that are falling apart and textbooks that need to be taped together.‚Äù

Like most states, Oklahoma cut school funding in the wake of the Great Recession. But it also pursued tax cuts during the economic recovery that followed, dropping income taxes and reducing the gross production tax on oil and gas companies. With little money to devote to schools, Oklahoma has led the nation over the past decade in cuts to its education formula funding, which is the main well of state money for individual districts.

‚ÄúThey sort of maximized the damage that the recession did to their schools and other public services, and as the economy improved, they kept cutting taxes,‚Äù Michael Leachman, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, recently told HuffPost. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just digging your hole even deeper.‚Äù

With less funding, many cash-strapped schools have gone to four-day weeks, while certifying a growing number of emergency teachers to fill vacant jobs. Such teachers don‚Äôt meet the state‚Äôs normal minimum requirements to teach in public school. The union says the state will have to increase salaries and school funding significantly if it wants to stop losing teachers to Arkansas and other nearby states that pay better.

Reversing course will not be easy. Approving tax hikes in Oklahoma is extraordinarily difficult, requiring a three-fourths supermajority in both chambers. Legislators were barely able to approve the tax package that has already foundered. Legislators had only hours to digest that bill before it was passed, and many apparently did not have time to read it. One state representative argued that the bill had a $75 million hole in it before taking the repeal of the hotel and motel tax into account.i am on american idol. i say nothing. lionel richie and luke bryan say yes aloud. katy asks what's going on. remaining silent, lionel and luke slowly push her chair out in front of the judges. i pull up my own chair and sit in her place. i send katy home. now, i am the lady judgeMalala Yousafzai returned to her home country of Pakistan for the first time since the Taliban attempted to assassinate her in 2012.

The girls‚Äô education activist landed in Pakistan early Thursday morning with her brother and father. The 20-year-old Nobel Prize laureate met with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in Islamabad where Abbasi and other government officials honored Yousafzai during a small ceremony.

‚ÄúWelcome home,‚Äù Abbasi told Yousafzai during a press conference, Reuters reported. ‚ÄúWe are very happy that our daughter has come back. When she went away, she was a child of 12. She has returned as the most prominent citizen of Pakistan.‚Äù

Shortly after, Yousafzai gave an emotional speech on national television as she wiped tears from her eyes.

‚ÄúI am very happy today, that after five and a half years I have set foot on my soil, in my nation again,‚Äù she said, according to Al Jazeera.

‚ÄúFor the last five years I‚Äôve dreamed that I can set foot in my country,‚Äù she said in clip captured by ABC News. ‚ÄúWhenever I travel in place, car, I see the cities of London, New York; I was told ‚ÄôJust imagine you are in Pakistan, you are traveling in Islamabad, that you are in Karachi.‚Ä≤ It was never true. But now today I see [that] I am very happy.‚Äù

As the audience broke out into applause, Yousafzai began to cry and paused to cup her hands over her face.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt normally cry,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still 20 years old but I‚Äôve seen so many things in life.‚Äù

Yousafzai may visit her childhood home in Swat Valley if security threats don‚Äôt prevent her from traveling.

She was just 15 when members of the Taliban shot her and two other classmates on a school bus as they made their way home from school. After the attack, the Taliban, which has condemned female education, vowed to kill Yousafzai if she ever returned to Pakistan. Details of her visit, like her location, have not been publicly confirmed for security reasons.

Days before her surprise visit to Pakistan, Yousafzai tweeted about her home country: ‚ÄúOn this day, I cherish fond memories of home, of playing cricket on rooftops and singing the national anthem in school. Happy Pakistan Day!‚Äù

The human rights advocate currently attends Oxford University and is about to publish her third book titled We Are Displaced: True Stories Of Refugee Lives.

Fans and fellow Pakistanis welcomed the young activist back to her home country on Twitter.

üå∏üíï ‚Äî Mahira Khan (@TheMahiraKhan) March 29, 2018MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has ordered 60 U.S. diplomats to leave by April 5, the foreign ministry said on Thursday, in a retaliatory move against Washington which expelled a similar number of Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a Russian spy in England.

The foreign ministry said it had declared persona non grata 58 diplomats in Moscow and two general consulate officials in Yekaterinburg in the row over the poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal on March 4.

Moments before the ministry announcement, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would respond in kind to the mass expulsion of diplomats by Western governments which include, apart from the United States and Britain, most member states of NATO and the European Union.

‚ÄúThe measures would be reciprocal ... They include expulsion of the equivalent number of diplomats and they include our decision to withdraw our agreement to allow the United States‚Äô general consulate to operate in St. Petersburg,‚Äù Lavrov told a briefing.

The attack on 66-year-old Skripal and his daughter, which Britain has blamed on Russian President Vladimir Putin and says was caused by a Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok left on the door of their home in England, has driven relations between Russia and the West to a new post-Cold War low.

Russia has denied involvement in the attack on the Skripals and says it suspects the British secret services are trying to frame Russia to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.

Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence who betrayed Russian agents to Britain and then was exchanged in a spy swap deal, is still in a critical condition from the attack.HuffPost

Families hoping for news outside the police station were dispersed with tear gas and authorities did not give information until late into the evening.

‚ÄúThe State Prosecutor‚Äôs Office guarantees to deepen investigations to immediately clarify what happened in these painful events that have left dozens of Venezuelan families in mourning,‚Äù said Chief Prosecutor Tarek William Saab on Twitter.

Venezuelan prisons are notoriously overcrowded and filled with weapons and drugs. Riots leaving dozens dead are not uncommon.

State official Jesus Santander said the state of Carabobo was in mourning after the incident in the city of Valencia.

‚ÄúForensic doctors are determining the number of fatalities,‚Äù Santander said. A policeman was shot in the leg and was in a stable condition and firefighters had extinguished the flames, he said.

Many Venezuelan prisons are lawless and have been for decades. Prisoners often openly wield machine guns and grenades, use drugs and leave guards powerless.

Replete with surprise sightings of Kim‚Äôs bulletproof train and an elaborate banquet, experts say the secret Beijing visit was a carefully choreographed message from China to the United States and South Korea, who are jointly focused on achieving Pyongyang‚Äôs denuclearization.

Forced Into A Corner

The summit between Kim and Xi follows the extraordinary announcement earlier this month that Trump and Kim had agreed to meet by May to discuss North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons program.

The overture was a stunning change in posture after months of escalating threats and warmongering between Washington and Pyongyang, and was maneuvered by the diplomatic gymnastics of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Since his election in last May, Moon has made a fierce effort to prevent any kind of military confrontation on the Korean peninsula. The South Koreans continuously sought relations with the North and facilitated messages between Pyongyang and Washington. Moon has organized an inter-Korean summit with Kim in late April, and proposed last week that he and Trump could even hold a three-way summit with Kim if their respective talks with the North Korean leader go well.

China has watched these events unfold from the sidelines with increasing ‚Äúexclusion anxiety,‚Äù according to Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, a research institute in Washington.

‚ÄúChina probably didn‚Äôt see many other options than to reach out to North Korea. It was almost forced into a corner,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIn the past, China has seen the North Korean nuclear issue as a form of leverage in its relationship with the United States, and it has extracted a lot of bargaining power out of that issue with the Americans. It has seen itself as an integral ‚Äï if not the central ‚Äï player in this issue. It does not want to be reduced to being a bystander.‚Äù

China is afraid that its exclusion from international efforts to denuclearize North Korea could have broader implications down the road, Yun continued. The Chinese fear that a rapprochement between Kim and Trump could diminish China‚Äôs influence over the Korean peninsula, facilitate the unification of the peninsula and ultimately create a U.S. military ally along the Chinese border.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a far-fetched possibility, but nevertheless, it is a possibility,‚Äù said Yun.

The meeting with Kim has got Xi ‚Äúback in the game,‚Äù echoed Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

‚ÄúXi Jinping and China have really been marginalized over the last few weeks as the inter-Korean relationship has begun to improve,‚Äù Glaser noted. This week‚Äôs meeting, she believes, allowed Xi to shore up his relationship with North Korea and convey some of the outcomes China would like to see from Kim‚Äôs meeting with Trump.

Beijing And Washington‚Äôs Divided Interests

From Trump‚Äôs perspective, China‚Äôs role in addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea has, in many ways, been disappointing. The U.S. president had expressed hope that Xi would cooperate by restricting Beijing‚Äôs trade relations with Pyongyang, which has only happened to a limited degree thus far.

‚ÄúIf China is not going to solve North Korea, we will,‚Äù Trump told the Financial Times last year, after repeatedly tweeting about his frustrations over Beijing‚Äôs apparent unwillingness to help rein in the North.

Even so, Trump has continued to push China to leverage its economic influence over North Korea.

China is the North‚Äôs biggest trading partner, and has historically opposed harsh international sanctions on the isolated nation to prevent a regime collapse and consequent influx of North Korean refugees. The countries‚Äô relations have worsened in recent months, however, as China bowed to international pressure and backed tougher U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.

Experts worry that Beijing and Washington‚Äôs competing objectives and foreign policy disputes could hinder efforts to peacefully resolve tensions with North Korea, even at this critical time.

‚ÄúThe Chinese have always been fearful that [the American-North Korean relationship] could improve in a way that could be harmful to Chinese interests, or that somehow North Korea could be transformed into a partner of the United States. It sounds crazy, but I hear them say this all the time,‚Äù said Glaser.

She believes that the best possible approach to denuclearizing North Korea involves multilateral cooperation and trust, but said Kim has successfully undermined hopes of a collaborative effort by turning South Korean, Chinese and American officials against one another.BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - China warned the United States on Thursday not to open Pandora‚Äôs Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe, even as Beijing pointed to U.S. goods that it could target in a deepening Sino-U.S. trade dispute.

China could target a broad range of U.S. businesses from agriculture to aircraft, autos, semiconductors and even services if the trade conflict escalates, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Thursday.

President Donald Trump‚Äôs move last week to slap up to $60 billion in tariffs on some Chinese imports has since provoked a warning from Beijing that it could retaliate with duties of up to $3 billion of U.S. imports.

China‚Äôs biggest U.S. imports are aircraft and related equipment, soybeans and autos, with the total bill about $40 billion last year.

‚ÄúThe malicious practices of the United States are like opening Pandora‚Äôs Box, and there is a danger of triggering a chain reaction that will spread the virus of trade protectionism across the globe,‚Äù a commerce ministry spokesman said.

The official line from China continues to be stern even as Beijing says it is all for dialog and negotiations. The feedback from U.S. and Chinese officials on the nature and extent of trade talks remains mixed, media reports show.

The Financial Times reported only on Monday that China had offered to buy more U.S. micro-chips and move more quickly to finalize rules allowing foreign firms to take majority stakes in Chinese securities firms, citing people briefed on the negotiations.

Chinese customs data shows the U.S. accounted for just $2.6 billion, or 1 percent, of China‚Äôs total semiconductor imports last year by value, with suppliers in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan commanding a bigger share.

But a source in the U.S. semiconductor industry said U.S. companies have slightly more than 50 percent of China‚Äôs market for chips, though export data does not reflect that because much of the product is sent offshore for low value added processing.

The source said the U.S. semiconductor industry had not asked the Trump administration to urgeChina to buy more U.S. chips and had been told by senior U.S. officials that the U.S. government had not made such a request to Beijing.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need China to buy more chips,‚Äù the source said, adding that U.S. industry was concerned about being targeted by Chinese non-tariff barriers.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about (Chinese) subsidies, IP protection, and cyber rules,‚Äù the source said, referring to concerns over Chinese retaliation.

China has long said it would like to import more U.S. high-tech goods, including high-end chips, but has been stymied by U.S. export controls set on national security grounds.

The Trump administration is accusing Chinese firms of stealing intellectual property and forcing U.S. firms to share commercial secrets - allegations that China denies.

On Thursday, China‚Äôs State Council, or cabinet, said transfers of Chinese intellectual property rights to foreign investors will be reviewed if national security is determined to be at stake, or if core technological innovations are involved.

Government approval will also be needed for intellectual property transfers involving semiconductors, software and agriculture.

SERVICES MAY BE TARGETED

China‚Äôs commerce ministry said on Thursday the U.S. approach to trade could trigger a domino effect and U.S. trade protectionism will only hurt U.S. consumers.

While China hopes the U.S. will resolve trade conflicts with China through dialog, it will take all possible steps to protect its interests, ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a regular briefing in Beijing.

‚ÄúNegotiations must be equal, and China will not accept any consultation under unilateral coercion,‚Äù Gao said.

On Wednesday, Trump‚Äôs top trade envoy said he would give China a 60-day window before tariffs on Chinese goods take effect, but added that it would take years to bring the two countries‚Äô trading relationship ‚Äúto a good place.‚Äù

The tariff list is expected in the next several days.

The China Daily on Thursday quoted Premier Li Keqiang as telling a U.S. Congressional delegation this week that China was open to dialog but ‚Äúfully prepared with countermeasures.‚Äù

It warned that if the conflict continued to escalate ‚ÄúChina could consider taking reciprocal measures against U.S. imports of agricultural products besides soybeans, as well as aircraft, automobiles and semiconductors.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd should the Trump administration further obstruct Chinese investments in the U.S., even tougher measures such as restrictions on imports of U.S. services and similar investment reviews would likely be on the table,‚Äù it said.

Separately, Hong Kong‚Äôs South China Morning Post reported on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials had been holding talks to shield American soybeans and other agricultural products from trade sanctions.

China is still considering import curbs on U.S. soybeans, U.S. Soybean Export Council Asia director Paul Burke said on Thursday, following a meeting with the Ministry of Agriculture.‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Look Like Anything To Leigh... And Bill‚Äù is HuffPost‚Äôs weekly ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù recap in which we break down the craziest thing you might have missed. This week: Season 2, Episode 5, ‚ÄúAkane No Mai.‚Äù

Welcome to Robobaby Watch: 2018.

Ever since Season 1 of ‚ÄúWestworld,‚Äù we‚Äôve been on the lookout for hints about the possibility of robot babies (aka robotots, aka the natural offspring a nonhuman), and the latest episode, ‚ÄúAkane No Mai,‚Äù might have given us another clue.

In the midst of all the exciting action in Westworld‚Äôs samurai-themed park Shogun World ‚Äï and the fact that Maeve (Thandie Newton) tapped into the code of Westworld, gaining the ability to make other hosts kill themselves at will ‚Äï there was a little hanky-panky.

No details on the summit agenda were released, with Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon saying the two sides agreed more time was needed to sort out details although they had exchanged opinions on the agenda ‚Äúfully‚Äù on Thursday.

Cho said the summit agenda would largely address denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and improvement of inter-Korean relations but declined to elaborate further.

‚ÄúWe still have a fair number of issues to resolve on a working-level for preparations over the next month,‚Äù said Ri Son Gwon, the chairman of North Korea‚Äôs committee for the peaceful reunification of the country in closing remarks to the South Korean delegation.

‚ÄúBut if the two sides deeply understand the historic significance and meaning of this summit and give their all, we will be able to solve all problems swiftly and amicably,‚Äù Ri added.

North and South Korea have experienced a significant easing in tensions since the Winter Olympics in the South in February. They are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce.

Kim is also scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump sometime in May to discuss denuclearization, although a time and place have not been set for that summit.

Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a surprise visit to Beijing this week, his first trip outside the isolated North since he came to power in 2011.

Even more surprising was Kim‚Äôs pledge to denuclearize the Korean summit. That commitment was reported by Chinese state media, although North Korea‚Äôs official media made no mention of it, or Kim‚Äôs anticipated meeting with Trump.

The South Korean unification minister told reporters Kim‚Äôs visit to China was not discussed with North Korean officials on Thursday.

Trump and Kim had exchanged threats and insults in recent months. The U.S. leader made the equally surprising announcement earlier this month that he was prepared to meet Kim to discuss the crisis over Pyongyang‚Äôs development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the United States.

The North Korean leader‚Äôs engagement with the international community has sparked speculation that he may try to meet other leaders. Japan‚Äôs Asahi newspaper said on Thursday Japan had sounded out the North Korean government about a bilateral summit.

Japan‚Äôs Foreign Minister Taro Kono left open the possibility that Shinzo Abe might meet Kim at some point. Kono said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that Japan was closely watching preparations for the North-South Korean summit and the Trump-Kim meeting.

Chinese President Xi Jinping promised Beijing would uphold its friendship with North Korea after his meeting with Kim.

Trump wrote on Twitter he had received a message from Xi on Tuesday night that his meeting with Kim ‚Äúwent very well‚Äù and that Kim looked forward to meeting the U.S. president.Thousands took to the streets across France on Wednesday to decry the murder of an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor that authorities have linked to anti-Semitism.

The silent marches, the largest of which took place in Paris, were held in tribute to Mireille Knoll, who escaped a roundup of Jews in Paris at the height of World War II. She fled to Europe and Canada before returning to France after the end of the war, where she lived for the remainder of her life.

She was found dead in her apartment last week, and authorities said she was stabbed 11 times before her apartment was set on fire. Two men, ages 22 and 29, have been arrested and preliminarily charged with murder with anti-Semitic motives.

‚ÄúI thought I was going to die on the spot. I cried all the tears in my body and I thought of her. She didn‚Äôt deserve this,‚Äù her son, Daniel Knoll, told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ‚ÄúHow can one do that to anybody?‚Äù

French leaders quickly urged citizens to participate in marches this week to combat a growing wave of xenophobia across France. In Paris, politicians were joined by thousands of people who marched from the city‚Äôs Place de la Nation to Knoll‚Äôs apartment.

Earlier in the day Knoll‚Äôs funeral was attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, who denounced the ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù motives behind the attack.

‚Ä≥[The attackers] murdered an innocent and vulnerable woman because she was Jewish, and in doing so profaned our sacred values and our history,‚Äù Macron said.

But the evening‚Äôs silent tribute was interrupted by the appearance of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who defied the wishes of Jewish groups who had asked her not to attend.

‚ÄúAnti-Semites are over-represented in the far-left and the far-right, making those parties ones that you don‚Äôt want to be associated with,‚Äù Francis Kalifat, the director of Crif, an organization representing the country‚Äôs Jewish groups, said before the marches, according to Agence France-Presse. ‚ÄúThey should first clean out their own house,‚Äù he later said.

Le Pen and far-left leader Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, who was also asked not to attend, drew shouts of ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù ‚ÄúGo home!‚Äù and ‚ÄúNazi!‚Äù from the marchers.

‚ÄúI find the behavior here undignified toward the [grieving] family,‚Äù Le Pen said after she left the rally, according to AP. ‚ÄúHer son said he wanted everyone there, so we are here.‚ÄùYANGON (Reuters) - Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has joined the legal team representing two Reuters reporters jailed in Myanmar, who are accused of possessing secret government papers, her office said on Thursday.

A court in Yangon has been holding preliminary hearings since January to decide whether Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will be charged under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

The journalists had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in western Myanmar‚Äôs Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August, which has sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.

Lawyers for the two reporters on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the case, saying there was insufficient evidence to support charges against the pair.

‚ÄúWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are being prosecuted simply because they reported the news. I have reviewed the case file and it is clear beyond doubt that the two journalists are innocent and should be released immediately,‚Äù Amal Clooney was quoted as saying in a statement released by her office.

‚ÄúThe outcome of this case will tell us a lot about Myanmar‚Äôs commitment to the rule of law and freedom of speech,‚Äù said Clooney, who is married to actor George Clooney.

Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar‚Äôs civilian government, declined to comment.

Government officials have previously denied the arrests represent an attack on press freedom, which rights advocates say is under growing threat in the Southeast Asian country.

Myanmar‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations, Hau Do Suan, said last month that the Reuters journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of ‚Äúillegally possessing confidential government documents‚Äù.

Gail Gove, chief counsel of Reuters, said retaining Clooney would strengthen the company‚Äôs international legal expertise and broaden efforts to secure the release of the reporters.

Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in custody since their arrest on Dec. 12.

The pair have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers at a restaurant in northern Yangon by two policemen they had not met before, having been invited to meet the officers for dinner.

The district court in northern Yangon will hear arguments from prosecutors and defense lawyers on the motion to dismiss the case on April 4.
