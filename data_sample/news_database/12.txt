John Mayer dropped the video for his new song “New Light” on Thursday, and it’s pretty much the opposite of the slick, overproduced videos that most artists release.

Mayer cracked on Twitter that he made it with “with a company that usually does birthday and Bar Mitzvah videos.”

The result is an intentionally awkward mix of Mayer and cheesy stock footage including Times Square, Paris, the Egyptian pyramids and... well... stuff like this:

James Mangold, director and co-writer of “Logan,” will direct the yet-untitled film for Disney, The Hollywood Reporter noted. He will co-write it with Simon Kinberg, the screenwriter behind several “X-Men” films. Kinberg, who was a producer on “Logan,” will also be a producer of the Boba Fett film.

Disney has not yet confirmed the report and there is no information on release dates, cast or when in the “Star Wars” timeline the film will take place. A movie based on Boba Fett has been in development on and off for a number of years, with several names reportedly attached to it, including “Chronicle” director Josh Trank.

The bounty hunter played a small but key role in the original trilogy, helping Darth Vader track down the protagonists in Cloud City in “The Empire Strikes Back.” There, Han Solo was frozen in carbonite for Boba Fett to deliver to Jabba the Hutt.

Boba Fett is (apparently) killed early in “Return of the Jedi,” but his distinctive armor made him a fan favorite despite his limited screen time. The character’s backstory was touched on in “Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones” as well as “The Clone Wars” animated series. Boba Fett has been featured in various “Star Wars” books and comics, much of which is no longer considered canon.

The Hollywood Reporter also reported that a long-rumored film about Obi-Wan Kenobi was in development with Stephen Daldry, director of “Billy Elliott,” in talks to direct.

Disney is rapidly creating a new canon.WASHINGTON/SEOUL, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dangled the possibility that a June 12 summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un could still take place, just a day after he canceled the meeting citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility.”

Trump indicated the summit could be salvaged after welcoming a conciliatory statement from North Korea saying it remained open to talks.

“It was a very nice statement they put out,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see what happens - it could even be the 12th.

“We’re talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it.”

After years of tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program, Kim and Trump agreed this month to hold what would be the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The plan followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over North Korea’s development of missiles capable of reaching the United States.

Trump scrapped the meeting, planned for Singapore, in a letter to Kim on Thursday after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by U.S. officials demanding unilateral disarmament. Trump cited North Korean hostility in canceling the summit.

In Pyongyang, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea’s criticisms had been a reaction to American rhetoric and that current antagonism showed “the urgent necessity” for the summit.

He said North Korea regretted Trump’s decision to cancel and remained open to resolving issues “regardless of ways, at any time.”

Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea had appreciated Trump having made the bold decision to work toward a summit.

“We even inwardly hoped that what is called ‘Trump formula’ would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue,” he said.

DIPLOMATS AT WORK

Trump’s latest about-face sent officials scrambling in Washington. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters diplomats were “still at work” and said Trump had just sent a note out on the summit, which could be back on “if our diplomats can pull it off.”

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Katina Adams declined to give details of any diplomatic contacts but said: “As the president said in his letter to Chairman Kim, dialog between the two is the only dialog that matters. If North Korea is serious, then we look forward hearing from them at the highest levels.”

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters Trump did not want a meeting that was “just a political stunt.”

“He wants to get something that’s a long-lasting and an actual real solution. And if they are they are ready to do that then ... we’re certainly ready to have those conversations,” she said.

“If the meeting takes place on June 12, we’ll be ready, if it takes place on July 12, we will be ready.”

Sanders indicated it had yet to be decided whether White House officials would stick to a plan to travel to Singapore in coming days to prepare the summit.

North Korea had sharply criticized suggestions by Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Vice President Mike Pence that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed by NATO-backed militants after halting his nascent nuclear program.

“TRUMP FORMULA”

Trump had initially sought to placate North Korea, saying he was not pursuing the “Libya model” and Sanders said he was following “the President Trump model.”

U.S. regional allies Japan and South Korea, as well as North Korea’s main ally, China, urged the two countries to salvage the summit on Friday.

At an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said it was necessary to ensure security on the Korean peninsula, which touched on China’s core interests.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at the same forum, regretted the cancellation and said the world should keep doing its bit to make the summit happen.

South Korea also would continue efforts to improve ties with the North, the office of President Moon Jae-in said after Moon’s top security advisers met for the second time on Friday.

Some analysts worried that canceling the summit could prompt a resumption in hostilities, including renewed shorter-range missile tests or stepped-up cyber attacks by Pyongyang and increased sanctions or deployment of new military assets by Washington.

In his letter, Trump warned Kim of the United States’ greater nuclear might, reminiscent of his tweet last year asserting that he had a “much bigger” nuclear button than Kim.

While the Trump administration had insisted on North Korea’s complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear program, Pyongyang had always couched its language in terms of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

It has said in previous, failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States provided security guarantees by removing its troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.

Reuters/Kevin Lamarque

Stone has long denied any involvement with the trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails that WikiLeaks published during the 2016 campaign. He also testified before the House Intelligence Committee last year that he only “wanted confirmation” that Assange had information about Trump’s opponent.

But according to a series of emails The Wall Street Journal reviewed for its Thursday article, Stone did more than ask for confirmation. In September 2016, he apparently badgered radio personality Randy Credico to press Assange for emails related to Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal while she was secretary of state.

Credico reportedly emailed back that Stone should check the WikiLeaks website for the information he wanted, since WikiLeaks had already posted the hacked DNC emails that July. According to the Journal, Stone responded: “Why do we assume WikiLeaks has released everything they have???”

Credico reportedly wrote to Stone that the Libya information would likely be in a “batch probably coming out in the next drop,” presumably meaning in the next set of hacked emails WikiLeaks published.

“I can’t ask them favors every other day,” Credico complained, according to the Journal. “I asked one of his lawyers ... they have major legal headaches ... relax.”

Stone became so insistent that Credico told the Journal that he “got tired” of Stone “bothering” him. Credico said he didn’t even pass along Stone’s message to Assange, whom he had interviewed for his radio program, but still told Stone that he had.

Stone tweeted during the election that he had a “back channel” to Assange, which could have meant Credico. He soon deleted the tweet.

In response to the Journal’s story, Stone sent a text message claiming that Credico and WikiLeaks had “provided nothing” to him and that his testimony before the House intelligence committee was “complete and accurate.”

Investigators have scrutinized Stone for his claims that he communicated with both Assange and Guccifer 2.0, the Kremlin operative identified by U.S. officials as responsible for the DNC hack.

Stone also appeared to know about WikiLeaks’ actions in advance. The day before WikiLeaks published hacked emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Stone said Assange was going to deliver “a devastating expose of Hillary.” The emails were published the day the “Access Hollywood” tape was released of Trump boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.

Stone said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press” that he was prepared for an indictment as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with the Russian government. The Mueller team may “conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business,” Stone said. But he insisted he would not be charged with Russian collusion.NicolasMcComber via Getty Images

Protests prompted supermarket chain Publix to suspend all political contributions after it was revealed to have given more than half a million dollars to a Florida Republican who called himself a “proud NRA sellout.”

Publix was found to have given $670,000 in donations over the past three years to Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner, who is now running for governor. But in Florida, where a school shooter in Parkland killed 17 people earlier this year, many locals aren’t about to let a National Rifle Association “sellout” run their state.

On Wednesday, Parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg issued a call on Twitter for people to stage a “die in” at the grocery store, which has locations throughout the Southeast.

.@Publix is a #NRASellOut

In Parkland we will have a die in the Friday (the 25th) before memorial day weekend. Starting at 4pm for 12 min inside our 2 Publix stores. Just go an lie down starting at 4. Feel free to die in with us at as many other @Publix as possible. — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) May 23, 2018

Prior to the demonstration, Publix issued a statement expressing “regret” that its political contributions had led to an “unintentional customer divide.” On Friday, it released a new statement saying it would be suspending political contributions.

“We would never knowingly disappoint our customers or the communities we serve,” the company said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “As a result, we decided earlier this week to suspend corporate-funded political contributions as we reevaluate our giving processes.”

The same day, Hogg attended a protest at a Coral Springs Publix, where he and supporters lay on the floor for 12 minutes.

“USA over NRA!” the activists chanted at one point.

Automated tweeting played a small but potentially decisive role in Trump’s win, according to a working paper released by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research. The research suggests that bots touting Trump or attacking rival Hillary Clinton could have accounted for 3.23 percentage points of the vote for president, putting Trump over the top. Clinton won the popular vote, and a small added margin in critical districts could have put her over the top in some states and affected the Electoral College total.

The research also suggests that the bots may have handed Brexit a win by influencing just 1.76 percent of the tally.

“Our results suggest that, given narrow margins of victories in each vote, bots’ effect was likely marginal but possibly large enough to affect the outcomes,” said the paper’s authors, Yuriy Gorodnichenko from the University of California at Berkeley and Tho Pham and Oleksandr Talavera from the U.K.’s Swansea University.

U.S. security officials have said the Kremlin attempted to sway the election for Trump via social media, using bots to inflate the impact of the messages. The research was an attempt to determine a concrete effect of bots on the 2016 presidential election and Brexit vote.

The researchers amassed a database of tweets starting a month before the election. They identified human tweets vs. bots and examined how closely votes were correlated with pro-Trump Twitter activity in particular areas. They then calculated how much the accounts they defined as bots added to the volume of tweets that supported Trump.

But some experts have criticized the research, saying it doesn’t have evidence to back up the assumption that pro-Trump tweets actually influenced voters.

That’s right: they find that states that tweet more positively about Trump votes more for Trump and then assumed that this is a causal relationship from tweets to votes to say that bots increases Trump vote share by over 3%. This is absurd and reckless! (8/9) — Sean Ehrlich (@SeanDEhrlich) May 22, 2018

The working paper found that bots were most effective when they backed up a target’s prior opinion. Trump supporters, for example, tended to react to and spread messages sent by pro-Trump bots. Also, tweets with a “high degree of emotionality” reached a wider readership and were more likely to be disseminated, according to the paper. Pro-Trump tweets steadily outnumbered pro-Clinton tweets in the period examined, except for the final few days into the election, the research found.

The New York Times reported earlier this year on research showing what little effect bot tweets likely had on voters’ ballots.

In January, Twitter told Congress that 50,000 automated bot accounts linked to Russia retweeted Trump messages almost 500,000 times between September and November 2016 — nearly 10 times the number of their retweets for Clinton. Russian bots were also responsible for 200,000 retweets of WikiLeaks’ Twitter account during the same period when WikiLeaks published unflattering Democratic National Committee emails obtained by Russian hackers.

Given the effect the bots may have had on the election outcome, the working paper’s authors suggest that bot control should be considered for future elections.A mysterious bag of socks ― of an unknown degree of dampness ― has been reportedly wandering around the White House press briefing room.

Saagar Enjeti, whose Twitter handle is @esaagar, is a White House correspondent for The Daily Caller, and he tweeted an image of the socks on May 17.

The socks appeared dirty and enclosed in a plastic baggy.

Five days later, Enjeti was back in the briefing room and shared another snapshot of the socks. While the location of the socks in the room had shifted the second time around, they remained sealed what appeared to be the original bag.

UPDATE: The bag of wet socks are STILL in the White House briefing room pic.twitter.com/gPAVMhUIah — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) May 22, 2018

Enjeti’s third spotting of the socks came a full week after the first, on May 24. The formerly “wet” socks were reportedly now “crusty.”

The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the sock saga.

Social media, however, has offered all the comments about the socks:

Enjeti told HuffPost via a Twitter direct message he had “absolutely no clue” who the socks belonged to, but that he did notice them on a day when it was pouring rain ― which would likely explain the wetness.

He also told us that “nobody who sits or stands around that area” of the briefing room “has any idea either” of where the socks came from.

“I’m not at the White House today because POTUS is traveling, but I will check on them Monday and tweet an update,” said Enjeti.

AdvertisementPerhaps it’s inevitable that designated hate groups and internet comedians would go to battle ― but nobody expects a Twitter confrontation to happen on their front doorstep.

The Proud Boys is a misogynistic far-right group with members who flirt with and often fully embrace white nationalism.

Vic Berger is a comedy video editor who works for Super Deluxe. He has published a few videos outing Gavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys and co-founder of Vice Media, as a racist oaf.

Then someone showed up outside his door.

The new thing in right-wing goonery, apparently, is house calls.

As Berger tells it, the encounter was brought on by several of his videos of McInnes, one of which is embedded below. In it, McInnes throws up a Nazi salute, says “nigger” over and over and plays with his butt:

The Proud Boys, labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, apparently took offense to the tweeted videos. Days after Berger posted the one above, the self-described “Western chauvinists” went nuclear.

On May 9, a tipster sent Berger an internal document from within the Proud Boys’ network, which called on all members to find Berger’s personal information and threaten him.

“Let’s get the social media profiles, phone numbers and addresses for their bosses, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, boyfriends, friends and get to work,” it reads. “LET’S SHOW THEM THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES!!!”

Less than two weeks later, a man rang the doorbell at Berger’s house in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, the email he’d brushed off as a joke became a very real threat.

“When I answered the door, he seemed nervous, like he wasn’t expecting me. It was the middle of the day, and my wife was home,” Berger told HuffPost. “He said, ‘Are you Vic? Your videos are hurting a lot of people. You’re really hurting the Proud Boys. You need to stop making these videos.’”

Berger, now terrified, turned back and screamed for his wife to call 911. He chased the man to his car and snapped a photo of the license plate:

I was recently made aware that Gavin McInnes sent this message to his followers, The Proud Boys. Today, a Proud Boy drove to my home, rang my doorbell and threatened me and my family. All because I posted edited videos Gavin didn't like. Got his plate # and filed a police report. pic.twitter.com/dsys9Wl6ry — Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) May 22, 2018

Berger reported the encounter to the police. An officer in the town, which Berger asked that we not reveal to protect his safety and privacy, confirmed that a report was filed.

An in-person visit from the Proud Boys was revelatory. Sure, they and other hate groups online have a predilection for threats and doxing ― publishing personal information online as a form of harassment ― but this was an escalation. They were willing to physically intimidate a Twitter user they found disagreeable.

“It was scary as hell,” he said. “I thought this was all just bullshit from the internet, they’ve always harassed me online. But now they’re sending thugs.”

Meanwhile, their dear leader, McInnes, has called on the Proud Boys and other conservatives to commit violence in the past ― and Berger has documented it:

Gavin McInnes calls on the Proud Boys to commit violence. To get to a "4th degree Proud Boy," one must fight for, or be arrested "for the Proud Boy cause." pic.twitter.com/EwOHfd0BsG — Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) May 22, 2018

The man who showed up on Berger’s doorstep appears to be Kenneth Lizardo, 54, a self-proclaimed Proud Boy who lives in Massachusetts. The license plate that Berger snapped in the photo, along with various public records, led us to Lizardo, whose Facebook page is decked out in Proud Boy regalia. Berger confirmed that the guy on the right in the photo below, Lizardo, is the man who showed up at his house:

The man on the right, Kenneth Lizardo, appears to be the person who showed up on the doorstep of Vic Berger. Facebook

Lizardo responded to requests for comment via phone calls and direct messages by blocking us on social media.

The Proud Boys have distanced themselves from the incident, with some accusing Berger of making the whole thing up. But internal communications between McInnes and his followers, sent to HuffPost by a source close to McInnes on the condition that we not quote the material, show McInnes alluding to the incident and saying he thought Berger deserved it.

Berger and his cohorts don’t think this is an isolated incident involving one disgruntled Proud Boy, either. The same day Berger got word that the Proud Boys were coming after him, his friend and fellow videographer, Nathan Bernard, got a similar threat from a man who can be seen in Facebook photos with Lizardo. On Twitter, Proud Boy Vincenzo Molino wanted Bernard to know that he had his address (redacted by HuffPost):

Twitter

This is a classic intimidation tactic online. In this case, it’s intended to get Bernard and Berger to stop doing their jobs and to not call out racism and fascism when they see it. But both are worried that there’s no recourse for less prominent victims of the harassment mob.

“I happen to have a platform that allows me to make this public, but the Proud Boys are most likely targeting people who do not have a platform,” Berger said. “They should be contributing positively to society instead of targeting and threatening people at their houses and trying to silence free speech.”

Bernard likened the incident to “Pizzagate,” a conspiracy theory that started online and led to a man showing up at a Washington, D.C., restaurant and firing a gun. All you need is one person to take the online guff seriously for things to get scary.It’s been a week since the mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, and the National Rifle Association has had time to make sense of why, exactly, this happened.

It’s because of an abundance of doors. And junk food. And not believing in God.

These are the things the NRA has blamed for 10 people being killed and 13 people being injured in last week’s massacre. Not once did the gun rights group raise concerns over the shooter’s easy access to firearms ― the 17-year-old student just used his dad’s guns ― or acknowledge that school shootings are now happening with such frequency in America that kids are developing post-traumatic stress disorder.

The Texas shooting was the 16th school shooting this year. Another school shooting took place while this article was being written.

But the NRA says guns aren’t the problem. Here’s a look at all the other things the group has said are the reasons for the horrifying uptick in gun violence at schools.

A “culture of violence”

Incoming NRA president Oliver North said the solution to mass shootings at schools is to focus on the “disease,” which is not about easy access to guns.

“The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” North said on Fox News Sunday. “They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases.”

Godlessness

NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said it’s helpful to offer “thoughts and prayers” after every mass shooting because it brings God back into the discussion.

“Taking God out of our culture ... is at least partly to blame for the violence we see today,” he said on his Monday show.

Too many doors in schools

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a fierce opponent of gun control, said the Santa Fe shooting may have been caused by schools having “too many entrances” and that it may be time “to look at the design of our schools moving forward.”

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch tweeted that Patrick is “exactly right.”

Unhealthy diets

NRA board member Ted Nugent said Tuesday that kids’ unhealthy diets are making them want to shoot up their schools.

“Mark my words when the studies are finalized, you will find that Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, certainly Sandy Hook, these maniac murderers in Parkland and now Santa Fe, if you really studied the slovenliness and the zombie-like conduct of these murderers, you go back to their diet and examine what they’ve put into their sacred temple, and it’s all garbage,” Nugent said in an interview on Newsmax TV, a conservative media outlet.

“I know people think I’m trying to get away from the gun issue, but it’s not a gun issue,” he added. “It is a conduct issue.”

Ritalin

North said the combination of kids growing up in a violent culture and then taking medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is causing a spike in school shootings.

“They have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,” he said on Fox News Sunday. “If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.”

The overmedication of children

“The problems that are producing scores of isolated young disturbed children who have convinced themselves that murdering their classmates is the way to get attention will not be solved at the gun store. It is in the home,” Loesch said Tuesday on an NRATV segment titled “The Overmedication of Children Is an Epidemic.”

“It’s about the kind of people we’re raising these kids to become,” she said.

“Progressive culture”

NRATV commentator Colion Noir said loose gun laws aren’t the problem behind school shootings. It’s America’s progressive culture.

“When are we going to be completely honest and acknowledge the awkward, bullied, sexually frustrated, psychotropic drug-laced, suicidal, mass shooters in the room for what they are?” he said on a Sunday NRATV segment. “Or are we just going to keep acting like we don’t know what’s going on in the name of not confronting the miserable reality that they are a creation of our so-called progressive culture and media?”

Criticizing masculinity as toxic

In the same segment, Noir blamed school shootings on parents failing to teach their kids “how to cope with the harsh realities of life.”

“We shield them in safe spaces and give them participation trophies incentivizing mediocrity, and tell our young boys that their masculinity is toxic and our young girls that being a woman means acting like a man, further confusing the hell out of kids who are naturally going to struggle with their identity as is,” said Noir.

Mainstream media

The Trump administration is poised to hand religious conservatives another victory: a slew of new federal rules that would give religious health care providers wide latitude to refuse to treat patients or perform procedures if doing so would violate their religious beliefs.

Some of the most powerful hospital networks in the country have lobbied for these “conscience” rules, claiming they shouldn’t fear a legal risk for practicing medicine according to their religious beliefs. But those same hospital networks are already using religious justifications to place women in life-threatening situations with impunity, documents obtained by HuffPost show.

At a hospital owned by Ascension, the largest Catholic hospital network in the country and a staunch proponent of a rule that would give nearly any health care worker the right to refuse care, doctors refused to intervene as a woman was undergoing a life-threatening miscarriage because they believed that doing so would be the same as performing an abortion, the documents show. Instead, they carted her out to the hospital parking lot so a relative could drive her to a different emergency room, where she underwent a massive blood transfusion and emergency surgery.

Ascension, which operates more than 150 hospitals according to these same religious principles, also runs a hospital where doctors refused to perform a tubal ligation, even though the patient was at risk of dying if she ever became pregnant again. And at hospitals controlled by Trinity Health, a network that manages nearly 100 care centers around the Midwest, multiple women have accused doctors of withholding emergency medicine because it violated their prohibitions on certain kinds of reproductive health care.

One of the new rules, which the Trump administration proposed in January but has not finalized, would limit patients’ and advocates’ ability to protest these incidents. The rules would broaden and define the legal right of virtually any health care worker, from surgeons to nursing home attendants to receptionists, to refuse to provide or facilitate medical services that go against their personal religious beliefs or their employer’s.

The reach of the new guidelines would be widespread. The American health care system relies heavily on Catholic and other religiously affiliated hospitals. Around 1 out of every 6 hospital beds in the U.S. is located in a Catholic facility, according to a 2016 report. That means for many Americans, the closest hospital is one that might refuse to treat them.

That’s what happened on Oct. 25, 2012, when a woman arrived at St. John Hospital and Medical Center of Detroit in an ambulance. The woman was between 17 and 23 weeks pregnant — a point where an infant would not survive outside the womb — and in the midst of a miscarriage. Her condition was life-threatening and indicated that she needed an emergency termination to prevent the risk of bleeding to death, according to a complaint later filed by a medical staffer at another hospital.

“I’m not sure why you’re here. We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.” - A doctor at a Detroit hospital to a woman in need of emergency treatment, according to a filed complaint

Doctors at St. John recognized they would not be able to prevent the death of the woman’s fetus. But they refused to offer her emergency intervention.

“I’m not sure why you’re here,” a doctor at St. John told the woman, according to the complaint. “We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.”

For a hospital, failing to try to stabilize a patient in a medical emergency is a violation of federal law. St. John broke this rule, then violated regulations again when it failed to transfer the woman to another hospital, federal investigators determined. When the woman left St. John, her heart rate was elevated and she was bleeding so much that staff were constantly cleaning blood off her body, according to documents from the investigation. But instead of calling an ambulance, St. John staff gave her directions to another hospital, placed her in a wheelchair and wheeled her into the parking lot. An unidentified woman then drove her away.

“I think it was her mom or her aunt,” one staff member told an investigator. “I just saw her get into a car with a woman. Do you know if she got care at [the other hospital] and if she is OK?”

In fact, once the woman arrived at Hutzel Women’s Hospital, she had a miscarriage and underwent emergency surgery to stop a “massive hemorrhage,” according to notes from the investigation. The woman had to be hospitalized for three days.

Several weeks later, a staff member at Hutzel filed a complaint about the woman’s treatment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for “multiple episodes of poor care.” “It seems inconceivable that a major hospital with labor and delivery services lacks the ability to care for a pregnant patient who is having a miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage,” wrote the staff member, who is unidentified in the documents. “I believe that further investigation into these events is warranted to determine... why she received improper management of her life-threatening condition. She is interested in understanding also.”

In an interview with a federal investigator, a St. John staff member said, “We are a Catholic institution and we do not perform abortions here if there are fetal heart tones.” All of Ascension’s hospitals adhere to a set of ethical guidelines written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that bans abortion services or “material cooperation” in an abortion. The guidelines do allow doctors to perform certain procedures as long as the primary goal is not to terminate the pregnancy but to save the life of the mother. But in practice, many Catholic hospitals place a blanket ban on any procedure they consider an abortion.

Ascension is not the only Catholic health care system pressing the Trump administration to protect it from consequences for risking patients’ lives. Trinity Health, which has lobbied the Trump administration to dismantle an Affordable Care Act rule prohibiting gender discrimination, owns and operates several hospitals that have been accused of violating federal laws requiring hospitals to provide patients with basic care. One woman accused a Trinity hospital of refusing to remove her intrauterine device, which had been dislodged when she fell down, causing her weeks of pain.

Mercy Health Partners in Michigan, which Trinity owns, risked the lives of five women who were having dangerous miscarriages by failing to offer a kind of medical intervention the hospital considered to be abortion, a whistleblower told federal authorities. All of the women suffered potentially fatal infections for which the typical treatment is to hasten the miscarriage. The whistleblower later reported three more cases where medical records suggested the hospital withheld certain treatment options because of its Catholic affiliation, according to federal records obtained by HuffPost.

A spokesperson for Mercy Health Partners declined to comment. Ascension did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Religiously affiliated hospitals already rarely face consequences for refusing to provide treatments. Under former President Barack Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services made a brief and perfunctory threat to suspend St. John’s right to participate in Medicare, but dropped it once St. John took “corrective action.” Trinity Health did not receive any major citations for breaking any laws after federal investigators received the complaints about Mercy. And courts have dismissed a string of lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for refusing reproductive health care.Bloomberg via Getty Images

President Donald Trump on Friday signed a series of executive orders that could make it easier to fire federal government employees, potentially undermining the unions that represent them.

The three executive orders Trump issued would reduce the timeframe for firing poor performers, curtail the amount of paid time federal employees can receive for union work and direct agencies to negotiate more restrictive union contracts in a timely fashion.

By signing the orders, the president was “fulfilling his promise to promote a more efficient government by reforming civil service rules,” Andrew Bremberg, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said in a call with reporters.

“Every year, the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey shows that less than one third of federal employees believe poor performers are adequately addressed by their agency,” Bremberg said, according to Government Executive. “These executive orders make it easier to remove poor performing employees, and ensure that taxpayer dollars are more efficiently used.”

Unions representing federal workers denounced the orders on Friday, calling Trump’s actions an “assault on democracy.”

J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement that the orders constituted “a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed to the 2 million public-sector employees across the country who work for the federal government.”

“This is more than union busting – it’s democracy busting,” Cox said.

Several Democratic lawmakers also criticized the orders on Friday.

“Attacking unions and demagoguing federal workers won’t help morale,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) tweeted.

Trump continues his assault on the federal workforce with today's executive orders. Attacking unions and demagoguing federal workers won't help morale. Show the federal workforce that serves all Americans the respect it deserves, Mr President. — Gerry Connolly (@GerryConnolly) May 25, 2018

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called the president’s actions “a cheap political stunt.”

The U.S. Justice Department this month is expected to approve a merger of two huge corporations ― St. Louis-based seed company Monsanto and German crop-chemical conglomerate Bayer ― and the consequences could be enormous.

The $66 billion deal, already approved by the European Union, will create the world’s biggest pesticides and seeds monopoly. The hookup will confine 61 percent of global seeds and pesticides production in the hands of just three megacorporations ― the other two being newly merged DowDuPont, and ChemChina, which acquired pesticides and seed company Syngenta last year.

Is that a problem?

It depends who you ask. Monsanto and Bayer are pitching their consolidation as a way to develop the technology and innovation necessary to feed a world that in two decades is likely to be home to 10 billion people. For critics ― environmentalists and many farmers ― it’s a terrifying step toward a near-monopoly in agriculture, giving giant companies unprecedented access to farmer data, squeezing out small farmers, and potentially raising food prices for consumers.

Monsanto is already a bogeyman for environmentalists because of its genetically modified seeds ― which critics say promote monocultures, trapping farmers into a cycle of dependence as well as an increased reliance on chemicals ― along with its history of producing controversial chemicals such as Agent Orange and the weedkiller glyphosate.

Many conservationists fear the merger continues a trend of concentrating huge power over the global food supply in just a handful of corporate giants.

“We will witness in our lifetimes the total disappearance of biodiversity from our farms, the disappearance of small farmers, and the end of real food and our food freedom,” Vandana Shiva, the veteran seeds campaigner, has previously warned.

Evgeniy Kozarenko, CEO of the Dublin-based organic seed treatment company Nagritech, is worried. The U.S. and the European Union “just approved the creation of a monster,” he told HuffPost. “Together, these two companies will influence farmers’ opinions and markets all over the world on a scale we’ve never seen before. We do not have the budgets to market our organic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. Other organic manufacturers also will not be able to compete.”

These fears are amplified by a growing concern that farming is on the cusp of a digital revolution that could allow the agribusiness to exert unprecedented control over farmers. Friends of the Earth Europe and several nongovernmental organizations have accused the EU of allowing a “Facebook of farming” to be created. Companies would be able to access farmers’ data to sell them seeds and pesticides.

“It’s not difficult to imagine a smartphone ad arriving within seconds of a farmer encountering weed or insect damage while he’s harvesting his crop,” the Missouri Farm Bureau Federation has said.

Monsanto itself has hinted that data is a key reason for seeking the merger with Bayer. “There is no new dirt,” Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant told Fortune. “We need to get much smarter societally about how we farm.”

The seed company has already invested heavily in the digital economy, shelling out nearly $1 billion in 2013 to buy the Climate Corp., a data company that provides farmers with weather data and predictions. The technology was reportedly being used on more than one-third of all U.S. farmland in 2014.

Monsanto’s “farm-to-fork” data platform, Climate Fieldview, which the company promotes as a “key 2018 growth driver,” uses tractors fitted with sensors and GPS, algorithms, and data drones to monitor field conditions and advise farmers in real time.

“The merger will create the biggest platform of its kind ― and give Bayer-Monsanto a ‘first mover’ advantage similar to Facebook, in the way that it affects competitors,” said Mute Schimpf, a spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth Europe. “The new platform allows Bayer-Monsanto to control how, where, when, and by whom food is produced. As Facebook’s algorithms decide which newsfeeds we see, so ‘Baysanto’ will decide which pesticides are used, and which seeds are planted.”

Friends of the Earth was one of more than 70 environmental organizations that signed a letter to the European Commission arguing that “Bayer-Monsanto would become the biggest player in the field of data platforms and data collection, exposing farmers to risks and problems similar to those seen in existing data platforms such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.”

Monsanto, however, says it’s the farmers who will benefit from the deal. “Now more than ever, farmers need access to tools that support the decisions they make to maximize their return on every acre,” said Brian Carroll, a company spokesman. He added that this kind of data helps farmers farm more sustainably and manage their risks.

Other Monsanto officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of company restrictions on discussing the issue, told HuffPost that farmers were “a pretty cynical bunch” and would reject any platform they see as too self-serving.

But not everyone is convinced. More than 1 million people last year petitioned the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, to block the deal, which polls showed was deeply unpopular.

In the U.S., groups representing farmers and conservation organizations wrote to the Justice Department predicting negative impacts on competition, farmers and consumers. They argued that the combination of seed and digital businesses would allow huge corporations to “create proprietary platforms that are closed to competition.”

Monsanto officials are cagey about the need for new laws. “The worry would be if regulation drives paranoia,” one company official said. “If the debate ended in a situation where farmers were scared about sharing their data, it would undermine a huge opportunity for, ultimately, more sustainable farming practices.”

Opportunities remain, though, for price discrimination and the use of data platforms to sell seeds, pesticides and fertilizers ― all of which, for now, is unregulated.

The Missouri Farm Bureau Federation says it’s in ongoing negotiations with agroindustry representatives about who owns data collected by digital apps such as Climate Fieldview.

“Two major concerns we have are: How is this going to affect the prices of products, and how is it going to affect the availability of products,” Spencer Tuma, the federation’s legislative affairs director, told HuffPost. She added that the group was worried about potential impacts on farmers, ranchers and ultimately consumers in the form of higher food prices.

“We think there is a responsibility for Congress to review some of the existing statutes governing whether those sorts of mergers have the ability to go through,” Tuma said.

Congress has the power to revise or rewrite existing merger laws. In July, 19 senators set out their concerns about the merger to the Justice Department’s antitrust division, so congressional action cannot be ruled out.

Carroll, though, was sanguine. “Bayer’s acquisition by Monsanto has undergone a lengthy and robust regulatory review process by the relevant competition authorities,” he said.

U.S. environmentalists are demanding that Monsanto sell Climate Fieldview as a condition of the deal. That leaves the fate of the world’s agricultural data ― who owns it, and how it is used ― undecided.Harvey Weinstein arrives at the New York Police Department's 1st Precinct to turn himself in on May 25, 2018. Spencer Platt via Getty Images

The best way to watch Harvey Weinstein walk himself into a Manhattan police precinct on Friday morning was via NBC News’ Periscope.

As the former Oscar-winning Hollywood producer and “king of indie film” marched from his black car into the police station, NBC correspondent Craig Melvin began naming some of the 95 women who have come forward with allegations against Weinstein ― Lucia Evans, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong’o, Uma Thurman, Salma Hayek. Reaction icons started floating up the right side of the screen, little hearts of different colors, one after another after another, until they formed a cloud of “likes.”

We, the people of the internet, were engaging in a collective act of schadenfreude, and it was delicious.

Women are so often told to contain our anger, to make it more palatable, less “aggressive,” small enough to contain within the male prerogative. But I’m angry at men like Harvey Weinstein, and there’s nothing palatable about it.

The man who beckoned young women to his hotel rooms for the sole purpose of using them, who hired ex-Mossad agents to track anyone liable to expose him, who had vast resources at his fingertips and used them liberally to try to silence the dozens of women he (allegedly) victimized ― even that man is no longer untouchable.

“One phone call and you’re done.”



“I have eyes and ears everywhere.”



“I’m Harvey Weinstein, you know what I can do.”



Not anymore. https://t.co/j3x8njJZWJ — jodikantor (@jodikantor) May 24, 2018

That man had to walk past reporters as he entered a police station, submitting to the cheap cop pornography of the perp walk. That man looked haggard and tilted his head low to avoid eyes and questions. That man also carried two books with him into the police station, biographies of Big Men in Show Biz — Elia Kazan, and Rodgers and Hammerstein — because he is, after all, exactly the kind of prick who fancies himself both a legend and a victim of a pious mob. That man was charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.

It is still shocking to see powerful men face criminal charges for harming women, and even more shocking to see them convicted. And the process leading up to that ― the public offerings of private pain (hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers …), the scrutiny of that pain, the way it’s picked apart and held up to the light and valued according to how neatly it can be added to a pile of other women’s pain ― is not a pretty one. The rapid rise of the Me Too movement has been exhilarating to witness but also exhausting.

There are few moments of relief when an eternity of systemic abuse is being unpacked and processed. When those moments do present themselves, your instinct is to seize them like a prize. Weinstein is the man behind some of the most recognizable films of my lifetime, but surely the footage many of us will most remember him for is Friday’s walk. A big man in a blue sweater, displayed like any other perp for our delectation, tokens of self-pity and self-regard in the crook of his arm.

As Rose McGowan tweeted Friday morning: “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.”One day, you look in your cabinets and there's no tupperware. The next day, somehow, tupperware is so plentiful, it falls out when you open the cabinet door. And you realize you have too much tupperware and you don't know where they came from.



Adulthood: a poemCan you believe?

Bobby Berk, the interior design expert from Netflix’s “Queer Eye,” recently stopped by the AOL.com office to makeover my desk on behalf of Chase Ultimate Rewards ― and being the “hero” for a day was everything I’d hoped it would be and more.

Before Bobby showed up to clean up my work space, my desk at our New York office was simply overloaded with stuff. As an editor of the site, I get sent a lot of books and alcohol and other random knick-knacks and, because I live in New York and don’t have very much space in my apartment, I keep a lot of it at work ― that is, until Bobby gave his two cents.

As he showed on the incredible first season of “Queer Eye,” Bobby has a natural eye for design and what works best for a space ― regardless of how big it is. When he was done with my desk, it was simplified, sleek, decluttered and just overall more pleasant to work in.

More from AOL.com:How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.

Any reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.A trio of older gay men offer their collective take on terms and expressions used by younger members of the queer community for a hilarious new video.

The clip ― released Tuesday by Grindr’s online lifestyle magazine, INTO ― finds the men sounding off on popular slang phrases like “werk,” “extra” and, of course, “yas kween.”

As the video progresses, the men offer off-the-cuff observations, as well as bits of sage advice, to their younger counterparts.

“You guys are watching too much RuPaul,” one quips in the clip, which had been viewed over 114,000 times as of Friday afternoon. Adds another, “This is the kind of thing the Kardashians would sit around and do all afternoon.”By Chris Riotta

John Peery self-identifies as a few things: he’s a straight white male, an actor who goes by the stage name “John Pizza” and, perhaps most importantly, a “RuPaul’s Drag Race” super fan. He and his girlfriend, Candace Thompson, watch the show at viewing parties hosted by Syndicated, their local watering hole in Brooklyn, each week.

“Porkchop is a hometown hero,” he told me at the bar, recalling one of the most famous drag queens from the show’s first season, who hails from Peery’s hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina. “If they were playing the hockey game when we walked in at 7:30, I can guarantee you we wouldn’t still be standing here right now.”

In its tenth season, the reality TV show in which drag queens compete to win $100,000 appears to be going mainstream. After moving from the Logo network to VH1 last year, when it broke viewership records and quickly became the highest-rated original program in its competitive time slot, the show has grown from having a cult-like following into a full-blown pop culture phenomenon, with viewers from all walks of life becoming invested in the queens and their personal journeys.

“Even if some people aren’t here to watch the show, they’re still catching and picking up things about a world they once knew nothing about,” Thompson, who identifies as queer, added. “The language, the culture…it’s making important progress.”

Syndicated is just one of countless venues across New York City and the rest of the country that’s beginning to take notice of “Drag Race.” Gay bars, however, have been hosting weekly viewing parties for years, where guests drink RuPaul-themed cocktails and watch the drama unfold on projector screens, often followed by raucous, live drag shows.

Now, bars and clubs that don’t cater exclusively to the LGBT community have started organizing similar weekly events, inviting straight fans to watch the competition side-by-side with the folks whose art form is responsible for the show’s commercial success.

“Drag Race” viewing parties at non-LGBTQ venues provide an educational opportunity for mainstream society to learn more about queer culture, according to Ariel Italic, a drag queen and member of the nightlife entertainment trio, The Nobodies. Each week, Ariel spends three hours applying makeup and preparing for her hosting gig at Brooklyn Bazaar, where she said a “decidedly mixed crowd” seeks out an immersive experience while watching the show.

“I think for a straight audience who is trying to figure the show out, having queer fans around can be a good way to get insight into how to interpret what’s happening on the screen,” Ariel told me. “Like, rather than having to ask questions, you can watch where everyone else is laughing or booing or cheering, and you can hear what sort of slang from the show they use in casual conversation and what doesn’t make it from the show into the real world. It gives context.”

Fans pour into the Brooklyn Bazaar’s vintage grand ballroom just before “Drag Race” begins at 8:00 p.m., finding their place among a sea of blue and green lawn chairs under fringed chandeliers, with glasses of red wine and draft beer in hand.

Ariel and The Nobodies remain busy throughout the entire night, conducting a game of bingo that correlates with the ongoing episode, cracking jokes and performing lip syncs during the commercial breaks. Straight couples and groups of straight friends often wander into the parties “to see what all the fuss is about,” Ariel said.

“Drag is a way to push people to look at the walls they’ve put up around different parts of gender or sexuality or beauty or whatever else,” she continued. “I hope that as more people get used to drag as a light-hearted, comedic medium full of sparkles and death drops, it can pave a way to the appreciation of the more intellectual and political aspects of drag. There’s a lot of smarts behind the spectacle.”

Mainstream pop culture isn’t the only thing to potentially benefit from the show’s continued prominence. Jee Song, director of events at the Museum of Sex in Manhattan, says ticket sales have been “steadily climbing” since the venue first decided to begin hosting viewing parties last year, describing the success of the weekly event as a “pleasant surprise.”

The Museum of Sex offers a “Drag Race” viewing experience in a club-like atmosphere. A DJ plays top 40 music during commercials as drag queens, fans and party-goers socialize over RuPaul-themed Smirnoff cocktails. When the show returns from a commercial break, everyone temporarily shuts the party down and immediately turns their attention to RuPaul.

Like most other viewing parties, the setting isn’t the typical cliche one thinks of when hearing the term “safe space,” since there isn’t much political correctness about “Drag Race” or the comedy employed by many queens in each episode. Still, the environment is one which allows for wide-ranging conversations to take place, and for straight people to ask questions to LGBT viewers about queer culture — so long as those questions “come from a place of genuine interest,” as Ariel Italic stressed. Song said the museum wanted to create an event surrounding “Drag Race” promoting “positive interactions” between the show’s fans of varying backgrounds and sexual orientations.

“We wanted to create a community where there is no judgement,” Song said about the museum’s decision to host “Drag Race” viewing parties. “It’s like magic: everyone enjoys it ... It seems to be this key to opening up a lot of different doors, and having it all come together in a melting-pot kind of way.”

“‘Drag Race’ taps into the psyche that life can be fun, it can be joyous, and it can be celebrated, no matter who you are,” she added.A 70-pound octopus named Fred not only has eight arms, but possibly nine lives.

Last week, a fish market in Morro Bay, California saved Fred from being served up for someone’s supper,

Giovanni DeGarimore, owner of Giovanni’s Fish Market, makes his living selling fish and other forms of seafood. But he recently decided against selling octopus products after learning about how intelligent the animals are.

DeGarimore told the San Luis Obispo Tribune he met a friendly octopus while diving in Fiji.

“Essentially, we played a game of hide-and-seek for 15 minutes under the ocean,” he said.

On May 14, DeGarimore’s dock manager told him a local crab fisherman was selling a 70-pound octopus, putting DeGarimore in an awkward position. He said he no longer wanted to financially reward those who capture octopuses, but also didn’t want to cut up such “a beautiful animal.”

So DeGarimore bit the bullet and purchased the octopus for what he says was a couple of hundred dollars.

The octopus was named Fred and spent a few days at the fish market before being released in a safe place.

A spokesperson for the fish market told local news station KSBW TV that the decision to spare the Fred’s life was personal for DeGarimore.

“He’s an avid diver and lover of the ocean, and though Gio makes his livelihood on selling seafood, he felt conflicted when it came to these magnificent and arguably sentient beings,” the spokesperson said.

Comparative psychologist and octopus expert Jennifer Mather spoke to Scientific American at length about octopus intelligence in 2009.

“I would say intelligence means learning information and using the information that you’ve learned,” she said, explaining that this is an ability researchers have observed in octopuses.

She added that octopuses engage in play and have distinct personalities. The complex environment of tropical reefs likely helped spur their intelligence, according to Mather.
