History catches up to the “weasels and liars” in American politics, Comey continued, noting that not many schools or streets are named for former Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), who led the notorious 1950s probe of suspected communists he believed had infiltrated the U.S. government during the Cold War.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) made the same comparison between Nunes and McCarthy earlier on Thursday.

“The release of this memo is really reminiscent of the darkest days of the McCarthy era, with character assassinations,” he said on CNN, arguing that the release distracts from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mueller took over the investigation after Trump’s controversial firing of Comey.

Other FBI officials have also come out in strong support of the FBI’s hard line on the memo.

“We are at a very weird stage of our democracy,” former FBI counterterrorism special agent Ali Soufan told The Daily Beast on Thursday. “It’s not just about the FBI. It’s about loyalty to the president, or loyalty to the Constitution. We are at a crossroads. We need to fight back. It’s probably the most important fight in modern American history.”

This story has been updated with more information about the FBI’s statement on Wednesday.Black celebrities are calling for the removal of Confederate statues in favor of replacing them with monuments that honor black heroes and icons in Mic’s latest project.

Confederate monuments have long embodied America’s infatuation with its racist past. Though there have been many petitions and protests throughout the years, demanding the removal of these monuments, the Black Monuments Project “aims to correct this sordid legacy through a blend of history and imagination.”

“It repurposes our nation’s Confederate-centric memory of the Civil War as a chance to celebrate black heroes, well and lesser known, instead of the white supremacists who would see them locked in chains,” wrote Mic reporter Zak Cheney-Rice in the project’s mission.

After a year dominated by talk of Confederate monuments, Mic imagines a country where black monuments bloom in every state. @kerrywashington, @Usher, @Common, @YaraShahidi and more share our nominees. #BlackMonuments pic.twitter.com/kuBBmXS7TD — Mic (@mic) February 1, 2018

A video accompanies the project, in which celebs, activists and politicians call for us to honor figures like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), musician Prince and Virginia resident Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells were the source of one of the most important cell lines for medical research.

″We need a monument in South Carolina for the Charleston Nine,” said “Orange Is the New Black” actress Danielle Brooks. “It is the collective name given to the nine souls that were brutally murdered in Charleston, South Carolina.”

Launched on the first day of Black History Month, the project’s website features an interactive map, highlighting icons for each state and territory in the U.S. along with accompanying biographies. Octavia Butler, a pioneer in the world of black science fiction, represents California. While Marsha P. Johnson, a trans activist integral in the beginnings of the Stonewall Riot, reps New Jersey. Bayard Rustin, a leader for both civil rights and gay rights, stands in for Pennsylvania.

Some biographies include 3-D Snapchat lenses, filters that allow users to snap a picture with an imagined statue of a black hero.

This is the latest campaign echoing calls for the removal of Confederate monuments, which many see as symbols of America’s unwillingness to formally apologize for chattel slavery.

In August 2017, a mob of white supremacists and other extremists protested through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, demanding the city preserve the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The ensuing conflict left many anti-racist activists injured and 1 person dead.

President Donald Trump downplayed the danger posed by white supremacists, claiming there were “very fine people on both sides” of the protests.

What happened in Charlottesville is part of a much longer history of romanticizing Lee and the Confederacy. Although Lee was a Confederate solider known for how he tormented his slaves, his image has been whitewashed, perpetuating the myth of a virtuous Confederate South.

These are the narratives the Black Monuments Project hopes to reverse.“This Is Us” fans are a famously passionate bunch, but Justin Hartley says one majorly crossed the line.

The actor recounted a troubling experience with a woman who approached him when he was out with friends at a Chicago restaurant. Hartley claims he was sexually harassed by the fan in question.

“This woman — who I don’t know, a stranger to me — recognized me and started screaming, going crazy,” he told Good Housekeeping. “She ran over and started kissing me.”

Hartley immediately rebuffed the woman’s alleged advances and asked her to respect his personal space.

“You do not walk up to people that you do not know and put your mouth on their face. If I did that to you, I would be in prison,” he said. “Please do not do that. And not that I’m trying to teach you life lessons, but I feel like this is a really good one for you. Don’t do that to anybody ever again.”

The “Smallville” alum said the woman did not exactly get the message and returned to his table after the alleged encounter to ask for a photo with the actor. Unsurprisingly, he flat-out denied her request.

“I’m not taking photos with you after you sexually harassed me,” the actor said he told her.

The ordeal didn’t exactly end well, with the woman allegedly calling Hartley “something more foul” than “jerk” before she left the group alone for good.

Hartley, meanwhile, is getting ready to return to the set of “This Is Us” and reconnect with fellow cast members before the ratings powerhouse returns on NBC this fall.On Monday, Chile made an announcement of gargantuan proportions: It was establishing five new national parks and expanding three others, adding 10 million acres – an area almost as large as Switzerland – to its protected area system.

In what has been described as the largest public-private national park donation in history, Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, the former head of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia, donated a million of the acres.

“Chile is still a developing country, with a large history of development and resource exploitation — in most cases overexploitation,” said Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in a statement. “If Chile can take this gigantic environmental measure, there are few reasons why developed nations cannot act as well.”

Conservationists view protected areas as a vital tool to protect species from extinction, safeguard ecosystems, provide environmental resilience in a rapidly warming world, and in some cases protect indigenous people. While the new parks in Chile will certainly benefit ecosystems and wildlife ­– such as pumas and llama-like guanacos – could it hurt the developing country’s economy?

On the face of it, large protected areas would seem to decrease economic output as they essentially lock away natural resources from exploitation. However, recent research has shown that not only can protected areas be good for national economies, they can also boost local economies and mitigate poverty – if managed well.

“These parks are really putting Chile on the map, in the broader eco-tourism sense,” William Laurance, an ecologist with James Cook University who has studied protected areas, said. “They’re all fully open to the broader public, and they’re being integrated with rewilding programs — to bring back or reintroduce charismatic species such as pumas.”

International tourism to Chile has been steadily increasing over the last decade. In 2016, the country saw 5.6 million tourists – a 400 percent rise since 2002 – and many of these travelers were likely drawn to the country’s renowned wilderness areas, including snow-capped mountains, unruly rivers, vast plains and magnificent wildlife.

“For every dollar you invest in national parks, you get 10 back; it’s more profitable than copper,” Hernán Mladinic, the executive director of Chile’s Fundación Pumalín, told The Guardian last year.

But protected areas can also have a less obvious effect on the local economy in developing countries: They can spur poverty alleviation.

“Research from around the globe suggests that parks can successfully balance conservation and development and are one of the most important mechanisms for permanent protection of natural resources,” said Katharine Sims, an economics and environmental professor at Amherst College.

Sims’ research has compared local communities living next to protected areas in both Thailand and Costa Rica with similar communities living far from parks. What she found surprised even her and bucked conventional wisdom: Poverty levels were lower for the people living near parks. Her research shows that economic benefits from the park – tourism, increased infrastructure and the overspill of ecosystem services – outweighed the restriction placed on exploiting natural resources.

Her findings have since been boosted by similar studies in Uganda, Indonesia, Bolivia and Nepal.

Still, Sims stresses that management matters. Parks with multiple zoning are the best for local economies in developing countries, she said.

“We found that Biosphere Reserves [protected areas nominated and controlled by national governments] were most successful. These parks included a mix of strictly protected core areas to protect wildlife and buffer areas to support multiple uses including tourism, recreation and sustainable resource extraction,” Sims said of recent research in Mexico.

Another subtle but still enormous economic benefit to protected areas concerns ecosystem services, the catch-all term for the multiple benefits nature provides such as pollination, carbon sequestration, clean water, erosion mitigation, fish nurseries and more.

For example, the Czech Republic’s 25 large protected areas provided €51 billion ($63 billion) every year ― more than a quarter of the country’s GDP ― as a result of ecosystem services, according to a recent paper put out by the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

“These estimates can emphasize the social importance of protected areas and nature in general, in other language than basic conservation goals,” said Jan Daněk, lead author of the study.

Such values are not incorporated into the traditional economy, but nonetheless underpin economic processes.

And some benefits of nature are “impossible” to put a dollar sign on, said Daněk, who pointed to the spiritual benefits provided by parks.

Buoyed by the evidence that parks not only protect nature, but also provide multiple economic benefits, conservationists have called for more protected areas worldwide. Currently, the Aichi Biodiversity Goals – international targets to halt the destruction of species’ habitats – have set a goal of protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of the oceans by 2020.

But preeminent biologist E.O. Wilson has a far more radical idea: the Half Earth Project. Wilson argues that half the planet – on land and in sea – such be set aside as protected areas to save life on Earth – including humanity.

Around the world, many countries have increased their protected area coverage. China, which has long had a system of cultural and small nature parks, has announced it will open its first formal national park in 2020. Papua New Guinea, which has few parks, recently established a conservation area that’s nearly the size of Rhode Island. And nations like Costa Rica and Bhutan have become renowned for their efforts to protect ecosystems – and been rewarded by tourism and relatively intact ecosystems.

But other parts of the world have seen movements to reduce protected areas, particularly to allow mining, logging and other extractive industries.

In the United States, which invented the concept of a national park, the Trump administration is taking a hatchet to many of the country’s newest protected areas, including controversial shrinkages of Bears Ears Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, enraging environmentalists and Native American activists who consider portions of these parks sacred. Even where protections stand, the administration is pursuing new rules that would allow protected areas to be opened up to drilling and logging.

To achieve anything close to the protection envisioned by Wilson’s Half Earth Project, or even less ambitious goals of the Aichi Biodiversity Goals, creative partnerships and funding – such as what happened in Chile – would need to become more commonplace.

“[It’s] a very good example of how to use philanthropic assistance to good effect – to have broad national benefits,” Laurance said, referring to the partnership between the Chilean government and Kristine McDivitt Tompkins. “This requires a level of self-confidence and open-mindedness that isn’t evident in some nations.”

For decades, Tompkins and her late husband Doug faced criticism from many in Chile about the intentions they had for their vast land holdings. But this week’s agreement shows that many in the country have come to embrace their vision of marking off land for national protection.

And Tompkins says she’s not done yet.

“While we will continue to help promote and safeguard these parks, we are beginning to turn our attention to more new conservation and rewilding projects in Chile and Argentina as we work to save and restore big, wild and connected ecosystems.”

If you’d like to contribute a post to the editorial series, send an email to thisnewworld@huffpost.comWASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump may have found his 100th problem.

Not long after the president got into a Twitter spat with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z about the black unemployment rate, that number has jumped from an all-time recorded low of 6.8 percent in December to 7.7 percent in January, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday.

December was the first time that black unemployment had fallen below 7 percent since the agency started tracking the data in 1972.

Trump repeatedly took credit for the decline, including during his first State of the Union address earlier this week. “And something I’m very proud of, African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded,” said Trump to major applause. Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) gave the line a standing ovation.

The White House has not revealed which of the administration’s policies Trump believes aided in the decline. Additionally, many political observers attributed the drop in large part to President Barack Obama’s administration, during which black unemployment was more than cut in half.

We probably shouldn’t make too much of Friday’s number anyway, said Valerie Wilson, the director of the program on race, ethnicity and the economy at the Economic Policy Institute. It’s difficult to attribute often-fickle economic numbers to the policies of one president and one administration. And unemployment rates can be even more volatile when looking at individual demographic groups since the sample size is smaller.Lin-Manuel Miranda used his playwright skills to give his second child a warm and special welcome into this world.

The “Hamilton” creator shared the happy news via Twitter on Friday, using a theater script format to describe the scene:

The couple already has a 3-year-old son named Sebastian.

Miranda confirmed he and Nadal were expecting a second child in December.

The page was the main hub for the group that threatened to attack the “Black Panther” Rotten Tomatoes score. Representatives for Facebook did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

PREVIOUSLY:

Although early reactions to the new Marvel movie “Black Panther” have been almost universally stellar, there are some critics who not only disliked the film ― they’re looking to sabotage it.

And now the rightful king of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler, is responding.

A Facebook group called Down With Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys, whose moderator describes himself as “alt-right,” recently announced its plans to intentionally tank “Black Panther’s” Rotten Tomatoes score once the movie starts showings on Feb. 15.

Last year, the same group claimed to use bots to take down the score for “The Last Jedi,” which is now around 48 percent despite a critics’ score above 90.

On Thursday, we asked Coogler for his thoughts on the group’s threat against “Black Panther.” The director hadn’t heard about Down With Disney, but he didn’t seem fazed when we explained it.

“For me, I’m looking forward to everybody seeing the film,” Coogler said. “I’m really looking forward to sharing the film with audiences regardless of what their political views are … that’s kind of where I [stand on that].”

Asked about his thoughts on Rotten Tomatoes ratings in general, Coogler said, “It ... can be an oversimplification of what critics are saying about a movie. It’s quicker to look at the consensus than it is to read the articles. But I’m a person who definitely respects film criticism and draws on it in the filmmaking process.”

HuffPost previously messaged the self-identified alt-right moderator of Down With Disney, who told us his chief complaints with “The Last Jedi” revolved around its “feminist agenda.” He claimed Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is a “victim of the anti-mansplaining movement” and that Poe and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) are in danger of being “turn[ed]” gay.

Following its proclaimed “success” in its campaign against “The Last Jedi” ― and “the sudden rise in those disgruntled with Disney business practices” ― Down With Disney created a Facebook event explaining its qualms with “Black Panther.” They include “corporate manipulations which created falsified bad press for the DCEU (DC Extended Universe)” among its reasons.

“It’s time to strike back at all those under Disney and bring down the house of mouse’s actions for paying off the critics that hurt DC Comics on film and for other parties affected by them,” states the description of the event.

The moderator also said that he will be making similar events for “Infinity War” and unspecified Netflix shows to “rally together to truly make a difference.”

“If you want to spread spoilers to Marvel fanboys, use this event as a platform to inform us of targets!”

At the time of this post, 3,700 people were attending the Down With Disney “Black Panther” event and 1,900 more were interested. However, the group appears to have run into some problems, because a link to the event now goes to an error page.

Representatives of Rotten Tomatoes previously denounced the page’s claims that bots attacked “The Last Jedi” score, telling us, “There’s nothing unusual in the behavior” of reviewers. “The only thing that we’re seeing is people are really passionate and they’re taking time to actually post reviews.”

Down With Disney maintains that the negative reviews are a result of bots it deployed.

Rotten Tomatoes also recently gave a statement to The Wrap condemning hate speech and promising to block those participating in it:

We at Rotten Tomatoes are proud to have become a platform for passionate fans to debate and discuss entertainment and we take that responsibility seriously. While we respect our fans’ diverse opinions, we do not condone hate speech. Our team of security, network and social experts continue to closely monitor our platforms and any users who engage in such activities will be blocked from our site and their comments removed as quickly as possible.

It remains to be seen what effect, if any, there will be on the “Black Panther” audience score. Regardless, if early reviews are to be believed, audiences are still going to leave saying, “Wakanda forever!”

AdvertisementIt all started with a hypothetical question for commentator Jessica Tarlov, who was also a guest on the show.

“Let’s say Donald Trump produces a memo that says Hillary Clinton had hookers in her room in a Ritz hotel in Moscow urinating on her bed,” Hannity said. “Now, if that was in there and it was not true ―and then it ends up being the basis in part for a FISA warrant against her used by Trump ― you’d be pretty pissed off and the media would be apoplectic tonight, true or false?”

“Absolutely true,” said Tarlov. “By the way, this is the only show that I’ve ever been able to talk about the pee tape on so that makes me really happy.”

Then, it got weird.

“And you know it’s not true because if someone pees in the bed, where are you going to sleep?” interjected Watters. “Where are you going to sleep?”

There was a brief moment of stunned silence. Check out Tarlov’s reaction:

“I don’t think he’s having a sleepover with them,” Tarlov said.

“It’s obviously not true, that doesn’t make any sense,” Watters persisted.

“I think it’s transactional,” said Tarlov. “I don’t think it’s a cuddlefest.”

In a funny clip on Thursday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” several passersby were shown a sign that read “LII,” as in Sunday’s Super Bowl LII, and most had no idea it meant 52. That reinforced the talk-show host’s contention that many people, like him, aren’t so good with Roman numerals.

Our favorite was the guy who guessed that the L stood for love, and the II represented “pause.”The American Meteorological Society has informed Donald Trump that the organization can connect him with scientists so he can get his facts straight on global warming.

The letter was sent in the wake of Trump’s extraordinary statements concerning climate change in his interview Sunday with British journalist Piers Morgan. The president insisted that the polar ice caps were “going to be gone by now” due to global warming. Instead, they’re “setting records,” he said. They are, in fact, setting records — for melting rates, according to data tracked by his own federal agencies.

Trump also insisted that no one uses the phrase “global warming” any longer because “it was getting too cold all over the place.” The last four years have been the hottest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. And there hasn’t been a cooler-than-average year since 1976, according to more than 135 years of records kept by NASA and NOAA.

“Unfortunately,” the AMS letter to Trump states, “these and other climate-related comments in the interview [by you] are not consistent with scientific observations from around the globe — nor with scientific conclusions based on these observations.”

The letter, written by AMS Executive Director Keith Seitter, points out that the president’s own “U.S. Executive Branch agencies such as NASA and NOAA have been central to developing these observations and assessing their implications” — and the AMS offers to put Trump and his staff in touch with that expertise.

The nonprofit and nonpartisan AMS, founded in 1919, is the largest and preeminent organization of weather and climate scientists in the nation. It considers climate change one of the “most pressing” issues confronting the world.

Several other scientists criticized Trump’s statements after the ITV interview with Morgan.

“Glaciers and ice caps are globally continuing to melt at extreme rate,” Dr. Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service, told Reuters. He called any implication that ice caps are increasing in size “simply wrong.” Or maybe the president was “referring to a different planet,” Zemp quipped.

An AMS post on the organization’s website also discussed the president’s remark about “global warming” switching to the term “climate change.” In fact, climate change has been used as far back as the early 20th century to refer to events such as the Ice Age.

“Obviously, the term still applies,” notes the post quoting Bob Henson of the Weather Underground Category 6 blog. “So does ‘global warming.’ In 2018 already, “global warming” is in the title of several scientific papers accepted to AMS journals,” notes the blog.

Trump recently pointed to a winter cold snap on the East Coast as disproving climate change, apparently confusing climate — long-term trends — and weather, which varies from day to day.

In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017

Trump has also called climate change a Chinese hoax.President Donald Trump ordered the release of a secret memo that’s the centerpiece of the latest controversy surrounding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation into Russian election interference.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) wrote the memo, which Republicans claim features shocking information that proves FBI bias against Trump. Democrats argue the memo omits key facts, allowing for a GOP-influenced narrative that distracts from the Russia probe.

Trump’s push to release the memo prompted a response from the FBI, its first public clash under Director Christopher Wray with a president who’s often critical of the bureau.

“The F.B.I. was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the bureau said in a statement referencing the House Intelligence Committee. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”

Read the memo below:Dennis Edwards, former lead singer of the Temptations, died Friday in Chicago, one day before his 75th birthday, according to CBS Chicago.

The cause of death has not been made public.

Edwards joined the legendary Motown quintet in 1968 and sang lead on some of their biggest hits, including “I Can’t Get Next To You,” “Cloud Nine” and “Ball Of Confusion.”

Edwards was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and started singing at the age of two in his father’s church.

The family moved to Detroit when Edwards was 10, and Edwards became the choir director at his new church while still in high school, according to STLPublicRadio.com.

Edwards switched from gospel to pop in his twenties, but his mom didn’t approve and refused to take any of his earnings.

Before joining the Temptations, Edwards sang in the Countours, years after their big hit, “Do You Love Me,” but that allowed him to get the attention of Motown founder Berry Gordy.

“I signed with Motown and at the time the roster was completely full. Mr. Gordy, he had the foresight to just keep me on the roster,” Edwards told RnBShowcaseMag.com. “I had the opportunity to sing with the Contours for a couple of years, and I got the chance to meet the Temptations.”

Edwards joined the group in 1968 to replace lead singer David Ruffin. It was a time when the band’s sound was changing from smooth soul focused on a lead singer to a grittier funk that relied more on a group blend.

The first hit he sang on was “Cloud Nine,” followed by “I Can’t Get Next To You,” “Psychedelic Shack,” “Ball Of Confusion” and “Papa Was A Rollin’ Stone,” among others.

The group split with Motown in 1976 and moved to Atlantic, which ended Edwards’ first stint with the group.

He worked with the Temptations on and off in the 1980s before touring with former Temptations David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, according to RollingStone.com.

In 1989, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Temptations.The latest Yeezy advertising campaign features nearly a dozen Kim Kardashian look-alikes running errands in the brand’s fashions, and American DJ Diplo decided to join in on the fun.

We’d say this is a “yes”:There are iconic roles and then there’s Lois Lane, the intrepid reporter and paramour of Superman who’s made her mark on the comics world for 80 years.

Margot Kidder, perhaps the most beloved actress to inhabit the role, died in her sleep Sunday at age 69. For nearly a decade, Kidder brought Lane to the big screen in four “Superman” films opposite Christopher Reeve, who died in 2004.

After news of Kidder’s death broke, some of the other actresses who’ve portrayed Lane in various works, including Teri Hatcher and Erica Durance, paid tribute to the late star on social media.

Hatcher, who starred as Lane in the ABC series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” for four seasons, shared a famous photo of Kidder wearing a sweater with the Superman symbol emblazoned on the chest.

“It is a privilege to have shared the same role of Lois Lane with this wonderful actress,” Hatcher wrote. “She led the way brilliantly. My heart goes out to her family and friends.”

Durance was cast as Lane ahead of the fourth season of the Superman origin series “Smallville,” which aired on the WB and the CW from 2001 to 2011. Kidder, according to Durance, once told her that she “hit it out of the park” when it came to portraying the character.

“To one kick ass lady,” Durance wrote on Twitter. “You will be missed.”

To one kick ass lady. You will be missed. #RIPMargotKidder — Erica Durance (@ED_DURANCE) May 14, 2018

Both Kidder and Hatcher also made guest appearances on “Smallville,” with the late actress dropping in for multiple episodes during the show’s fourth season. Hatcher appeared as Lois’ mother toward the end of the series’ run.

Representatives for Amy Adams and Kate Bosworth, who’ve both played Lane on the big screen, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The official account for DC Comics, which has published the adventures of Superman since 1938, shared a message Monday afternoon about Kidder’s passing.

A woman lies facedown on the stairs in a nightgown, her body oddly stiff. Another woman is crumpled in her closet, next to a bloody knife and a suitcase. One woman is found tucked in bed, a red lipstick stain on the underside of a pillow the only clue to her demise.

The dollhouses, known as ‘‘The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,’’ were put together in minute detail as tools for teaching homicide detectives the nuances of examining a crime scene, the better to “convict the guilty, clear the innocent, and find the truth in a nutshell,” in a mantra adopted by Lee. Before she created her striking dioramas in the 1940s and ’50s, crime scenes were routinely contaminated by officers who trampled through them without care; evidence was mishandled; murders were thought to be accidents and accidents, murders. Today, even as forensic science has advanced by quantum leaps, her models are still used to teach police how to observe scenes, collect evidence and, critically, to question their initial assumptions about what took place.

The 19 existing nutshells were recently on display at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Lee’s pedagogical models having aged into a ghoulish sort of art. I saw them on a freakishly warm day in Washington, D.C., amateur sleuths crowded around me. Each model was accompanied by a card explaining basic facts about the case — the solutions are kept secret — and by a flashlight so that viewers could investigate the various clues more closely.

But something else was going on in the exhibit. Look closely at the nutshells: What unites them are the scenes of domestic horror that Lee, considered the “mother of forensic science,” portrays in such unsettling detail. Most of the victims are women, found dead inside the comfort of their homes. Dioramas that appear to show domestic bliss are slyly subverted to reveal the dark underside of family life. Unwittingly or not — her private life offers only scattered hints as to her motivation — Lee, with each nutshell, was leaving clues that pointed to the culprit in the larger story of American crime. Many of these scenes of murder are in fact scenes of misogyny in bloody apotheosis.

Peering inside “The Kitchen,” I felt as though I’d interrupted a profoundly intimate moment of pain. Lee handmade her dioramas at a scale of 1 inch to 1 foot ― classic for dollhouses ― and they are accurately and overwhelmingly detailed. In “The Kitchen,” there’s fresh-baked bread cooling in the open oven, potatoes half-peeled in the sink. Outside the window, female undergarments are seen drying on the line. But on the floor, flat on her back, is a deceased woman in an apron, her cheeks blazing red. On further scan of the room, viewers will notice that newspaper has been stuffed under the doors, blocking air passage, leading to the conclusion that she died from carbon monoxide poisoning.

At first glance, it looks like a suicide. But why would this housewife kill herself in the middle of cooking dinner? Maybe, one exhibition viewer theorized on a Post-it note, “she died of sheer misery over her dull repetitive unfulfilled life.” But then why is the table near the window askew? Could someone have staged the suicide and escaped out the window?

The only narrative available to investigators (and to viewers of the exhibition) comes from the woman’s husband, who reported that he went on an errand for his wife, and when he returned she was dead. Huh. It was this type of case that Lee wanted investigators to examine more closely, instead of accepting the obvious answer and moving right on.

“She was about championing the cases of people who were overlooked. And as a woman, she felt overlooked by the system,” said Nora Atkinson, the show’s curator. When Lee was building her models, the field of law enforcement was almost entirely male, she explained. “When they came across a scene, they didn’t take the cases against women that seriously, just like they didn’t take the cases against a drunk or a prostitute that seriously. She focused on people who were on the fringes of society, and women fell into that.”

The most gruesome of the nutshells is “Three-Room Dwelling,” in which a husband, wife and baby are all shot to death. As the diorama doesn’t have a roof, viewers have an aerial view into the house. Even though the victims are dolls, it’s a disturbing crime scene. In the kitchen, a gun lies on the floor near a bloody puddle. In another room, a baby is shot in her crib, the pink wallpaper behind her head stained with a constellation of blood spatters. The wife is shot in bed, turned on her side. Her husband is facedown on the floor, his striped blue pajamas soaked with blood.

Atkinson said when she observes crowds discussing “Three-Room Dwelling,” men and women have very different theories on the perpetrator. “The women believe that it was the husband who did it, and the men believe that it must have been an intruder,” she said. “It’s really sort of a psychological experiment watching the conclusions your audience comes to.”

For the record, I too am confident the husband did it. Maybe that’s because I’ve covered so many similar cases, and they’re sadly predictable. But I wasn’t surprised to hear that others were reluctant to reach the same verdict. As someone who writes almost exclusively about male violence against women, I’ve noticed a deep unwillingness among the public to recognize domestic abuse at the heart of violent American crime.

Most people would be startled to learn that over half of all murders of American women involve domestic violence. New York City’s first murder of 2018 was a woman stabbed to death by her husband. And despite how mass shootings are often portrayed in the media, most of them closely resemble “Three-Room Dwelling.” They are committed by husbands and boyfriends, take place within the perceived safety of the home and are anything but random.

Private violence also begets more violence: Our prisons are filled with men and women who were exposed to domestic violence and child abuse. “In looking for the genesis of crime in America, all trails lead back to violence in the home,” said Casey Gwinn, who runs a camp for kids who grew up with domestic abuse (where, full disclosure, I have volunteered in the past).

That inability to see domestic violence as crucially interwoven with violent crime in the U.S. leads to massive indifference. Funding for services is bleak, “desperately inadequate,” in the words of Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Among the media, there’s an impulse to categorize crimes involving intimate partners as trivial, and to compartmentalize them as private matters that exist wholly separate from Real Crime. I often wonder if it’s the word “domestic” that positions it so squarely within the realm of milk and cookies, instead of as part of a continuum, with murder and mass death terrifyingly adjacent.

In one hyperlocal example this week, no reporters showed up to a news conference on domestic violence homicides held by the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women. Why? Well, the Super Bowl is about to take place in the state, and all eyes are focused on that instead.

So from where did these dark creations emerge? What inspired Lee to spend so much time replicating trauma? She was born into a wealthy family in the 1870s and was intrigued by murder mysteries from a young age, the stories of Sherlock Holmes in particular. While she was studious and bright, she never had the opportunity to attend college. She married at 19 and had three children, but eventually divorced. Later in life, after her father’s and brother’s deaths, she began to pursue her true interests: crime and medicine.

In the 1930s, she used her fortune to help establish the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard, the first of its kind in North America. And she started working with her local New Hampshire police department, becoming the first woman in the country to achieve the rank of police captain. At the age of 65, she began making her dollhouses, which would be her longest-lasting legacy.

The teaching tools were “intended to be an exercise in observing, interpreting, evaluating and reporting,” she wrote in an article for the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. “One of the essentials in the study of these Nutshells is that the student should approach them with an open mind — far too often the investigator ‘has a hunch,’ and looks for and finds only the evidence to support it, disregarding any other evidence that may be present.”

Little is known about why Lee chose the particular scenes she did, and why she narrowed her lens on the domain of domestic life. The nutshells are all based on real crimes, with some adjustments.

“When she was traveling around with police officers and investigators in the New England area, these were in part a reflection of the scenes that she had access to, and the crimes that were taking place,” said Corinne Botz, an artist and author who published a book exploring the nutshells through a feminist lens.

Perhaps Lee felt those cases were not getting the attention they deserved, she said, noting that many of the nutshells are overt stereotypes: the housewife in the kitchen, the old woman in the attic.

“​Lee picked the cases that interested her​,” Botz said. “She is trying to make investigators take a second look, and not make assumptions based on what a neighbor reported or what first meets the eye.”

Atkinson thought it was possible Lee was subconsciously exploring her own complicated feelings about family life through the models. “A lot of these domestic environments reflect her own frustration that the home was supposed to be this place of solace and safety,” she said. “The home wasn’t necessarily a place where she felt safe and warm. It was a little bit of a prison for her.”

Lee hinted at her difficulties in a letter penned in her 70s. “This has been a lonely and rather terrifying life I have lived,” she wrote. “Chief amongst the difficulties I have had to meet have been the facts that I never went to school, that I had no letters after my name, and that I was placed in the category of ‘rich woman who didn’t have enough to do.’”

But her nutshells, and their portrayal of violence against women, have ultimately transformed the way investigators approach crime, said Jeanie Foley, who creates full-size, realistic simulated crime scenes based on true cases to teach students at Boston College School of Nursing. The scenes she builds are similar to Lee’s nutshells, but on a much larger scale and with far less detail.

Decades after Lee built her nutshells, the field of forensic science is now dominated by women.

“Today, in the 21st century, the science of forensics plays a crucial part in the solution of crimes,” she said. “Lee’s models gave women a better opportunity to have a fair investigation. A more open-minded investigation.”

Deliberately or not, Lee’s nutshells urge us to acknowledge that American crime is born in the home ― and we ignore it at our own peril.

Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated that Lee’s father prevented her from attending college. While Lee said her father “believed that ‘a lady didn’t go to school,’” according to Botz’s book, Botz and other experts on Lee’s life have not definitively concluded why she did not attend.Taylor Swift at a concert in Texas last year.

What do fans of “Hamilton,” Taylor Swift and Chance the Rapper have in common? They’ve all lost out on tickets to performances after they were snatched up by ticket-buying bots.

And despite efforts by federal and state governments, little has changed.

Sophisticated internet software known as bots race through ticket sellers’ online ordering forms and buy hundreds of tickets well before human eyes even reach a captcha. Those tickets then get resold with a serious markup.

One broker used bots to buy 30,000 “Hamilton” tickets over 20 months — vacuuming up as much as 40 percent of available seats for some performances — according to a lawsuit by Ticketmaster. During Bruce Springsteen’s Broadway run, tickets with a $75 face value were selling for $1,400 on StubHub. Bot-reliant brokers have drawn the ire of pop star Taylor Swift, who vowed to foil them with a ticket-buying system aimed at rewarding the most active fans. And Chance the Rapper bought about 2,000 tickets from scalpers and sold them back to fans.

“Despite efforts by federal and state governments, little has changed.”

Federal and state governments have tried to push their way into the murky gutters of the web, banning the use of bots software and, in some cases, instituting criminal penalties for those who are caught. But so far, few have been.

The Federal Trade Commission, which, alongside state attorneys general, is assigned to enforce the federal law, has yet to bring any enforcement action. And of the 13 states that ban bots, New York appears to be the only one to have reached a settlement with ticket resellers.

According to the New York Attorney General’s Office, tickets are resold on the secondary market at an average markup of 49 percent. Of course, the markup can be even higher for major events: The average ticket price for this year’s Super Bowl is an eye-popping $5,500. The face value for nosebleed seats is $950.

To be sure, bots aren’t the only factor limiting ticket availability to the public — an investigation by NewsChannel 5 in Nashville, Tennessee, found that just 7 percent of tickets to a Justin Bieber concert were actually up for grabs. The rest were set aside for promoters, fan club members and American Express cardholders. But bots are most targeted by lawmakers.

Proponents say the legislation still has a deterrent effect, particularly once criminal penalties become a part of the package.

“The first step to stop bad behavior is to make it illegal,” said Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican who sponsored a bill banning bots. “Even if it’s difficult to enforce, you can put a dent in it by making it illegal and hopefully deter people.”

Kavanagh’s legislation has been through a few iterations. Last year’s bill tried to bar the use of any software that impersonates a human and conceals its real identity, but the tech industry quickly opposed it because such software often is used for benevolent purposes such as customer service.

This year’s bill would ban bots directly and make their use a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison. (A bill in New Jersey, meanwhile, would impose a $10,000 fine and up to 18 months in prison for those convicted of using bots to buy tickets online.) Even with stiff penalties, enforcement can be a challenge.

State laws have little impact on bots deployed outside their borders, and a 2016 federal law — the BOTS Act — doesn’t combat overseas operations.

But consumer advocates say companies that sell tickets aren’t doing enough to report problems to enforcement agencies, particularly because their internal data would be the first to flag purchases that didn’t fit the typical purchasing algorithm.

“Really, the companies that spot and know a bot is being used are the primary ticketers. That’s typically going to be Ticketmaster,” said John Breyault with the National Consumers League, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. “If bots continue to purchase large amounts of tickets, why isn’t Ticketmaster taking advantage of the law to bring more prosecutions?”

Breyault said some ticket-selling companies also own the online markets where they can be resold, taking a cut of each sale. Ticketmaster is affiliated with TicketsNow. State laws could strengthen the federal law, he said, if they provided stiffer penalties or required ticket sellers to report suspected bot usage.

But Katie Peters, head of public policy with Ticketmaster, said it’s not so simple. Bot developers quickly find new ways around additional security measures.

“The problem is we innovate, they innovate,” she said. “We innovate, they innovate.”

Where the law allows for a private right of action, the company has sued. Ticketmaster filed suit in California against ticket brokers it claims used bots to grab tickets to “Hamilton” and the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao boxing match, in Las Vegas, in 2015. The $10 million suit is working its way through court.

And in New York, the attorney general’s office last year reached settlements worth $4.2 million with six ticket brokers, five of which used bots. One of the companies, Renaissance Ventures, also known as Prestige Entertainment, in 2014 bought over a thousand tickets to a U2 concert in one minute. The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for additional information.

Kavanagh said he envisions local police departments’ computer crime units as the best avenue for enforcing his bill, should it become law.Zack Caspary

The members of Why Don’t We have a secret handshake they do right before hitting the stage. They call it their “confidence solidifier.”

“I can’t go onstage if I don’t shake everyone’s hand,” Why Don’t We’s Daniel Seavey told HuffPost. “There was one time the show started and we hadn’t done the handshake. We were supposed to run onstage, but we finished the handshake first.”

The five-piece group, featuring Seavey (who competed on Season 14 of “American Idol”), Zach Herron, Corbyn Besson, Jonah Marais and Jack Avery, started that handshake after forming their band in the summer of 2016. The guys knew one other from touring as solo acts and decided to meet up in Los Angeles just to see what would happen.

“There was this magic sauce in the air,” Besson recalled. Seavey noted how everything came together very organically.

“Coming into the group, it never was really us like, ‘Oh, let’s just join this boy band,’” Seavey said. “It was more so, ‘We are all friends. We all like the same type of music, so why don’t we just make a band and make good music?’”

Why Don’t We is made up of five guys ranging in age from 16-19, so it would be easy to dub the group a “boy band.” While Besson says they “embrace the boy band term,” they wouldn’t mind being called something else.

“If people want to call us a boy band, that’s cool. I don’t think we necessarily call us ourselves a boy band. We prefer ‘man band.’ Like if possible, in your article if you can convince everybody to call us ‘man band’ from now on, that would be so incredible,” Besson joked.

“No, but we embrace it,” he continued. “Our sound is definitely a little bit different than what you’d expect from a traditional boy band or what’s been termed as a boy band in the past. We’re kind of just doing our thing. We’re doing the music we love — doing it the Why Don’t We way.”

Whatever they’re doing, it appears to be working. The group has garnered 2.4 million followers on Instagram, amassed more than 120 million audio streams globally and racked up 38 million YouTube views for their “These Girls” video.

“It’s so cool. When my mom gets excited about things now, she texts me with six exclamation points instead of just one,” Besson said about their newfound success.

Performing at New York’s Madison Square Garden for Z100’s Jingle Ball in December marked one of the highlights of the past year ― not only because of the concert itself, but because of the other artists in attendance.

“When we originally got to Madison Square Garden that day and got to our dressing room, there was a note left on our table … It was from Taylor Swift and she was congratulating us on all of our success … It was a super sweet letter,” Besson said.

“She invited us to her dressing room after our set. We walked in and it smelled like the most beautiful botanical garden ... Taylor Swift was standing right there, and Ed Sheeran was just there hanging. We were like, ‘Whoa, this is like real life right now.’”

Why Don’t We met Sheeran prior to Jingle Ball at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2017.

“We were on the red carpet, and he stopped by and was like, ‘Hey, Why Don’t We’! And we were like, ‘Uuuuhhhh, hi Ed Sheeran!’ It was a crazy moment. He said he loved our music, loved our sound and that he couldn’t wait to see where our success takes us,” Seavey said.

Then, just a few months later, Why Don’t We’s manager and label, Atlantic Records, called with a nice surprise.

“They said, ’Hey, this guy thinks he may have the perfect song for you guys. And we were like, ‘Who is it?’ And they were like, ‘Ed Sheeran.’ And we were like, ‘Oh, well, let’s hear the song.’ We heard the song and we loved the direction he was going with it,” Seavey said about “Trust Fund Baby.” “We got our voices on it as soon as we could, and it came out amazing.”

The group has already released five EPs filled with plenty of tracks, but the new single, released this week, is by far the favorite. “This feels like the best way to represent how we want the rest of the year to go,” Seavey said.

More music is on the way as the band currently works on a full-length album, expected out later this year.

“If you thought 2017 was a good year for us, then I’m really excited to see how 2018 does because we got a lot more things up to our sleeve,” Seavey said.

One of those things is an upcoming headlining tour, set to kick off in February. Their live set will feature a mixture of everything. The guys are working on dance routines, incorporating live instruments and planning a high-production show.

And you can bet they’ll do that secret handshake each and every night.Amazon and other companies announced they would form an independent health company for their U.S. employees. The move will likely benefit the companies more than the employees. Philippe Wojazer/Reuters

Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway announced on Tuesday that they would be teaming up to form an independent health company ― one that is “free from profit-making incentives and constraints” ― for their U.S. employees, with a long-term aim of creating health care solutions that benefit, “potentially, all Americans.”

Although no details for this proposal were offered in the announcement, stock prices for insurance giants like UnitedHealth and Anthem fell steeply in its wake, an indication of the perceived power of the combined effort of these three corporations.

It’s impossible to assess the viability of their plans when there really aren’t any, but it makes perfect sense that three large companies, recognizing that they are contributing to the record profits of other large companies ― i.e., insurance companies ― would want to take a stab at decreasing their own expenditures.

And indeed, in spite of the seemingly progressive rhetoric (“improving employee satisfaction,” “free from profit-making incentives,” etc.), every commentator on this proposal saw it quite clearly as a business decision. The New York Times even compared it to “classic disruption,” where a company enters “a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost.” That a proposed nonprofit health care company would be immediately and so easily compared to “classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers,” is a good indication that most people doubt that health is really the goal here.

And with good reason. Amazon is conducting an experiment in ”purposeful Darwinism,” according to a New York Times profile of life inside the business, to see just how far it can push its workers, and with little concern for their health. The same piece found 80- to 85-hour workweeks with no work-life separation to be the norm for some workers, and there were accounts of people who fell ill being threatened with dismissal for their “personal difficulties.”

For blue-collar workers, the brutality is even more straightforward: In 2011, Amazon stationed paramedics and ambulances outside its factory in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to cart off workers as they collapsed in the 102-degree heat.

This is all to say that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is interested not in people’s health but rather in his bottom line. It’s very possible that he and his partners will find a way to cut down on the obscene administrative costs of most health insurance companies, including the $20 million per year on average that most insurance CEOs make. But even with the combined 1 million employees between the three companies, ”the idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.”

The basic idea being toyed with here is, however, a good one: By having significant buying power through the representation of a large number of people, it is indeed possible to negotiate medical costs. The Department of Veterans Affairs, for instance, gets a 40 percent discount on drugs, and pharmaceutical costs in countries with single-payer health care are much lower than in the U.S.

Amazon and its allies are thus right to think that the exorbitant cost of health care can be reined in by eliminating the profit motive and consolidating buying power, but in both cases a single-payer Medicare for All system is a far better proposal than their own. Medicare for All would allow for real negotiation over medical costs and would ensure that profit doesn’t endanger care. As long as health care is subservient to corporate interests, any cost-cutting will be to the benefit of the rich, not the sick.

As Mark Dudzic of the Labor Campaign For Single Payer points out, there’s a good reason corporate America won’t get behind a proposal that both saves them money and has the support of the majority of Americans: It’s all about power.

Companies like employment-based health care, despite its costs, because it keeps the workforce captive. They also fear slippery slopes and know that the socialization of one industry could mean that theirs is next. Bezos and company thus want to take on the enormous project of starting a health care nonprofit because they want to stave off any threats to their own power.

Progressives are not the only group in the political spectrum that has “awoken” in recent years. Capitalists too are very aware of popular discontent, the kind that could actually endanger their position rather than just feed the Democratic Party machine and will no doubt continue to trot out proposed “solutions” to political crises in health care, education, housing, transportation and so forth. The only real solution to these problems is to eliminate the profit motive once and for all, and that means bringing social goods back under social control.
