Jim Carrey just released his latest work.

In his ongoing series of portraits, the actor-turned-artist found inspiration from Fox News host Sean Hannity and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Carrey depicted the pair as professional wrestlers and urged them to “join the WWE where their hyperbole will do less damage to the culture.”

If u believe wrestling is real u may even believe Fox news, Info Wars and the robotic drones on Sinclair Broadcasting. But wrestling doesn’t harm viewers. Performers like Sean Hannity and Alex Jones should join the WWE where their hyperbole will do less damage to the culture. pic.twitter.com/HHsfvRaToJ — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) April 3, 2018

The portrait is the latest in an ongoing series. Last week, Carrey took on President Donald Trump with a cheeky submission to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery:

Dear Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery @NPG, I know it’s early but I’d like to submit this as the official portrait of our 45th President, Donald J. Trump. It’s called, 'You Scream. I Scream. Will We Ever Stop Screaming?' pic.twitter.com/LrCmlXXpv7 — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 29, 2018

He also made an apparent dig at Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and advisor:

Prior to that, Carrey painted a portrait of what many believe was White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders:Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent introduced fans to their new son, Oskar Michael Brent-Berkus, in a stunning photo series this week.

The “Nate & Jeremiah by Design” hosts posed with Oskar, who was born March 26, and their 3-year-old daughter, Poppy, in People magazine’s latest issue.

In the interview accompanying the photos, Berkus and Brent, who married in 2014, explained the surprising significance behind their son’s name. Oskar was the middle name of Berkus’ former partner, Fernando Bengoechea, who died in the 2004 Sri Lankan tsunami.

“We have always honored Fernando’s memory in our relationship,” Brent said. “It’s such an important chapter in Nate’s life. So the idea that we can honor his memory in a beautiful way was exciting to us.”

Berkus added that the name “was actually Jeremiah’s idea.”

Meanwhile, their daughter Poppy “has photos of [Bengoechea] and she’ll know his whole story,” Brent said. “We both believe that the good stuff and the bad stuff is what really defines us.”

The pair’s People spread comes a week after they announced Oskar’s birth on Instagram.

“We have waited for you, we already love you, and we as a family stand on the shoulders of so many people who have made it possible for families like ours to continue to grow,” Berkus wrote, alongside an adorable black-and-white photo of Poppy touching her new brother’s toes.An officer in the U.S. Navy is making waves for the way he served his country on Monday.

Cmdr. Richard I. Lawlor usually helps out President Donald Trump as a naval attaché. But when the White House needed someone to portray the most famous rabbit in the world, he bravely dressed up as the Easter Bunny for the annual Easter Egg Roll.

Twitter users enjoyed his shocked expression ― or rather the bunny costume’s ― as the president and first lady greeted guests.

“Could they have found a more shocked looking bunny?” one tweet asked, per Inside Edition.

Even more shocking: Until Lawlor’s name was made public, Mashable reports that many people thought the bunny might be former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who wore the costume in 2008.

The gig was a far cry from Lawlor’s usually more dignified public appearances. According to the Daily Mail, he has sometimes been called on to read out the citations when Trump ― and before him, President Barack Obama ― present national honors like the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Reports of a shooting trigger an avalanche of misinformation on the internet.

When a woman opened fire at the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, on Tuesday, Twitter immediately lit up with false and inaccurate reports, some from seasoned journalists and reputable news outlets.

With gun violence regularly at the forefront of the news, this faulty dialogue has become commonplace. But there are ways to keep fake news from spreading after a shooting.

Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner.

In the moments after a shooting, law enforcement officials and first responders are trying to figure out what’s happening and whether a situation is escalating. Police scanners allow anyone, anywhere to listen to their conversations unfiltered. Their questions about a crime scene, their speculation about what might be coming next, all the comments made in the midst of a chaotic situation are on display ― including things that turn out to be totally wrong.

During the YouTube shooting, a first responder was heard on the scanner saying 37 individuals would need “triaging,” or medical attention. In reality, four people were treated for injuries ― three who were shot, and one who injured an ankle while running from the shooter.

But it was easy to find tweets that said 37 people were injured. Even some journalists and news outlets, like Newsweek, shared the line. (They later deleted their tweet.)

Twitter

Law enforcement officials and first responders aren’t journalists. Their conversations immediately after a shooting are rooted in speculation, not fact.

Be careful how you label a shooting.

A lot can sound like “shots fired.” Cars backfiring and fireworks are two things commonly misreported as shootings.

Even when shots have actually been fired, that doesn’t always mean there’s an active shooter, or someone with a gun continuing to go after others.

Even when there is an active shooter, it doesn’t always mean anyone has been shot.

Even if a person was shot, it doesn’t mean the suspect is carrying out a “mass shooting,” the definition of which is not clearly defined. (An incident is commonly called a mass shooting if three or more people in a similar location are shot, though law enforcement and media outlets often use different standards for the term.)

Don’t assume you know the shooter’s motive.

Several outlets, including the Associated Press and CNN, reported the YouTube shooter was involved in a domestic dispute, which wasn’t true. Sometimes a shooter’s motive remains unclear for months, as is the case with the Las Vegas massacre.

Wait for an official confirmation before sharing a suspect’s identity.

With almost every major shooting in America come false reports of the shooter’s identity. Sam Hyde, a comedian, is almost always brought up as a “shooting suspect,” his image being shared so often The New York Times called it “an identifiable meme.”

Adam Lanza, who killed students at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was found with his brother Ryan’s ID, leading several media outlets to initially report he was the suspect.

After the YouTube shooting, BuzzFeed’s Jane Lytvynenko kept track of hoaxes, including a tweet that claimed she was the shooter.

Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner.

Seriously, don’t.

Take eyewitness accounts with a grain of salt.

People in stressful situations don’t always know the full details of what’s going on around them. Many only see one area of a much larger crime scene.

It’s common for law enforcement to investigate leads on multiple shooters after a mass shooting situation that was carried out by one person, thanks to conflicting reports from people who were there. But there’s almost always just one shooter.

Be careful when talking about the number of victims.

Numbers included in official statements from law enforcement statements and hospitals are often updated to more accurately reflect who was treated. And there’s often confusion about the extent of injuries during a shooting ― just because someone was injured doesn’t mean they were shot; just because someone was shot doesn’t mean they were killed.

Be mindful of where the media is getting its information.

Anonymous sources and eyewitnesses are commonly cited by journalists after a mass shooting. While that information can often help paint a picture of what’s unfolding, it can also be very, very wrong.

News outlets will often cite other news outlets’ reporting after a shooting, and it’s good to know the original source of any information you’re reading. A “fact” about a shooting may be widely reported, but only supported by one source talking to one outlet.

Don’t believe everything you see on Twitter.

Is the person tweeting new to Twitter? Do they normally post from the area where the shooting occurred? A few seconds of digging can help add clarity to who a person is and if they’re legit.

Doctored photos are often shared after mass shootings. You can find an image’s origin by doing a reverse image search.

After the YouTube shooting, one victim’s Twitter account was hacked. An individual posed as a YouTube employee to try and trick a HuffPost reporter into sharing false information. Don’t trust that people in your Twitter timeline have accurate information or good intentions.

Don’t spread information overheard on the police scanner.

I actually cannot say this enough.

Be careful about what you share.If the first rule of advertising is to know your audience, then Randy Colpek is a real-life Don Draper.

Colpek is such a fan of Kirkland Signature Light — a budget beer sold only at Costco — that he took it upon himself to attempt his own commercial for the beverage. The end result was uploaded to YouTube.

The “ad,” such as it is, is actually a series of “outtakes” where (a possibly intoxicated) Colpek breaks through a bunch of empty beer cases a la the Kool-Aid Man and attempts a slogan extolling the virtues of the brew.

Some sample slogans:

“Kirkland Light: It’s 11 a.m. somewhere.”

“Kirkland Light: Available in 48-packs where you buy your pants!”

“Kirkland Light: Give me a Kirkland, a coozy and a floozy!”

“Kirkland Light: Got a drinking problem? Now you got a drinking solution!”

“Kirkland Light: Life is like beer. Drink it in and piss it out!”

Colpek, who works as a carpenter near Santa Cruz, California, admits the commercial is supposed to be funny, but says his appreciation of the beer is apparently real. He told Reddit users he drinks about 18 cans a day.

He said it’s more about quantity than quality.

“To be honest all cheap beer is pretty much the same,” he told HuffPost by email. “I always get the cashier saying ‘Looks like someone is having a party,’ but Costco cut down on that shame.”

Colpek made the video last summer, but it started to go viral after he posted it on Reddit earlier this week.

So far, Costco hasn’t commented on Colpek’s free advertising, but he’s looking at the situation philosophically — at least, we think?Thousands of Kentucky teachers protest pension and budget cuts at the state Capitol in Frankfort on Monday, April 2. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images

Andrew Bailey had toyed with the idea of running for public office in Kentucky for years.

A teacher at Fairdale High School in Louisville, Bailey figured he’d start small: maybe a seat on the Board of Education for Jefferson County Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, or perhaps a spot on Louisville’s Metro Council.

But Bailey never took the next step.

Then, last Thursday, the Kentucky Legislature passed a controversial bill making sweeping changes to the public pension system that guarantees teachers’ retirement plans. After months of teacher opposition, Republicans tucked the changes ― which included the conversion of pensions into 401(k)-style plans for new hires ― into a bill that had previously dealt with wastewater issues and passed the legislation mere hours later.

The move sparked outrage among educators, who staged a quasi-strike that forced school closures in at least 25 districts across Kentucky last Friday. Thousands marched on the state Capitol in Frankfort on Monday morning.

And Andrew Bailey finally launched that political career he’d long considered.

On Monday, Bailey filed paperwork with Kentucky’s Secretary of State to run for the state Senate seat held by Sen. Dan Seum, a Republican who had voted for the pension overhaul on Thursday night.

The pension legislation “was the catalyst that made me take that jump,” Bailey told HuffPost. “I’d never thought about running at the state Senate level. But you gotta go big or go home. It’s a chance to let them know there are political consequences.”

Bailey wasn’t alone: Across the state, teachers are seeking public office in numbers unprecedented in modern Kentucky history, political observers say. By the end of January, as the battle over their pensions intensified, more than 25 teachers had filed to run for office, with most of them running as Democrats.

Controversy over how the pension changes were pushed through has only exacerbated that phenomenon. In the days after the Thursday vote, three other Kentucky teachers joined Bailey in declaring their intent to run for state House and Senate seats held by Republicans who supported the pension changes.

“You can only sit and fuss about it for so long before you have to do something. No one else is going to stand up for it. We have to do it for ourselves.” - Kentucky teacher Mona Hampton-Eldridge

On Monday, Mona Hampton-Eldridge, a teacher at Northern Middle School in Somerset, announced her intention to run against Republican Rep. Tommy Turner.

Nicole Britton, a teacher in Washington County, filed to run for the seat held by Republican Sen. Max Wise.

And Lydia Coffey, of Liberty, said she would take on Republican Rep. Daniel Elliott. Coffey is a retired teacher who protested the pension changes at the Capitol.

The four candidates who filed to run for office on Monday missed the filing deadline for Kentucky’s May primaries, meaning they will have to run as write-in candidates. That could make it nearly impossible to knock off the established incumbents they’re facing. Three of the four incumbents were unopposed until this week.

But that the teachers jumped into electoral races at all is a sign that the educators who rallied at the Capitol on Monday weren’t making empty threats when they screamed “Enough is enough!” and promised to do everything they could to defeat the lawmakers who’d voted for the pension changes.

Like Bailey, Hampton-Eldridge saw the pension vote as the “breaking point” that convinced her to run for office.

“I had to do something,” said Hampton-Eldridge, who has worked for the Pulaski County school district since 2001 and taught middle school since 2008. “You can only sit and fuss about it for so long before you have to do something. No one else is going to stand up for it. We have to do it for ourselves.”

Britton, too, decided amid the pension loss to take the plunge into politics, although she said she felt guilty that it took such upheaval for her to finally get involved.

“I’m a little bit sad it took that to get me to take on some civic duty,” said Britton, who has been a teacher for 12 years in Washington County. “But we’re here now and we are united, and one thing about teachers is, we work together very well.”

At least 10 candidates with backgrounds as teachers, professors or education professionals are running for state Senate seats as Democrats, according to Brad Bowman, communications director for the Kentucky Democratic Party. At least 33 such candidates are pursuing state House seats, he told HuffPost. (All four of the candidates who declared on Monday are Democrats, they told HuffPost.)

That total includes some incumbents, Bowman said, but the majority are teachers or education professionals seeking to unseat Republicans in a state where the GOP regained the governor’s mansion in 2015 and took control of both houses of the state legislature the following year for the first time in more than a century.

Though the pension fight has dominated headlines, teachers in Kentucky have also opposed attempts by Gov. Matt Bevin (R) and the Republican legislature to bring charter schools to the state, as well as various proposals to cut school funding in ways that teachers and administrators alike have said could further undermine school programs and public education in an already-struggling state.

“Our legislators, it feels like they just keep trying to cut us off at the kneecaps,” said Matt Kaufmann, a teacher at Moore High School in Louisville who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Republican Sen. Ernie Harris.

Kaufmann, who entered the race in January, said he was recruited by Save Our Schools, a movement that opposes the introduction of charter schools in Kentucky.

“We’re fighting for education as an institution. We’re fighting for our students and teachers who deserve good schools,” he said. “That’s why I’m running, and I think that’s why a lot of educators are running. We don’t have a choice.”

Bailey chose to go into teaching after studying architecture because teaching gave him the chance to “make a difference every single day.” But, he said, he hasn’t received new textbooks since 2008, forcing him to conduct his business classes largely without them. Most of his students, meanwhile, are on free or reduced lunch programs.

That’s made it hard to watch the governor propose drastic cuts to many education- and school-related programs, and even harder to listen to Bevin refer to teachers who opposed his agenda as “selfish” and “ignorant” people acting with a “thug mentality.”

Coffey, who taught middle school in Casey County for 27 years, said she initially considered a run for office in January before deciding against it. Bevin’s attacks on teachers, though, inspired her to change her mind.

“To sit back and say that we haven’t been demoralized, to treat us like we are not intelligent individuals ... I don’t think there’s an understanding of what it’s like to work in our classrooms, to work with students with all kinds of needs,” she told HuffPost. “We’ve never been attacked by the governor of our state. Whether it was a Republican or a Democrat, no one has ever attacked the teaching profession.”

Although some Republican legislators bucked Bevin on school funding ― the compromise tax and budget package passed this week did not include many of the governor’s proposed education cuts ― that rhetoric has also left teachers like Bailey and Coffey wondering if lawmakers in Frankfort really care about public education.

“I don’t feel they have our backs right now,” said Bailey, who has served as treasurer of the Jefferson County Teachers Association ― the union that represents teachers in Louisville ― and said he has assisted school board and other local election campaigns.

While the pension controversy pushed many of the new candidates into their races, they all said education issues wouldn’t be their only focus. Kaufmann and Hampton-Eldridge see the teachers’ fight as emblematic of broader problems facing working Kentuckians, especially after Bevin and Republicans implemented a so-called “right to work” law and repealed the state’s prevailing-wage laws in 2017.

“I’m standing up for the working people of Pulaski County,” said Hampton-Eldridge, whose husband works in construction and was affected by the prevailing-wage repeal. “I’m for the working common person.”

Britton, meanwhile, sees herself as part of a national movement of women who are newly running for office. She describes the recent attacks on teachers as part of a broader attack on women, who make up nearly 80 percent of the nation’s teaching force.

“You have to wonder: If we were a predominantly male profession, would we be fighting this uphill battle?” she said.

None of the four new candidates’ Republican opponents immediately responded to requests for comment.

Hampton-Eldridge and the other write-in candidates know it won’t be easy to actually unseat those lawmakers, but they also said their decisions to run carry symbolic significance.

“Even if we don’t win, it sets a precedent that we’re not just going to sit down and take it anymore,” Hampton-Eldridge said. “We’re going to start fighting for what’s ours.”Thunder only happens when it’s raining, but viral memes happen all the time ― though they usually don’t bring a 41-year-old song back up to the top of the music charts.

According to Billboard, Fleetwood Mac’s song “Dreams” spiked at No. 14 this week on the Hot Rock Songs chart, apparently because of the song’s appearance in a meme on Twitter.

The song’s revival seems to have started with Twitter user @bottledfleet, who tweeted a video clip and caption on March 22. The text reads, “Fleetwood Mac’s music is so boring, you can’t even dance to it,” followed by, “Me, an intellectual:” The accompanying video is a 38-second clip of a marching band’s dance team passionately dancing and pelvic thrusting to “Dreams.”

As of Wednesday, the tweet had more than 130,000 retweets and more than 320,000 likes.

Stevie Nicks told Rolling Stone last yearthat she wrote the now-iconic single “in about 10 minutes.” The song, which appeared on the band’s “Rumours” album, hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977.

Billboard notes that in addition to climbing the charts this week, “Dreams” saw a 36 percent surge in download sales between March 23 and 29 ― the week immediately after the tweet went out.

Memes are reviving classic hits, y’all. What a time to be alive.

“Dreams” isn’t even the first song off of “Rumours” to see a recent resurgence. In May, “The Chain” landed at number 7 on the Hot Rock Songs chart because it was included on the “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” soundtrack.Adam Rippon is basking in the glow of a new romance.

The Olympic skater and self-proclaimed “glamazon bitch” made it Instagram official with Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, who hails from Finland, on Monday by posting a shirtless snap from a hike at Runyon Canyon in Los Angeles.

He also confirmed to People on Wednesday that he and Kajaala are dating.

A post shared by Adam Rippon (@adaripp) on Apr 2, 2018 at 5:32am PDT

It’s unclear just how long Rippon, who in February became one of the first two openly gay men to compete for the U.S. at the Winter Olympics, had been single.

He and Kajaala initially met via Tinder and started talking about seven months ago, according to People. They have officially been an item since last week.

It’s “fresh,” Rippon said of the relationship. “I’m fresh!”

Rippon told the magazine’s editorial director, Jess Cagle, earlier this month that he’d split from a longtime boyfriend last summer.

“Everything was great with him,” Rippon said. “He was a great guy, but I felt like I really needed to focus on myself.”

He said at the time that he had tried dating apps like Tinder and Grindr, but didn’t really expect a relationship to come from them: “I think in the last few months I’ve been so focused on myself that in a way, I think that if I am to meet somebody I want it to happen organically.”In what’s been characterized as the most progressive remarks ever uttered by a modern pontiff about homosexuality, Pope Francis reportedly told a gay man during a recent conversation at the Vatican that “God made you like that and he loves you like that.”

Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse, said Francis made the comments to him when they met for a private discussion last month to discuss the sex abuse and cover-up scandal involving Catholic priests in Cruz’s native Chile.

“He told me, ‘Juan Carlos, the fact that you’re gay doesn’t matter. God made you like that, and he loves you like that, and I don’t care,’” Cruz told Spanish newspaper El Pais, recalling his two-and-half-hour conversation with the pontiff.

Cruz, who was abused as a child by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest, told the paper that his sexual orientation came up during the discussion because he has been targeted for being gay after speaking out about his abuse.

“They had told [Francis] that I was practically a pervert. I explained that I’m not the reincarnation of San Luis Gonzaga, but I am not a bad person, I try to not harm anyone,” Cruz told El Pais.

Francis responded, Cruz said, by telling him, “The pope loves you [as you are], you have to be happy with who you are.”

I spoke for more than two and a half hours alone with Pope Francis. He listened to me with great respect, affection and closeness, like a father. We talked about many subjects. Today I have more hope in the future of our church... Even though the task is enormous. — Juan Carlos Cruz Ch. (@jccruzchellew) April 29, 2018

A representative at the Vatican declined to confirm or deny the pontiff’s remarks, telling The Los Angeles Times, “We don’t normally comment on the pope’s private conversations.”

Francis has spoken with compassion about homosexuality, though his comments have not led to any real change in the church’s longstanding position on homosexuality.

“If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?” Francis famously said in 2013. Later that year, he suggested in an interview that God does not “reject and condemn” gay people.

The LA Times described Francis’ reported comments to Cruz as expressing a possibly “new level of acceptance of homosexuality” for the Catholic Church.

“This is a big deal, I cannot remember the pope making a comment about gay people being born that way,” the Rev. James Martin, an American priest who has advocated for bridging the divide between the church and the LGBTQ community, told the Times this week.

“Pope Francis has repeated what all reputable biologists and psychologists say — you don’t choose your sexual orientation. And that is a great comfort to many gay and lesbian Catholics who have been told by priests that they have chosen their orientation and are therefore guilty,” Martin continued.

Observers have warned against hyping the pontiff’s comments, however, as they were uttered in private and don’t represent a shift in church teaching.

The Catholic Church’s catechism, which summarizes the church’s doctrinal positions, states that homosexuality’s “psychological genesis remains largely unexplained.” Homosexual acts are described as depraved and “contrary to natural law.”

“Under no circumstances can they be approved,” the catechism reads.

Still, experts said Francis’ reported comments suggested that church attitudes toward the LGBTQ community are shifting.

“It goes beyond ‘who am I to judge?’ to ‘you are loved by God,’” Christopher Lamb, the Vatican correspondent for the Catholic newspaper Tablet, told The Guardian. “I don’t think he has changed church teaching but he’s demonstrating an affirmation of gay Catholics, something that has been missing over the years in Rome.”

Additional reporting by HuffPost reporter Carol Kuruvilla.A photograph taken at Hope Hicks’ send-off party has sparked fresh criticism about a lack of diversity inside the White House.

Members of President Donald Trump’s administration gathered in Washington on Tuesday night to bid farewell to outgoing communications director Hicks and senior communications aide Josh Raffel.

As it did for the same issue in summer 2017:It might seem like technology has made it easier for those with social anxiety to interact with others, but it can also lead to new stressors and a deeper sense of isolation. martin-dm via Getty Images

Desiree Wiercyski, a life coach and psychologist, has curated a fierce persona on Instagram. Almost daily, she shares advice, inspiration, and selfies with her more than 2,000 followers. But Instagramming was practically unthinkable for her a year ago.

Wiercyski, who has social anxiety disorder, felt almost panicky when she first started using social media.

“I would get incredibly anxious about something as small as leaving a comment on a friend’s post,” she recalls. “My heart rate would increase and I’d break out in a sweat. It really felt like an extension of being in a room full of crowded people.”

A post shared by Life Coach & Podcast Host (@dezwmsmba) on Jan 27, 2018 at 3:10pm PST

Maybe, on some level, you can relate. After all, most of us get a little shy around new people, or simply don’t like the thought of being judged by others. But for the 15 million adults affected by social anxiety, those feelings of shyness or fear of judgment are much more acute ― even paralyzing.

“Social anxiety is a mental, physical and emotional state of intense discomfort and nervousness, and even trepidation, that occurs in a social context,” said Teodora Pavkovic, a New York City-based psychologist. People with social anxiety are fearful of being humiliated or doing something “wrong” in front of others, she explained.

Now, in an age when technology allows us to communicate more (if not mostly) via taps of our fingertips, it might seem like it’s easier for those with social anxiety to interact with others. In some ways, it is. But the internet ― and social media in particular ― can also lead to new stressors and a deeper sense of isolation, creating a double-edged sword for the socially anxious.

On the plus side, social media can provide a “safe place” for people with social anxiety to post about themselves in a way that makes them feel comfortable by removing them from the immediacy of in-person conversation, Pavkovic said.

“Social media helps me to express myself in ways that I wouldn’t normally do in person,” Philtrina Farquharson, a PR professional who has social anxiety, explained. “I can say or do whatever I want and be free without reaping immediate consequences, unlike being in social settings.”

Wiercyski, the life coach, had to work through her own discomfort on social media to discover its benefits. She started taking small steps such as liking posts from companies or well-known influencers. “Then I shifted to leaving comments, and started to really build a community,” she says. “I’ve built a whole new community of people I know, trust, support, and who support me.”

But because those with social anxiety can become preoccupied with how they come across to others, they tend to worry excessively about how they’ll be judged online, Pavkovic explained. As a result, people with social anxiety tend to be passive users of social media ― meaning they’ll observe rather than post.

“They’ll scroll through others’ profiles and photos without leaving comments or posting content of their own, and seem to prefer private communication through social media, such as through direct messages,” she said.

Many are familiar with FOMO — fear of missing out — but for those with social anxiety, the feeling can be heightened. martin-dm via Getty Images

Pakovic explained that these online connections don’t replace the benefits of offline friendships, though.

“Even virtual connections still require some level of back-and-forth,” Pakovic explained, “and given what we know about social media usage by individuals with social anxiety, they may not provide enough of that in order to form strong enough virtual friendships.”

“Science leaves us with no doubt that human beings require direct, live, face-to-face connections with other human beings in order to grow and develop to our full potential,” she said.

Research suggests that high social media use might prevent people from pursuing face-to-face interaction. Thomas Rodebaugh, a researcher at Washington University in St. Louis who focuses on social anxiety disorder, explained, “Some of our data shows that people spend time online as a way of avoiding interactions they might have otherwise.” Pursuing those interactions, he said, is key to overcoming feelings of anxiety around social interaction.

Finally, social media can make people with social anxiety feel even more left out. While we all experience FOMO ― or “fear of missing out” ― those with social anxiety can feel it to an extreme.

Jenna Salerno, a content writer for a technology company who also has social anxiety, says that in the past she spent too much time on social media and became overly focused on comparing her life to others’.

“Looking at friends who are out on a Friday night while I’m in bed scrolling through my news feed alone didn’t make me feel like I was living,” she said.

She’s now using social media less and less. “I find spending time with people in my real life is more important than watching from the sidelines,” Salerno said.

Wiercyski’s advice for others dealing with social anxiety in a technology-centric world: “Like most things in life, the basic rule is, if it’s not making you feel better, or you find it’s all you can think about, it’s time to take a break,” she said.

If you realize you’re feeling worse after using social media, or you simply don’t like how much time you’re spending on it, those are red flags you might want to cut back, Rodebaugh said. But know that reducing your social media dependency (just like quitting sugar, alcohol, or cigarettes) is not an easy task, Pavkovic said.

First and foremost, focus on “reconnecting with humans and nature,” she suggests. “Start off by arranging to spend quality one-on-one time with a friend, even if it’s just one friend a time.”

Next, try out some science-backed “brain hacks” that may help reduce your device usage, Pavkovic said. Some examples: Turn off all notifications to avoid those distracting “pings,” change your phone screen to greyscale to reduce the visual stimulation, or keep the phone in an adjacent room so that it doesn’t lure away your attention (even when it’s off!).

Finally, Pavkovic highly recommends deleting all social media apps from our phones, which prevents you from mindlessly opening the apps whenever you need a “quick fix.”

Wiercyski said that a few times a month, she’ll notice an anxious feeling while scrolling through her Instagram feed and comparing what she sees to her own life. “At that point, I know it’s time to sign off,” she said, “even if only for the evening, and focus on something else, like hanging out with friends or reading.”

Five years ago, a show about a small-town couple running a real estate and home design business while raising their four children premiered on HGTV. “Fixer Upper” quickly became Texas’ most prized possession, shoveling in ratings and setting a new (but probably painted antique white) bar for home improvement television.

If HGTV was once a destination for wallpaper television, the kind of programming that played pleasantly in the background of your home for hours on end, the Gaineses made it something else ― a purveyor of a new and improved kind of “ubiquity TV” that didn’t just stream on your screen. With books and decor lines, a physical mecca in Texas and near-constant paparazzi coverage of its stars, “Fixer Upper” was everywhere, so firmly lodged in the pop culture landscape that it was hardly just wall dressing.

This week, the cultural phenomenon that was “Fixer Upper” came to an end after five seasons on the network. Now, diehard viewers are left wondering: How did a show about remodeling captivate our attention for so long? And how will HGTV fill the farmhouse-shaped hole in its programming? HuffPost spoke to a few HGTV representatives and professionals in the world of home improvement entertainment to find out.

In a nutshell, Chip and Joanna Gaines represented exactly what Scripps Network (now under Discovery) was looking for at the time: compelling, character-driven content for a channel previously populated only by background noise. The story of charismatic, goofy Chip and his style-minded, shiplap-loving wife, Jo, wasn’t just meant to be viewed in bulk on the weekends, the low-volume hum of equipment dulling your tired senses. It was meant to be appointment television, wooing viewers eager to catch up with the Gaineses to a steady Tuesday night slot.

“We’ve moved beyond where I think the network was in terms of being wallpaper programming,” Allison Page, the general manager of programming at HGTV, told HuffPost. “I don’t say that submissively, because it was very successful to have the network be something that people just wanted on in the background, and I think it still works on that level, but I think now that we have true stars and real hits, those have become more appointment programming.”

So what are the markings of appointment programming in the home improvement realm?

“These programs are about redemption and hope,” Page said. “They’re about making something beautiful, they’re about fixing what is broken [and] honoring the history of something while making it work in the present day. They’re stories about pride in the work and essentially building communities and creating spaces where people can live their best lives.”

Between unexpected reno complications and subway tile selection, Chip and Joanna offered glimpses of their personalities, values and life at home with their “kiddos.” They became full-fledged characters on-screen, and their partnership proved irresistible for viewers.

The Gaineses harnessed the “redemption and hope” narrative better than most ― to their own advantage. “No one gets it more than Chip and Jo. That show did for them what everyone knows it’s done for them,” explained John Feld, senior vice president of HGTV programming. “They have this incredibly thriving business in Waco now, and that’s the benefit. ... We put them in a situation which was like, ‘Can you give us this amount of episodes and a few more next season?’ And they knew what the benefit of that would be and they worked twice as hard.”

Indeed, Chip and Jo’s combination of personality and design aesthetics ― Farmhouse sinks! Wood beams! Concrete countertops! Motivational wall art! ― captivated fans well beyond the HGTV platform. Viewers were first introduced to the Gaines family through their Magnolia renovation and design business. During their time on the network, the family would go on to launch the large Magnolia Market in Waco, home to their bakery, the Silos Baking Co., where people can shop or relax in a physical environment carefully curated by the Gaineses. The duo also released their own seasonal lifestyle magazine, Magnolia Journal, and just last month opened a breakfast joint, Magnolia Table, to rave reviews.

On top of that, they have a home decor line at Target, and their books The Magnolia Story, Capital Gaines and the upcoming Magnolia Table have (or likely will) all hit The New York Times bestseller list.

But it wasn’t Chip and Jo who approached HGTV with the idea of “Fixer Upper.” The idea to take on the worst house in the best neighborhood and make it a client’s dream home ― that was the network’s.

“We knew we wanted to make a show called ‘Fixer Upper’ that basically followed a real-life family-owned company where people were working with homeowners to find the worst house on the block and make it the most beautiful house on the block,” Page explained. “We gave the production company casting money, and then they hired scouts and used their own internal teams to set a really wide net.”

The team’s casting department eventually found a blog post featuring Joanna’s work and filmed a demo reel with her and her husband, who ended up booking the gig due to their requisite skill set, natural on-air chemistry and prime location.

“One of the values we thought would be compelling in a show like this would be being in a smaller town where there’s a very strong sense of community and where housing prices are reasonable. That’s part of the ethos of HGTV,” Page said. “While we do occasionally shoot in New York or LA, a larger percentage of our programming is somewhere in the middle.”

As a result, the Gaineses have provided not only themselves with an exorbitant amount of, well, wealth, but have made Waco a Disneyland-like destination for home and design obsessives. Over 30,000 people flock weekly to Magnolia Market. In its first week alone, Magnolia Table and its menu of tater tots, lemon-lavender doughnut holes and avocado toast drew crowds of hundreds. It’s no wonder that the couple decided now was an ideal time to hang up their on-screen tool belts.

“We’re just going to take a break, we’re going to enjoy our family, we’re going to step back, really focus on our businesses, and what God has blessed us with, and then we just can’t wait to see what the future holds. We really are extremely optimistic,” Chip told HuffPost last fall.

Of course, while Chip and Jo excelled beyond imagination in the world of lifestyle programming, HGTV amassed a healthy roster of ubiquity TV talent outside of “Fixer Upper” (like “Property Brothers” Jonathan and Drew Scott, who predate the Gaineses on the network’s roster).

″‘Fixer Upper’ took it to another level, but I think we built a foundation of a few hit shows,” Page said, recalling the first iteration of “Flip or Flop,” which also became optimal viewing thanks to its now-divorced hosts, Tarek and Christina El Moussa. (The show launched a franchise with six new iterations.)

“Beyond that, I think now we have ‘Home Town’ [with Ben and Erin Napier] and ‘Good Bones’ [with Karen E. Laine and Mina Starsiak] showing that same kind of intent of view, so we’re absolutely just trying to build on that, with all the other chapters of ‘Flip or Flop,’ knowing that we trained an audience to know there was going to be a premiere episode on Thursdays for 52 weeks a year rather than 20 weeks a year.”

In other words, HGTV is staying focused on talent-driven shows in the same vein as “Fixer Upper.” But professionals in the home-building and design worlds would like to see the network switch things up a bit, or try going back to the gimmick-free, wallpaper basics.

New York-based interior designer Rayman Boozer of Apartment 48 says he’d like to see a “Design 101” type of program where viewers can simply get the useful home improvement information they need.

“I’d love to see a reboot of ‘Dear Genevieve,’ or something similar,” he told HuffPost, referencing “Trading Spaces” alum Genevieve Gorder’s show, in which she helped lucky homeowners redesign a run-down space in their house. “I’d also like to see a show that goes back to basics: Show a real-life interior designer providing realistic ― cost-effective and available ― advice and sources. In each episode, the viewers could explore fabric showrooms, furniture and flooring shops, etc. No gimmicks.”

Amber Lewis, on the other hand, wants the network to feature higher-budget homes and convey the often-pricey truth about construction, real estate and design.

“In my opinion, the biggest problem with HGTV is that it’s completely unrealistic. The budgets are so under market value for what it actually costs to get work done,” the CEO and lead designer of California-based Amber Interiors told HuffPost. “It would be refreshing for them to update their price points and get with the times! No bathroom costs $5,000 to completely remodel, and not a single kitchen on earth can be remodeled in a couple weekends with a $10,000 budget! How about high-end, large-budget projects and a host that shows the back end of how that’s done, almost like a ‘Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,’ just no Robin Leach, or caviar wishes and Champagne dreams!”

For Page and Feld, the most important thing is to give the audience what it wants: an escape.

“The viewers see us as this comfort food, especially in times of upheaval and turmoil and whatever else is going on in the world,” Feld said of the network. “Our goal is just to continue giving them those projects, and especially those people who they can feel are likable and who they trust to do the things that relax them every evening. There’s nothing tense or anxiety-causing in our programming.”

Page agreed.

“What’s so special is this is a channel that’s more than the sum of its parts,” she said. “It’s more about ‘I love HGTV,’ whereas you look across the cable landscape and you’ll see a hit here or a hit there. It’s less often ‘I love this entire meal.’”

Luckily, dessert is still on its way. Beyond the reruns that will inevitably follow the finale, Joanna is set to premiere a new 30-minute series, “Fixer Upper: Behind the Design,” in the coming weeks. Like any good ubiquity TV stars, the Gaineses aren’t really going anywhere.Ortahisar, Nevşehir, Turkey

The lowercase letter “g” has two forms: the “opentail” one most people use, and the “looptail” form commonly seen in print and online in fonts such as Times New Roman and Calibri:

HuffPost

Researchers from Johns Hopkins University found that while everyone can read the looptail g just fine, most people can’t write it or even correctly identify when it’s on its own.

“We think that if we look at something enough, especially if we have to pay attention to its shape as we do during reading, then we would know what it looks like,” Johns Hopkins cognitive scientist Michael McCloskey, the study’s senior author, said in a news release. “But our results suggest that’s not always the case.”

When presented with four versions of it ― three of them incorrect ― 7 out of 25 people were able to pick the right “g.”

“They don’t entirely know what this letter looks like, even though they can read it,” said cognitive science graduate student Gali Ellenblum. “This is not true of letters in general. What’s going on here?”

You can test yourself here:

In another experiment, only 2 of 38 adults named “g” when they were asked to list letters with two lowercase forms, and only one could write both.

“We would say: ‘There’re two forms of g. Can you write them?’ And people would look at us and just stare for a moment because they had no idea,” Kimberly Wong, a junior undergraduate at Johns Hopkins, said in a news release. “Once you really nudged them on, insisting there are two types of g, some would still insist there is no second g.”

In yet another experiment, 16 people were given a paragraph that showed the looptail g 14 times. Respondents were asked to speak each word aloud, then researchers requested that they write the letter. Half wrote the opentail form anyway, and while the rest attempted the looptail g, only one wrote it correctly.

Some researchers have theorized that the economic anxiety of the working class may explain the Trump support, while others cite white Americans’ fears about “cultural displacement.”

Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Clemson University, told HuffPost the key is Christian nationalism.

Christian nationalism is an ideology that fuses Christians’ love of God and country. It hinges on the narrative that the United States has a special covenant with the Christian God.

This ideology has emerged at various times in U.S. history, but a distinct, aggressive iteration seems to have materialized in the Trump era, according to a Think Progress report. This most recent version rejects secular society and seeks to restore America’s identity as a “Christian nation” by leveraging Christians’ influence in the public sphere. Some of Trump’s strongest evangelical supporters believe the president was divinely chosen by God to help them achieve the goal of a Christian nation.

Whitehead said his research indicates that Americans who believed in several key tenets of Christian nationalism had a strong likelihood of voting for Trump. This was true even when the research team controlled for other influences, like political ideology and party affiliation.

The findings suggest that Christian nationalism is a “unique and independent influence” that led to the Trump presidency.

“Christian nationalism provides a metanarrative for a religiously distinct national identity,” the researchers write in an article published in the journal Sociology of Religion in January. “And Americans who embrace this narrative and perceive threats to that identity overwhelmingly voted for Trump.”

Whitehead, working alongside sociologists Joseph O. Baker, of East Tennessee State University, and Samuel L. Perry, of the University of Oklahoma, used data from the latest Baylor Religion Survey. This wide-ranging, mailed survey was conducted months after the 2016 election, from Feb. 2 to March 24, 2017. It included a national, random sampling of 1,501 American adults.

The researchers used participants’ responses to six statements to measure affinity to Christian nationalism:

“The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation.”

“The federal government should advocate Christian values.”

“The federal government should enforce strict separation of church and state.”

“The federal government should allow the display of religious symbols in public spaces.”

“The success of the United States is part of God’s plan.”

“The federal government should allow prayer in public schools.”

The researchers included a few control variables, including responses to the Baylor survey that measured participants’ economic satisfaction, sexism, racism, attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and views of Muslims. To make sure that Christian nationalism isn’t acting as a proxy for political conservatism or religiosity, the team also included controls for things like party affiliation, conservative religious beliefs and religious practice.

What they found was that, even after controlling for these other influences, Americans who supported five of those statements and rejected the one on church-state separation were much more likely to have voted for Trump.

While political identity and race were the overall strongest predictors of Trump votes, the researchers found that Christian nationalism was the most significant religious predictor. The ideology also had an effect across party lines.

For example, a Democrat who held views consistent with Christian nationalism was three times more likely to vote for Trump than a Democrat who didn’t hold such views. On the other hand, Republicans who scored low on the Christian nationalism index were less likely to vote for Trump.

Whitehead told HuffPost that voting for Trump was an outlet for what Christian nationalists perceived as the religious backsliding of the country. It also allowed them access to the most powerful position in the world: the U.S. presidency.

Before the election, the Trump campaign put together an advisory board of some of the nation’s top evangelical leaders to provide feedback on issues that are important to evangelicals. After the election, the group has taken on a more informal role, but key leaders maintain close ties to the administration and are regularly asked to provide their opinions.

Access to this type of power leads Christian nationalists to “forgive and forget all sorts of moral shortcomings,” Whitehead told HuffPost.

That’s why he’s doubtful that Christian nationalists’ support for Trump will be shaken by allegations of infidelity, such as those brought forward by adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Daniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, about a year after Trump and his wife, Melania, were married.)

“For Christian nationalists, the end goal is a society that favors Christianity in various aspects and at a number of institutional levels,” Whitehead told HuffPost. “How that project is achieved is of little consequence to them. They believe God can use anyone, ‘even a thrice married, non-pious, self-proclaimed public playboy,’ as we say in the paper.”

Robert Jones, CEO of The Public Religion Research Institute, told HuffPost that Whitehead’s study is consistent with his own research. In The End of White Christian America, Jones wrote that evangelicals have recently grown anxious about the declining dominance of white Christianity in America, both demographically and on such culture war issues as same-sex marriage.

It’s important to acknowledge that the nationalism Whitehead documents in the study is not just Christian, he said, but specifically white Protestant Christian.

“The idea of a Christian nation in American history has always been wrapped up with protecting the power of whiteness and Protestantism,” Jones said. “The KKK, for example, targeted not just African-Americans but also Catholics and Jews as threats to their ideal of American society. And this study presents one more important piece of empirical evidence that this idea is still with us.”

Penny Edgell, a sociologist of American religion at the University of Minnesota, also pointed out how the study illustrates the connections between race and religion in the U.S. Edgell, who reviewed Whitehead’s research for the Sociology of Religion, said the study shows why scholars and the media need to stop treating American evangelicalism as a unified whole.

“As social groups, White evangelicals, Latinx evangelicals, and African-American evangelicals largely go to different churches, belong to different non-church religious organizations and networks, vote differently, have different policy preferences, have different political ideologies, and understand contemporary social problems (like racism and economic inequality) very differently,” Edgell wrote in an email. “By implying more unity than actually exists, media and scholarly accounts that talk about ‘evangelicals’ as a group generally privilege the views and experiences of White evangelicals. And that’s a problem.”

Another strong predictor of a vote for Trump in Whitehead’s study was anti-Muslim sentiment. The researchers were able to measure the survey participants’ attitudes toward Muslims by analyzing their responses to the following statements:

“Refugees from the Middle East pose a terrorist threat to the United States.”

“Muslims hold values that are morally inferior to the values of people like me.”

“Muslims want to limit the personal freedoms of people like me.”

“Muslims endanger the physical safety of people like me.”

Whitehead and the other sociologists involved in the study found that anti-Muslim sentiment was strongly correlated with Christian nationalism.

Paul Froese, director of the Baylor Religion Surveys, told HuffPost that Christian nationalism has long been used as a pillar of anti-immigration sentiment in American politics. In the 1950s, Christian nationalists used this ideology to help inspire anti-Communist sentiment, arguing that communism threatened to make the U.S. both socialist and atheist.

“With anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. at an all-time high, I expect that Christian nationalism will be used to justify fighting Islam around the world (perhaps as we tried to battle communism during the Cold War),” Froese told HuffPost.

Although white Christian America is in demographic decline, the researchers believe Christian nationalism is not reducible to or strictly defined by white Protestant Christianity. As a result, this ideology can influence narratives and actions beyond institutional religion.

Whitehead said this means that, even though the number of white Protestant Christians is decreasing in America, Christian nationalism will continue to play an important role in American politics.

″[Christian nationalism] is a religious cultural expression that is not beholden to any particular religious tradition,” Whitehead said. “Therefore, even as white Christian America continues to decline demographically, Christian nationalism will continue to be a force in social life and political life.”

Rev. Jim Wallis, a progressive evangelical activist, told HuffPost that Christian nationalism has done “tremendous damage” to the overarching mission of evangelical Christianity, which he believes is to bring “justice to the poor and oppressed.”

White evangelicals have a responsibility to make racial justice central to their faith, he said.
