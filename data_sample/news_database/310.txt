Rivera said her time on stage was “a dream come true” and thanked the Recording Academy for inviting her and adding “a touch of sensuality” to the ceremony.

“Joy and satisfaction, that’s how I describe my feelings in this instant,” she wrote in Spanish in an Instagram caption on Monday. “Last night I lived another memorable moment in my life, in which the world’s eyes were set on Puerto Rico. An island that has suffered like never before this past year but an island that keeps bringing talent and joy to the rest of the world through art.”

The Puerto Rican beauty queen then addressed her critics.

“P.S. (The day that all of those who have given negative criticism step on a Grammy stage, is the day their opinions will count. Meanwhile, stay looking pretty sitting on the other side of the television screen),” she wrote.

Despite the criticism, a lot of people were very excited to see Rivera on stage and applauded her participation in the ceremony.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― The State of the Union is one of the most predictable set pieces of political theater in the United States. Washington’s partisan divide will be easily evident by who sits and who stands and claps. Some octogenarian senator will be caught asleep on camera. A military widow or a wounded soldier will be used as justification for continued overseas military operations ― and easy applause. No one will remember what policies were proposed. The opposition party response will doom the career of whoever gives it.

And the president will declare, with much unnecessary buildup, that the state of the union is “strong.”

That is unless you happen to be Gerald Ford (R), the 38th president of the United States.

In January 1975, five months after acceding to the presidency in the wake of Richard Nixon’s (R) resignation, Ford gave his first State of the Union address. He recounted how when he was a freshman congressman from Michigan he sat in the House and witnessed President Harry Truman (D) declare that the state of the union was “good.”

“Today, that freshman member from Michigan stands where Mr. Truman stood, and I must say to you that the state of the union is not good,” Ford said.

Not good was an understatement. The nation was in the middle of a long recession, inflation ran wild, factories closed, crime rates soared and energy shocks and long gas lines were a recent memory. The continued debate over Nixon’s extreme corruption, which Ford had labeled “our long national nightmare,” still raged. And this is not to mention the continued revelations by congressional investigators about how the nation’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely broke the law to undermine the civil and political rights of Americans.

Still, “not good” is the most negative state a president has ever said the union has been in, according to the history of State of the Union addresses delivered to Congress.

Not every president has opined on what the state of the union is in his State of the Union addresses, but those who did had never dared declare it anything less than “challenged,” as Lyndon Johnson (D) did in 1968. Ford actually leveled with the American people and said that, in truth, the state of the union was “not good.”

No president has ever risked doing so again. Ford lost the election the next year to Jimmy Carter (D), previously the little-known governor of Georgia. (Although not a State of the Union address, Carter would make the same “mistake” in 1980 in his much-maligned “malaise speech.”)

Since 1981, there has been a marked rise in the presidential declaration that the state of the union is “strong.” Ronald Reagan (R) declared the state of the union to be “strong” or “stronger” in four of his seven addresses. George H.W. Bush (R) said the state of the union was “strong” only once; he lost re-election.

Bill Clinton (D) really formalized the use of the word “strong” in the address. In all seven of his State of the Union addresses, Clinton declared the state of the union to be “strong” or “growing stronger.” Since then, every State of the Union address from George W. Bush (R) and Barack Obama (D) has declared that the state of the union is strong, to some extent.

The White House has already announced that President Donald Trump will declare on Tuesday that the state of the union is “strong.”

The American people will have to wait 500 (fictional) years for another dose of negativity in the form of President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho telling them he knows “shit is bad right now with all that starving bullshit.”Carlos Barria / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Tuesday backed the release of a controversial GOP-authored memo suggesting misconduct at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department. But he argued he’s actually protecting the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation ― the very things Republicans have already tried to use the memo to undermine.

Ryan told reporters Tuesday he supports the release of the GOP-authored House Intelligence Committee memo, despite the objections of the Justice Department, because there are “legitimate questions” about whether the civil liberties of a particular U.S. citizen were violated. Ryan said he sees the issues raised in the memo as “a completely separate matter from Bob Mueller’s investigation.”

The only problem: Republicans have been citing this same memo in an effort to erode confidence in the FBI and Mueller’s probe, which has already resulted in criminal charges or guilty pleas from four Trump aides.

GOP members have engaged in a lengthy campaign to suggest there was a broad conspiracy within the nation’s premier law enforcement agency to undermine Donald Trump. Some of the president’s favorite Fox News programs ― “Fox & Friends,” “Justice with Judge Jeanine” and “Hannity” ― have amplified those claims in an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion with Russia during the 2016 election and obstruction of justice from Trump and his team.

Democrats have tried to combat this campaign by preparing their own memo which, they say, puts some of the claims of the GOP document into broader context. But Republicans have blocked Democratic attempts to release that memo side-by-side with the GOP one.

On Monday, Sean Hannity said the supposed conspiracy against Trump “makes Watergate look like stealing a Snickers bar.” Sara Carter, a Fox News contributor whose blog posts about the GOP memo on her personal website have been widely shared in conservative circles, agreed with his assessment. “Absolutely!” she said. And Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) told HuffPost on Monday night that the GOP memo reveals conduct that was “worse than Watergate.”

When HuffPost asked King why he wouldn’t want to release the Democratic memo as well in that case, King ― with no apparent irony ― said the Democratic document is an attempt to “blur and obfuscate the issue.”

Ryan urged GOP members during a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning not to overstate the conclusions of the memo and not to tie Mueller’s investigation with the memo, which reportedly suggests that the FBI and Justice Department may have misused their authority to secure a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to surveil Trump campaign official Carter Page.

“Because of all the loose political rhetoric floating around here, we need to make sure we explain that there is a separation between these things,” Ryan told reporters.

The speaker said he had four points about the memo ― points he also made to members earlier in the morning. Ryan said he wants the document released (1) because of the questions about violating an American’s civil liberties, (2) because this was separate from the Mueller investigation, (3) because there may have been “malfeasance” at the FBI, and (4) because it’s important for the public to be able to trust the Department of Justice and the FBI.

But the public won’t be able to see the underlying documents that Republicans insist show FISA abuse. Rather, they’ll have to rely on the assertions of Republican staffers.

Even Trump administration officials say House Republicans may not be the most reliable narrators. Last week, a Trump administration official at the Justice Department wrote in a letter that the department was “unaware of any wrongdoing relating to the FISA process.” The letter called the potential release of the memo an “unprecedented” and “extraordinarily reckless” action that risks “harm to national security and to ongoing investigations.”

DOJ has been mum on the issue now that Republicans have voted to release the memo. A department spokesperson told HuffPost they had no statement.

FBI supporters told HuffPost they’re concerned about the detrimental effects of the campaign against the bureau. And indeed, there’s evidence it has already swung public opinion.

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll shows that the percentage of Republicans saying they trust the bureau has dropped by 22 points since 2015, while trust among independents has dropped about 15 points. Despite Hillary Clinton’s assertion that former FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into her email server cost her the election, Democratic trust in the bureau is roughly the same in 2018 as it was in 2015. Just 10 percent of Republicans now have a great deal of trust in the FBI, compared to 30 percent of Democrats.

When asked Tuesday why he supports releasing the Republican document but not the Democratic memo, Ryan said Republicans are following the declassification process.

“I would remind you that the Democrats tried blocking the rest of the members of Congress from even having access to the memo that the majority wrote,” Ryan said.

Asked again why Congress wouldn’t release both documents at the same time, Ryan said it was “ironic” that the majority voted to actually give access to this memo alleging FISA abuse, while the minority voted to deny that access. “So I think the irony is a little rich here these days,” the speaker said.Seth Meyers took an in-depth look into the growing case that President Donald Trump obstructed justice on Monday’s broadcast of “Late Night.”

And there was one particular detail that Meyers couldn’t quite believe.

Namely, that in May 2017, Trump reportedly mocked the wife of then-acting FBI director Andrew McCabe for her failure to win a Virginia state Senate seat two years previously.

Per NBC News, Trump suggested McCabe “ask his wife how it feels to be a loser” during a telephone call, which he made the day after firing James Comey as director of the bureau.

“You told him to ask his wife what it’s like to be a loser?” asked Meyers. “You should ask your wife what it’s like to be married to one!”

“Awful,” Meyers added. “You are awful.”

AdvertisementAlden Ehrenreich, the actor playing young Han Solo in “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” got pranked by none other than original Han Solo himself.

Actor Harrison Ford recently snuck up on Ehrenreich during an interview with “Entertainment Tonight.”

“You’re shitting me,” Ehrenreich said as Ford appeared next to him. “Oh my God.”

“Get out of my chair,” Ford deadpanned. “Get out of my life!”

Ford then gushed about Ehrenreich’s performance in the role he originated, calling it “spectacular.”

Even “Solo” director Ron Howard was surprised by the extent of the praise.

“I have to say, I’ve known Harrison a long time,” Howard told ET. “He can be great, he can be supportive. He’s never effusive.”

On Tuesday morning, the British singer shared this snap of herself dressed up as the country music star to Twitter:

“We love you!” Adele wrote about Parton. “We wish We could possess an ounce of your ability.” She also described Patron, whose hits include “Jolene,” as “a hero of my life.”

Here’s a picture of Parton for comparison:

Similar, right?

It’s unclear what prompted Adele’s dress-up session. Parton has yet to respond.

The two stars are known to be big fans of each other.

“I love her! I would love to do something with her. I just love her. I love how she looks, I love how she sings, I love how she Is,” Parton told Digital Spy of Adele in 2016.

During that interview, Parton also touted a potential collaboration between the two. Time will tell if Adele’s new picture is related to that possibility.

Tweeters, meanwhile, appeared to enjoy the image:

Quelling someone else’s temper tantrums isn’t something most of us have to worry about until we actually have small children. But Arie Luyendyk Jr., the current titular bachelor, claims to want a wife and family stat, so perhaps it’s appropriate that he had to test his own tantrum-defusing skills on Monday night’s episode.

The meltdown took place on a bowling group date. Two groups of women competed to win the right to attend an evening soirée with Arie, but he had second thoughts after seeing the losing team’s disappointment and invited them as well. Krystal, the season’s villain, was infuriated that her hard-won advantage had been easily taken away. On the drive back to the hotel, according to several other bachelorettes, she called Arie a liar for changing his mind. Back at the hotel, she changed into a robe while the other women primped, then dramatically announced she wouldn’t be going. “My bags are packed,” she said.

Krystal’s feelings of disappointment may have been valid, but everyone seemed to agree ― both on the show and in the Twitter commentariat ― that her reaction came off as selfish and manipulative, designed to grab Arie’s attention and force him to spend time away from the group smoothing things over with her.

But this raises the question: What would be the optimal way for Arie to handle such a stunt? Should he have left her alone all night to stew? Should he have taken her hurt seriously and tried to comfort her? Or should he have confronted her and let her know that throwing a fit would get her nowhere?

Arie chose the latter option, leaving the other women at the evening party to talk to a spa robe-clad Krystal in her hotel room ― and lay down the law. “I think you should stay up here tonight,” he told her. “Know that I’m not happy about [your behavior].”

Now, there’s something undeniably icky about the the bachelor, a man who is, in theory, dating and pursuing a possible long-term relationship with each of these women, chastising one of them like she’s a misbehaving toddler. It’s hardly an equal dynamic. But it’s also gratifying to see the lead resist the impulse to cater to a contestant’s bad behavior ― she was, after all, acting like a petulant child.

So what was the right way to handle Krystal’s power sulk?

On HuffPost’s “Here to Make Friends,” we discussed all this and more with actress and “Bachelor” superfan Erin Darke:

Claire Fallon: So Arie says, “I think the right thing for me to do is probably check on her. I don’t wanna disrespect you guys by going up, but she has such strong feelings so I should probably address it.”

Erin Darke: By the way, I don’t think that was the right thing to do.

Claire: I’m torn.

Emma Gray: I’m torn too.

Erin: I think if someone is throwing a temper tantrum, and you have nine other women in front of you who aren’t throwing a temper tantrum, you spend the time with them.

Emma: I agree, but I think that part of what he was doing was shutting her down when he went to talk to her.

Erin: He didn’t shut her down! She came back down an hour later!

Claire: He told her not to come down. He went up and was like, do not come down. And she did it anyway, but he told her not to.

Erin: But he gave her exactly what she wanted.

Claire: What she wanted was for him to go up there and beg her to come back down.

Erin: But she also just wanted attention.

Emma: But she wanted it to work in her favor, and instead he’s so much less into her.

Erin: He said, “I don’t want to be disrespectful to you,” [to the other women], but I do think it was disrespectful, because he just left those nine women sitting on this couch in the W Hotel for god knows how long while he went and talked to the girl in the robe.

Emma: I also wonder, though, if it’s partially that he knew he was gonna have to have this conversation at some point. There’s no way the producers were gonna let him not confront Krystal in this moment.

Claire: If I were him I might just want to get this over with, so that I’m not thinking about it.

Erin: Maybe with another person it would have worked more. Arie’s like a dating robot. You can feel him processing information and then going like, “What would a human do next?” There’s a 10-second lag between everything he says.

Claire: I also just wanted to point out again that Krystal is in a robe when Arie shows up but her hair and makeup are perfect.

Emma: Oh she has been preparing for this moment, which is why I enjoyed that he did shut her down. At one point he says, “It’s just bowling.”

Claire: And she says, “It wasn’t just that, you know that.” Why would you say that? He literally just told you it was just bowling.

Erin: But then he also says to her, “You know me better than anyone else here,” which just encourages her. He said it at least twice.

Claire: I feel like it was a way of reprimanding her, though. Like, “you’ve had more opportunity than anyone else to know me, and yet you can’t trust me, you can’t treat me respectfully. It’s not that I haven’t given you what you need in order to treat me better.”

Erin: She’s seen his home videos. [All laugh.]

Claire: So Krystal says to Arie, “I felt very passionate and I felt very hurt and I said things out of hurt and I don’t feel like I know anything about you.” And that’s when he’s like, “You know more about me than anyone.” And she’s like, “I know, but I need more.” And he says, “If you were downstairs, we’d be able to talk about it, but this is what couples can’t do, run away from their problems, and when things like this happen, it makes me pull back.”

Emma: I thought this was a valid point on his end.

Claire: Then he says, “I think you should just stay up here tonight, I’m gonna go down and hang out with everyone else. Know that I’m not happy about it. I’ll see you in a couple days.” And he just kinda leaves. He doesn’t give her another hug or anything. If I was Krystal here ― and I’ve been the girl who picks a fight to get attention ― that would not be a reaction I would be happy with. I would be like, I was hoping to get validation out of it, and instead he is treating me more coldly than he ever has.

Erin: It’s funny, because when you read that dialogue back, I was like, “Oh yeah, those are really intelligent things to say.” But when I hear Arie say them, I just wanna bang my head against a wall. But that is exactly how you should respond in that situation!

The Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony-winning record producer sat down with GQ for a wide-ranging interview about his career, his childhood on the South Side of Chicago and the current music scene. And boy, he did not hold back.

When asked about the biggest musicians of the moment, Jones voiced his approval for several artists, including Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars and Mary J. Blige. But when pressed on the subject of Taylor Swift, Jones made a face.

“We need more songs, man,” Jones told GQ. “Fucking songs, not hooks.”

Interviewer Chris Heath reminds Jones that some people consider Swift “the great songwriter of our age.”

“Whatever crumbles your cookie,” Jones laughs.

Forget “I don’t know her.” Forget “Ask Taylor.” “Whatever crumbles your cookie” is now the shadiest sentence of our time.

That said, Jones’ opinion of Swift’s music wasn’t the only fascinating tidbit in the interview, which you can read in full here. Here are seven more unbelievable moments from Jones’ off-the-wall GQ profile.

1. Jones says he has 22 girlfriends across the world.

“Hell yeah. Everywhere,” Jones said. “Cape Town. Cairo. Stockholm—she’s coming in next week. Brazil—Belo Horizonte, São Paulo, and Rio. Shanghai—got a great girl over there from Shanghai, man. Cairo, whew.”

2. ...and he would never consider dating a woman his own age.

“You gotta be kidding,” Jones said. “I got me some technology out there that keep fat and old away from here. Buzzes if they’re too old.”

Jones tweeted an apology for his comments before the article’s publication. “The comments were insensitive and inappropriate and I sincerely apologize for them,” Jones wrote.

3. His daughter Rashida Jones was bitten by Michael Jackson’s chimpanzee Bubbles.

″...the chimpanzee, whatever the f**k it was, he was a pain in the ass,” Jones said. “He bit Rashida. My poor baby.”

4. He once complimented the Pope on his “pimp shoes.”

“He had on some burgundy wingtips, man, with thin tan rib socks, man,” Jones told GQ. “We had to go and kiss his hand before we left. And when I kissed his hand, I looked down and saw those shoes and it just fell out of my mouth. I said, ‘Oh, my man’s got some pimp shoes on.’ And he heard me.”

5. He survived a car crash that killed four of his friends when he was a teenager.

“A little raggedy-ass car,” Jones described. “Two up front and three in the back. I’m in the center. Trailways bus hit us. Everybody in the car died except for me. Reached up and pulled my friend, and his head fell off. That’s fucked-up for 14. It was very traumatic.”

6. Michael Jackson once told Jones that Prince tried to run him over with his limo.

After giving an embarrassing performance, Prince “told Michael he’d kill him” if Jackson showed the footage to anyone, Jones says.

“Oh yeah, [Prince] spoke to [Jackson]. [Prince] waited in the limousine to try and run over him and La Toya and his mother,” Jones added.

7. Jones was supposed to be at Sharon Tate’s house the night she and four of her guests were brutally murdered.Erik Killmonger of “Black Panther” is unlike any character Michael B. Jordan has played before.

He’s a menacingly calculated villain who you can’t help but root for just a little bit. In Jordan’s words, he’s a “revolutionary.”

“I think some of the most interesting characters are the ones you can empathize with,” the 30-year-old actor told HuffPost. “And if we can get people to empathize and see Erik Killmonger’s POV, I think we can make for an interesting film.”

Jordan gained 20 pounds and grew out his hair in preparation for the film. He also kept a journal ― something he does for all of his roles, he said ― and often found himself in a “dark” place. But he’s OK with that.

“That process was pretty intense, a little darker than the usual character that I play,” he said. “It was a side of me that I don’t get a chance to indulge in often and it was a lot of fun.”

Jordan showcases some of the work that went into his role in a new video highlighting the importance of paying it forward to other artists. In partnership with Brisk and his production company, Outlier Society, Jordan stepped behind the camera to combine his passions of acting, directing and helping other artists.

“I wouldn’t have the opportunities that I have today if it wasn’t for the actors that came before me and the producers and the directors that opened up these doors,” he said. “So I’ve always took the stance that when I had the opportunity to do the same thing, I would pay it forward also.”

Director Ryan Coogler, who worked with Jordan on “Fruitvale Station” and “Creed” as well as “Black Panther,” was one of the people who pushed the actor to try his hand at directing.

“He’s a guy that told me, like, ‘Mike, yes, start directing. It’s never gonna be the perfect time, you just gotta do it,’” Jordan said.

“Black Panther,” which hits theaters Feb. 16, has already broken Marvel Universe records for presales. The film also has an almost all-black cast and crew, something rare for a feature of its scale.

“I love going to work every day in general but [there’s] something special about going to set to be in that environment,” Jordan said. “It was an incredible feeling to work with that cast and to tell that story, so it was a feeling I’ve never really had before on set.”“Glee” star Mark Salling, who faced sentencing in March on child pornography charges, was found dead Tuesday in Los Angeles, his attorney confirmed to HuffPost. He was 35.

“I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning,” attorney Michael Procter said in a statement. “Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment. He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected.”

A Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson told HuffPost that authorities responded to a reported death in the 11900 block of Big Tujunga Canyon Road at 8:50 a.m. Tuesday, but wouldn’t identify the person. TMZ, citing unnamed law enforcement officials, was first to report Salling’s death as a suicide.

Salling, who played Noah “Puck” Puckerman on “Glee,” faced up to seven years in prison after pleading guilty in October to possessing child pornography involving prepubescent minors. A plea deal required him to register as a sex offender, enter a treatment program and pay $50,000 to each victim who requested compensation. He was also forbidden from contacting anyone under 18 without a parent or guardian present, and was barred from going within 100 feet of public parks and schoolyards.

Salling’s sentencing hearing was set for March 7.

In December 2015, the actor was arrested on suspicion of possessing images of underage girls, along with two videos, on his personal computer. Authorities found tens of thousands of images depicting children as young as 2, according to court documents.

Salling also faced legal conflicts over sexual assault accusations. A former girlfriend, Roxanne Gorzela, sued the actor in 2013 for allegedly forcing her into unprotected sex, according to documents obtained first by the New York Daily News and confirmed by People. She also alleged that he pushed her to the ground in an argument over the incident. Salling settled with Gorzela for around $2.7 million in 2015.

Another woman said the actor forced her into sex in 2012 after she revoked her consent. She contacted police in 2016, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declined to file charges, citing insufficient evidence.

Let me be clear. Having compassion for #MarkSalling in no way minimizes his crimes, nor does it minimize the pain and devastation of the victims of those crimes. I'm just saying stop adding to his family's pain. This was their son. If you're without sin, feel free to cast stones. — Tim Davis (@loudmouthmuch) January 30, 2018

Born in Denver on Aug. 17, 1982, Salling found a unique outlet for his lifelong interest in music on “Glee,” a musical comedy series following the members of a high-school glee club that ran for six seasons, concluding in 2015.

“I’ve been doing the whole music thing my whole life ― piano lessons, writing songs, singing and performing,” Salling told talk-show host Wendy Williams in 2009, explaining how he landed the role of Puck, best friend of quarterback Finn Hudson.

“It’s pretty natural,” Salling added.

Finn was played by Corey Monteith, who died in 2013 from a mix of alcohol and heroin.

“Today we lost another Glee cast member,” “Glee” vocal arranger Tim Davis wrote on Twitter, where a debate had brewed over the response to Salling’s death.

“Let me be clear. Having compassion for Mark Salling in no way minimizes his crimes, nor does it minimize the pain and devastation of the victims of those crimes. I’m just saying stop adding to his family’s pain. This was their son. If you’re without sin, feel free to cast stones,” Davis continued.

His comment was reshared by Jane Lynch, who played antagonistic cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester. Approached by TMZ, Lynch called the death “tragic.”

Christie will join ABC News as a contributor, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to HuffPost. The news was first reported Monday by The Star-Ledger.

The famously blunt politician will make his debut as a contributor on Tuesday’s “Good Morning America.” He’ll return to the network later that night to contribute to the coverage of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address.

The former governor, who left office earlier this month after serving eight years, has been a staunch backer of Trump since the presidential campaign. Once Christie dropped his own primary bid, he put his support behind Trump. Even though he was one of the few high-profile campaign surrogates not given a top position in the Trump administration, he’s remained loyal to the president.

The Star-Ledger also reported that ABC would turn to Christie for coverage during the 2018 midterm elections and for his take on Trump voters. A network representative declined to comment to HuffPost.LONDON (Reuters) - CIA Director Mike Pompeo said Russia will target U.S. mid-term elections later this year as part of the Kremlin’s attempt to influence domestic politics across the West, and warned the world had to do more to push back against Chinese meddling.

Russia has been accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the allegations, which Moscow denies, and whether there was any collusion involving President Donald Trump’s associates.

In an interview with the BBC aired on Tuesday, U.S. intelligence chief Pompeo said Russia had a long history of information campaigns and said its threat would not go away.

Asked if Russia would try to influence the mid-term elections, he said: “Of course. I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that.

“But I am confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election. That we’ll push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won’t be great.”

He also said the Chinese posed a threat of equal concern and were “very active” with a world-class cyber capability.

“We can watch very focused efforts to steal American information, to infiltrate the United States with spies, with people who are going to work on behalf of the Chinese government against America,” he said.

“We see it in our schools, in our hospitals and medical systems, we see it throughout corporate America. These efforts we have to all be more focused on. We have to do better at pushing back against Chinese efforts to covertly influence the world.”

GLOBAL INFLUENCE

The Kremlin, which under Vladimir Putin has clawed back some of the global influence lost when the Soviet Union collapsed, has denied meddling in elections in the West. It says anti-Russian hysteria is sweeping through the United States and Europe.

In the interview, Pompeo also repeated his message that North Korea was close to developing missiles which could be used in a nuclear attack on the United States.

“I think that we collectively, the United States and our intelligence partners around the world, have developed a pretty clear understanding of (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un’s capability,” he said.

“We talk about him having the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon to the United States in a matter of a handful of months.”

The CIA chief defended Trump over accusations from a book which suggested the president was unfocused, unprepared and unfit for his office.

“It’s absurd, the claim that the president isn’t engaged and doesn’t have a grasp on these important issues is dangerous and false,” Pompeo said.

Asked if Trump’s use of Twitter posed any national security issues, he said: “Hasn’t caused us any trouble.”The transgender soldier who is set to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address alongside Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) says she won’t be “rooting for, or against, anybody.”

Kennedy, who is the grandson of Robert Kennedy, announced Monday that he’d invited Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King to accompany him in an effort to protest President Donald Trump’s efforts to ban transgender recruits from the U.S. military.

Still, King told TMZ that she plans to attend the address “with an open mind.”

Patricia King represents the best and bravest our nation offers. She will make our Commonwealth and our country proud at the State of the Union on Tuesday night. https://t.co/Y9PgbhZihx — Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) January 28, 2018

“[I’m] hoping I’m going to hear a portrayal of our country that involves directions that I, as a citizen, would like to see,” King said in the above video. “We’re a country that needs to be united, and the goal is for all of us to win.”

King, who is stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington state, first came to terms with her gender identity in 2013 at the end of her last deployment. According to the Boston Globe, she was the first service member to have the military pay for her gender confirmation surgery.

Though it remains to be seen if Trump will make note of LGBTQ issues in any way, King added, “I certainly hope that he remembers us and mentions us.”

AdvertisementAs much as we might like a “Bodyguard” remake starring Kylie Jenner and a former member of her private security team, alas, it was not meant to be.

As photos of the reality TV star and her ex-bodyguard Tim Chung made the internet rounds recently, some people were convinced that not only was he worthy of the name “hot bodyguard,” but he was also the father of Jenner’s new baby girl, Stormi.

Except, by all accounts Jenner and boyfriend Travis Scott welcomed their first daughter together ― albeit in secret ― in February.

Chung, also a Los Angeles Police Department officer, set the record straight once and for all on social media, calling the rumors “incredibly disrespectful.”

“I am a very private person and would normally never answer to gossip and stories that are so ridiculous that they are laughable,” he wrote on Instagram on Saturday. “Out of deep respect for Kylie, Travis, their daughter together and their families, I would like to set the record straight that my interactions with Kylie and her family have been limited in strictly a professional capacity only.”

“There is no story here and I ask that the media no longer include me in any narrative that is incredibly disrespectful to their family,” Chung continued.

Rumors swirled earlier this month that Chung was the father after fans thought they noticed a resemblance between him and the child. Stories about Jenner’s ex-boyfriend Tyga then surfaced saying he, too, believed that Scott was not the baby’s biological father.

The “Rack City” rapper later shut down speculation that he ever suggested there was anything going on between the two outside their working relationship.

“I’ve never said anything about someone else’s child or family insinuating my involvement; and will never do so,” Tyga wrote on Twitter. “Please, Stop spreading false stories and attacking people’s families.”

Never one to let a little controversy get in the way of a good time, Jenner and Scott made their official debut as a couple at the Met Gala last week, three months after welcoming Stormi.

Jenner turned heads (and diverged from the night’s theme) in an Alexander Wang getup complete with tiny sunglasses.

Eduardo Munoz / Reuters

Columbia University’s graduate students voted overwhelmingly to unionize in late 2016, in an election certified by the federal government. But as far as the Ivy League school’s administration is concerned, the whole union thing was just a grad student fantasy ― one that President Donald Trump may help dissipate.

In a letter Tuesday, Provost John H. Coatsworth told the school community that Columbia does not recognize the union’s legitimacy and intends to fight it in court. The school has dragged its feet on bargaining with the union, and Coatsworth’s letter makes clear Columbia will take the fight as far as it can, regardless of any damage the university’s reputation may suffer.

Coatsworth acknowledged the decision to challenge the union wouldn’t be a popular one among students and alumni.

“We recognize the potential, indeed the likelihood, for disappointment and dispute in our community,” he wrote. “Needless to say, we have not come to this decision lightly. Because of the principles at stake ― principles essential to the university’s mission of training scholars ― we have declined to bargain until the legal process has been allowed to run its course.”

Coatsworth said the school will ask a federal appellate court to review the dispute. Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board ― which paved the way for the union ― could come to the school’s rescue under Trump. Indeed, Columbia and other supposedly liberal schools fighting grad student campaigns ― the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and Cornell University among them ― find themselves in the awkward position of hoping the Trump administration will deliver for them.

The NLRB ― in one of its biggest decisions in years ― decided in August 2016 that Columbia graduate students were, in fact, employees of the school, and therefore eligible to unionize. The board determined that it didn’t matter whether the graduate students were there to be educated, as Columbia stressed ― they were paid to do work, which made them employees.

That decision set up the grad-student vote to join the United Auto Workers. And it opened the door for grad students who teach at other private schools to exert their collective bargaining rights.

But the union movement was dealt a major setback with Trump’s election. The president gets to fill open slots on the five-member NLRB, which referees disputes between employers and unions in the private sector. It was a liberal majority that decided the Columbia case in favor of the graduate students. A conservative majority is more likely to side with the schools and determine that grad students are ineligible to unionize.

The board is currently split 2-2 along partisan lines due to the expiration of one member’s term. Once Trump names a fifth member and the Senate approves his pick, a full board may well revive the grad student question and rule instead against the right to unionize. It isn’t uncommon for the board to reverse precedent in a matter of years. In fact, the 2016 Columbia decision had overturned a 2004 ruling against grad students.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has ordered additional law enforcement to investigate allegations of sexual assault at Walker County’s Karolyi Ranch, the former training facility for USA Gymnastics athletes.

Abbott’s Tuesday request asks that the Texas Rangers, a statewide law enforcement agency, join the Walker County Sheriff’s Office in its ongoing investigation.

“The public statements made by athletes who previously trained at the Karolyi Ranch are gut-wrenching,” Abbott said in a statement. “Those athletes, as well as all Texans, deserve to know that no stone is left unturned to ensure that the allegations are thoroughly vetted and the perpetrators and enablers of any such misconduct are brought to justice. The people of Texas demand, and the victims deserve, nothing less.”

USA Gymnastics, which had used Karolyi Ranch as its national team training center since 2001, cut ties with the Huntsville facility earlier this month after more than 140 women came forward with allegations that former team doctor Larry Nassar had sexually abused them, many while at the facility, under the guise of medical treatment.An Alabama law tells teachers to emphasize “that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public.” Barry Rosenthal via Getty Images

In Alabama, a statewide anti-bullying law calls on schools to develop policies that foster environments free of harassment, intimidation and violence.

But for gay students, another state law directly impedes this goal. A different Alabama law calls on health educators to emphasize “that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public.”

Alabama is one of seven states that currently has a law barring teachers from positively portraying homosexuality in schools. These laws, sometimes called “no promo homo” laws, affect nearly 10 million public school students around the country. They work to decrease teachers’ support of these students and limit students’ access to necessary resources, according to a research brief released Tuesday from GLSEN, a nonprofit that works to support LGBTQ students.

These laws range in severity. Some ban educators from broadly portraying homosexual people in a positive light. Others specifically call on educators to omit information or resources that would benefit gay students. In Arizona, when teaching about AIDS, health educators cannot include portrayals of “homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style” or suggest “that some methods of sex are safe methods of homosexual sex,” a law says.

Utah had one of these laws up until July, when it was repealed, but information from the state is still included in the study. Texas, Arizona, Alabama, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi still have these laws. The anti-gay laws in these states operate alongside anti-bullying statutes, which all 50 states have.

At a time when LGBTQ student experiences are improving on many ― but not all ― fronts, these laws represent dark spots of state-sanctioned prejudice.

“So-called ‘No Promo Homo’ laws have a deeply disturbing chilling effect. However narrow the actual scope of the laws, teachers in states that have them are less likely to allow vital LGBTQ-related content in their classrooms, no matter the topic,” said GLSEN Executive Director Eliza Byard in a news release.

GLSEN mined data from its own surveys of students and teachers along with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study to glean information on what these laws might mean for students.

Although these laws typically apply to health education, they can have spillover effects on an entire school’s attitude toward LGBTQ students, the brief found.

Students in these states reported higher rates of bullying and less peer acceptance after accounting for factors like a state’s demographics and state education spending, but these differences disappeared after accounting for a state’s political leanings, measured as the percent of the population identifying as conservative.

But in other areas, differences remained after accounting for all these outside factors. LGBTQ students in these states still reported having less supportive teachers, less access to Gay Straight Alliance clubs and less comprehensive anti-bullying school policies.

Secondary school teachers in these states ― not just health educators ― also reported using a curriculum that was less likely to represent LGBTQ people or related topics.

And health educators in these states were less likely to report having specific mental health services for gay students, or any recent professional development specific to this population.Wendy Williams was pretty clear about what she thought about the #MeToo movement during her syndicated talk show on Friday.

“I’m sick of this #MeToo movement,” Williams said just over 15 minutes into her daytime show’s “Hot Topics” segment. “I love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it’s got — I look at all men like, ‘You’re a #MeToo.’ All of them. All of them, which is not fair.”

Earlier in the segment, the 53-year-old host also spoke about #MuteRKelly, a campaign started by two women to remove R. Kelly from the music industry.

“What is this, 10 years too late?” Williams said. “It’s not going to work. Black people aren’t really good at protesting. Not since the King march.”

The comment provoked this reaction from an audience member:

"The Wendy Williams Show"

Williams then addressed R. Kelly’s marriage to the late musician Aaliyah when she was 15.

“The #MeToo movement hasn’t affected R. Kelly,” she said. “R. Kelly wasn’t a ‘me too.’ Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.”

Williams also mentioned the R&B singer’s infamous sex tape, saying that the young girl featured in the video “let it go down.” (Kelly’s lawyer called the tape a forgery.)

People on Twitter were especially upset about this comment.

These are GIRLS! They are children. Why does that have to be explained to you! This man URINATED ON AN 8th GRADER and you have the nerve to say it’s HER FAULT!?! @WendyWilliams Have you ever talked to one of his victims?! #muteRKelly @metoo — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) January 26, 2018

Wendy Williams defense of R Kelly on her morning show is the same argument used by Roy Moore supporters. Disgusting; blaming 15 year old children for being attacked by a sexual predator. #WendyWilliams — M.E. Carter (@MeritaC) January 25, 2018

In July, Kelly was also the subject of a BuzzFeed investigation that reported the singer was holding multiple women in an abusive sex cult against their will. Kelly denied the accusations.A gay couple who claimed to have had their marriage recognized in Russia by way of a bureaucratic loophole have gone into hiding after facing legal persecution.

Pavel Stotzko and Eugene Wojciechowski are believed to have left Russia after an apparent standoff with police, The Guardian reported Monday. Members of the local activist group, Russian LGBT Network, said the entrance to Stotzko and Wojciechowski’s Moscow apartment had been blocked over the weekend by officers, who were attempting to confiscate the couple’s passports. The apartment’s electricity and internet access were turned off for several hours, the group wrote on Facebook.

By Monday, the men had handed their passports over to authorities and had relocated to “a safe location,” Russian LGBT Network members wrote in a second Facebook post.

Stotzko and Wojciechowski are believed to have left the country, The Guardian and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty both reported. (All Russians over 16 are required to have internal passports that document their place of residence and marital status. A separate, external passport must be used for foreign travel.)

Human rights activist Igor Kochetkov told The Moscow Times that he’d helped the couple, who had been receiving death threats, to flee.

“The police officers declared openly that they could not protect [the pair] from attacks from homophobically minded citizens and organizations. This was a hidden threat,” Kochetkov said. “Therefore the decision was made that for now, they must leave Russia.”

Stotzko and Wojciechowski were married in Copenhagen on Jan. 4. When they returned to Moscow last week, they presented their passports to a customs officer, along with their Danish marriage certificate. The officer stamped the marital status page in Stotzko and Wojciechowski’s passports and filled their names in.

Russian law states marriages that were registered abroad will be recognized if they do not “contradict article 14 of the Family Code,” according to The Moscow Times. Though polygamous unions and marriages between close relatives are prohibited, the law does not mention same-sex couples.

Hence, the men interpreted their passport stamps as legal recognition of their union. Their story made international headlines and was touted as a rare LGBTQ-rights victory in Russia, where same-sex couples are not permitted to wed.

Their happiness, however, was short-lived. After news of the couple’s story broke this weekend, Russia’s Interior Ministry spokeswoman Irina Volk told RT that Voytsekhovsky and Stotsko’s passports were marked as invalid in a federal database. The customs officer who stamped the passports and her direct supervisor, she added, were fired for “committing violations of Russian legislation.”

Russia’s stance on LGBTQ issues has been the subject of global scrutiny in recent years. In 2013, the country adopted a controversial law forbidding distribution of “gay propaganda” to minors.

Over the past year, lawmakers have repeatedly dismissed troubling allegations that gay men are being detained, tortured and even killed in the Russian republic of Chechnya.Kids truly do say the darndest things. That’s why many parents turn to the app LittleHoots to document these golden quotes.

The news outlet used a Getty Images photo of a turban-wearing Indian soldier ― likely a Sikh ― to accompany the piece headlined “How Terrorism Is Taught Around The World.” And people were not happy.

Social media users and members of the Sikh community spoke out, labeling the outlet “irresponsible” and guilty of perpetuating a false stereotype.

Dear @USNews,



Using this image of a Sikh in your article on 9/11 and terrorism is irresponsible and dangerous. Please take it down quickly. Please also invest in some cultural diversity training to ensure this doesn’t happen again.https://t.co/4aLyTSUQya pic.twitter.com/hDAp8qpwuQ — Simran Jeet Singh (@SikhProf) January 26, 2018

Using the apparent image of a Sikh in this @USNews story examining post 9/11 terrorism is reckless and we will be seeking a correction and apology immediately https://t.co/IJnue61Rcy — Sikh Coalition (@sikh_coalition) January 27, 2018

Dangerous journalism, contributing to religious illiteracy, fueling stereotypes, and contributing to discrimination and violence against Sikhs. I've written to the editors of @USNews and the author @sintiaradu, requesting that this inaccurate and consequential image be removed. — Nathan C. Walker (@revnate) January 27, 2018

The outlet did not issue a public apology. But following the backlash, the image was soon replaced with a photo of New York’s Twin Towers with smoke coming out of the buildings after the 9/11 attacks.

“It was brought to our attention that some users objected to a photo we published” with the story on terrorism, Enxhi Myslymi, the outlet’s communications and public relations manager, told HuffPost in an email. “We reviewed the image, took the photo down, and updated it with a new one within 24 hours. We appreciate our readers for flagging these images for us.”

The Sikh Coalition told HuffPost that the original photo used with the story was not only offensive, but “dangerous.”

“While the Sikh beard and turban are articles of faith that represent a commitment to justice and equality, they have frequently been falsely associated with terrorism in the media with devastating consequences,” the organization said in a stement. “Images and words matter and the U.S. News image plays into a dangerous narrative that can intensify hate directed at Sikhs. No community deserves to be the target of backlash and bigotry.”

In the month following the 9/11 attacks, the coalition documented more than 300 cases of violence and discrimination against members of the Sikh community.

Years later, many Sikhs are still targets of discrimination and hate violence. And many Americans remain in the dark about the religion. A study by the National Sikh Campaign and Hart Research Associates found that 60 percent admitted to knowing nothing about Sikh Americans. When shown a photo of a Sikh person, Americans were more likely to identify the individual as Middle Eastern or Muslim.

The Sikh Coalition said that U.S. News and World Report should have “thought more critically” about their image choice and assessed the impact of their stories on the community.

AdvertisementPeople on Twitter have Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s back.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) tweeted a tasteless joke over the weekend about the 84-year-old justice’s decision not to attend President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address on Tuesday:

It's not fair that ppl are criticizing Justice Ginsberg for skipping SOTU! Security concerns wouldn't allow her to bring CPAP machine into House Chamber. pic.twitter.com/9GOR4NlHkr — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) January 28, 2018

He also spelled her surname wrong.

Ginsburg famously nodded off during former President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech in 2015. She later blamed her dozing on the wine she consumed at a dinner prior to the address.

This time around, Ginsburg isn’t skipping Trump’s address in order to call it an early night. In fact, she’s giving her own talk in Rhode Island as part of a nationwide tour.

Needless to say, Huckabee’s barb did not go down well on Twitter. Even Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) called it “despicable” and “tasteless”:
