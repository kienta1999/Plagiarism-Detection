CONGRATS TO ILLINOIS SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D) ON HER HISTORIC PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENT She will be the first senator to give birth while in office. [HuffPost]The vice chairman for Michigan State University’s board of trustees appeared to dismiss the damning Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal on Monday while defending the school’s president against calls to resign.

During an interview with Michigan radio show “Staudt on Sports,” trustee Joel Ferguson insisted that university president Lou Anna Simon was “the best president [MSU’s] ever had” and would not be leaving her post.

“She’s a fighter. Her overall, what she’s done for this university, she’s not going to get run out of there by what somebody else did,” he said.

Ferguson expressed the board’s support for Simon despite revelations that the school allowed Nassar, who is accused of sexually abusing over 140 women, to treat patients even while he was being investigated by university police for sexual assault. Nassar is serving a 60-year sentence on federal child pornography charges. In November, he pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.

Ferguson said that trustees met for a five-hour meeting, yet spent only 10 minutes talking about Simon.

“We had so many other things we were going over, we unanimously decided in that meeting right away ... we were going to support her staying as the president,” Ferguson said. “There’s so many more things going on at the university than just this Nassar thing.”

Hours after Ferguson’s radio interview, the NCAA announced it would be launching a formal investigation into the university’s handling of the allegations against Nassar.

Many were outraged that Ferguson appeared to dismiss the Nassar scandal.

Michigan St. trustee Joel Ferguson says Lou Anna Simon is best prez school's had in his 30 yrs on board.



"So much more going on at university than this 'Nassar thing.'"



"Nassar thing?" Can you possibly be more tone deaf? — Bonnie Bernstein (@BonnieBernstein) January 23, 2018

Could this be one of the most tone-deaf statements ever made? Certainly in top 10:

Nassar’s victims blame Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics for enabling him to treat athletes even after allegations of abuse.

Over the course of two decades, eight young women say they told at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives about Nassar’s sexual abuse, yet university officials did nothing to stop him, the Detroit News reported last week.

The women say their warnings go back as far back as 1997, though Simon told Detroit News that she learned about Nassar’s abuse in 2014, when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed.

The university didn’t officially fire Nassar until two years later, in September 2016.

“I was informed that a sports medicine doctor was under investigation,” Simon told Detroit News on Wednesday. “I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth.”

A post shared by The State News (@statenews) on Jan 18, 2018 at 7:47am PST

Olivia Cowen, who said Nassar abused her 10 years ago, delivered a victim’s impact statement in front of the former physician last week while holding Michigan State University accountable for his abuse. She is one of more than a hundred women who are delivering victim impact statements during Nassar’s week-long sentencing hearing.

“I’ve gone from a raving fan of MSU to now seeing green and white in the very same way I see Larry Nassar,” Cowan said in court last Wednesday. “I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed.”

Cowan later added, “As if the struggle of what Larry Nassar did isn’t bad enough, it’s horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing.”

An editorial in the State News, Michigan State University’s independent student-run newspaper, also called for Simon to resign, urging the president to “make the right choice, because time’s up.”

Several state lawmakers have also asked Simon to step down as university president.

But Ferguson told “Staudt on Sports” that the university board of trustees wanted to keep Simon as president, and emphasized her ability to make money.

“When you go to the basketball game, you walk in that new Breslin [Student Events Center], and the person who hustled and got all those major donors to give money was Lou Anna Simon,” he said.

Ferguson added that while the board of trustees wants Simon as president, trustees would be happy to have the attorney general review the investigation independently.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in this May 9 photo by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang. KCNA KCNA / Reuters

SEOUL/WASHINGTON ― North Korea has scheduled the dismantlement of its nuclear test site for sometime between May 23 and 25, depending on weather conditions, in order to uphold its pledge to discontinue nuclear tests, the country’s state media reported on Saturday.

The official Korean Central New Agency said dismantlement of the Punggye-ri nuclear test ground would involve collapsing all of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts.

“The Nuclear Weapon Institute and other concerned institutions are taking technical measures for dismantling the northern nuclear test ground ... in order to ensure transparency of discontinuance of the nuclear test,” KCNA said.

The announcement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hold a summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.

Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday North Korea can look forward to “a future brimming with peace and prosperity” if it agrees to quickly give up its nuclear weapons.

However, in spite of its pledge to stop testing, North Korea has given no indication it is willing to go beyond statements of broad conceptual support for denuclearization by unilaterally abandoning a nuclear weapons program its ruling family has seen as crucial to its survival.

In announcing the plan to shut Punggye-ri last month, Kim said North Korea no longer needed to conduct tests because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons.

KCNA said journalists, including from the United States and South Korea, would be invited to cover the event, to “show in a transparent manner the dismantlement of the northern nuclear test ground to be carried out.”

To accommodate the traveling journalists, North Korea said various measures would be taken including “opening territorial air space.”

All international journalists would be provided with a charter flight into Wonsan, a port city in eastern North Korea, from Beijing, KCNA said. There, reporters will board a charter train to the nuclear test ground in an “uninhabited deep mountain area.”

NO MENTION OF EXPERTS

South Korean officials said in April North Korea also planned to invite experts from the United States and South Korea for the Punggye-ri shutdown, but KCNA made no mention of this.

Last month, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked the United Nations to help verify the shutdown.

All of North Korea’s six known nuclear tests have taken place at Punggye-ri, in the northeastern part of North Korea where a system of tunnels have been dug under Mount Mantap.

Last month Trump welcomed Pyongyang’s announcement that it planned to close Punggye-ri.

Experts have said the pledge was a big step forward but verifying it will be difficult.

According to Chinese academic reports, North Korea’s most recent nuclear test in September of what Pyongyang said was a hydrogen bomb, was so large it triggered a collapse inside the mountain, rendering the entire site unusable for future tests.

But U.S. intelligence officials have said it remains usable and could be reactivated “in a relatively short period of time” if it was closed.

Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at California’s Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said in a blog post this week that recent satellite images had shown the removal of some buildings from the site.

On Saturday, he told Reuters that closure of Punggye-ri did not mean much in terms of disarmament, given that the United States, for example, stopped nuclear testing in 1992.

“It would, however, require North Korea to clear out the test tunnels and rebuild any infrastructure that might be removed — or dig new tunnels at the site or elsewhere. So, it’s a good confidence building measure, but not necessarily a sign of irreversible disarmament.”

Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States and a leading expert on North Korea’s nuclear program, said collapsing the Punggye-ri tunnels would be “a big and positive step,” given his belief that North Korea still required more nuclear and missile tests to reach the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile.

However, he said the other crucial steps North Korea needed to take to demilitarize its nuclear program were to shut its plutonium production reactor, and open its uranium processing to inspection.Parishioners at Unitarian Universalist Church in West Lafayette, Indiana, arrived Sunday to discover two obscenity-filled banners tied to fences on the property.

One of the banners reportedly read, “Die Fucker, Orlando just like Los Vegas [sic],” and included the date Jan. 23, USA Today reports.

The banner apparently referenced both the 2016 massacre of 49 people that targeted the LGBTQ community at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, as well as last year’s mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas.

A second banner referenced rock singer-songwriter Jackson Browne and included a series of racist and homophobic epithets. There appeared to be little connection between the two banners, save for the fact that Browne, who is known for his progressive stances, is scheduled to perform Jan. 23 at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Orlando.

The church posted unedited photographs of the banners to its Facebook page on Sunday.

Church member Suzan Windnagel told USA Today that she first discovered the banners early Sunday, one day after the church hosted the Greater Lafayette Resistance Fair, which featured “speakers discussing the damaging effects of the [Trump] administration,” according to the event’s Facebook page.

“I automatically called 911, because, I mean, you’ve seen the pictures of what was there,” she said. “The words were sickening, hate-filled and threatening.”

Later that day, West Lafayette Mayor John Dennis responded to the incident in a lengthy Facebook post, noting that he would “not allow our embracing of all that is right to be targeted by those who feel empowered to deliver a message of hate, violence and exclusivity.”

Dennis is scheduled to speak at an event on Wednesday called “Stand for Love, Sing for Justice,” which will be held at the church and is planned as a response to the threats.

Orlando police told The Associated Press that they’ve increased security ahead of Browne’s performance due to the incident.

At present, Indiana law enforcement officials told USA Today they had few leads in the case.More than a hundred women have read victim impact statements during physician Larry Nassar's week-long sentencing hearing. GEOFF ROBINS via Getty Images

The NCAA has formally opened an investigation into Michigan State University’s handling of the allegations against Larry Nassar, the school’s disgraced former team doctor who has been accused of sexually abusing more than 140 women, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.

The NCAA confirmed the news in a statement late Tuesday.

“The NCAA has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential NCAA rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State,” the group said. “We will have no further comment at this time.”

Jason Cody, a spokesman for Michigan State University, said the school’s athletic department had received the letter and was reviewing it.

More than a hundred women have read victim impact statements during Nassar’s week-long sentencing hearing, set to conclude later this week. The physician pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct and faces a minimum of 25 years in prison. He was already sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for child pornography.

Many of the women say they told parents, coaches and trainers at Michigan State University about Nassar’s abuse, but that the allegations were overlooked or hidden.

Michigan State University’s former gymnastics coach Kathie Klages retired last February as allegations against Nassar began to pile up. She has been accused of covering up the accusations, according to the Times.

Jessica Smith, who said Nassar abused her for months when she was 17, told HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos that many of those involved haven’t faced proper punishment for overlooking the complaints.World leaders are serving up some shrewdly veiled criticism of Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, days before the U.S. president is due to speak there.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked things off with a nearly hourlong address on Tuesday morning, warning explicitly of the dangers that protectionism and trade barriers pose to the world, which he likened to the threat of terrorism.

Modi’s remarks came just hours after Trump slapped tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines ― a move decried by Asian nations as the “America First” leader’s trade battle with China escalates.

“Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalization,” Modi cautioned. “The negative impact of this kind of mindset cannot be considered less dangerous than climate change or terrorism.”

The prime minister delved further into climate change, which has become a contentious issue between Trump and other world leaders since he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Trump once dismissed global warming as a “concept” that was “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” (Yes, really.)

Next up to take a swing at Trump was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who vowed on Tuesday to “push back against the anti-trade tendency in globalization that will leave us all worse off.”

“We’re working very hard to make sure that our neighbor to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and [how it] has benefited not just our economy, but his economy and the world’s economy,” Trudeau added, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has repeatedly slammed the trade pact between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico as “the worst deal ever” and threatened to upend it.

Then, in a direct blow to Trump and the U.S., Trudeau announced that Canada would join a massive Pacific trade deal with 10 other countries, not including the U.S.

The newly established Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership is a revised version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which collapsed as a result of Trump’s withdrawal last year.

Trump has dedicated much of his year-old presidency to trying to erase his predecessor’s legacy and curb U.S. leadership on global trade. The TPP was President Barack Obama’s signature trade achievement. Obama also spent years renegotiating and reaffirming NAFTA.

On Wednesday morning, German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed Modi’s warnings about rising protectionist tendencies among major economic powers.

“If we are of the opinion that things are simply not fair, that there is no reciprocity, then we have to seek multilateral answers, and not pursue a unilateral protectionist course where we isolate ourselves,” she said.

Wonder who she’s alluding to 🤔 — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) January 24, 2018

Without directly mentioning Trump’s influence, Merkel also lamented Europe’s passive approach to foreign policy.

“We need to take more responsibility,” she said. “We need to take our destiny into our own hands.”

Merkel’s words were reminiscent of earlier remarks, made some months after Trump’s inauguration, in which she suggested the long-standing Western alliance was threatened by his presidency.

“The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over,” she said in May. “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.”

In English, French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a snide comment clearly directed at Trump in absentia on Wednesday.WASHINGTON — California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) announced Wednesday that the state has sued the Trump administration over its decision to scrap an Obama-era hydraulic fracturing rule.

The 2015 rule — which was finalized but not implemented due to legal challenges — sought to better protect public health by setting standards for the construction of hydraulic fracturing operations on federal land and requiring oil and gas companies to disclose the chemicals used in the process.

At a news conference Wednesday, Becerra — who has sued the administration more than 20 times — said “the risks of fracking to our health and to our environment are real; they’re known.” The lawsuit, he said, is about protecting California’s 40 million residents.

“President Trump and Interior Secretary [Ryan] Zinke didn’t let the law or facts get in their way in their zeal to repeal this common-sense measure,” Becerra said.

Better known as “fracking,” this practice involves pumping a pressurized mixture of water, sand and chemicals into underground rock formations to release oil and natural gas.

There has been growing public concern in recent years about the threats fracking poses, in particular to groundwater. In a 2016 report, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that such activities “can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.”

Industry groups and several states promptly sued the Obama administration after the rule was finalized, and in 2016 a federal judge struck down the rule, concluding that the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management did not have the authority to regulate fracking. In September, however, a federal appeals court overturned the lower court’s ruling.

In its push for “energy dominance,” the Trump administration has furiously promoted increased fossil fuel development and worked to roll back numerous industry regulations, including the fracking rule.

Last month, the BLM issued a final notice rescinding the rule. The move, the agency wrote, was necessary “to prevent the unnecessarily burdensome and unjustified administrative requirements and compliance costs of the 2015 rule from encumbering oil and gas development on federal and Indian lands.”

Becerra told reporters Wednesday that the repeal is “reckless,” “arbitrary” and “capricious.” The BLM, he argues, has failed to justify its recent change in course.

David Hayes, the Interior Department’s deputy secretary under President Barack Obama and the current executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center, said Wednesday that by rescinding the 2015 rule, the Trump administration put the industry’s financial interests ahead of public health and the environment.

“Americans deserves better than a ‘trust us’ approach that fails to forthrightly address fracking-related drilling risks to our public lands,” he said in a statement.

Similarly, a coalition of environmental and tribal groups represented by Earthjustice also filed suit on Wednesday in an effort to block the repeal.

“This is another case of the Trump administration putting our public lands and water at risk to pad the bottom line of the oil and gas industry,” Earthjustice attorney Michael Freeman said in a statement. “The agency has abdicated its responsibility under federal law to manage these lands for the good of the public, not just for fracking companies. We’re filing this case to force BLM to do its job.”Trevor Noah is raining on Congress’ parade.

Lawmakers celebrated the end of the government shutdown on Monday. But on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” Noah said funding the government for the next three weeks “sounds pathetic.”

“[It’s] not normal,” said Noah. “I don’t care what anybody says, you’re just having a government funded week to week. America’s the richest country in the world and the government is out here basically paying rent week to week.”

He also compared America to an errant tenant who “gets caught in the stairway by the landlord.”The U.S Olympic Committee issued an open letter on Wednesday apologizing to the victims of former gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.

Minutes after Nassar was sentenced to serve 40 to 175 years in prison on counts of criminal sexual conduct, the USOC published a letter to his victims, which included Team USA gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. Nassar pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting young girls under the guise of medical treatment.

The USOC published its letter after hearing 169 survivors and their family members gave victim impact statements for more than a week leading up to Nassar’s sentencing. The convicted sex offender preyed on more than 140 young athletes during his time working for USA Gymnastics and various Michigan State University sports teams.

“We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren’t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams,” the USOC statement read.

The USOC said the purpose of its letter was to apologize to the victims and lay out the steps the organization would take to protect athletes. The committee vowed to initiate changes within the USOC and the national governing bodies that oversee individual sports to prevent abuses in the future.

“We Must Change the Culture of the Sport,” the statement listed as the first change: “This was the primary recommendation of the independent Deborah Daniels Report on USA Gymnastics and the athlete testimony underlined its importance. We heard athletes describe being unsure or unaware of how to report abuse and to whom, and sometimes even what constitutes abuse. We heard athletes describe being afraid or discouraged from reporting abuse.”

In the letter, the USOC also announced it would launch an investigation by an independent third party to see how Nassar was enabled to commit his abuses for so long. Three USA Gymnastics directors resigned on Monday and the USAG suspended Olympic gymnastics coach John Geddert, who had a close relationship with Nassar. USAG also cut ties with the national team training center, Karolyi Ranch, where much of Nassar’s abuse occurred.

“We need to know when complaints were brought forward and to who,” the USOC statement read. “This investigation will include both USAG and the USOC, and we believe USAG will cooperate fully. We will make the results public.”

Raisman, a six-time Olympic medalist, accused the USAG of victim-shaming and enabling years of sexual misconduct. The 23-year-old gymnast called out the organization earlier this month in a series of tweets where she said the problem extended beyond Nassar and former USAG President Steve Penny.

“We must investigate to figure out the many flaws in @USAGym system,” Raisman tweeted. “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again. This problem is bigger than Penny and Nassar. The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.”The National Hispanic Media Coalition is planning to take action against The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for what it describes as “institutionalized racism” against Latinos.

The 2018 Oscar nominations were announced on Tuesday, with Latinos conspicuously missing from all four acting categories. Hours later, the media advocacy group sent out a press release stating it would hold two demonstrations against this year’s Academy Awards.

NHMC is seeking to raise awareness about the lack of Latino representation, both in front and behind the camera.

“For years the success of the major film studios has been won on the backs of U.S. Latinos who represent 23 percent of all movie ticket buyers and 18 percent of the U.S. population,” NHMC president and CEO Alex Nogales said in the statement. “Yet, on- and off-screen and in the narratives Hollywood’s movies tell, Latinos remain the most underrepresented minority in the industry. Enough is enough. It’s time to end the whitewashing and put Latinos in front of and behind the camera.”

We're calling out @TheAcademy! Hollywood is STILL so white. #Latinos, #Hispanics, #Latinx are still grossly underrepresented in front of and behind the camera. Real change needs to occur. We're protesting on: February 5th and March 3rd. #OscarsSoWhite #LatinosLeftOut pic.twitter.com/ZiFC8yEQFB — NHMC (@NHMC) January 24, 2018

Latino actors and actresses have been underrepresented throughout Oscar history, with only 16 nominations and six wins over a period of 90 years.

Representation in the film industry in general is similarly bleak. Only 3.1 percent of speaking characters were Latino in 2016′s top 100 films, according to a report by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

The media coalition said its first demonstration will be on Feb. 5 at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ honoree luncheon. The second demonstration will be held on March 3. The time and location of both events have not yet been announced.You’ll soon be able to watch one of the most celebrated queer-themed Broadway plays in recent memory from the comfort of your living room.

Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” which opened on Broadway in April, takes a behind-the-scenes look at “The God of Vengeance,” a 1907 Yiddish drama that sparked controversy for featuring a love scene between two women. Written by Shalom Asch, “The God of Vengeance” is now regarded as a classic, but when it was first translated into English and staged in New York in 1923, its cast was arrested on obscenity charges for portraying a lesbian relationship.

“Indecent” has been captured for posterity by the digital theater platform BroadwayHD, where it will be available for streaming on Thursday. HuffPost got an exclusive sneak peek at two performance clips from the show in the videos above and below.

The clip above shows the climax of the provocative play within a play, in which Asch’s characters Menke (Katrina Lenk) and Rifkele (Adina Verson) share a passionate kiss before the curtain falls. The women meet as actors to discuss the daring nature of their roles in the below clip.

“I have always felt both the beauty and the danger of the presentation of lesbian sexuality in public,” she told The Cut last year. “I’m a woman who has been jumped on in the street and beaten by men.”

The worlds of musical theater and politics will come together in celebration of the LGBTQ community next month in New York.

The Human Rights Campaign announced Tuesday it would honor Tony-, Grammy- and Emmy-winning singer-actress Audra McDonald with this year’s National Equality Award, in recognition of her “outstanding efforts in standing up” for queer rights, at the 2018 HRC Greater New York Gala.

HRC’s President Chad Griffin praised McDonald for not only “captivating and inspiring audiences around the globe in a truly profound way,” but also using “her incredible talent to help make the world a better place by speaking out for the vulnerable and the oppressed.”

Slated to speak at the Feb. 3 event in New York is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). The organization chose the senator as a speaker, Griffin said, because she has been “on the front lines” in terms of resisting the Trump administration’s anti-LGBTQ agenda.

“From fighting back against Trump’s transgender military ban to pushing for LGBTQ non-discrimination protections, Sen. Gillibrand stands shoulder to shoulder with the LGBTQ community as a champion of equality,” he added.

McDonald has been an outspoken LGBTQ rights advocate for years. In 2015, the Broadway icon railed against then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allowed business owners to cite religious beliefs as a reason to discriminate against customers.

“Some of the closest people to me ... are LGBTQ. I have family members that are LGBTQ. That they don’t have the same rights that I do is heartbreaking to me, and wrong,” she told Variety last year. “I just feel it in the very core of my being, the injustice ... I can’t be silent. These are my friends. These are my family.”Bryan Cranston plays Walter White in the pilot of "Breaking Bad." Screengrab: Netflix

Can you believe it’s been 10 years since “Breaking Bad” premiered? Can you believe how much story has been told — and continues to be told, thanks to the “Better Call Saul” prequel — in that time?

Neither can Vince Gilligan.

“You know, I couldn’t be happier or more proud of that,” the series’ creator tells Yahoo Entertainment. “I came from network television. I worked for seven years on The X-Files, and loved that job immensely and learned pretty much everything that I needed to know when it came to running my own show. We did 202 episodes total in nine years of that show. I’m not a great mathematician by nature, but I’m guessing we did what? Like 170, 180 episodes just in the time I was there?

I guess I’m just plain amazed that in only 62 episodes of Breaking Bad, and now I think we’ve aired 30 episodes of ”Better Call Saul,” for a total of 92, that the number is that few for something that has caught people’s attention like it has. Coming from network TV, I’m used to a much bigger number of episodes, much more bulk involved in the storytelling, so to speak. As a show creator, I love this new era of television that we’re in, where these companies that we work for have figured out a way to monetize fewer episodes and make that work for their business models. Because in terms of being a writer, fewer is better. You have a chance to have a higher level of quality than when you’re slinging 24, 26 episodes a year.”

Gilligan dreamed up the idea for a dying chemistry teacher’s meth-cooking venture while discussing the woes of being an unemployed writer with his best friend and eventual ”Breaking Bad” writer and co-executive producer, Thomas Schnauz. Then he wrote and directed the “Breaking Bad” pilot. In honor of the 10th anniversary of its Jan. 20, 2008 premiere, Gilligan took a trip down memory lane to share his favorite memories of Bad’s beginnings, along with stars Bryan Cranston (Walter White), Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman), Betsy Brandt (Marie Schrader), RJ Mitte (Walter White, Jr.), Max Arciniega (Krazy-8), and costume designer Kathleen Detoro.

Guests at Walt’s 50th birthday party watch his brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) discuss a meth lab bust on TV. Screengrab: Netflix

IN THE BEGINNING…

Gilligan and Schnauz, friends since they met at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, joked that one way they could deal with the uncertainty of employment as writers would be to drive around the country in an RV that was also a mobile meth lab. Did that inspire the character of DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), whose drug bust in the pilot sparks the interest of his brother-in-law, Walter White, in making meth?

Vince Gilligan: You know, I remember when I was writing the pilot, I worried that it was a little too pat that Walt’s brother-in-law happened to be a DEA agent. I thought to myself, “There’s a way to go here [with] the story I’ve got going: There’s Skyler [Walter’s wife, played by Anna Gunn], and there’s Walt Jr., and there’s a baby on the way, but there doesn’t have to be a brother-in-law who’s a DEA agent. It could just be that Walt happens to be watching TV one day, and he sees a bust on the news.” You could do it all without that character of Hank Schrader.

I remember going back and forth on that when I was plotting out that first episode. I guess I thought to myself, “If there’s this extra element, if there was a real man’s man in this story, a character right from the first act who is everything that Walt appears not to be, then that might make for some interesting storytelling.” I think that’s really where the idea for Hank came from, that Walt is cerebral and a bit soft, or at least that’s what we think of him. We find out over the course of [the series] that he’s never a physically imposing guy, but his will is downright scary. He, in fact, becomes the scariest guy in that universe by the end of it all. I liked the idea from the beginning to array him against someone who was comfortable in his own skin, a “Hail, fellow, well met,” and boisterous, and gun-toting — just a real badass. It certainly helped, too, that it would help Walt realize just how much money could be made in this criminal enterprise of his.

One other thing I realized from the earliest days: I thought to myself, “You know, Walt’s gotta be doing this, even if it’s on an unconscious level, to stick it to his brother-in law. There’s gotta be some antipathy there somewhere.” He loves the guy, but on the other hand, as we see in that first episode at the birthday party, Hank essentially does the verbal equivalent of wrapping his arm around Walt’s head and giving him a noogie.

Bryan Cranston (Walter White): When we first started this, it was very risky, because what Vince Gilligan was attempting to do had never been done on television: actually change a character over the course of the series. To this point, it had always been about things that could be depended on, whether that’s Thomas Magnum or Archie Bunker, or Ross and Rachel. We would watch because we liked those characters. “Oh, here’s a new situation, but we know how Ross and Rachel are going to feel about this.”

And it was all them navigating their way through their lives, but they never really changed. Even Tony Soprano was who he was from beginning to end. Vic Mackie from The Shield — all these characters that came before Walter White were tried and true, and greatly drawn characters.And then this came, and I read it, and when Vince told me what he wanted to do, I thought, “This has never been done.” He goes, “I know, I don’t even know if they’re going to let us do it, but I’d like to try.” “Well, OK.” And so, when we started 11 years ago shooting the show, we didn’t know anything was going to work. We knew we had a good script. All the actors, the whole crew, knew that this story was really, really special. But that doesn’t always equate to success. In fact, many times it does not.

So we just had to have faith, keep our heads down, do the work, and hope that it could find some kind of audience. But no one could ever have guessed the avalanche of attention that “Breaking Bad” eventually received, and then became this incredible story and revered television show. I’m very proud of that, obviously, but it just makes us dink our heads when we think about where we started. We had no idea that it could ever become what it became.

CREATING WALTER WHITE AND COMPANY

Both Matthew Broderick and John Cusack, AMC network executives’ first choices to play Walter White, passed on the part, which suited Gilligan just fine. He had Bryan Cranston in mind all along, having worked with the actor best known for comedies like Malcolm in the Middle and Seinfeld at that point, in a 1998 episode of “The X-Files” called “Drive.” Cranston played a dying racist, but managed to make the character sympathetic, something Gilligan never forgot. Cranston was equally impressed with the ambitious story Gilligan planned to unfold with Walter White.

Cranston: Everything became more clear to me about the subtext after I had my first meeting with Vince, and he told me what he wanted to do. In the pilot, we see the setup of what happened to Walter: He finds out about his cancer, he’s desperate to do something bold for his family before he dies. And so he makes that bold decision, and that creates the slippery slope. But beyond that, I didn’t know where he had intended on going until the meeting, and he told me he wanted to change a good person into a bad person and have him become this drug kingpin. I was mouth agape and listening to what he was saying, and I was thinking, “Oh, my God!” And I started thinking about it, like, “Is this possible? Would this work in television?”

And it just so happened that the timing of this was perfect, because I think our society was getting more sophisticated with its viewing. Cable was exploding, and there were far more options for viewers. And so we realized you can’t play it safe. You have to do something bold. [People] talk a lot about thinking outside the box and all those kind of things, but it was one of those rare occasions when it actually was just that. So I was just excited about being on board this new frontier.

Gilligan: I think people love an underdog because they identify with the underdog. It’s funny, even the winners of the world — the billionaires, the top athletes, the movie stars. I’m no psychologist, but there’s some basic human thing that we all have within us, [where] we all wanna think of ourselves as an underdog. Not as a loser, but as an underdog. An underdog is a winner who at the moment is losing, but who is not, in fact, a loser. I don’t think you can find that definition in Webster’s, but that’s the way I always thought of it.

Walt actually treads a fine line. When I look back on the pilot, he is somewhere between an underdog and a loser. You feel for him because you think to yourself, “This guy is doing everything right.” The first half of the pilot, this guy has done, as far as we can tell, everything right in life, and yet he keeps getting crapped on, right and left, by the vagaries of fate and by the people around him. He’s got a family who loves him very much, but his fear is, “How am I gonna support these folks, even on a good day?” Then, when he gets that cancer diagnosis, something just snaps in him. We identify with that underdog nature that he has in spades in that first hour.

Then, there’s Bryan Cranston… I did everything in my power as a writer to stack the deck for that particular character, so that the viewer would sympathize with Walter White. There are sympathize-able actors. There are actors who can be scary. There are actors who can be funny. Bryan really is the hat trick. He can do it all. I think a large part of the equation is Bryan himself and the humanity and the empathize-ability that he brought. He exuded it from every pore of his body. He brought that to the character and added so much likability to the character that the writing itself could never have attained on its own.

Because the show planned to take high school chemistry teacher Walt from “Mr. Chips to Scarface,” as Gilligan explained early on, was there any concern that Walt would be too likable, too sympathetic, as he was introduced as a major underdog, so that it would be impossible for viewers to eventually turn on him?

Cranston: The thing the pilot does, and that was the master plan, is that despite your better judgment, you’re saying, “Oh, but the poor bastard, he got a raw deal. … OK, just this once.” If he does this one thing, then you can look the other way and forgive him for this, because you might have done the same thing if it was you, and you were on your way out and you wanted to do something.

Here’s a man who missed opportunities in his life, and he needs to leave something for his family, because it’s going to be devastating and they’ll be left penniless. So you justify your approval of what Walter White is doing. And by doing so, what Vince Gilligan was actually doing to the audience was baiting the hook. And in the pilot, the audience swallowed that bait. They felt compassion, concern for Walt, and rooted for him. Throughout all the danger and his decision making and his indecision and his doubt and his insecurities, we rooted for him, and that was by design.

Because once that bait was taken, and in the second and third episodes, and fourth episode and fifth episode, the bait is now dissolved, what’s left in the audience? Just the hook, and at a certain point, the audience witnessing the evil deeds that Walter White was now doing. And it was beyond need now. He’d already made his money, as he said, and he didn’t really need to do more. Then it’s, “I don’t know if I like him anymore, and he and Jesse are now arguing, and I’m more on Jesse’s side.” And the audience will try to spit the hook out, and what happens is that it gets caught. So Vince, in all of his wisdom, would allow the audience to take the line out. I’ll continue with the fishing analogy. Episode after episode, he’s letting the audience run with the line. Out it goes, out it goes, out it goes. At a certain point — and it was different for everyone — where did your allegiance for Walt turn?

Some say it was early on. Some say it was when he let Jane die. Some say it was when he killed so-and-so or killed Mike. It differs. But whenever that was for any particular audience member and they wanted to spit the hook, it got caught, as we knew it would. And that’s when he clicked that reel and started pulling you in. And you know you didn’t want to. It’s like, “Oh, God. Oh, I can’t. What an a**hole he’s become, and what’s going on, and why is he…?” And we’re reeling you in. And it was just a brilliant manipulation that you didn’t see coming, because you didn’t see the hook when you ate the bait. It just wasn’t present. We thought we were feeling compassion and sorrow for a man, and what we were actually doing is buying a ticket for his trip to hell.

And then there’s Jesse, Walt’s former student, who is introduced when Walt witnesses him climbing out the bedroom window of a naked woman, falling off the roof, and then quickly driving away from the scene of a DEA drug bust. Jesse doesn’t say a word, but the look he and Walt exchange says they know each other, they’re surprised to see other, and it’s not a happy surprise.

Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman): You can tell, there’s obviously such history there. To be honest, before shooting the pilot, we didn’t have any lengthy conversations about where this kid was from. I think it was pretty much on the page, and then my own interpretation, and, long story short, I think that’s why I ended up landing the role because [of] my take on this kid. All I knew was within those 60 pages of that script, and the backstory I could kind of come up with.

This guy obviously wasn’t very focused in school, he kind of got mixed up with the wrong crowd, and he is now cooking and selling crystal meth for a living. But, I didn’t want to just make him the quintessential kind of druggie, burnt-out, bad guy. I wanted to give him some layers. And that’s what really helped me out, because after we shot the pilot and got picked up, the whole journey for Jesse was changing, unbeknownst to me. The original plan was to kind of use Jesse Pinkman as a tool to bring Walter White into this world, and then he was gonna meet his demise toward the end of the first season, and then Walt would go out and have some sort of revenge. But, I had no idea that was the original plan. So these characters and these stories just kept evolving. Each time I received a new script, more layers of the onion were revealed to me.

Gilligan: Jesse Pinkman’s character … that was something that tickled me, that I was looking forward to writing when I came up with the idea that this guy’s a former student who failed Walt’s chemistry class, but would wind up being his partner, and that these two guys basically hate each other. One thing that Bryan early on said to me was, “The way these buddy stories always go, these mismatched buddies, like Riggs and Murtaugh from “Lethal Weapon,” they hate each other at the beginning. They wind up at the end, they love each other. The one guy invites the other over for Christmas dinner after the end of the two-hour thing.”

He said, “I don’t wanna do that. I think Walt should never like or respect Jesse. I think he should hate this guy just as much at the end as he does at the start, and vice versa.” We took that and ran with it as long as we could, although it felt, at a certain point, these guys gotta have some kind of a grudging respect for one another. But I respected what Bryan was saying. He was basically saying, “Let’s not soften these characters.” Because that is a natural tendency that happens in a lot of these kind of stories. “Let’s try to go a different way.” That was good advice.

Paul: To be completely transparent, I was just so happy to be getting these scripts week to week, and there was really nothing I could say to make this show any better. So I was just happy that my character didn’t die in a first-season episode. But it’s true, everything was just so much more complicated and just honest with this show. And so it’s good that Walt and Jesse didn’t have that sort of best friend, “Aha!’ moment. The waters were definitely a little muddy between those two throughout the series, which was, I think, very smart.

And then there’s Marie, Skyler White’s sister, a quirky X-ray technician played by Betsy Brandt. Brandt also auditioned for the role of Skyler (and a woman named Linda, who was cut from the storyline) before she landed the role of Marie Schrader. Brandt was motivated by one word Gilligan said to her for creating her character.

Betsy Brandt: One of the things that I love and respect about Vince so much as a writer is that he’s so clear in his vision and so specific, and yet he’s so open to where it goes. I just wanted to know everything that he thought about Marie. I remember he kept using the word “needle” with her. He kept saying, “She needles Skyler. She needles her sister.” He would always say, “She’s not a bitch. It’s just, she’s not easy.” To me, she’s complicated, and that’s what was so interesting about her. And I thought it would be just a fun ride to take.

One of my favorite things about the show is when you look at the pilot and the episodes in Season 1, you can then look at who these characters were in the last season of the show, and you see that’s who they are in the beginning. We’ve gotten to know them so much more, and the stakes are higher, and everything becomes more complicated, but I feel like you see who Marie is with her husband, her sister, her brother-in-law, her nephew. The roots of these people and the relationships to one another are, I just think, evident right out of the gate. And I always loved that about the show.

THE PILOT HIGHLIGHTS

1. The White family breakfast on Walt’s 50th birthday, including fake bacon (which Walt Jr. insists smells like a Band-Aid); playful banter about a janky hot water heater and how Walt is now old; and a sweet chemistry that made breakfast on Breaking Bad, especially Walt Jr.’s love of the morning meal, a meme.

RJ Mitte (Walter “Flynn” White, Jr.): You know what I remember most about pretty much most of the scenes, but that one in particular, was everyone’s camaraderie. I miss the show, not just because of the show’s content and what we did, but I miss working with the people that I had the privilege to work with, and the camaraderie that we had on the set. It really made the characters what they are. As I’ve gotten older and filmed more and worked more, I really appreciate the professionalism that they brought to that. That was so crucial to the show.

I think people gravitated towards [breakfast as a meme] because it was the only time in the series where there was no chaos. They were a normal family that sits down and eats with each other and talks, and those were big moments of happiness. I really think that’s why people gravitated to those moments of innocence. And you’re rooting for Walt. That evolution of doing what was right and doing what we want is something that we all struggle with. It’s these transitions of: What do I need and what do I want, and what weighs more, my needs or my wants? For the most part, you were still [hoping] that Walt would come back to his family, that he would make all this money and find a cure for himself. In actuality, that didn’t happen, but we were all hoping that it was going to be OK.

But they did eat a lot of fake bacon while filming the pilot, right?

Mitte: I did not. If you notice, my character doesn’t really eat bacon in that shot, because he had smelled it. So that day, I didn’t have bacon, but we did eat plenty at breakfast.

2. The scene in the clothing store, when Walt stands up to some bullies who are making cruel remarks about Walt Jr. and his cerebral palsy. It’s one of Walt’s most heroic moments, and goes a long way toward establishing the audience’s allegiance to him in the pilot.

Cranston: I think that was an awakening scene when we were trying jeans on in a store and some bullies were picking on my son. And before the cancer diagnosis, Walt would have handled it completely different. He would have backed down and just gotten his wife to leave the store, or try to tell the security guard to have these boys stop picking on us, or something of that nature. And the new Walt felt empowered by his decision-making that no one else knew about except him. And that struck me as very honest, that it infuses you with a new energy whenever you make bold choices. And it doesn’t mean they’re good choices; it means that it becomes very bold, but not always beneficial. And that’s basically a taste of the direction that Walter White was going to take in his new life.

Mitte: To me that scene was very impactful because, one, it was one of my very first days being on set. It wasn’t my first day, but it was one of those big days where it was like everyone’s there. I had real [lines of] dialogue, [was] working and improving. … That really altered my perception of the industry. I also think that was that moment when you first saw [the] Heisenberg [persona], and that was so impactful in the story.

It definitely helped toward the bond [between Bryan and me]. [Walt] was standing up for Walt Jr., and that was one of those really special moments where you can connect with an individual you are working with, and you can have that moment with them, and it’s fun. It’s cool to be able to create that real family, because we really are a family. I can go and call anyone [in the cast] and have a chat. We don’t do that all the time, but we have the ability to do that with each other, and that is something that is hard to find. There’s not many people that I’ve had that with.

3. Jesse visits his drug-dealing cohort Krazy-8, who’s training a scary-looking attack dog (who turned out to be quite a pussycat).

Max Arciniega (Krazy-8): The funny part about it was that we did our first take, and the dog started biting on the dummy. As soon as we cut, the dog was literally exhausted. And so the dog trainer came over and grabbed this supposedly vicious Rottweiler, and took him over to get some water. He was panting like he was out of shape. So he’s there, panting and panting, and Vince was like, “Oh, OK. So, is the dog ready?” And the trainer was like, “No. He’s going to need a break.” And Vince was like, “What are we thinking, like how long?” The trainer was like, “Probably about 25 minutes.” Vince was like, “Twenty-five minutes? Oh, OK.” So this vicious Rottweiler was literally just this out-of-shape teddy bear. That was one of the cool memories about that experience there. You could go up and pet him. He was such a sweet dog. He was a good actor, right?

Paul: I remember loving that dog. The dog was great. I think he just was very happy to bark for some treats.

THE UNDERPANTS

As would continue throughout the series, the “Breaking Bad” pilot was full of memorably funny dialogue, situations, and physical moments, from Jesse describing “cow houses” to Skyler’s bemusement at Marie’s offer to critique her writing, to, in one of the enduringly iconic images of the series, Walt in the desert in his tighty-whities. Many viewers were used to seeing Cranston in the white briefs from his time on “Malcolm in the Middle,” which is exactly why Walt almost wore sweatpants instead.

Gilligan: I love “Malcolm in the Middle,” but I have to admit that I certainly didn’t see every episode, and I had, in fact, forgotten that Bryan’s character of Hal had spent so much time, not just in his underpants, but in his tighty-whities. I had written the tighty-whities stuff right from the get-go, before I even had an actor in mind. I had an image of a guy in tighty-whities, in the desert, with the gas mask and all that stuff.

Cranston: I brought it to his attention because it was in the script. And he didn’t know that that was sort of a signature piece of Hal. So if he had, then I would have thought, “Oh, maybe just subliminally he put that in there.” But because he didn’t know, I went, “Oh, OK. Well…” Then that’s when I was objective; when I was looking at the choice of wardrobe and things, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t want to repeat that. That wouldn’t be smart.”

Gilligan: I kinda wimped out on the morning of filming, and I said, “Are you OK with the tighty-whities?” He said, “Versus what?” I said, “Well… I guess [Walt] could’ve brought a pair of sweatpants or something he could be wearing. He doesn’t have to be in his underpants.”

Cranston: And so I’m looking at all different kinds of boxers and things like that, and something was kind of gnawing at me. The choice was, “Yeah, I guess we could go with boxers.” And I kept going, “Why did he write that? Why was that image in his head when he wrote that? Because he didn’t have an association with ‘Malcolm in the Middle,’ so what was it?” And I asked him, and he didn’t know. He just thought the image was funny. And it is. Tighty-whities on a grown man is funny, and that’s primarily why I wasn’t going to do that again, because I had done that for seven years.

And so I was convinced that I was not going to do that. And then as I’m working on the character, I always try to find the emotional core, and that’s where the seed is, to be able to then nurture that character and have it grow out of that. And with Walt, it was depression.

A lot of what Walt was doing was out of depression, not out of emotion, because his emotional core was calloused over by years of indifference and disappointment. And I thought, this is kind of indicative of a halting maturity. Walt gave up at some point 20 years ago, when he became a teacher. He gave up maybe his own destiny, maybe something, but he didn’t care anymore. And so, that then informed a lot of decisions. That created the mustache that was so transparent that it looked silly. It wasn’t full, it didn’t really make any statement, the hair was muted brown. We took any color highlights out of my hair and deadened the color. We chose clothes that were the colors of walls: taupe, sand, beige, eggshell white. He blended [in], he became invisible to society and to himself.

And then I went back to the underwear situation and I went, “Well, you know what? I think this kind of tells our story, that he doesn’t care.” His growth as an adult, as a human being, stunted at a certain point. When I looked at Hal, it was funny in that context that he was just the biggest boy of the family. Whereas in this context, it was even more depressing. And so I thought, wouldn’t that be interesting, to take the same exact underwear in a comedy to make [the character] funny and in a drama to make it depressing or sad?

Kathleen Detoro (costume designer): They came from JCPenney, because they did not have a logo on them. I don’t really like having any logos on stuff. I don’t want to be advertising anything in particular. If there is a logo, I would take it off. But, with men’s underwear, it is usually stitched into the waistband. And I had to figure out a way for him to be able to stick a gun in his underwear. It would usually go in the back of the waistband of their pants. So we figured out a way to do that so the gun would be OK.

And he came out, and he took a bow in his underwear in front of everyone. We would just acknowledge the underwear scene, and he could focus on it. And that scene is so amazing. The whole thing is brilliant. And it was a billboard. I think it was on Sunset Boulevard. When I saw it, I just laughed so much, because I think it was of him in his underwear in the green shirt on the road in the desert. And I was like, “Oh, wow. Who would have thought, back when I had that meeting about the [underwear], that this would be above the Chateau Marmont?

Paul: Bryan really knows how to wear his tighty-whities, you know? I haven’t worn tighty-whities since I was a young little boy. But, Bryan … that’s his underwear of choice. I don’t know if he told you that, but he loves those things. Actually, that could be a lie. I have no idea.

Gilligan: The guy was so absolutely fearless.

Because the underpants are associated with two of his signature characters, has Cranston ever been approached about being a spokesman for the briefs?

Cranston: No. [Laughs] That’s the first time I’ve ever been asked about that. With Hal, unless they did it tongue in cheek. … Hal did not make tighty-whities sexy. And Walter White just kind of gave it a nastiness that I don’t think wholesome underwear companies would want to be a part of.

Brandt in Marie’s signature shade of purple. Screengrab: Netflix

THE COLOR PURPLE

Color played a huge role in “Breaking Bad,” from the colors of the Albuquerque sky and desert to the characters’ clothing and cars to, of course, Walt and Jesse’s famous blue crystal meth. Blogs were devoted to dissecting the color schemes of the characters’ wardrobes, and what the evolution of those colors meant. One character who made a statement by never changing her color: Marie, who loved anything and everything purple, from both outfits we see her wearing in the pilot to, eventually, even her kitchen appliances (who knew you could buy a purple toaster?).

Brandt: In the beginning, Marie only had a few scenes. I just wanted to be as specific about her as I could and know as much about her as I could. Just because there wasn’t a lot of material, I was kind of looking for stuff. I always said Kathleen Detoro’s superpower is color — we all had colors. I just said, “You know what? I think Marie is that person.”

I just kept thinking about what Vince said about her needling [people]. I felt like she’s so tightly wound. In my head, I said, “I don’t think she does anything half-assed.” So I think if purple is her color, purple is her color. And Vince thought that was great. Then that first season, he and the writers, they just went with it, really so much more than I ever could have imagined. And I just loved that for her. I mean, her entire house. She doesn’t live alone. [Hank] is like, “It’s fine.” It’s so much easier just to accept everything is purple than to fight her on it. That tells us so much about her.

I was like, “OK, so she’s not easy in other ways, too.” And [before] the pilot, I asked Vince, “What do you think she does for a living?” He said, “Well, what do you think?” I said, “I think that she is an X-ray technician, or maybe an insurance adjuster.” He said, “OK, I like that. Let’s do that.” I wanted her to have some foot in the door in the medical field, but I didn’t want her to be a doctor. I didn’t want her to be a nurse. I wanted her to not have too much power. I wanted her to be able to have a chip on her shoulder.

Fans must have sent all kinds of purple gifts. Did Brandt ever get sick of the color?

Oh, my god, there is no purple in my house. Except for my daughter’s bedroom, because she doesn’t have to pay for my creative choices. Since then, when I do any other project, not to tell anybody how to do their job, but I say, “Please, very limited purple, or no purple.” It’s just a different person to me. And yes, I still get all sorts of purple stuff. When we did our premiere, I can’t remember which season it was, at [San Diego] Comic-Con, there were all these women who showed up in purple. It was just beyond touching. To me, those are the amazing meetings that you have with people that are fans of the show, because they have lived it with you. It’s those experiences that are a privilege. It’s a privilege to be in someone’s living room.

ETC., ETC.

Aaron Paul’s favorite memory from filming the pilot?

Paul: This is the perfect point to segue back to Bryan in his underwear. Bryan walking around in his tighty-whities. … He really just owned them. He was very confident. He would just be walking around set in the middle of the desert, with an umbrella kind of shading his body and his face from the sun, just in his loafers and in his tighty-whities, a beautiful sight. I just remember Bryan having all of us in tears from laughter. And, it was that way through the entire series. He was truly the anchor that culled us all together.

We’re celebrating the pilot here, but fans continue to debate the series’ ending. Does Paul think Jesse is alive?

Paul: I hope so. But if you really look at the evidence, his fingerprints are all over the place. He has a record. So, they’re definitely gonna be searching for him. He is on the run, you know? He did murder someone, probably the nicest person on Breaking Bad, poor Gale. And he did get punished and abused for some time. So, I don’t know. I like to think that he kind of ran off, [is] maybe hiding out in Alaska somewhere, maybe building things with his hands, I don’t know. But, he’s definitely in hiding somewhere, for sure.

Would he ever want that question answered definitively, by Gilligan and the Breaking Badwriters?

Paul: Oh God, I have no idea, but all I will say is, if for some reason Vince decides to have Pinkman pop up anywhere … whatever Vince asks me to do, I’m just gonna smile at him and nod my head yes. I owe him so much, and I know that he would never do anything to harm or jeopardize what he had created in the first place and what we all were very much a huge part of creating. So yeah, if that did happen, I can say with confidence that it would be done in a very delicate, delicate way.

Breaking Bad was originally going to be set in Riverside, Calif., but execs asked Gilligan to consider filming in New Mexico for budget purposes. He does not regret his decision to say yes.

Gilligan: The Sony production executives called me up one day as we were plotting out the pilot and said, “What do you think about Albuquerque?” I don’t know if they said Albuquerque, to be fair. I think they said, “What do you think about shooting in New Mexico?” They said, “You could put license plates on the cars that say California. What’s the difference? California kinda looks like New Mexico.” I said, “Why would we do this again?” And, they said, “Because you’ll have a lot more money to play with. You’ll have a lot more money with which to make the show, because New Mexico is offering quite a good inducement in terms of a rebate package.” One of the things I’m proudest of is that I said, “Yes, but we’re not gonna put California license plates on, and we’re not gonna never look East to avoid seeing the Sandia Mountains. Let’s just call it Albuquerque, N.M. Let’s call it what it is.”

Because, unfortunately, as we all know, there’s not one state that has a lock on the meth problem. It’s pretty much all 50 of them. I figured New Mexico’s as good as any place. It turned out to be one of the greatest boons to the show and what people love about the show. In other words, Southern California, it’s a lot of tract homes, and it’s a lot of people, millions and millions of people — it would have to be a show set in a city, really, which is a very different feel. I only realized how different it was in hindsight, once we started shooting in Albuquerque.

In Albuquerque, you’re surrounded by plains, and deserts, and mountains, and a landscape that is, on the one hand, beautiful, but on the other hand, is dead set on killing you if you let it. You wander just a few miles from your house in some places in Albuquerque without water on a hot day, and you will die. It is a deadly landscape. That comes across so wonderfully onscreen. It becomes, in essence, a contemporary Western. I didn’t even realize how much I was gonna love that until we actually started seeing it on film. The best thing we really got from shooting in Albuquerque was shooting in Albuquerque.

Marie and Hank at Walt’s birthday party. Screengrab: Netflix

When Marie met Hank…

Brandt: I met [Dean Norris] the first time when I came into meet with Vince. Dean was in the waiting room. There were other actors in there, too. Not many. It wasn’t a large group, but I just started talking to Dean. We just started chatting. And I remember, I asked him what network it was on. Then I said, “I think this is funny. Is this funny?” Because it’s an hour [drama]. And he’s like, “Oh, yeah. Yeah.” He said, “I’m going in there reading this as funny.” I said, “OK, good, because I am, too.” We both said afterwards, “Oh, I went in and definitely played the comedy more because of our conversation.” Everything just came together on this for me. I can’t speak for everybody else, but I feel like this show is full of those stories, that everything just fell into place. I think it is the definition of lightning in a bottle.

We still want to know more about Marie and Skyler’s background, their childhoods. Wouldn’t it make a great story, or a book, or a prequel season or series?

Brandt: If you get that show produced, I will do it. I will do a season of Skyler and Marie. It’s funny, Anna and I would talk about how, “God, don’t you want to meet their parents?” We had talked about that with Vince. Vince was like, “Oh!” He had ideas about it. But it’s cable. You never get to explore as much as you want, because you just don’t have the episodes.

What does Max Arciniega think about the fact that his name was used for a pivotalBreaking Bad character, Max Arciniega, Gustavo Fring’s best friend and original partner in Los Pollos Hermanos? Max the character was murdered by the Mexican cartel, sparking Gus’s quest for revenge against Don Eladio and Hector Salamanca.

Arciniega: I was aware that Vince Gilligan tends to name characters after people that he knows and likes. So I got a call from Vince, and he’s like, “Hey, listen. I was thinking about naming one of the characters after you, and just wanted to know if that was OK?” And I was like, “Absolutely. I would be honored. That’s amazing.” And so it was as simple as that. I remember, I had some family members who were big fans of the show. They didn’t know, and no one else knew about it. I had never said anything. I started getting phone calls, and they’re like, “They named a character after you!” It was an honor.
