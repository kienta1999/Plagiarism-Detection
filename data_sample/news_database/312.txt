If Bran Stark is the Three-Eyed Raven, then Jojen Reed was at least the Raven-Symoné of “Game of Thrones.”

Although he didn’t possess the all-powerful capabilities of Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright), Thomas Brodie-Sangster’s Jojen saw glimpses into the future and did his best with the information he received. He also had a best friend named Chelsea ― er, rather, a sister named Meera (Ellie Kendrick) ― to possibly help him deal with his premonitions. That’s so Raven.

We lost Brodie-Sangster and his visions in season four, thanks to some lame-as-heck ice zombies ― but, hey, Raven’s psychic character made a comeback on Disney with “Raven’s Home.” Maybe there’s hope for Jojen? While talking with Brodie-Sangster about his new dystopia film “Maze Runner: The Death Cure,” we also asked if HBO had contacted him about possibly returning to “Game of Thrones” in season eight ― considering Bran has time-traveling powers and all.

“No, I never have. I quite like the idea of that as well, like kind of come back like an Obi-Wan spirit, kind of cool. No, I haven’t heard anything from HBO,” Brodie-Sangster said.

Perhaps Jojen is gone for good. Nonetheless, the actor graciously shared his thoughts on where the show might be headed. Brodie-Sangster subscribes to the idea that the old Three-Eyed Raven (Max von Sydow) we saw on “Game of Thrones” is actually future Bran.

That’d mean these two dudes are the same person:

HBO

Throughout the show, there have been hints this may be the case.

In season six, episode five, the Three-Eyed Raven says it’s time for Bran “to become me.” Cue Bran’s shocked/concerned face.

HBO

In season seven, episode three, Bran explains to his sister Sansa (Sophie Turner) that he can see everything because the Three-Eyed Raven taught him. She says, “I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven,” and rather than just say something like, “Oh, there was another Three-Eyed Raven before me,” Bran says, “It’s difficult to explain.”

Sansa gives a look like, “I came out in the snow for this crap?”

HBO

And in season three, episode two, during Jojen’s first appearance, he comes to Bran in a dream and says the raven “is you.”

On the theory that the old Three-Eyed Raven was actually future Bran, Brodie-Sangster told us: “Yeah, I kind of went with that one. I like the theory of multiverses and different parallel universes working together in time. I just quite like that theory. I went with that and like the idea of that.”

“You got to be careful you don’t lose people ― what people love about a certain show,” he said of the idea of time-travel theories. “But, like I said, I like all that.”

The eighth season of “Game of Thrones” isn’t coming until 2019, so there’s plenty of time to speculate. In the meantime, Brodie-Sangster opened up about his character Newt’s big “Maze Runner” moment, whether there’s a secret “Game of Thrones” texting thread, and a disturbing trend we’ve noticed in his projects that he’s very aware of.

(Warning! Spoilers for “Maze Runner: The Death Cure,” “Godless” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”!)

I think I saw one of your “Maze Runner” co-stars, Will Poulter, call you “Thomas Brodie-Gangster” in an interview.

It was a nickname I had at school. “Sangster” didn’t go unnoticed that it rhymes with “gangster,” and I was probably the least gangster person at the school, which is why everyone found it rather hilarious. So I’ve heard that one for a while, but I quite like it.

Why do you think it was important not to break up this last “Maze Runner” movie into two films, like other franchises have done?

Well, [director Wes Ball] has always said that, right from the very first movie, that if we got to make all three, he would only ever want to do three. He doesn’t like the idea of pulling a story apart and just elongating it and stretching it out. I think he just likes the pace of a proper trilogy. Something about three just kind of works. I’ve always thought there were two middle movies, [but] middle movies tend to not be so good anyway.

I was holding out hope that Newt would make it, but then we get a death scene that’s different from the one in the book. Did it change at all from what we ended up with?

Yeah, it did change. One of the first things we did, me and Dylan O’Brien, when we landed, was to go through this fight choreography for this scene. So we kind of got that down and then we were just kind of working. Wes really wanted, and I wanted, to also be in and out of crank, and Newt turn the fight into an internal fight... kind of struggling with controlling it, as opposed to just being another fight sequence with a zombie.

Of course, on the day, it all changes. And Wes goes, “Actually, that doesn’t work here.” So it was, as it always is on “Maze Runner,” a bit spur-of-the-moment as you work with your impulses and stuff. It was a fun thing to shoot ― quite tiring, middle of the night, I had horrible contact lenses as well, but I was happy with it.

Was it always supposed to end that way, thinking it’s a little ambiguous and then finding out Newt got stabbed?

Yes, to keep it open. And I like the way it turned out, a bit sloppy as well.

So why are you always dying by getting stabbed?

I know! You’re the first person that mentioned that, and I’m quite conscious of it, too. I seem to be dying a lot recently, and it’s all from being stabbed.

Yeah, “Maze Runner,” “Game of Thrones” and “Godless.” Are you trying to be the new Sean Bean with all the death scenes?

I don’t think I’m quite up to his level yet, but I’m working on it. I know, even the Western I did [“Godless”], I was expecting to get shot in that. And I got stabbed.

I know! A lot of people were upset when you died.

I always like it when good characters die. I would have personally liked to get a couple shots off. Yeah, like kill one guy and then get killed.

As a former member of the First Order in “Force Awakens,” how do you feel about your boy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) running things now in “Star Wars”?

I haven’t seen the new “Star Wars” yet.

Oh no! So I spoiled it!

[laughs] No, I do need to see it.

Well, as a member of the First Order, how are you feeling?

Oh, yeah. I feel I was key in the storytelling of the last one.

For sure.

My thoughts are: Damn! Blast!

What’s it like that every project is always like a “Game of thrones” reunion?

It’s been great for British actors actually. You’re bound to kind of pop around and see people in other projects.

“Harry Potter” actors have an ongoing texting thread. Is there one for “Game of Thrones”?

No, there isn’t for “Game of Thrones.” Well, not that I’m involved in, anyway. There is a “Maze Runner” one.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

Are you all going to continue that?

Yeah, it started on the same movie and it’s the same chat.

Who’s worse: Littlefinger or Janson?

Ooh. They’re very similar, actually. Both quite conniving, quite backstabbing. I think Littlefinger is more so, so I’d say Littlefinger probably. He’s very untrustworthy, but Aidan Gillen knows best.Jay-Z and Sean "Diddy" Combs attend a Roc Nation brunch on Saturday. Kevin Mazur via Getty Images

The diversity of Grammy nominees this year has Sean “Diddy” Combs reminiscing about how far hip-hop has come.

In a tweet Sunday night, the rapper and entertainment mogul hailed the award show for having its most diverse list of nominees yet, with hip-hop well-represented.

“Hip Hop was seen as a non priority in the 90s, it was seen as a genre of music that wouldn’t last,” Diddy tweeted. “It was so raw and infectious that it broke out of just being a trend and became the culture.”

Hip Hop was seen as a non priority in the 90s, it was seen as a genre of music that wouldn’t last. It was so raw and infectious that it broke out of just being a trend and became the culture. This is the most diverse line up of Grammy nominees in history!! pic.twitter.com/JKsp9pZ983 — Diddy (@Diddy) January 28, 2018

For the first time since 1999, Album of the Year nominees did not include a white man. Four of the five nominees were people of color. It’s a stark change considering a white act has won the category for the past nine years. The diversity in nominees may be due in part to changes to the voting process implemented by the Recording Academy this year. As Diddy pointed out, this led to more recognition for hip-hop, a genre that was largely ignored when it was first created.Theater fans got a treat on Sunday when Broadway stars Ben Platt and Patti LuPone took the stage at the Grammy Awards to pay tribute to composers Leonard Bernstein and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Platt, 24, who nabbed a Tony Award last year for his star-making performance in “Dear Evan Hansen,” opened the segment with “Somewhere” from “West Side Story.” LuPone, 68, reprised her iconic performance as Eva Perón in “Evita” with a stirring rendition of “Don’t Cry for Me, Argentina.”

It was a big night for both stars. Earlier in the evening, the “Dear Evan Hansen” cast recording took home the 2018 Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album, pushing Platt halfway to EGOT ― that is, winning Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards ― status.

LuPone’s performance marked her first collaboration with Lloyd Webber in over two decades. They have had an adversarial relationship since 1994, when LuPone was replaced by Glenn Close in the Broadway production of Lloyd Webber’s “Sunset Boulevard.”

Fortunately, they seem to have buried the hatchet.

Fans were moved by both performances, and LuPone’s name began trending on Twitter after she left the stage.

But at least one member of President Donald Trump’s administration panned it.

Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, took to social media to slam Clinton and the entertainers who read from the book in the segment.

While Haley didn’t name Clinton specifically, she was replying to a tweet from The Washington Post’s Anne Rumsey Gearan, who did mention the former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate:

Hillary Clinton doing a dramatic reading of “Fire and Fury” was worth waiting up for. — Anne Rumsey Gearan (@agearan) January 29, 2018

Haley fired back:

I disagree. That part ruined the Grammys. Such a shame. — Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) January 29, 2018

I have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it. Don’t ruin great music with trash. Some of us love music without the politics thrown in it. — Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) January 29, 2018

Given the long and deep connection between art and politics, especially in music, that second tweet was roundly panned on Twitter.

Here’s some of the reaction:

British Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump to London last week after a 15-minute meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, The Guardian reported.

In an interview on Sunday night with Piers Morgan, Trump said he plans to make a state visit to the U.K. in October, and possibly a “working visit” another time. An aide for Trump quickly told Morgan that a date had not yet been confirmed.

“I’ll be there. She [Theresa May] just invited me. Twice. State and working. One is a state, October,” said Trump.

A “Protest Trump’s visit” Facebook page by the Stop Trump Coalition began mobilizing protesters on Thursday, marking Oct. 1 as a placeholder date.

“It’s just been announced: Donald Trump is coming to Britain on a visit later this year. Let’s be ready ― and be prepared to take to the streets in the most incredible protest in our history,” said the post. By Sunday night, the page had some 22,000 people signed up to take to the streets, with another 62,000 marked as “interested.”

On Jan. 20, thousands of protesters gathered in London to demonstrate against Trump on the anniversary of his inauguration and for the women’s march. Last May, an online petition against the government’s plan to invite Trump on a state visit received more than 1.8 million signatures.

Trump canceled a trip to London for the official opening of the new U.S. embassy building earlier this month. The president said he was skipping the trip because he disapproved of the location and price of the new embassy:

Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018

The British press reported that the White House was worried about demonstrations.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has had a contentious relationship with Trump, said the president bailed on the trip because he “got the message” that Londoners don’t agree with his policies:

Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda. It seems he’s finally got that message. pic.twitter.com/YD0ZHuWtr3 — Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) January 12, 2018

In the ITV interview on Sunday, Trump said he “gets along great” with May, adding: “I think I’m very popular in your country.”

“I know, but I believe that, I really do,” Trump said. “I get so much fan mail from people in your country. They love my sense of security. They love what I’m saying about many different things. We get tremendous support from people in the U.K.”U2 took on President Donald Trump on Sunday in a “resistance”-themed Grammy performance that took place on a barge with the Statue of Liberty serving as a dramatic backdrop.

In a pre-taped segment, the band performed its new song, “Get Out Of Your Own Way,” in which frontman Bono sings:

Fight back

Don’t take it lyin’ down, you got to bite back

The face of Liberty’s starting to crack

She had a plan up until she got smacked in the mouth

And it all went south

At the end of the song, Bono pulled out a bullhorn and said, “Blessed are the shithole countries, for they gave us the American dream.” Trump reportedly used that phrase to describe Haiti and some African nations while meeting with lawmakers to discuss immigration.

Before the segment, U2 was introduced by Cuban-born singer Camila Cabello, who shared her family’s immigration story and called for viewers to support young undocumented immigrants, also known as Dreamers.WASHINGTON ― Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer says the Republican National Committee should return donations from casino mogul Steve Wynn.

Spicer, who worked as a spokesman for the RNC before joining Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, told MSNBC on Monday that the party should “absolutely” return all the money Wynn contributed during the current campaign cycle.

“I think we need to have a standard that says that if a credible allegation comes, we need to take it absolutely seriously,” Spicer told MSNBC’s Craig Melvin. “I think the right thing to do for the Republican Party is to have the higher moral ground and say we’re going to return the money.”

Wynn, who resigned Saturday as the RNC finance chairman, was accused of sexual harassment and misconduct spanning several decades in a bombshell Wall Street Journal report published Friday. Wynn denies the allegations.

The RNC has been silent on the matter of Wynn’s donations since the WSJ report was published ― opening itself to charges of hypocrisy given that the party called on Democrats to return money that Harvey Weinstein donated to their campaigns over his years of activity in fundraising circles.

The Weinstein scandal put Hollywood’s hypocrisy in broad daylight. RT if you agree the DNC should return his donations. — GOP (@GOP) October 9, 2017

Wynn donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican party committees over the years, including the RNC and its congressional counterparts, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

In his interview on MSNBC, Spicer defended himself when asked by Melvin why he had been silent on the matter of Wynn’s donations but not that of the money Weinstein had contributed to the Democratic Party.

“I think I’ve been pretty outspoken with respect to all the sexual harassment. All allegations should be taken seriously,” the former Trump aide said.Well, this is truly magical.

Over the weekend, Ryan Reynolds was in South Korea on a press tour for “Deadpool 2” and decided to make a surprise appearance on a Korean singing competition called “King of Mask Singer.” During the show, two singers battle it out in full disguise so that “only the pure vocal talents shine through.”

Reynolds cloaked his identity with the help of a unicorn mask and a glittery rainbow cape.

MBCentertainment

He also decided to belt out “Tomorrow” from the musical “Annie.” Believe it or not, the 41-year-old has a pretty decent voice.

In a second equally surreal clip, Reynolds reveals himself, causing the audience and judges to go bonkers.

After his unveiling, Reynolds apologized for this performance (“I’m so sorry about that song”) and then shouts out, “Donald Trump? DONALD TRUMP?” after a judge admits that he thought the president was the disguised performer and not Reynolds.

People on Twitter absolutely loved the actor’s appearance on the show.

Ryan Reynolds went on King of Masked Singer and sang Tomorrow from Annie while in the persona of Unicorn.

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who served as the acting director of the bureau last year after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey, is stepping down, NBC’s Pete Williams first reported.

McCabe felt pressure to leave from current FBI Director Christopher Wray, according to The New York Times. Wray reportedly had concerns about McCabe’s actions during the 2016 presidential election and suggested his deputy be demoted to another job, which made McCabe feel like he should leave the bureau.

McCabe is leaving his position immediately, but he is set to be on the FBI payroll for a few more months, a source told HuffPost. McCabe has accumulated leave time that would bring him past the date where he’d be eligible to retire.

The news wasn’t a total shock, as McCabe had been expected to retire later this year. He was closely aligned with Comey, who was fired by Trump in May. Trump’s firing of Comey is now part of the special counsel investigation being run by former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

The FBI hasn’t issued a public statement on McCabe leaving, and agents still at the bureau learned of his departure from news reports, according to the Times.

Comey responded to the news Monday evening:

Special Agent Andrew McCabe stood tall over the last 8 months, when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on. He served with distinction for two decades. I wish Andy well. I also wish continued strength for the rest of the FBI. America needs you. — James Comey (@Comey) January 30, 2018

Former Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday called McCabe a “dedicated public servant who has served this country well.” He added that bogus attacks on the FBI and Justice Department were meant to “distract attention from a legitimate criminal inquiry” and were doing “long term, unnecessary damage to these foundations of our government.”

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is, and has been, a dedicated public servant who has served this country well.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette says his office will conduct an “independent, thorough, transparent and prompt” investigation into Michigan State University in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal.

According to dozens of survivors, Nassar sexually abused MSU athletes under the guise of medical treatment for over two decades during his tenure as the school’s trainer. Nassar was recently sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.

“It is abundantly clear that a full and complete investigation of what happened at Michigan State University — from the president’s office down — is required,” Schuette said during a Saturday news conference. “My department ... will find out who knew what and when, who took action, who failed to take action, what did or did not happen, and what should have happened.”

Schuette said the investigation began last year, but the attorney general’s office waited to announce the news until every survivor read her victim impact statement in court during sentencing. Over 160 survivors and family members read victim impact statements in court this month after a weeklong sentencing hearing for Nassar.

The investigation will be led by Bill Forsyth, a veteran prosecutor from Kent County, Michigan, with 42 years of experience who was named as the special independent counsel. Michigan State Police director Col. Kriste Etue, her team and a team of prosecutors from the attorney general’s office will assist in the investigation.

“I’ve been doing this for a long time and I have never seen anything like this,” Forsyth told CNN.

Schuette said this investigation is “priority one” for him and his office.

“No individual and no department at Michigan State University is off-limits,” he added. “Too many voices of too many victims had been unheard for too long.”

Schuette said he has asked Patrick Fitzgerald, MSU’s independent investigator turned legal counsel, to turn over any and all information the attorney has gathered while working on the Nassar case “to ensure our investigation leaves no stone unturned.” (Scroll down to see a copy of the letter from Schuette and Forsyth to MSU’s board of trustees obtained by HuffPost.) Once the investigation is concluded, Schuette said, the report will be available to the public.

In a statement following Schuette’s announcement, MSU’s board of trustees said it supports the investigation.

“We are committed to taking the right actions to create a culture that provides a safe environment for all members of our community, and the transition to new leadership will be a key component in helping us change course. The Board will play an integral role in these efforts and in making MSU a leader locally and nationally in preventing sexual abuse,” the statement reads. “We cannot change the past, but we can and will devote our time and resources to foster healing and move forward together.”

Nassar, who is serving an additional 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three other counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, will be in prison for the rest of his life. Many of his survivors, however, are asking for the institutions that enabled him for so long to be held accountable.

Multiple Nassar victims say they reported his behavior to MSU coaches and other officials, but their complaints were repeatedly brushed under the rug. Others question whether USA Gymnastics knew of Nassar’s rampant abuse. At least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar’s abuse and failed to report it.

“I knew that he abused me. I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,” survivor Amanda Thomashow said during her victim impact statement.

Fellow survivor Olivia Cowan added a similar sentiment in her impact statement: “MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full.”

In the wake of the Nassar sentencing, heads have begun to roll with the resignation of MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA opened an investigation into MSU and a congressional committee is scrutinizing major sports organizations, including USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, about their policies against sexual abuse.

“We will put a bight light in every corner of the university,” Schuette said. “This will be done right. Period.”

Read Schuette and Forsyth’s letter to the MSU board of trustees in full:Sandwiched between the classic looks of the Golden Globes and SAG Awards and the elegant fashion we expect to see at the Oscars, the style of the Grammys allows celebrities to let loose on the red carpet.

It’s one thing to have a little fun, but of course, some stars took it to a whole other level at the 2018 Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Jenny McCarthy turned heads with her blue hair, sunglasses and gloves on the red carpet, while Ava Max’s colorful suit and Patrick Starr’s pink and purple outfit made similar waves.

Singer Joy Villas ― who drew attention with a Donald Trump-themed outfit last year ― wore another controversial political dress, this year choosing to take on abortion rights activists with a dress portraying a fetus and a purse that said “Choose Life.”

Fisher took the award over Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mark Ruffalo, who were nominated for the audiobook version of Sanders’ Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In; Neil Degrasse Tyson for Astrophysics for People in a Hurry; Bruce Springsteen for Born to Run; and Shelly Peiken for Confessions of a Serial Songwriter.

The beloved actress died on Dec. 27, 2016, at 60 years old from a heart attack.

In response to the win, her “Star Wars” co-star and longtime friend Mark Hamill tweeted his congratulations to his “Space Sis”:

Fisher’s daughter, actress Billie Lourd, also shared her happiness over her mother’s posthumous win, calling The Princess Diarist the last professional project the two worked on together.

“I wish she was here to carry me down the red carpet in some bizarre floral ensemble,” Lourd wrote, adding that she’d celebrate on Fisher’s behalf “in bed in front of the TV over cold Coca Colas and warm e cigs.”

A post shared by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Jan 28, 2018 at 2:15pm PSTThe 2018 Grammys went full fire and fury.

In a sketch during the award show, host James Corden gathered music greats Cher, John Legend, DJ Khaled, Cardi B and Snoop Dogg to audition to narrate Michael Wolff’s best-selling account of President Donald Trump’s White House, Fire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House, in an effort to get nominated for the Best Spoken Word Album category. (Carrie Fisher won for “The Princess Diarist” this year).

But there was one not-so-musically inclined reader in the mix too: Hillary Clinton.

Corden vetoed most of the auditions, including those from Legend and DJ Khaled. Cardi B ended her own reading on Trump’s cheeseburger and bedtime habits by saying: “Why am I even reading this shit? I can’t believe this. I can’t believe that he really. ... This how he lives his life?”

The sketch sent Twitter over the edge. Here’s what people were saying:

Haley was annoyed by a skit Sunday night in which artists and others, including Hillary Clinton, read lines from Michael Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. The ambassador tweeted that the awards show had spoiled “great music with trash.”

I have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it. Don’t ruin great music with trash. Some of us love music without the politics thrown in it. — Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) January 29, 2018

Ruhle pointed out the hypocrisy of someone in the Trump administration making such a critique on her Monday morning show.

“Is she aware that the president himself went after Jay-Z this weekend?” Ruhle said. “He goes after ‘SNL.’ He goes after average TV ratings, and let me remind you, he goes after the NFL.”

President Donald Trump regularly tweets insults aimed at members of the media and entertainment industries. His targets have ranged from Meryl Streep to network ratings to, as Ruhle noted, Jay-Z, whom he went after this past weekend for saying the president should respect others.

“So how does Nikki Haley say, Grammys are ruined because politics are in the mix?” Ruhle continued. “The president has put politics in everything, including our breakfast cereal.”

Artists including John Legend also pounced on Haley’s attack. People pointed out that music and politics have always been linked.

You chose to work for a buffoon. I hope it was worth it. 🤷🏾‍♂️ — John Legend (@johnlegend) January 29, 2018

Art and politics are joined at the hip. Always have been. The First Amendment protects artistic impression, political and otherwise.



It's sad that you, as a member of the Presidential Cabinet, can't see that. — Pé Resists (@4everNeverTrump) January 29, 2018“Because we all know getting in this game, getting in the culture is a lot of work, it’s a lot of time,” Ross said. “But I think Cardi B coming off, it’s like jumping off the porch moving at the pace she did, she really inspired — had to be — millions of little girls around the world. We can make this happen, and it’s not out of reach. … That’s what I think she did.”Music’s biggest night kicked off before most people were even watching, as many winners of the 60th annual Grammy Awards were announced hours before the ceremony started Sunday night.

Rap and hip-hop dominated the nominations with the awards show being hailed as one of the most diverse in Grammy history. Jay-Z led the pack with an impressive eight nods for his album “4:44.” Kendrick Lamar earned seven nominations, and “That’s What I Like” singer Bruno Mars was up for six awards.

All three were contending for Album of the Year, as were Childish Gambino and Lorde ― making it the first time since 1999 that a white man wasn’t nominated in the category.

The ceremony, which was held in New York City following a 15-year stretch in Los Angeles, is as much about performances as it is about handing out statues. Lady Gaga, Kesha, Sam Smith, U2, Miley Cyrus, Elton John, SZA and many more took the stage. To top it all off, professional carpool karaoke singer James Corden was tapped to host for the second year in a row.

Mars, who also performed with an assist from Cardi B, was the big winner of the night, completing a clean sweep for his third studio album “24K Magic.” In his acceptance speech for Album of the Year, he graciously gave his fellow nominees a shout out for their “top-shelf artistry” and “blessing the world with your music.”
