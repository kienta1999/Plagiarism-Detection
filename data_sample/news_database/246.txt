PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) ― A Russian medalist at the Pyeongchang WinterOlympics is suspected of having tested positive for a banned substance, a source at the Games said on Sunday, in a potential major blow to Russia’s efforts to emerge from a drug-cheating scandal.

Alexander Krushelnitsky, a bronze-medalist along with his wife in mixed-doubles curling, is suspected of having tested positive for meldonium, the source said. Meldonium increases blood flow which improves exercise capacity in athletes.

Krushelnitsky did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A spokesman for theRussian delegation at Pyeongchang said he had no immediate comment.

Russia has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies. As a result, its athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR).

Russian sports officials are to meet anti-doping officers at Pyeongchang, the source said, adding that any violation would only be confirmed after analysis of a “B” sample.

Krushelnitsky and his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova, won bronze in a game against Norway, which would take that medal if a doping violation were to be confirmed.

“I hope it’s not true ... for the sport of curling,” said Norwegian team skipper Thomas Ulsrud.

“If it’s true I feel really sad for the Norwegian team who worked really hard and ended up in fourth place and just left for Norway and they aren’t even here.”

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had taken note of the case without going into details.

It said that if the case were to be confirmed, it would be considered by its OAR Implementation panel, the body in charge of monitoring the OAR team’s behavior at the Games.

“On the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the anti-doping system at the Games which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,” an IOC spokesperson said.

As neutral athletes, the Russians are unable to have their anthem played in medal ceremonies or use national symbols.

The IOC has said it may allow the Russians to march with the Russian flag and in national uniform at the Games closing ceremony on Feb. 25, provided they will have complied with its code of conduct on neutrality.

The code requires compliance with IOC anti-doping rules.

Speaking about OAR player Slava Voynov, Milbury said, “He left a huge void in the Los Angeles Kings’ defense, otherwise may have gone on to win more than the championships they did already.”

“This guy was a special player, and an unfortunate incident left the Los Angeles Kings without a great defenseman,” he added.

Voynov was previously an Los Angeles Kings player until he was indefinitely suspended in 2014 following an arrest for domestic violence. After his wife accused him of choking, hitting and pushing her into a television, he pleaded no contest on a misdemeanor charge of corporal injury to a spouse. A judge sentenced him to 90 days in jail.

As commentator Kenny Albert recounted Voynov’s path to becoming a competitor for Team OAR in Pyeongchang, Milbury lamented the “huge void” left on the Kings with Voynov’s absence.

The NBCSN broadcast of the US hockey game just talked about that Russian player Voinov was recently being charged with domestic violence

Milbury later defended his comment, arguing he was merely providing context for Voynov’s suspension.

“As I said at the time when he was suspended, the league made the right call, 100 percent,” Milbury said.

Several of Voynov’s OAR teammates have argued he “deserves to be” at the Olympics this year.LeBron James made it clear on Saturday that he has no intention of keeping his mouth shut and dribbling a basketball.

The Cleveland Cavaliers star said after Saturday’s NBA All-Star Game practice in Los Angeles that he will “talk about what’s really important” when it comes to the state of race relations in America.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized James earlier this week for expressing his opinions, including the quickly infamous “shut up and dribble” comment.

“I will not just shut up and dribble,” James said during his media session. .”.. So, thank you, whatever her name is. ... I get to sit up here and talk about what’s really important and how I can help change kids.”

James has used his platform and ability to reach people. He has criticized President Donald Trump and did so again in January when he and Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant sat down with ESPN and both issued strong comments condemning the leadership in the White House.

Ingraham’s comments — they included telling James to “keep the political commentary to yourself” — were in reference to the James/Durant interview.

James initially put a #wewillnotshutupanddribble hashtag on his Instagram account after hearing Ingraham’s remarks.

“It lets me know that everything I’ve been saying is correct for her to have that type of reaction,” James said Saturday of Ingraham. “But we will definitely not shut up and dribble. I will definitely not do that.

“I mean too much to society, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don’t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they’re in.”

Durant echoed James’ comment with some of his own on Saturday.

“I feel like everybody has a voice, especially with our own platforms, we can use our voices for good,” Durant said. “It’s not just me. I feel like everybody in this room has a voice and it’s getting louder and louder every day, so we’ve got to speak what we believe in, we’ve got to speak our truths, and we’ve got to keep it real out here.”

Ingraham released a statement Saturday defending her comments.A group of students who survived the Wednesday mass shooting at a Florida high school is organizing a nationwide march to demand lawmakers make ending gun violence a priority.

The “March For Our Lives” is planned for March 24 in Washington, D.C., with sister marches expected to break out in other major cities across the country, five students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School announced on Sunday during several TV appearances.

“People are saying that it’s not time to talk about gun control, and we can respect that,” Cameron Kasky, a junior at the high school, said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“Here’s the time: March 24,” Kasky continued. “In every single city, we are going to be marching together as students begging for our lives. This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about the adults. We feel neglected. At this point, you’re either with us or you’re against us.”

“My message for the people in office is: you’re either with us or against us. We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” says Cameron Kasky, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS who survived the shooting https://t.co/23UcS7BvpW https://t.co/ERSSNzMPbu — CNN (@CNN) February 18, 2018

A 19-year-old former student has confessed to using an assault-style rifle to open fire Wednesday at the high school in Parkland, killing 17 people and injuring over a dozen others. Many students at the school, located roughly 40 miles north of Miami, have spoken out since the massacre, pleading with politicians to take action on gun violence.

“We are losing our lives while the adults are playing around,” Kasky said Sunday on CNN. “We have our lives on the line here. At the end day, that is what is going to be bringing us to victory and to making some sort of right out of this tragedy. This is about us begging for our lives.”

“The future of our country are those children that are currently dying because politicians refuse to take action.” - David Hogg, senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School

Four other classmates joined Kasky on Sunday: David Hogg, Alex Wind, Jaclyn Corin, and Emma Gonzalez, who delivered a powerful speech Saturday at a rally for gun control in Fort Lauderdale.

Gonzalez begged Congress to “please stop allowing us to be gunned down in our hallways” during an appearance with her fellow students on “Fox News Sunday.”

“We want students to be at that march and to be with us,” Gonzalez said. “We want to be with those students who we didn’t understand their pain before and it’s all too tragic that we all have to understand the same pain now.”

David Hogg, a senior at the school, slammed lawmakers who receive financial contributions from special interest groups such as the National Rifle Association, a pro-gun organization that has donated millions of dollars to lawmakers over the years.

“Our elected officials need to get together, overcome their political differences, and get some things done because they need to save the future of our country,” Hogg told Fox News’ Chris Wallace. “And the future of our country are those children that are currently dying because politicians refuse to take action and continue to take money from the special interest groups.”Sally Field appears to be gunning for a new accolade: best supporting mom.

The Academy Award-winning actress is playing matchmaker between Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon and her son on Twitter.

The “Forrest Gump” star tweeted at the 28-year-old bronze medalist on Friday after her son, Sam Greisman, tweeted that his mom was giving “some really helpful advice ... on how to deal with my Olympic crush.”

Greisman shared a screenshot on Friday, apparently showing a conversation between him and his mom. Fields encouraged him: “Sam... he’s insanely pretty. Find a way..”

Just some really helpful advice from my mom on how to deal with my Olympic crush. pic.twitter.com/shYCXwNOMf — sam greisman (@SAMGREIS) February 17, 2018

Greisman, 30, has previously professed his affection and admiration for Rippon, who was the first openly gay American man to qualify for the Olympic Games.

In a Thursday post, Greisman, a film writer and director, praised Rippon as “sassy, beautiful” and the “sweetheart of the Olympic games.” In another, he got right down to it, tweeting: “marry me Adam.”

Taking matters into her own hands ― perhaps following her son’s direct request ― Fields retweeted her son’s latest post and tagged Rippon in it.

There’s no word yet on Rippon’s response, but we can totally understand if he’s a bit busy.

“Marches aren’t going to solve it,” Limbaugh told Chris Wallace, the program’s host, after a segment featuring student survivors of last week’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed the lives of 17 of their classmates and school faculty members.

“Chris, the next shooter is out there. The next shooter probably has the gun that he’s going to use. … How is anything that we’re talking about going to stop that?” he asked of the planned demonstration.

Limbaugh then proposed guns be allowed in schools.

“The solution to me ― and I know this is going to cause all kinds of angst ― but the solution is we need concealed carry (of weapons) in the schools,” he said.

The students Wallace interviewed announced their plans to march for more sensible gun laws next month.

“The ‘March For Our Lives’ is going to be in every major city and we are organizing it so students everywhere can beg for our lives,” Cameron Kasky said in the emotionally charged segment. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t about the red and blue, the GOP and the Democrats, this is about adults and kids.”

He added that lawmakers who accept money from the National Rifle Association are wearing a “badge of shame.”

Limbaugh dismissed that thinking.

“These students think they’re taking politics out of this,” he said. “The minute they bash the NRA, it’s politics. … This is an event that advances a political agenda for the American left and the Democrat Party. Bash the NRA.”

Fox News’ decision to invite Limbaugh on after featuring the students was in poor taste, other media figures tweeted.

President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attended a party at Mar-a-Lago on Friday just hours after visiting first responders and wounded survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that killed 17 people.

The event was a Studio 54-themed disco party, according to CNN’s Kevin Liptak.

A photo posted on Instagram captured the first couple sitting down and chatting while people socialized around them in a luridly lit room of Trump’s resort.

“Please take note that the President did NOT dance,” Instagram user Sean Bianca wrote before the photo was removed later Saturday and her Instagram account was switched to private. “He and the First Lady were there for a short time but neither was dancing around as one should have expected. Their mood was somber and they were there for a very short time.”

Trump’s appearance at the party was confirmed on Facebook by prominent Florida bankruptcy attorney David Lloyd Merrill.

“So the president did arrive,” wrote Merrill, who attended the bash after hearing Trump would attend. “I couldn’t meet him or speak but was about 3’ away. Super cool no matter what your political affiliation!”

It was an unusual activity following a visit to survivors of one of the nation’s largest school shootings.

The president’s attendance at the disco party occurred amid a Twitter storm over a group photo featuring a smiling Trump giving a thumbs up while posing with law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The photo is Trump’s new header photo on his Twitter page. Twitter comments slammed the president’s “tone-deaf” demeanor.

Trump is spending the holiday weekend at his resort. He will forego his traditional round of golf at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday “to respect the dead and the mourners,” a White House aide told Bloomberg.

The president will not be golfing on this sunny Saturday in Palm Beach.

Also known as “Paddy’s milestone,” the island is actually a volcanic plug – a literal rock formed over an extinct volcano. And it turns out that the unique makeup of the rock left behind is uniquely suited for making curling stones.

There are three subgroups of the water-resistant microgranite that can can be mined from the island: Ailsa Craig Common Green Granite, Ailsa Craig Blue Hone Granite and Ailsa Craig Red Hone Granite.

Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite, which is why it has provided the stones for every single competition at the Olympic Winter Games. About every 10 years, Kays extracts several thousand tons of the distinctive blue and green varieties. The blue hone, whose tight molecular structure makes it impervious to water and melting ice, is used for the insert and running band of the stone, while the green granite makes up the body.

Baylor University is investigating at least two football players after members of the school’s equestrian team reported a sexual assault, local Texas station KWTX-TV reported Thursday.

Title IX investigators at the university have obtained video of the alleged assault in an apartment building near the Waco campus of the Texas university, which may have been posted on social media, sources told the television station.

No arrests have been made and no charges have been filed, but the investigation is ongoing, KWTX reported.

The sexual assault reportedly occurred the night of Nov. 11, but was listed as being reported on a university online crime log on Nov. 14. A heavily redacted city police report obtained by the station also described the incident. The victim was identified as Jane Doe, while the complainant was identified as Jane Doe 2 in the police report, according to KWTX.

The station reported that investigators interviewed four students — at least two of them redshirt football players. Four staff or faculty witnesses have also been interviewed, according to the police report.

Baylor’s football team has a history of mishandling sex assault complaints against its players.

A law firm’s 2016 report on the school found that the football staff actively dissuaded women from filing accusations and refused to report complaints to the proper authorities.

The university’s board of regents noted that the athletic department failed to “identify and respond to a pattern of sexual violence ... to take action in response to reports of a sexual assault by multiple football players, and to take action in response to a report of dating violence.”

Following the investigation football coach Art Briles was fired, athletic director Ian McCaw resigned and former university president Kenneth Starr stepped down after he was demoted.

More than a dozen women have sued the university, claiming it created a safe haven for sexual abuse. One lawsuit, filed last February by a university alumni who said she was raped in 2013, alleges that at least 52 instances of rape by at least 31 different football players occurred between 2011 and 2014.

The university declined to confirm KWTX’s report, saying that the issue touched on “federal guidelines related to student privacy and confidentiality; thus, we are unable to address them at this time.”

“Baylor University takes any allegation of sexual assault seriously,” university spokeswoman Lori Fogelman told HuffPost in a statement.by wildestanimal via Getty Images

A man in Australia was taken for a wild ride after a shark snagged his line while he was fishing from a kayak off the coast of Balnarring in Victoria this weekend.

After the 34-year-old man, identified by an Australian news outlet as Brett Palmer, hooked the shark, a struggle ensued.

In an attempt to break free from the line, the powerful shark pulled Palmer into the water. Fortunately, he didn’t become bait. His friends, who were fishing in a boat nearby, came to the rescue and pulled him out of the water, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Palmer later docked his boat on the shore and continued fishing with his friends on their vessel. When he returned for his kayak hours later, it was gone.

The kayak had floated out to sea and a massive search-and-rescue effort was launched after people reported seeing it ― filled with fishing gear but without an occupant ― half a mile from shore at Cliff’s Beach in Western Port Bay.

AdvertisementFox News host Shepard Smith said Friday that special counsel Robert Mueller’s string of indictments against Russian operatives for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a stark demonstration that the probe into Kremlin election interference is “the opposite of a hoax.”

Smith’s declaration was a pointed dig at Donald Trump’s often-repeated complaint that the Mueller probe is a “hoax,” a witch hunt, or “fake news” concocted by the media.

The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017

“If there was ever any question — even a single question — there is no more. Russia attacked the United States of America,” Smith said on “Shepard Smith Reporting.” He called it a “coordinated, government-sponsored campaign to undermine American democracy.”

The Russians “infiltrated our system, manipulated us on behalf of Vladimir Putin, and they did it online and in person, on our soil,” Smith added.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced Friday that 13 Russian nationals and three Russian organizations were indicted on several charges for their alleged attempts to interfere in the election to support Trump and hurt his opponent Hillary Clinton. The Russians are charged with posing as Americans to stage fake political rallies, create fake social media accounts and buy political ads. The budget for the operations was more than $1.25 million a month shortly before the election, according to the indictments.

In one case, according to the indictments, Russians reached out to “unwitting” people associated with the Trump campaign.

One Twitter account allegedly run by the Russians, @TEN_GOP, tweeted to Trump last year: “We love you Mr. President.” Trump retweeted to his millions of followers and responded: “So nice, thank you!”

The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. also retweeted several messages from the account and others allegedly operated by Russians.

Trump said in a tweet after the indictments were announced that election results were “not impacted” — which Rosenstein did not say at his press conference. Trump added: “The Trump campaign did nothing wrong — no collusion!”

It’s about time.

John-Henry Krueger won silver Saturday at the Winter Olympics to capture the United States’ first individual speedskating medal since 2010.

Krueger and ultimate gold medalist Samuel Girard of Canada were the only competitors left standing in the men’s 1,000-meter short-track final after a crash temporarily wiped out the rest of the field.

The American skater hadn’t even qualified for the 2014 Games in Sochi after he got hit with the swine flu at the Olympic trials, which made his medal in these games even sweeter.

“It’s the ultimate redemption,” Krueger told NBC. “I’m finally able to put away the story about how I was a young kid who had swine flu and ended up missing the Olympics. Now I’m the young kid from Pittsburgh who came back from adversity and who ended up being the top in the world.”

Krueger appeared to have been eliminated in a quarterfinal heat, but officials ruled that an opponent, Sjinkie Knegt, had pushed him. So Krueger advanced and later was able to raise the American flag in celebration.The family of Korryn Gaines, a young woman shot and killed by a Baltimore County police officer in 2016, has been awarded $37 million after a jury ruled Friday that the officer’s actions were improper.

Police say Gaines, 23, raised a shotgun into the firing position during what had turned into six-hour standoff, and that Officer Royce Ruby’s actions were therefore justified. Ruby fired a bullet that killed Gaines and wounded her son, Kodi, who was 5 at the time.

Kodi was awarded $32 million in Friday’s judgment, according to WBAL. Gaines’ daughter, Karsyn Courtney, was awarded $4.5 million. Her father and mother each received $300,000, and the Gaines estate was awarded an additional $300,000.

The all-female jury of six reached its verdict after three hours of deliberations. None of the money awarded was for punitive damages.

Gaines’ family welcomed the verdict as a victory for the broader community.

“This win is for all of my sisters in the movement who have lost their children to police violence.” - Rhanda Dormeus, Korryn Gaines' mother

“This win is for all of my sisters in the movement who have lost their children to police violence,” Gaines’ mother, Rhanda Dormeus, told The Baltimore Sun outside the courthouse after the verdict. “Some of them have never received justice, either criminally or civil. I just want to tell them that this win is for them.”

In a statement, Baltimore County said it is disappointed by the verdict and may file an appeal.

“A mother died, a child was unintentionally injured, and police officers were placed in mortal danger,” the statement read. “By any account, this was a tragic situation.”

Officers went to Gaines’ apartment the morning of Aug. 1, 2016, to serve her an arrest warrant on charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and multiple traffic violations. When she didn’t open the door after officers knocked repeatedly, they obtained a key from the landlord and attempted to enter the apartment. They found Gaines on the floor holding a shotgun and her 5-year-old son.

“At that point, our detectives backed off, not only to call additional resources, but to ensure the safety of the community and bring a safe resolution to this incident,” Baltimore County police Cpl. John Wachter said in 2016.

Gaines published videos of the standoff on Facebook and Instagram throughout the ordeal. In the caption of one of them, she wrote, “My son is not a hostage.”In the wake of Florida’s horrific school shooting, Gwen Graham, a Democratic candidate in the state’s gubernatorial race, called on Gov. Rick Scott to immediately suspend sales and permits of AR-15s and assault-style weapons.

If no action is taken soon, Graham said, Scott’s legacy “will be forever covered in blood.”

Graham, a former congresswoman, called out the governor and the state’s Republican lawmakers in a statement released on Friday. Her plea comes days after a 19-year-old man confessed to walking into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with an AR-15 assault-style rifle and opening fire.

Wednesday’s massacre left 17 people dead and 15 others wounded. The victims included both students and staff.

“Listen to the children who survived this shooting and the mothers who lost their kids,” Graham said. “I stand with them in demanding our leaders take action now.”

Graham pointed out that the gun used in Wednesday’s attack was similar to the weapon used during the horrific shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando two years earlier. The Orlando shooter reportedly used a .223 SIG Sauer MCX rifle, killing 46 people and injuring 53 others.

“After the largest mass shooting in modern American history, Rick Scott sat on his hands,” Graham said. “After 13 school shootings, Rick Scott looked the other way. After the massacre of children, Rick Scott won’t even say the words commonsense gun safety laws.”

“If Rick Scott and Republicans in Tallahassee won’t even confront the problem we face, how can we expect it to ever stop?” she added. “Rick Scott’s legacy will forever be covered in blood.”

Graham’s pitch to halt sales of assault-style weapons as a “temporary measure.” She called on lawmakers to move forward with gun safety measures that she and other Democrats in the legislature have proposed in previous years as a state representative.

These measures include tougher background checks, banning “large capacity ammunition magazines,” restricting domestic abusers from owning guns and a ban on assault-style weapons.

When asked about Graham’s request, the governor’s office directed media outlets to Scott’s previously released statement, which mentioned plans on meeting with state leaders to discuss ways to “keep guns away from individuals struggling with mental illness.”

“To our elected officials in the Legislature: It is time to act and engage,” Graham said.Nathan Chen competes in the men's single free skate Saturday in Pyeongchang, South Korea. ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images

The real Nathan Chen finally arrived at the 2018 Winter Olympics.

After falling (quite miserably) to 17th place after the team men’s short program and earlier individual events, the two-time U.S. champion figure skater redeemed himself with a history-making men’s free skate performance on Saturday.

Chen, 18, landed a historic five clean quadruple jumps during his long program on Saturday. In an additional quad flip ― he had originally planned for only five ― Chen placed his hand on the ice. The graceful and powerful performance earned him a personal best score of 215.08, raising his final score to 297.35.

While he lost his chance at a medal, Chen’s six-quad attempt still made him the first Olympian to land even five quads cleanly in a routine.

“I did the best that I could after what happened in the short program, and I think what happened in the short program allowed me to take the pressure off myself and just enjoy myself here,” Chen told NBC after the event.

When asked why he attempted six quads after a disappointing week, Chen replied: “I already fell so many times, I might as well go out, throw everything down and see what happens.”

His comeback impressed many veteran figure skaters, including announcers Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski, and 1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi.

“What?!?!?!” Yamaguchi tweeted after Chen’s show. “Completely inhuman display of ridiculousness!!!”

She included her own “chicken scratch” scorecard in the tweet.

Chen was breaking records way before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

He became the first U.S. male skater to land two quad jumps in a short program and four quad jumps in the free skate event at the 2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championship. Chen broke similar records the following year by landing two quad jumps in the short program and five quad jumps in a free skate performance at the 2017 U.S. Championship.PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - A South Korean province is considering a proposal to co-host the 2021 Asian Winter Games with North Korea in a bid to strengthen inter-Korean ties, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said on Saturday, quoting provincial governor Choi Moon-soon.

Gangwon province, host for the current 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, is considering the idea also as a way of making further use of Olympics venues, Choi was quoted as saying.

North Korea is participating in the Pyeongchang Games at the invitation of the South, which is using them to help ease tensions between the two countries, still technically at war. The host city for the 2021 event has not been decided yet.

A spokesman for South Korea’s sports ministry said it “hopes to continue sports exchanges with North Korea after the Winter Games” but it had not yet discussed any bid for the 2021 Games.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who held talks with top North Korean officials at Pyeongchang at the start of the Games, said on Saturday there was also a growing understanding of the need for talks between the United States and North Korea.

Washington has been pursuing a policy of isolating North Korea and exerting maximum pressure on the reclusive state to persuade it to drop its nuclear and missile weapons program.

“Talks between South and North Korea are making significant progress ... Meanwhile, a shared understanding of holding talks between the United States and North Korea is growing,” Moon told reporters in Pyeongchang.

″(I) hope the inter-Korean talks could lead to talks between the U.S. and North Korea and also denuclearisation talks.”

Last week, Moon met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, who delivered an invitation for Moon to attend a summit in North Korea “at an early date”.

Moon said it was premature to talk about when a summit could take place. “There is a high expectation of an inter-Korean summit, but people seem to be getting a bit ahead of themselves,” he added.

About the possibility of co-hosting the 2021 Asian Winter Games, the Gangwon governor said he would start mapping out details once the Olympic Games end and that the proposal would also utilize North Korea’s Masikryong ski resort.

Prior to the Winter Olympics, the two Koreas held a joint training program at the Masikryong resort.

The proposal, if put forward, would need approval from South Korea’s unification ministry.

A unification ministry spokeswoman said it had no immediate comment. Choi could not be immediately reached for comment, but his office said the issue had not been discussed and was the governor’s personal opinion.Sen. Dianne Feinstein pointed out that 18-year-olds can't buy a handgun but they can buy an AR-15. Reuters/Joshua Roberts

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced Friday that she is introducing legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase rifles — including military-style assault weapons — from 18 to 21.

Under federal law, handguns cannot be sold to anyone under age 21. But licensed gun dealers are permitted to sell assault-style rifles and other “long guns” to buyers 18 and older.

Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman in Wednesday’s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, used an AR-15 assault-style rifle, according to police. He is 19 years old.

Lone gunmen in many of the most deadly mass shootings in the U.S. over the past several years, including the Las Vegas massacre on Oct. 1, were armed with similar weapons.

“Licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21, but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR-15 to anyone over 18. This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely no sense,” Feinstein said in a statement.

“If you can’t buy a handgun or a bottle of beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy an AR-15,” she continued. “This is common sense, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in this effort.”

I plan to introduce a bill to require ALL firearms purchases from gun dealers be restricted to individuals who are at least 21 years old. If you can’t buy a handgun or a bottle of beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy an AR-15. — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) February 17, 2018

Raising the age for the legal purchase of long guns falls far short of a ban on assault-style weapons, which is what many gun control advocates have called for.

President Bill Clinton signed a federal ban on the manufacture for, sale to and possession by civilians of what it called “assault weapons” and large-capacity magazines in 1994. The law specifically barred certain semi-automatic weapons, including the AR-15. But that law lapsed in 2004, and Congress did not reauthorize it.

The assault-style rifles often favored by criminal shooters are based on military weapons. But military assault rifles have a selector switch that allows automatic fire (a continuous spray of bullets with one pull of the trigger) or semi-automatic fire (one shot with each trigger pull). Civilian versions of the rifles are semi-automatic only.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) offered a harsh dose of reality to embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt during a Senate hearing on Wednesday.

Pruitt, whose tenure with the agency has been plagued by scandals like rampant spending, dodged questions from senators on topics from unapproved raises for staffers to his unprecedented (and expensive) security detail.

In response to one of his lavish habits ― he flies only first or business class because of security concerns, according to Pasquale Perrotta, who recently resigned as Pruitt’s head of security ― Leahy mocked Pruitt.

“What a silly reason you had to fly first class,” Leahy said. “Because of a danger to you, you had to fly first class ... Nobody even knows who you are.”

Pruitt’s office maintained that he received death threats, but details on those claims are murky at best. Perrotta wrote in a memo last year that disapproving passengers were “lashing out” at Pruitt and that first or business class accommodations would prevent such encounters.

“Oh, somebody might criticize you?” Leahy continued. “You got security people that we’ve never seen before. But you have to fly first class? Oh, come on.”

“According to EPA’s assistant inspector general, Scott Pruitt has faced an unprecedented amount of death threats against him and his family,” said EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox in a statement last month.Maame Biney, pictured in an earlier race at the games, briefly took the lead in her 1,500-meter preliminary on Saturday but was eliminated.

U.S. speedskater Maame Biney finished last in her 1,500-meter short-track heat on Saturday, ending her trailblazing run at the Winter Olympics.

The 18-year-old Biney is the first black woman on the U.S. Olympic short-track team ― and indeed the first black woman to make either Team USA Olympic speedskating squad. She qualified for the games before long-track racer Erin Jackson, who is also black.

“I am super honored to be able to be part of this, because I know that us African-American girls and women haven’t been able to be in this situation before,” Biney told HuffPost before the Pyeongchang Games. “I’m really honored to inspire other women, African-American or any other race, to get out there and do what you can and succeed.”

On Saturday, Biney briefly took the lead early in the race but then faded out of contention. (Leslie Jones of “Saturday Night Live” posted footage of the heat, below.)

The American athlete finished in a time of 2 minutes, 31.819 seconds in the field of six ― nearly two seconds behind the third and last qualifier from the heat, Valerie Maltais of Canada.

In her stronger event earlier in the games, the 500-meter, Biney advanced out of the preliminary heats, but could not overcome a slow start in her quarterfinal on Tuesday.

North Texas traffic anchor Demetria Obilor gets up in the early hours of the morning to deliver a traffic report for WFAA-TV, rocking her gorgeous natural hair all the while. But unknown to the anchor, there was a little girl on the other side of the screen getting up early too to see someone with hair that looked just like hers on television.

On Thursday, Obilor invited her “mini-me,” 4-year-old Karsyn, to join her on the set of her “News 8 Daybreak” morning broadcast so they could celebrate their natural hair together.

“Growing up, I didn’t see any news anchors with curly hair or natural hair or even braids,” Obilor said during a Facebook live segment for WFAA-TV. That’s why she understands that for Karsyn, seeing a woman rock natural hair on television is “a big deal.”

The 4-year-old’s story first came to light on Sunday when her mom, Tiffny Jones, posted on Twitter about how the child would watch Obilor on television and say, “Mommy ... look, my hair is like Demtria Obilor from TV.”

Photos of Karsyn’s beauty and self-assurance touched Obilor. A few days later, the mother and daughter joined the traffic anchor on television for a special segment.

Karsyn, who was full of energy, helped deliver the traffic report for Thursday morning right next to her role model.

A post shared by Demetria Obilor (@demetriaobilor) on Feb 15, 2018 at 7:32am PST

Later on, Karsyn and her mother joined Obilor for a Facebook live session to chat about how to care for natural hair and how important it is for little girls to see themselves represented on television.

“Representation ... in society is just so important for us,” Jones said on the segment. “I want her to see other people in the media that look just like her and for her to just rock it and be proud and embrace it.”

Obilor herself has faced racism in the past for her natural hair. While she was working as a traffic reporter in Las Vegas last May, she reportedly received an email from a viewer who ridiculed her hair. The viewer claimed he had to “fast forward whenever [Obilor] comes on” television.

Obilor posted an image of the email to Twitter, describing it as a “racist, hateful” message.

Here's one of the racist, hateful emails I've received for rocking my natural hair on TV. pic.twitter.com/oA8L6gYCyw — Demetria Obilor (@DemetriaObilor) May 25, 2017

On Thursday, Obilor emphasized that it is crucial to make sure young black girls are encouraged to feel positive about themselves. She was struck by Karsyn’s confidence.

“She’s such a confident girl, and that’s so important to instill at such a young age,” Obilor said.

Jones said that even though it’s a “struggle on a daily basis” to take care of her daughter’s natural hair, Karsyn doesn’t want to do anything different with her hair.

“She loves [her natural hair] because she likes to shake it,” the mom said, laughing as the little girl demonstrated by waving her head side to side.

“We tell her to be herself. Do not let anybody put you in a bubble, you do whatever your heart desires,” Jones said.James Wisniewski and Sergei Andronov fight for the puck in Saturday's hockey match between the U.S. and the Olympic Athletes from Russia. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images

No miracles. Just meh.

The United States men’s hockey team couldn’t get by Russia’s 6-foot-7 goalie Vasily Koshechkin in a 4-0 loss on Saturday at the Winter Olympics.

The Americans (1-2) now must play an elimination game on Tuesday to make the quarterfinals. The Russians (2-1), technically the Olympic Athletes From Russia, have earned an automatic bye.

This year’s competition does not include current NHL players ― after they had appeared in five previous Olympics ― but one former league star figured largely in the scoring for Russia. Ilya Kovalchuk, who had 417 career goals in the NHL, made two goals after Nikolai Prokhorkin notched the first two for their team. (Watch the scoring highlights here.)

Koshechkin stopped 29 shots to help the Russians turn this game of rivals into a rout.

“I think it was a learning experience for us,” U.S. Coach Tony Granato told NBC afterward.The earthquake struck Oaxaca, Mexico, as seen in the U.S. Geological Survey map above. USGS

A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 hit Oaxaca, Mexico, on Friday evening, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The origin of the quake was reportedly 43 kilometers, or 26.7 miles, deep. The U.S. Tsunami Warning System said there was no tsunami threat to the West Coast of the U.S. and British Columbia or Alaska.

While the epicenter of the earthquake center was in the town of Santiago Ixtayutla, tremors were apparently felt more than 350 miles away in Mexico City.

An earlier USGS report measured the earthquake at a preliminary magnitude of 7.5.

Gerardo Ruiz Esparaza, Mexico’s secretary of communications and transportation, said communication and transport infrastructure was operating normally across the country following the earthquake.

During a preliminary assessment, Oaxaca’s civil protection office reported that there was damage in the city, but no reports of deaths so far.

Videos of the earthquake show buildings swaying as people take cover in hallways and on the street. Some residents held onto parked cars to keep themselves steady as the ground moved.

The earthquake comes just months after a pair of deadly earthquakes struck the country.

On Sept. 7, a massive 8.1-magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico, killing at least 98 people. Less than two weeks later, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico, devastating parts of Mexico City and leaving more than 350 people dead.

Shortly after Friday’s earthquake stopped, officials said there was no damage reported in Mexico City.

However, initial photos and footage from Pinotepa de Don Luis and surrounding areas in Oaxaca showed damage to buildings and stores.

SANTIAGO JAMILTEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - At least 13 people on the ground, including three children, were killed when a Mexican military helicopter carrying top officials surveying damages from an earthquake crashed in a small town in the southern state of Oaxaca, authorities said on Saturday.

The helicopter, which was carrying Mexico’s interior minister and the state governor, crashed on top of two vans in an open field while trying to land in Santiago Jamiltepec after a tour of damage from a powerful earthquake on Friday, officials said.

The senior officials survived but 12 people at the scene were killed and another died later in a hospital, Oaxaca’s attorney general’s office said in a statement. Fifteen more people were injured.

The 7.2 magnitude quake left nearly a million homes and businesses without power in Mexico City and the south and damaged at least 50 homes in Oaxaca.Mourners hold signs with the names of some of the 17 people killed during a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School at a candlelight vigil on Friday in Boca Raton, Florida.

You’ll find little in the way of silver linings in Parkland, Florida, this week, where a gunman killed 17 people and injured 15 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Nor will you find them in Las Vegas, where a heavily armed gunman opened fire on thousands of concertgoers in October, killing 58 and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Beneath both of these incidents, however, is a harrowing realization that could be momentarily mistaken for the coldest of comfort: As horrific as these shootings were, the evidence suggests they could have been far worse.

This is in no way a cause for solace. Rather, it’s a disturbing reminder of the cards we’ve been dealt by feckless lawmakers who have failed to take any action whatsoever to prevent or even mitigate mass shootings. And it should serve as a warning that as long as we continue to do nothing, we are likely resigning ourselves to a fate of mass shootings more horrific than the ones we’ve experienced.

The Florida gunman reportedly entered Stoneman Douglas High on Wednesday with a legally purchased AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and “countless magazines,” each one holding 30 rounds. When he opened fire, the school went into an “active shooter” lockdown. Teachers and students barricaded doors and went into hiding. An armed school resource officer was on duty at the time but was unable to respond. By the time the shooting was over, the gunman had fired more than 100 rounds, authorities said. But for reasons we may never know, he appeared to stop shooting on his own accord.

“He tried blending into the crowd and was talking to one of my friends as he was exiting,” a student said of the shooter.

When police arrested the suspect, a former student, they found a number of loaded magazines in his backpack. On Friday, the FBI reported that it had failed to act after receiving a tip that the young man had expressed a “desire to kill people” and spoke about “the potential of him conducting a school shooting.”

In Las Vegas, the potential for further damage was far greater. The gunman in that shooting appears to have used more than a dozen assault-style rifles in the attack, many of them outfitted with 100-round magazines and bump stocks, after-market accessories that simulate automatic fire. Although fully automatic weapons are illegal under federal law unless specially registered, the gunman’s arsenal was completely legal. According to a subsequent report by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, he “did not commit a crime until he fired the first round into the crowd.”

The gunman, shooting from the 32nd floor of a hotel, was ultimately able to fire more than 1,100 rounds into the crowd of helpless people, following a crude plan known as “the beaten zone” in military jargon, said Arthur Alphin, a ballistics expert and former West Point professor who has testified in a number of multiple shooting cases.

“This guy didn’t even have any sights on some of his guns. He wasn’t aiming them. He was just pouring bullets into that beaten zone of a couple football fields,” said Alphin. “If anybody thinks that the murdering bastard looked down there, identified a target and said, ‘That’s Sweet Pea from Arkansas. I’m going to shoot her,’ they’re full of it. He couldn’t see them, he couldn’t recognize them.”

“This guy didn’t even have any sights on some of his guns. He wasn’t aiming them.” - Arthur Alphin, ballistics expert

In the end, the gunman stopped shooting of his own volition before fatally shooting himself.

When police finally breached his hotel room, the shooting had been over for more than an hour. Inside, investigators found a dozen additional firearms and more than 5,000 rounds of live ammunition.

Based on the gunman’s arsenal, it appears that he could have caused more destruction if he’d been intent on it, Alphin said.

“He could have planned it far, far better, absolutely no question,” he said. “He was clearly a lunatic. He clearly knew nothing about his guns. To him, ammo was ammo and guns were guns.”

Whatever relief we might feel at hearing that is a telling indictment of our approach to mass shootings. We’ve given people easy access to all the tools they need to inflict unimaginable violence on others, leaving ourselves simply to hope that nobody will use them for that purpose. And when this inevitably fails, we often end up having little choice but to hope that mass shooters will choose to limit their carnage themselves.(Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment of 13 Russian individuals and three organizations for allegedly interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election sets the stage for the prosecution of Americans who may have helped the Russian effort, some legal experts said.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters on Friday there was no allegation in the indictment that any American knew about the alleged scheme. It said Russians did contact “unwitting” members of the campaign of now President Donald Trump in a bid to support him while denigrating his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.

The indictment said the Russians conspired “with persons known and unknown,” which could include Americans.

“While they went to great pains to say they are not indicting any Americans today, if I was an American and I did cooperate with Russians I would be extremely frightened today,” said former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter.

The White House took a different view, issuing a statement saying that Trump had been briefed on the matter and was “glad to see the Special Counsel’s investigation further indicates there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump campaign and Russia.”

Mueller has been silent on where the probe is headed. It has so far led to guilty pleas from Trump’s former national security advisor and a one-time campaign aide to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as indictments of his former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort’s business partner Rick Gates.

Moscow has denied meddling in the election. Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that meant the Russian government was extremely unlikely to turn over any of its nationals for U.S. prosecution. There is no formal extradition agreement between the United States and Russia.

There is no crime called collusion in U.S. law, but former federal prosecutor Randall Eliason, now a professor at George Washington University Law School, said the same conduct is often covered by the offense of conspiracy.

“The fact is that collusion is potentially a crime,” Eliason said. “This has always been clear, and it is even clearer now.”

The indictment alleges a scheme to impede the functioning of the U.S. Federal Election Commission and other government agencies. Prosecutors also accuse the Russians of opening bank accounts under false names and unlawfully using stolen identities of Americans to post on social media in support of Trump.

To charge an American with conspiracy, legal experts said, Mueller would need to show that person was aware the Russians were trying to interfere in the election and knowingly aided them.

For example, people who participated in activities to support the Trump campaign could be charged if they knew Russians had organized them to help sway the vote. If an American helped direct the Russian acts, that could lead to charges as well, said Harvard Law School Professor Alex Whiting.

“If there were meetings between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and the Trump campaign officials encouraged the Russians or guided them to particular types of work, or provided them assistance so that they could focus their interference, that would be collusion,” said Whiting, a former federal prosecutor.

Some experts said Friday’s indictment does not indicate Mueller’s probe was broadening.

Bill Jeffress, a criminal defense lawyer at Baker Botts, said he thought it was significant that Mueller made clear that members of the campaign only dealt with Russians unwittingly.

“If they had enough evidence that an American were complicit they would have included it,” said Jeffress.

But Cotter said the narrative set forth in the indictment could easily include many more participants.

“The net is tightening,” he said. “They have moved up a whole other step on the ladder.”

All we need is Khaleesi flying in on one of her dragons. Or better yet, the Night King refreezing the ice with his night dragon.PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 17 (Reuters) ― Czech Ester Ledecka produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Winter Olympics when she tore down Jeongseon slope in bib number 26 to stun the pre-race favorites and win the women’s super-G on Saturday.

The 22-year-old was ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings in Super-G and was thought to have a better chance of gold in the snowboarding events she will also contest in Pyeongchang, an unprecedented doubling up.

Bib 26 was the starting position for a racer with only the slimmest chance of getting near the podium and the top contenders clearly thought the medals had been decided by skiers in the top 20 spots.

When Ledecka started her run, Austrian Anna Veith was at the bottom of the slope taking phone calls and preparing to celebrate becoming first woman to win back-to-back titles in the Olympic super-G.

The Czech’s run appeared at par with her starting position until halfway down the course but she carved up the bottom of the run to clock one minute 21.11 seconds.

Ledecka could barely believe it herself when the green light indicated she had bumped Veith out of the gold medal position by one hundredth of a second to give her country its first Alpine skiing gold medal.

“I was wondering what just happened. Is this a kind of mistake?,” she said.

”I was thinking okay they’re going to change the time, I‘m going to wait for a little bit and they’re going to switch and put some seconds on.

“I was just staring at the board and nothing was happening and everybody was screaming. I just started to think okay, this is weird.”

Veith’s time of 1.21.12 was only enough for silver, while Liechtenstein’s Tina Weirather claimed bronze in 1:21.22 after she had earlier edged Swiss Lara Gut off the top of the timesheets by the slenderest of margins in a thrilling race.

“I thought I had gold,” Veith said. “For me it was a big surprise that she could do this. At first I thought ’is this a mistake? But I want to congratulate her because she did a really good run.”

Despite a delay of an hour because of high winds, the race got underway under bright blue skies with a big crowd packed into the stands at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre.

American Lindsey Vonn went out first but made a mistake before the final jump and skied into soft snow for a time that was only good enough for sixth.

The 33-year-old will have another chance to become the oldest female medallist in Olympic Alpine skiing in her favoured downhill on the same mountain next week.

While Vonn is the second most decorated woman on the Alpine World Cup circuit with 81 victories, Ledecka has never even graced the podium on the circuit while she split her time with her snowboarding career.

World champion in the parallel giant slalom snowboarding and silver medallist at the last world championships in the parallel slalom, she could yet enjoy unprecedented medal success in the two separate snow sports.

“I was probably the only snowboarder on site,” Ledecka said when asked how she had managed to go so fast.
