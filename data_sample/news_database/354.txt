ATHENS (Reuters) - Black-clad protesters in southern Athens have torn down a red sculpture shaped like an angel and broke its wings in a fresh act of violence against an artwork critics liken to Satan.

Protests against the 8-metre high sculpture called Phylax, which in Greek means “guardian”, have ranged from throwing white paint and spitting at it to attempting to exorcise it with a Greek priest sprinkling holy water.

It was displayed in early December in a busy area in the coastal suburb of Palaio Faliro. Protesters have included some residents, religious conservatives and supporters of far right political groups.

Late on Wednesday night a group of 10-15 hooded persons tied it to the back of a truck and drove away, pulling it down, mayor of Palaio Faliro Dionysis Hatzidakis told Real FM.

“It’s wings are now broken,” said Hatzidakis who has filed a lawsuit. “It has been severely damaged.”

“So, if we don’t like something we destroy it ... for political purposes?,” Hatzidakis said, adding that he suspected the attackers were far-right.

He said they threatened to hurt an eye-witness if he alerted authorities. If the sculpture can be repaired it will be reinstalled, a spokesman for the mayor told Reuters.

The sculpture was created by well-known Greek artist Kostis Georgiou who has exhibited both at home and in other countries. He told Enikos.gr that Phylax was transferred to a safe place and that he hopes “the evil shall not prevail”.Little Miss Muffet has nothing on a Florida man who called 911 to report that his wife had become a “black widow spider.”

William Rutger, 61, of Tarpon Springs, called for emergency help around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, saying he wanted his arachnid wife to be involuntarily given a mental examination, according to The Smoking Gun.

Pinellas County deputies who responded to the call said Rutger appeared to be highly intoxicated, slurring his speech, smelling of alcohol and unable to express his thoughts coherently.

The deputies said they warned Rutger not to call 911, except for an emergency, and left.

That message went unheeded. Rutger called 911 again about 90 minutes later, repeating his complaint that his wife had become a black widow spider, according to the police report. At that point, deputies returned to Rutger’s home and arrested him on a charge of misusing the 911 system.

Rutger was taken to the Pinellas County Jail, where he posed for the below mugshot, and was released about eight hours later, according to WFTS.

Rutger didn’t immediately answer HuffPost’s request for comment.

The Smoking Gun smoked out this fun fact: Rutger is the author of the 2009 book The Alcoholic’s Guide To Adventure. The book is “a lighthearted jaunt into the sublime world of drunken decadence,” according to its listing on Amazon.After 15 years, Spike TV has rebranded as Paramount Network, but the former cable channel’s Twitter page did not go gently into that good night.

Spike TV launched in 2003, promoting itself as “the network for men” and became known for airing action movies and shows like “Bar Rescue” and “Lip Sync Battle.” The change to Paramount Network, envisioned as a prestige network on par with AMC, HBO or Netflix, took place on Thursday.

However, strange things started on Tuesday when the Spike TV Twitter account posted this tweet.

But he also confirmed having her around is “a lot of fun.”

“I always just expect her to put on a show, belt a few songs out. But she never does,” the 34-year-old said during an interview on SiriusXM Studios’ “Sway in the Morning” on Tuesday.

“I am insisting consistently, ‘When is the performance coming?’ But no, she’s a lot of fun,” he said.

Hemsworth was asked if he ― or anyone in his family ― had any marriage advice for his brother, who is engaged to Cyrus. Hemsworth has been married to his wife, actress Elsa Pataky, since 2010. The couple have three children together.

“No ... I’ve asked my mom about marriage and kids and [she’s] said, ‘Look, we’ve been doing it for a long, long time that if there was an answer to it, and a way to do it properly, we’d have it figured out,’” the actor joked. ”‘There would be one book that says here’s how to do it.’ No, he doesn’t need my advice.”

Liam Hemsworth and Cyrus, who were engaged once before, reconciled in 2016 after a two-year split. Since getting back together, the two are constantly bombarded with speculation about their relationship status and even occasional pregnancy rumors.

Cyrus shut down speculation that she was pregnant in November, after fans became suspicious of a certain Thanksgiving photo.

“RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a shit ton of tufurkey,” the singer tweeted.

On Thursday, Amazon released the short list of cities and other localities that are still in the running to host the online retail giant’s second headquarters, which it’s calling HQ2.

Here’s the list, in alphabetical order:

Dallas

Denver

Indianapolis

Los Angeles

Miami

Montgomery County, Maryland

Nashville

Newark, New Jersey

New York City

Northern Virginia

Philadelphia

Pittsburgh

Raleigh, North Carolina

Toronto

Washington, D.C.

The frenzied initial application process drove officials to pull out all the stops to catch Amazon’s eye. Kansas City, Missouri, mayor Sly James bought 1,000 items from Amazon (for charity) and left a five-star review for each one along with a plug for his city as the perfect HQ2. (Kansas City did not make the final 20.)

Newark dangled $7 billion in tax breaks in its bid, justifying the eye-popping figure by estimating that HQ2 could generate $9 billion in economic activity. (Newark did make the final 20.)

The HQ2 pitch from Golden, Colorado, included a letter from Gov. John Hickenlooper to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Rick Wilking / Reuters

“Thank you to all 238 communities that submitted proposals,” said Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy in a statement. “Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough ― all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity.”

“Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation,” Sullivan added.

The company said it will be reaching out to officials in the 20 cities over the next few months “to dive deeper into their proposals, request additional information, and evaluate the feasibility of a future partnership.”

Two-time Olympian Johnny Weir is “thrilled” to see LGBTQ athletes taking the spotlight at the 2018 Winter Games, but he’s also had to face questions about why he did not publicly address his sexuality during his competitive days.

Weir, 33, endured media scrutiny over his private life during the 2006 and 2010 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, and Vancouver, Canada, respectively. His energetic routine to Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face” at the 2010 U.S. Nationals prompted further speculation.

On Thursday, Weir explained on Twitter why he did not publicly come out “in the traditional sense” until a year after participating in the Winter Olympics for the second time.

I am so thrilled that there are out representatives of the LGBTQ community competing at the Olympic Games. Notably, @guskenworthy ⛷ & @Adaripp ⛸ among others. It is very brave for all of us to live our truths whether on the global stage or in our own homes. — Johnny Weir (@JohnnyGWeir) January 18, 2018

Because of the attention on those athletes, many of you have written or tweeted because I am not referred to as “out” at either of my Olympics and in the traditional sense I wasn’t. — Johnny Weir (@JohnnyGWeir) January 18, 2018

I wear my sexuality the same as I wear my sex or my skin color. It is something that simply is and something I was born into. I never “came out” in sport because I didn’t imagine it as a great secret & it had nothing to do with my skating or my dreams. — Johnny Weir (@JohnnyGWeir) January 18, 2018

He continued:

I was extremely lucky to grow up in a family/community of acceptance and perhaps that’s why I don’t see my sexuality as something that needs addressing. I am forever indebted however, to the warriors who came before me that allow me to lead the life I do so openly. — Johnny Weir (@JohnnyGWeir) January 18, 2018

Weir’s remarks come nearly two weeks after figure skater Adam Rippon was named the first openly gay U.S. man to qualify for the Winter Olympics.

The 28-year-old, who hails from Pennsylvania, soon may not be the only American athlete heading to the 2018 Winter Games who identifies as queer. Freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, who came out as gay in a 2015 ESPN interview, is expected to find out later this month whether he qualifies for the U.S. ski team.Jimmy Kimmel thinks he knows how a porno video starring President Donald Trump would go down.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the comedian claimed to have obtained footage of Trump’s encounter with former adult actress Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels), with whom the president allegedly had “textbook generic” sex in 2006.

The spoof clip ends, of course, with Trump declaring it to be “far and away the greatest sex you’ve ever had.”

Just one problem: It was a #FakeWolf.WASHINGTON ― The drama and acrimony in the Senate over the past week may be hampering the chances of contacts with extraterrestrial life, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said jokingly on Wednesday.

Kennedy expressed dismay about the bad blood and finger-pointing among his colleagues, who feuded in recent days about an infamous White House meeting on immigration last week with President Donald Trump. The ensuing fallout from the session ― in which the president reportedly referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” and said that instead of immigrants from those areas, he would like more from places like Norway ― has resulted in several African nations summoning U.S. diplomats to protest Trump’s comments.

Several of the meeting participants ― Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) ― have been engaged in a war of words over what the president exactly said about certain countries. Cotton and Perdue went so far as to question the credibility of Durbin, who confirmed Trump’s “shithole” remark.

The spectacle was too much for Kennedy, a freshman who already has made a name for himself on Capitol Hill by frequently opining on events of the day with folksy and witty one-liners. In his Wednesday comments, he compared the Senate’s recent nastiness to the notoriously sensational daytime television program “The Jerry Springer Show,” and facetiously posited that it was impairing intergalactic relations.

“That’s why the aliens won’t talk to us,” Kennedy told reporters. “They look at all of this stuff, and they go, ‘These people ― they’re 13-year-olds.’”

He continued: “I’m talking about private meetings, so-and-so said this, and no, he didn’t say that, and you’re a liar. The whole junior high cafeteria syndrome.”

He added: “You know ― here’s a newsflash to you: Sometimes, people swear, okay?”

Kennedy said the discord among his colleagues was hindering talks to fund the government and avoid a shutdown of agencies at the end of this week.WASHINGTON ― Just a few days before a shutdown, lawmakers are still sorting out how they plan to fund the government past Friday.

House Republican leaders put forward a plan Tuesday night that would extend government operations for another month, fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years as a lure for Democrats and try to win GOP support by delaying some taxes on health insurance plans.

That bill would have a decent chance of passing the House and Senate, with Democrats still calling for a legislative fix for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program but not necessarily willing to shut down the government in order to get a deal.

In the House, this so-called continuing resolution (CR) could probably pass with just Republican votes ― or with only a few Democrats joining Republicans ― and then pass the Senate with bipartisan support.

That’s essentially how Congress passed the last CR to keep the government funded at the end of December. House Democrats waited for Republicans to put up all the required votes to pass a CR before 14 Democrats joined most Republicans in supporting the bill just before Christmas. And then, in the Senate, 17 Democrats and one independent (Sen. Angus King of Maine) voted for the measure even though it didn’t include protections for DACA’s “Dreamers.”

And while some Democratic senators who supported the CR in December are in question ― Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.) said Tuesday it would be “baloney” to vote for another stopgap bill ― a number of Democrats still look gettable.

But that’s assuming Republicans actually move forward with this CR plan. Or that conservatives and defense hawks let them.

Some House Republicans pushed GOP leaders Tuesday night to put forward a so-called cromnibus ― a portmanteau of “CR” and “omnibus” ― that would fund non-defense government operations for a month while supplying the Pentagon with money for the rest of the fiscal year.

“I would love to see a cromnibus,” Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) told reporters Tuesday night. “That’s what we wanted back in December.”

Byrne, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said he didn’t know if he would support the CR this time, citing challenges to defense procurement when Congress funds the military with short-term bill after short-term bill. But he and other defense hawks have had concerns for months about funding the Pentagon with another CR.

On the conservative side, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) emerged from a meeting with his conservative caucus late Tuesday night to announce that there currently are not the votes in the GOP conference to pass the CR that leadership laid out.

“Based on the number of noes and undecideds in the Freedom Caucus, there’s not enough support to pass it with just GOP support in the House,” Meadows said, adding that there were other members in the conference who may oppose the CR as well.

Meadows said he planned to go to GOP leadership and ask for this defense cromnibus, but, he said, if it was clear Senate Democrats would have no problem voting against that measure, Plan B would be to add some funding for defense ― so-called anomalies for priorities like military pay raises and some procurement ― to the CR.

Meadows also said there may be a Plan C, though he wouldn’t get into that possibility out of concern he’d end up negotiating against himself.

The cromnibus plan could gain steam Wednesday if conservatives get behind it, but it’s difficult to see Senate Democrats going along. Senate Democrats are already showing signs of reluctant opposition to a CR that does nothing for Dreamers, so House Republicans could make the task of Democrats opposing this bill much easier, perhaps sending the government into a shutdown.

But conservatives are thus far sticking together against the CR. Assuming leadership doesn’t go along with any of these demands from the Freedom Caucus, a big question in the House could become how many Democrats would be willing to vote for the short-term bill.

Last time, in December, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made sure Republicans put up the requisite number of votes for the CR before any Democrat voted for it as well.

On Tuesday, Hoyer was cagey about whether Democrats could support a CR like the one GOP leaders laid out later in the day. While he was clear he and other Democrats want a DACA fix, he was less than firm about Democrats holding strong ― particularly when there are a number of Senate Democrats who are showing some discomfort with the prospect of a shutdown over what is, in effect right now, a clean extension of funding with six years of CHIP.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could always go to Pelosi and cut a deal for a few votes with Democrats, which is the potential risk for conservatives. They may end up driving Ryan into the arms of Democrats, possibly securing a better spending deal or DACA agreement in the future.

But they’re betting that Republicans won’t trust Democrats on such a deal and that, if there’s a chance a CR could go down in the House because of insufficient Republican support, Pelosi will wait to see how many votes Ryan can put up.

The specter of a government shutdown has been raised by all the gamesmanship, to say nothing of President Donald Trump’s erratic behavior. The president could have another “shithole” moment and throw any deal into chaos.

For now, conservatives want to see if leadership will agree to any of their demands ― about 72 hours away from a shutdown.

Asked what would happen if leadership flatly rejected all of his proposals, Meadows raised the possibility of problems. “I’m sure we’ll be writing another story,” he said.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) says he ― and not Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ― is to be believed on what was said at last week’s hotly contested meeting regarding immigration with President Donald Trump at the White House. But he’s refusing to clarify what exactly he did hear Trump say.

Durbin on Tuesday said he stood by “every word” of his account of the meeting, which he attended alongside Cotton, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). The president, Durbin attested, referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” in the meeting and said that instead of immigrants from those areas, he would like more from places like Norway.

Addressing the controversy Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Cotton said that his prior remarks ― when he said in a Sunday interview that he “did not hear derogatory comments about individuals or persons” from the president and that the president was mischaracterized ― were accurate.

“I stand by every word I said,” Cotton said, echoing Durbin. “The difference is, I’m right.”

Cotton declined, however, to elaborate on what language Trump specifically used in the meeting. The Arkansas Republican disputed the notion that the president said anything “vile” or “racist.” Cotton dodged questions about whether the president expressed a preference for immigrants of some nations over others.

“The entire point the president made, and others of us made, is that we shouldn’t have any kind of country-of-origin quota,” Cotton said, adding that he and Trump supported a merit-based immigration system.

If Trump did use vulgar or racist language in the meeting, Cotton asked rhetorically, “why didn’t Sen. Durbin speak up in the meeting? Why didn’t he slam his papers down and walk out? Why did he wait to hold some random, impromptu press conference in Chicago?”

But Cotton’s response to the controversy hasn’t exactly been clear-cut, either. He initially released a joint statement with Perdue that said he could not recall whether the president used the word “shithole.” Later, Cotton said he didn’t hear any such language being used.

“My memory hasn’t evolved,” Graham said Monday, in what seemed like a dig at his GOP colleagues. “I know what was said, and I know what I said.”

While Graham has not directly confirmed Trump’s remarks in the meeting, the South Carolina Republican has praised Durbin repeatedly and noted that he told Trump in the meeting that America is “not defined by its people but by its ideals.” On Tuesday, Graham again defended his Democratic colleague, calling him “one of the best people you could ever hope to work with.”

Other GOP senators, however, said they believed Cotton and Perdue over Durbin.

“As far as I’m concerned, I have two very good friends that were there, standing within range, who said the statements were not made,” Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) told HuffPost. “And I believe them.”

Even Sen. Tim Scott, the junior senator from South Carolina, was careful not to get between Graham and the rest of his GOP colleagues on the matter of who said what at the White House.

“My primary objective is to make sure we’re not focusing on bad blood but focusing on the necessary policy decisions that we have to make,” Scott said.Former White House adviser Steve Bannon is willing to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether President Donald Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election, according to multiple media reports late Tuesday and early Wednesday.

“Mueller will hear everything Bannon has to say,” a source told The Daily Beast, which first reported the news on Tuesday night.

Axios confirmed on Wednesday that Bannon ― who reportedly received a subpoena last week to testify in the special counsel’s investigation ― “intends to fully cooperate with Mueller.” Though the subpoena asks Bannon to appear before a grand jury, Bannon struck a deal to be interviewed directly by prosecutors instead, CNN’s David Wright said.

A source familiar with the investigation told NBC the interview could be scheduled as early as this month.

The reports show a shift from Bannon’s handling of a congressional investigation into the possible collusion. Appearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Bannon was said to have repeatedly avoided answering questions about his time in the White House or on the Trump transition team by invoking executive privilege.

Axios said executive privilege probably wouldn’t apply to the Mueller interview, because Mueller himself is working for the executive branch.

Bannon “can say whatever the hell he wants to say to [Mueller] about whatever topic that he wants,” a source familiar with Bannon’s thinking told Axios.

A source close to Bannon told NBC that Bannon would “answer any questions” Mueller asks.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) sent Twitter users into a mini-meltdown on Tuesday when he was caught on camera removing a pair of glasses that he wasn’t actually wearing.

Hilinski died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his apartment. The Pullman police department issued a statement confirming his death and said that there was a suicide note near his body.

“Pullman Police detectives and the Whitman County Coroner’s Office are conducting a thorough investigation to confirm the suspected cause and manner of death,” the statement read in part.

The police went to his apartment to do a welfare check after the redshirt sophomore failed to show up for practice earlier in the day.

Hilinski was a backup for the Cougars but started the team’s bowl game against Michigan State last month. He completed 39 of 50 passes for 272 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in a 42-17 loss.

Hilinski was widely expected to be the starter heading into the 2018 season after ending last year 130 of 179 (72.6 percent) for 1,176 yards with seven TD passes and seven interceptions.

Washington State University president Kirk H. Schulz tweeted, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Hilinski family”

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) announced on Monday that she won’t attend the Jan. 30 speech to a joint session of Congress due to Trump’s “racism,” citing recent comments in which he reportedly labeled Haiti and African nations “shithole countries.”

ANNOUNCEMENT: With all the racism coming from the White House, I will NOT be attending @realDonaldTrump's State of the Union.

“I’m here on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to say I will not be going to the State of the Union,” Jayapal said in a video posted on her social media accounts. “I think it is absolutely unacceptable to see the racism and the hatred coming out the White House in a way in which this president is fueling the flames of divisiveness across our country.”

Jayapal said she will join other Democratic lawmakers who are skipping the address in hosting a “State of Our Union” gathering, at which they’ll discuss their “opposition to these racist policies that are being put out of the White House.”

The representative, who is serving her first term in Congress, is the fifth Democratic House member to announce plans to boycott Trump’s speech. The others are Reps. Maxine Waters of California, John Lewis of Georgia, Frederica Wilson of Florida and Earl Blumenauer of Oregon.

More may participate in the protest. Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN the group will discuss becoming part of the boycott at a Wednesday meeting.

Waters, in comments to MSNBC, strongly defended her decision to skip the speech.

“Why would I take my time to go and sit and listen to a liar?” Waters said, referring to Trump. “Someone who lies in the face of facts, someone who can change their tune day in and day out. What does he have to say that I would be interested in?”

She added: “He does not deserve my attention.”

By Teresa Wiltz

California this month became the first state to eliminate court costs, fees and fines for young offenders. But court officials and legislators wary of forfeiting a key source of revenue have raised roadblocks in states and localities that have tried to follow suit.

The Trump administration has further blunted momentum by scrapping an Obama-era warning against imposing excessive fees and fines on juveniles. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the move as part of a broader effort to overhaul regulatory procedures at the Department of Justice. The administration declined to comment on whether it supports the imposition of such fees.

The state of Utah, the city of Philadelphia, and Johnson County, Kansas, are among the handful of jurisdictions that have scaled back juvenile fees and fines in the past year, but none has gone as far as California.

“It feels like a steep climb now,” said Joanna Visser Adjoian, co-founder and co-director of the Youth Sentencing & Reentry Project, which successfully fought to end Philadelphia’s policy of billing parents for the costs of detaining their children.

A report released in 2016 by Juvenile Law Center, a Philadelphia nonprofit, found that in almost every state and the District of Columbia, minors who appear in the million-plus cases heard in juvenile court each year may be charged for multiple court-related costs, fines and fees. Courts use the money for witness fees, court operations, public defender fees and probation supervision. They also spend it on health care, GPS monitoring and drug tests, among many other items and services.

The fines and fees vary widely. In Alameda County, California, which did away with its fees in 2016, juveniles in the justice system were charged an average of $2,000 to pay public defenders and cover the cost of GPS monitoring, among other services. For a single parent earning the federal minimum wage, that translates into about two months of salary. In Idaho, juveniles are fined $1,000 each time they violate probation.

Racism and Recidivism

In many places, the fees are similar to what adults are charged. The difference is that few young offenders have the money to pay them — many, in fact, are too young to work. That means their parents or guardians often end up being liable for their fees and fines. For youth and their families, failing to make the payments may result in incarceration, suspension of driver’s licenses and an inability to expunge or seal records.

A 2017 report by the National Center for State Courts found that most states do not have systems in place to evaluate a family’s ability to pay fees for juvenile probation supervision or to waive those fees when appropriate to do so.

Several years ago, the strife in Ferguson, Missouri, helped raise awareness of the role court fees play in keeping the poor caught up in the criminal justice system. Conservatives such as Right on Crime, a Texas-based legal policy group, have joined liberals in opposing excessive fees and fines as costly — since they lead to more people being incarcerated — and unfair.

Nevertheless, many courts are reluctant to relinquish the revenue, according to Jay Blitzman, a juvenile court judge in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Courts do rely on the fees and fines as a revenue source, Blitzman said. But ultimately he believes they are counterproductive.

“Current practices not only run the risk of criminalizing poverty, but dramatically exacerbating racial disparities,” he said. “There’s a better way to do business.”

Advocates fighting the fees also note that it can be politically difficult to convince lawmakers and the public to waive fees for people who have been charged with crimes.

Republican state Rep. Lowry Snow, who sponsored the Utah legislation, said some of his colleagues worried that eliminating fees would let youthful offenders off the hook. So the law limits fines for minors under age 16 to $180. The limit for minors over 16 is $270.

“We’re trying to find a balance,” Snow said. “Holding them accountable but not making it so onerous that they become locked into the system for long periods of time.”

Looming Action?

Last month, the Alabama Juvenile Justice Task Force reported that more than three-quarters of juvenile probation officers believe young offenders should be required to pay all of their fees and fines before being released from probation. But the Alabama report also recommended minimizing fees and suggested that juvenile probation shouldn’t be extended for technical violations such as failing to pay fines and fees.

A recent report by a similar panel in Tennessee found “the imposition of fines and fees can significantly increase the likelihood of youth reoffending” and recommended their elimination. (The Alabama and Tennessee reports were supported by The Pew Charitable Trusts, which funds Stateline.)

Meanwhile in California, 21-year-old Michael Rizo is hoping the new law there will help people like him avoid significant fines and fees.

Rizo was arrested for the first time when he was only 11. His mother had her hands full trying to raise him in their rough-around-the-edges neighborhood, where a local gang ruled.

Rizo says he was repeatedly arrested, on charges of burglary, robbery and violating the terms of his probation. And as his arrests piled up, so too did his juvenile court fees: Ankle monitoring bracelets cost $30 a night; twice-weekly drug tests cost $20 a pop; and juvenile detention cost as much as $30 a night, he said. His mother ended up having to declare bankruptcy, Rizo said.Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said it welcomed the mass resignation of members of the National Parks Service advisory board, saying they had ignored sexual harassment cases and lied about how they were treated by the Trump administration.

The sharply worded statement underscores the tensions between the President Donald Trump’s administration and some public employees over Trump’s efforts to roll back environmental protections and boost development of federal lands.

Seven of the service’s 10 advisory board members submitted their resignations recently, panel chairman and former Alaska Governor Tony Knowles told Reuters on Tuesday, saying the Trump administration had ignored their requests for a meeting.

“We welcome their resignations and would expect nothing less than quitting from members who found it convenient to turn a blind eye to women being sexually harassed at National Parks,” Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an emailed statement.

She added it was “patently false to say the Department had not engaged the board, when as recently as January 8 we were working with the board to renew their charter, schedule a meeting, and fill vacancies.”

The Trump administration has claimed the National Parks Service was afflicted with a culture of sexual misconduct during the administration of President Barack Obama that was not adequately addressed by the previous leadership.

The advisory board members, which included Republican members, were appointed while Obama was president. Most of their terms were set to end in May, which would have allowed InteriorSecretary Ryan Zinke to choose replacements then.

Knowles had said the concerns of the resigning panel members included climate change and a difference in policies regarding the hiring of diverse candidates by the U.S. National Park Service.

The National Park System Advisory Board was created by the U.S. Congress in 1935 and is tasked with advising on matters such as the designation of historic and natural landmarks.As it aims to further burnish its environmental credentials, McDonald’s says it will make its packaging 100 percent green by 2025.

The global fast-food giant on Tuesday announced plans to make all of its consumer packaging out of renewable, recyclable and certified materials within seven years. It also will add recycling bins to all of its stores.

“Our customers have told us that packaging waste is the top environmental issue they would like us to address,” Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s sustainability officer, said in a statement. “Our ambition is to make changes our customers want and to use less packaging, sourced responsibly and designed to be taken care of after use.”

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 45 percent of U.S. landfills are made up of discarded food and its packaging or containers.

Today, only 10 percent of the company’s more than 36,000 restaurants offer recycling bins for customer use, while about half of its products’ packaging comes from renewable, recycled or certified materials, according to a press release.

The company’s preferred certification is by the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets environmental, economic and social standards for its sourced materials.

The plans to go green follow a number of previous environmentally-friendly steps made by the company, including a recent vow to eliminate foam packaging from its global supply chain by the end of 2018.

Other measures being taken include a 2020 goal, set in 2014, of serving only coffee from certified sustainable sources, as well as a 2020 goal of using only fiber-based packaging from certified or recycled sources.Trump plans to highlight “the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media” later today and on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” host Jimmy Fallon imagined how the ceremony will go down.Steve Bannon declined to answer questions about his time in the White House and refused to abide by a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon invoked executive privilege and refused to answer the House Intelligence Committee’s questions during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, according to several media accounts.

Bannon, who appeared voluntarily before the committee for about 10 hours, repeatedly declined to answer questions under advisement from the White House about his time as part of the presidential transition team or as a senior aide to President Donald Trump.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on Tuesday night that Bannon was effectively being gagged by the White House, even after the panel issued a subpoena to compel his testimony.

“He quickly informed through his counsel to the committee that he was not going to answer questions that pertained to meetings, conversations, events, etc., that took place either during the transition or while he was part of the administration,” Schiff told Hayes. “They went back to the White House and got the same instruction again, basically … effectively putting in place a gag rule.

“There is no privilege that broad, obviously,” he continued.

Executive privilege is a principle that allows the president, his aides and Cabinet officials to flout some subpoenas in order to protect confidentiality in the executive branch, according to The New York Times, although the definition has relatively narrow interpretations.

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) told CNN on Tuesday that Bannon’s refusal to answer the committee’s questions could place him in contempt of Congress.

“While we were able to ask and answer a lot of different kinds of questions, there were an awful lot of questions we weren’t able to answer based on this very novel theory of executive privilege,” Himes told CNN.

Despite Bannon’s invocation of privilege in front of the House committee, some say he will be more forthcoming with special counsel Robert Mueller. Bannon was issued a subpoena to appear in front of a grand jury as part of Mueller’s investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia last week, the Times reported.

The Daily Beast’s Besty Woodruff, citing an unnamed source familiar with Bannon’s thinking, said the former aide won’t abide by the terms of Trump’s executive privilege as part of that inquiry.

Sarah Palin (R) said it’s a “perpetual gut punch” to hear reports that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) now regrets picking her as his 2008 presidential running mate.

Palin, in an interview with The Daily Mail published Thursday, said McCain has never expressed any misgivings to her. The ailing senator reportedly makes the admission in his upcoming book and in an HBO documentary, The New York Times reported.

“That’s not what Sen. McCain has told me all these years, as he’s apologized to me repeatedly for the people who ran his campaign –- some who now staff MSNBC, the newsroom there, which tells you a lot,” Palin said. She attributed McCain’s statements to his ghostwriters.

“It happens to me also where people speak for me and a bell is rung, and you can’t un-ring the bell,” she said. “I don’t know unless I heard it from Sen. McCain myself.” She added that hearing the claim feels “like a perpetual gut-punch.”

McCain reportedly writes in his book that he planned to choose Joe Lieberman, then an independent senator from Connecticut, as his running mate, but advisers counseled him against it because of Lieberman’s past as a Democrat.Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House is headed down a well-trodden path: After selling out in bookstores across the country, a production company has scooped up rights to adapt it for the screen.

Endeavor Content has purchased film and television rights to the explosive tell-all and reportedly plans to adapt it into a TV series. The deal is said to be in the million-dollar range, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

A network is not yet attached to the project and details on what shape it could take are not available.

Wolff will reportedly be involved in the project’s development as an executive producer, alongside former BBC executive Michael Jackson, per Variety.

Earlier this month, publisher Henry Holt & Co. was compelled to release the book four days before its scheduled date after lawyers for President Donald Trump attempted to stop its distribution. The sensational book, a product of Wolff’s months of access to the Trump administration, painted the White House as a place of chaos helmed by an unstable and reluctant politician, and the president has repeatedly said the book contains false accounts.

Fire and Fury debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times’ best-seller list based on only two days of sales, and it continues to top charts.

Creators have already shown interest in series centered around current and recent political drama. The most recent season of “American Horror Story” drew inspiration from the 2016 election, and the team behind “Zero Dark Thirty” was said to be cooking up a 10-part miniseries on the same event last spring.Camila Cabello’s single “Havana” is so popular, even rubber chickens are getting into it.

Ellen DeGeneres asked the singer for any standout covers of her hit single during an appearance on “The Ellen Show” Wednesday.

“I’ve seen a couple [of covers],” Cabello responded. “The one that stands out right now, you know the one with the chicken?” DeGeneres immediately knew what the star was referring to and added, “That’s the one that stands out for everyone.”

DeGeneres showed the audience the cover, which was posted by YouTube user Big Marvel in November, and the Cuban-born star said she had “so many questions” about the video.

Cabello first heard the viral rubber chicken version of “Havana” while on “Elvis Duran and the Morning Show” last week. At the time, the singer inquired about how the rubber chicken was actually able to hit different notes.

“But I wonder if someone is changing the notes, did they go and tune it so that ... that’s just the chicken?” she asked Duran, who said there was no auto-tune involved. “Wow. So depending on if you squeeze the foot or if you squeeze the thigh, it’ll make a different note?”

The National Hockey League’s excited announcement that Kid Rock will perform at its All-Star Game on Jan. 28 in Tampa, Florida, got a cold reception from some folks on Twitter.

Cold, but funny.

Critics had plenty of reasons to protest the league’s polarizing choice of the musician. He supported Donald Trump’s campaign, used a four-letter criticism of Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protest, and enthusiastically displayed the Confederate flag.

In addition, Kid Rock hasn’t had a Billboard chart-topping album since 2007 (“Rock N Roll Jesus”), and that was his only one.

Social media pretty much called out the NHL’s choice for all of the above.

Here’s a sampling:

NHL: Why don't any women, minorities, or people under 40 watch our sport?

Hey @NHL, did you actually discuss inviting Kid Rock to perform at the ASG or was it an intern error? — Jason Kay (@JKTHN) January 17, 2018Toyota Motor Corp. has ended talks with the Environmental Protection Agency to overhaul internal management practices at the agency, the automaker told HuffPost on Wednesday.

The decision comes more than a month after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced in an off-the-cuff remark that he planned to hire Toyota to evaluate the agency’s internal practices and recommend some of the Japanese auto giant’s strategies to speed up reviews.

“We were always just in talks anyway, so it was not a done deal,” Karen Nielsen, a Toyota spokeswoman, told HuffPost by phone. “We were just looking into working with them, but that was never a promised thing.”

That isn’t how Pruitt made it sound when, at a Dec. 7 hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he told lawmakers: “We are actually partnering with Toyota to begin a lean process at the agency to evaluate management practices.” The statement came in response to a question from Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) about how the agency assessed its workload and determined how many people were necessary to meet its goals.

The announcement drew swift criticism from former EPA officials and environmentalists who told HuffPost at the time that the partnership represented “a clear conflict of interest.” The EPA directly regulates Toyota, and the automaker has lobbied aggressively to weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards.

On Dec. 13, the Environmental Working Group sent a letter to Toyota North America CEO James Lentz, recommending he abandon talks with the EPA or risk damaging the company’s reputation.

“We urge you to immediately and unambiguously announce Toyota’s rejection of any management partnership with EPA and Administrator Scott Pruitt,” EWG President Ken Cook wrote in the letter. “To do otherwise risks irreparable harm to Toyota’s brand and reputation in the American marketplace.”

Five days later, EPA operations chief Henry Darwin dismissed ethical concerns about the partnership.

“It’s not about policy. It’s not about specific decisions,” Darwin said in an interview with Bloomberg. It’s “about the process that we use in order to basically eliminate waste and maximize customer value.”

During his 20 years working in Arizona, Darwin said he implemented parts of “The Toyota Way” ― a set of “lean manufacturing” strategies to avoid defects and shorten supply-line delays ― at the state’s Department of Environmental Quality and for Gov. Doug Ducey (R).

“Even the appearance of helping Mr. Pruitt dismantle public health and environmental protections at EPA would be a public relations nightmare for Toyota, and it seems the company agrees.” - Ken Cook, president of EWG

Toyota proselytizes the Toyota Way by consulting for hospitals and nonprofits through a nonprofit affiliate called the Toyota Production System Support Center.

But Pruitt’s aggressive rollback of pollution rules at the behest of companies the EPA regulates has raised concerns even among Republican former administrators. The timing of his Toyota announcement in particular fueled the backlash.

In October, the EPA began working to repeal rules limiting emissions from truck components ― the same year vehicle emissions became the top source of greenhouse gas pollution in the country. Pruitt’s announcement in December came one day after a former Volkswagen executive was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the emissions cheating scandal the EPA investigated in 2015.

Nielsen declined to comment on whether pressure from EWG factored into Toyota’s decision on working with the EPA. In a statement to HuffPost, the EPA said: “We continue to have collaborations with Toyota to better improve Agency outcomes.”

On Jan. 9, Christopher Reynolds, Toyota’s executive vice president for corporate resources, sent EWG a letter defending the EPA talks, but informing the group that the company had “no definitive plans to move forward with a project.” EWG shared the letter with HuffPost.

“Even the appearance of helping Mr. Pruitt dismantle public health and environmental protections at EPA would be a public relations nightmare for Toyota, and it seems the company agrees,” Cook said in a Wednesday morning statement to HuffPost. “It would be wise for any corporation that cares about its brand and marketshare among environmentally-conscious consumers to steer clear of the Trump administration. They’re bad for business.”Former “Today” show co-host Ann Curry said Wednesday that she was “not surprised” by the sexual misconduct allegations that led to the firing of her former co-host Matt Lauer ― but was reluctant to elaborate on what she knew, saying she wanted to “move on” from her tumultuous time at the show.

“I’m trying to do no harm in these conversations. I can tell you I am not surprised by the allegations,” the veteran journalist said on “CBS This Morning,” in her first extensive comments about Lauer since NBC ousted him in November amid accusations from staffers of sexual harassment and assault.

“I’m trying not to hurt people. I know what it’s like to be publicly humiliated. I never did anything wrong to be publicly humiliated, and I don’t want to cause that kind of pain to somebody else,” Curry went on, when asked to elaborate. “But I can say that ― because you’re asking me a very direct question ― I can say that I would be surprised if many women did not understand that there was a climate of verbal harassment that existed.”

After Curry suggested that she’d seen what she called “verbal sexual harassment,” host Norah O’Donnell asked her whether such an environment was “pervasive.”

“I don’t want to cause more pain, but no, you’re asking me a very direct question. I’m an honest person. I want to tell you that it was,” Curry responded. “Yes, period.”

Curry was forced off of “Today” in 2012, with executives citing low ratings. But Lauer, who clashed with Curry, reportedly played a role in her ousting, culminating in a humiliating farewell appearance for Curry.

“I don’t know what all was behind it,” Curry said Wednesday. “I do know it hurt like hell. It wasn’t a fun moment. I’ve learned a great deal about myself. I’ve really, at this point, let it go. I just let it go. It has been years, and I want to really move on from that.”

Curry briefly spoke about Lauer’s firing in November, telling People magazine that she was “still really processing” the news.

“The women’s movement got us into the workplace, but it didn’t make us safe once we got there,” Curry said then. “And the battle lines are now clear. We need to move this revolution forward and make our workplaces safe. Corporate America is quite clearly failing to do so, and unless it does something to change that, we need to keep doing more ourselves.”

Over the past few months, the #MeToo movement has exposed alleged sexual misconduct involving many powerful figures in politics, entertainment, business and media ― including Lauer and former “CBS This Morning” co-host Charlie Rose, who was fired from CBS and his PBS program after allegations of serial sexual misconduct from female staffers.

On Wednesday, Curry again said that the “reckoning” was “frankly long overdue.”

“We’re waking up to a reality and injustice that’s been occurring for some time, and I think it will continue to occur until the glass ceiling is finally broken,” she said. “This is about power and power imbalance, where women are not valued as much as men.”

Curry said she was glad that NBC has put Hoda Kotb alongside co-anchor Savannah Guthrie in Lauer’s stead, marking the first time in the show’s history that two women have anchored its first two hours.Actress Jackée Harry on Tuesday said a reboot of the family comedy series “Sister, Sister” is on the way.

Harry, star of the 1990s series, was asked about a revival on Steve Harvey’s talk show. She replied with two extremely pleasing words: “It’s happening.”

Harry, who played Tia Mowry’s mother on the hit sitcom about twin sisters, told Harvey she’s excited about the new project.

“Sister, Sister” would join several other sitcoms from the ’90s and early-2000s returning to TV Guide listings.

“Girl Meets World,” a series geared toward young audiences that ran from 2014 to 2017, capitalized on the earlier “Boy Meets World.” In 2016, Netflix revived the cult classic “Full House” with the sitcom “Fuller House,” exploring the adult lives of the original show’s child-star cast. And “That’s So Raven” returned to the Disney Channel in the form of “Raven’s Home” in July 2017.Actress Jane Fonda is savage.

“Today” co-host Hoda Kotb asked Fonda and her “Grace and Frankie” co-star Lily Tomlin how long the two have known each other during an interview Tuesday morning.

Tomlin decided to make a little joke in response, turning to Fonda to say, “I knew you before your first face-lift.”

Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift comment pic.twitter.com/2qUUxReqiy — TODAY (@TODAYshow) January 16, 2018

Initially, Fonda seemed to move on from the jab. But as the women laughed awkwardly, her brain was clearly working on hyperdrive, which we assume looks something like this ...

… because Fonda eventually turned to Tomlin and retorted, “Who are you, Megyn Kelly?”

She was referencing a September interview in which Megyn Kelly, hosting her first week of “Megyn Kelly Today,” asked Fonda about the plastic surgery she’s had done. Fonda didn’t appreciate the question then.

This time the sass was strong enough to leave Kotb and co-host Savannah Guthrie scrambling for a transition, which Fonda eventually provided by bringing up New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
