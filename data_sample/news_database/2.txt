Manchester, England, will always be with Ariana Grande.

This week marked the anniversary of the deadly bombing attack that occurred during her 2017 Manchester Arena concert.

On Thursday, the “No Tears Left To Cry” singer posted an emotional tribute to the victims of the attack, which left 22 people dead, with a photo of a bee tattoo inked just above one of her ears.

“Forever,” the 24-year-old wrote in the caption of the photo posted to Twitter and Instagram, alongside an emoji of a dark cloud.

The worker bee is a symbol of Manchester and celebrates the city’s industrious spirit. According to the BBC, it’s even incorporated into the city’s coat of arms.

In June 2017, PRI reported that many Manchester residents showed their solidarity with the victims and survivors of the devastating bombing by getting the bee tattoo.

The Sun also reported in June 2017 that after Grande’s One Love Manchester benefit concert, which raised money for those affected by the tragedy, the singer and her tour team got the bee tattoo backstage.

Though this could very well be the tattoo featured in Grande’s post on Tuesday, the Daily Beast reported that when Grande got the bee tattoo backstage after her tribute concert, she got it on her arm, not above her ear — so this could possibly be a new tattoo.

Yet regardless of how many worker bee tattoos the singer may have, Grande still feels the sting of the attack.

In a moving interview, she recently told Time that even though she’s been relatively private about her feelings about the experience, there’s a reason for it.

AdvertisementCNN’s Jake Tapper made a simple request during a testy exchange with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday: The president should tell the truth.

During an appearance on “State of the Union,” Conway clashed with Tapper over the state of President Donald Trump’s credibility.

“Does his job include lying to the American people?” Tapper asked. “Because he continually does so and he undermines his own administration when he does so.”

Conway hit back, accusing the CNN host of wanting to go viral by using the words “Trump” and “lie” in the same sentence.

“No, I would like him to stop lying, quite frankly,” Tapper said.

The two continued to tangle over Trump’s record, with Conway denying there was any sort of “credibility crisis” within the current White House administration and Tapper referencing specific instances in which the president has lied to the American public and failed to correct the record.

“It matters to people that the president tell them the truth,” Tapper pressed.Actor/comic Ken Jeong had a real show-stopper during a performance in Phoenix on Saturday. In the middle of his act, he left the stage to provide medical assistance to an ailing audience member.

Jeong, who was a medical doctor before his career in entertainment, seemed to think he was being heckled by a female patron during a set at Stand Up Live, TMZ reported.

“He couldn’t see what was going on with the lights,” Heather Holmberg, who was at the show, told USA Today. “He was playing with them from the stage for a second, and it was like, ‘No, no, no. We need you!’”

A hush came over the room as Jeong realized something was wrong. So he jumped off the stage to help the woman, who appeared to be having a seizure.

@kenjeong at Stand Up Live! A woman had a medical emergency during the show. Ken thinks its heckling, when people are asking for his help. He jumps off stage to assist. An EMT helped, too. Then on with the show! Great night! He is gracious and grateful...AND flipping funny! pic.twitter.com/G0nMWb5wMM — Heather Holmberg (@TippedHatEnt) May 6, 2018

The actor’s representative confirmed the incident to Entertainment Tonight.

Jeong and an EMT in the audience stayed with the woman until paramedics arrived. The woman appeared to be recovering and left in an ambulance, USA Today reported. At the time of this writing, her condition was not known.

Jeong then returned to the stage and finished his set.

Jeong, known for roles in the TV series “Community,” the “Hangover” movies and the semi-autobiographical sitcom “Dr. Ken,” previously worked in internal medicine. Early in his second career, he continued working as a doctor while trying to establish himself in comedy. But he kept the humor out of his day job.

“I never let on I was a comedian. I never acted out. It was really important to me, like, to not be Patch Adams,” Jeong told NPR in 2014. “I was so super serious as a doctor, I would bark orders to my nurses. I was hard-core. I wanted to make sure I did my job right.”

Ultimately, Jeong gave up medicine when his acting career took off.

A Tennessee woman serving a life sentence for murdering a man who picked her up at 16 while she was being sex-trafficked is receiving a clemency hearing.

Cyntoia Brown, now 30, has served 13 years in prison for the 2004 murder of real estate agent Johnny Allen, 43. After running away from her adopted family, Brown was living in a motel with a pimp called “Kut Throat.” Brown’s lawyer, Charles Bone, told The New York Times last year that Kut Throat raped and abused Brown as well as forced her to become a prostitute.

Allen picked her up and brought her home to his bed, court documents state. At one point, she believed he was reaching for his gun, so she took a handgun from her purse and shot him, she said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati agreed Tuesday to hear oral arguments in Brown’s case on June 14, according to a report by The Tennessean. On Thursday, a state parole board agreed to a clemency hearing on May 23 inside the Tennessee Prison for Women in Nashville where Brown is held.

The Tennessean notes that Brown’s fate is not up to the parole board, as it will merely make a recommendation for or against clemency. Gov. Bill Haslam (R) will ultimately decide.

Haslam is in his last year as governor and has not granted any clemency petitions. But the publication noted that “it is not unusual for governors to grant such petitions in their last year in office.”

The Times reports that many supporters of Brown have “described her as a model inmate.” While in prison, Brown received her GED certificate and earned an associate degree from Lipscomb University, a private Christian college in Nashville.

Turner completely forgot the words to the 1986 Bangles’ hit and was later eliminated from the competition.

The Top 7 show honored Prince, who penned the girl band’s start-of-the-work-week lament under the alias Christopher. But Turner couldn’t rise to the challenge.

She got the first few words right, “Six o’clock already, I was ...” and went blank. She skipped over “just in the middle of a dream/I was kissin’” to awkwardly pick up the song again at “Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream.”In the end, she shrugged.

Judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie and Katy Perry all offered reassurance and reminded her that even the pros mess up.

“It’s just not my night,” she said.

Childish Gambino took the internet by storm this weekend with the release of his new single “This Is America” and its accompanying music video loaded with haunting images of black oppression and gun violence.

Fans unpacked the subtle references on Twitter, with many proclaiming the rapper, whose real name is Donald Glover, one of the most important voices of this generation.

ICYMI, below are some of the most talked-about references in “This Is America,” in order of appearance in the video.

Calvin The Second

Viewers initially confused actor and musician Calvin The Second, who plays the guitarist in the video’s opening shot, for the father of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot to death in Florida in 2012 by George Zimmerman.

Calvin The Second confirmed his appearance in the video Sunday on Instagram: “Got the call from one of my agents while up at Coachella that they wanted me for the shoot on Sunday, drove down and got to be a part of history.”

Warehouse

“This Is America” is set entirely in a drab warehouse, which some viewers interpreted as the country’s foundation, built on systemic white supremacy and oppression.

“Much of this seems to take place in a building/warehouse where the foundation and support systems (the beams) are mostly white,” tweeted @JarridGreen.

Some veteran Childish Gambino fans pointed out similarities to his 2011 “Freaks and Geeks” music video, which also takes place in a warehouse.

The video features a shirtless Childish Gambino donning a gold chain necklace and trousers that give off a ’70s vibe. His look appears to be inspired by the late Fela Kuti, a Nigerian musician dubbed “Africa’s answer to Handel” by one arts critic.

“Fela Kuti reverberates in Childish Gambino’s body,” civil rights activist Michael Skolnik wrote of the video on Twitter. “It is art at its highest form. Still in awe.”

Some suggested Childish Gambino’s look was a nod to the late Richard Pryor, the legendary comedian and social critic. Others noted the similarities between his pants and a Confederate soldier’s uniform.

African dance

Fans were obsessed with Childish Gambino’s nod to African dances, including Shoki and Gwara Gwara, a style of dance popularized in South Africa (and featured in Rihanna’s 2018 Grammys performance).

“Childish Gambino reeks of talent,” tweeted @muchman16. “I loved the part where those kids danced shoki and gwara gwara.”

Others pointed out how dance trends can distract from the life-or-death situations affecting black communities.

“Childish Gambino’s #ThisIsAmerica spoke to me as a black South African women,” tweeted @Cpaw2. “Women being hunted and killed while society does the gwara gwara.”

Jim Crow

Shook by how fast I caught this reference. I haven’t seen a Jim Crow picture in years. Donald Glover did not come to play with y’all today. #ThisIsAmerica pic.twitter.com/5Xq4tLSJ7P — Nick (@nicky_furiosa) May 6, 2018

Justin Simien, the filmmaker behind “Dear White People,” tweeted a “love letter” to the video on Sunday, breaking down its searing use of Jim Crow imagery.

“Jim Crow began as one of the first fits of white American culture to address it’s former African slaves (and their descendants) at all,” Simien wrote. “A minstrelsy mainstay played by white men in black face, and sometimes by black men in black face.”

“Jim Crow began as mere pop culture entertainment at the expense of America’s freed slaves and became the means of their oppression,” he continued, noting that the character’s name was eventually lent to laws enforcing racial segregation in the U.S.

America’s gun obsession

Childish Gambino/YouTube

Each time Childish Gambino fires a gun in “This Is America,” he hands it off to someone who whisks it away in a red cloth. Viewers interpreted these scenes as a reference to Americans’ willingness to protect gun rights over people, despite the country’s alarmingly high rates of gun violence.

“Because this is America,” tweeted @Shugah. “We shoot up schools, churches, each other and then we place the guns tenderly in a cloth to protect them. And then we dance.”

Suicide

No one caught the fact that at 2:13, a man jumps to his death. It shows how we don’t care about suicide in America, yet are all in when it’s a dance/trend. This Is America. #thisisamerica @donaldglover pic.twitter.com/OXhFMUjX6V — iris (@siriouslyyy) May 7, 2018

One viewer suggested the apparent suicide scene points to a pervasive mental illness stigma plaguing the African-American community.

“Does the man jumping to his death that goes largely unnoticed because of Gambino’s dancing serve as a reminder that suicide & poor mental health in the African American community is being ignored,” asked @JuelzKojoey on Twitter.

Charleston massacre

Childish Gambino/YouTube

One of the most disturbing scenes in “This Is America” features an all-black church choir getting shot up with an assault-style rifle. The massacre appears to be a reference to the 2015 mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a white gunman killed nine black churchgoers.

“Childish Gambino really made a reference to the Charleston church shooting that happened in 2015,” tweeted @EmanThatKid. “He shows how mass shootings are normalized in America, even if you shooting up a place of worship.”

Viral videos of police brutality and racism

Childish Gambino/YouTube

In one scene, black teenagers use their phones to record the chaos unfolding below, as their mouths appear to be covered by a white material.

Some viewers believed this to be a reference to the rise of viral videos of police brutality and racist encounters to overcome the metaphorical muzzling of black people in a white supremacist system.

“Kids are seen recording everything on their phones, referencing the use of livestreams in police shootings as a means of documenting and sharing the truth,” tweeted @thelocalemo. “Gambino’s lyrics state, ‘this is a celly, that’s a tool.’”

White horse

Childish Gambino/YouTube

It’s easy to miss the white stallion galloping by in the background on the first viewing of “This Is America.” Upon closer look, viewers pointed to biblical references of a “pale horse” heralding the apocalypse, which largely goes unnoticed by the characters dancing in the foreground of the video.

Karen Civil, a social media and marketing guru, pointed out the specific passage from the Bible’s Book of Revelation: “And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.”

Traffic stop killings

Toward the end of the video, Childish Gambino dances atop a red car surrounded by other decades-old cars with their hazard lights flashing and doors open.

Viewers drew connections to the black men routinely killed by police during traffic stops, including Philando Castile in Minnesota in 2016.

“Do a lot of those cars ... have their drivers side doors open and hazards on cause they’re symbolic of the cars of all the people pulled over and killed by the police?” wondered Twitter user @giddy_pony.

Others found economic symbolism within the sea of beat-up cars.

“I’m having a 4 am finals procrastination epiphany that the mostly parked, vacant cars in #ThisIsAmerica reference to the stalled socioeconomic and political mobility of Black people in America,” tweeted @izaynab.

SZA

R&B singer SZA made an appearance in “This Is America,” sending her fans into a frenzy. Viewers noted the similarities between her hairstyle and the Statue of Liberty’s crown.

SZA appeared to confirm the Lady Liberty theories Sunday on Instagram.

The Sunken Place

Anyone who has seen the film “Get Out” likely picked up on the eerie vibes at the end of the video as Childish Gambino attempts to escape the warehouse. It reminded many of “the Sunken Place” seen in the 2017 film, the mental space where the main character Chris goes after he’s been brainwashed, unable to control his body.

“The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized,” Jordan Peele, the movie’s director, explained on Twitter in March 2017. “No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us.”

Daniel Kaluuya, who played Chris in “Get Out,” introduced Childish Gambino’s performance of “This Is America” on “Saturday Night Live.”

Ad-libs

Twitter user @_mikepearson suggested “This Is America” features over a dozen improvised lines from mostly black artists, including Kendrick Lamar and Offset.

However, Complex pointed out that the streaming music service Tidal only lists Young Thug, 21 Savage, Quavo, Slim Jxmmi and BlocBoy JB as contributors on the song.But there’s gems all through this thing, so I think that it’s all that data harvesting is in there as well as all the technology for the hosts. Just imagine: Their eyes are cameras, their hard drives are downloading everything, so there’s so much information. Again, that’s a guess.

Dolores has been out there killing a bunch of people. How does Peter feel about his daughter? Is he proud?

Yeah, I mean, I don’t think Peter is cognizant of it enough to be aware of it at that point, but I was looking at your theory, and you were theorizing about the [hosts eventually having babies] and stuff, and how Maeve [Thandie Newton] is dead set on finding her daughter. And then you have the image [of a mother and baby in the new titles], and I don’t know what it means, I really don’t. I was just listening to your report on that. ... If you go back to that pilot, you have Peter and he’s completely devoted to Dolores when he’s talking to Ford [Anthony Hopkins], who asks, “What are your drives?” He said to take care of my cattle, take care of my wife, and to protect Dolores, so that’s another thing that goes to kind of what you were saying. And Peter is the first host to show that undying love for his child.

Yeah, I’m into that theory. I’m sure there’s going to be robot babies.

Oh, and by the way, I gotta give props to you and your cohort Leigh, who said “Bernarmy.” That was hysterical.

Hey, thanks. There are so many Bernards in the trailer.

Yeah, I love that, because I had to go back and stop the trailer and say, “Was that a bunch of Bernards there? Damn, it was a bunch of Bernards.” I wish they had a bunch of Peters.

[Laughs] Definitely. And with all those Bernards, who knows if the Bernard we’re seeing is actually Bernard or some other character in disguise as Bernard?

Man, I have no clue. I have no clue, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that he has to be, because you saw Peter in that Season 1 scene with Tony Hopkins. You saw him be Peter, and you saw him be The Professor. It’s unlikely that Bernard was ever programmed to be anything but Bernard, but you never know what Ford was up to and why he likes making so many of them.

What was it like working with Anthony Hopkins in Season 1?

The first time I met Tony―

Oh, so Anthony Hopkins likes to be called Tony? Because my colleague recently did an interview and wondered if Robert De Niro liked to be called Bob.

So does Robert Redford. He likes to be called Bob. I haven’t worked with him, but I have friends that have that call him Bob.

And Anthony introduces himself as Tony?

I got the part on a Friday, and on Monday I was sitting at a table with Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Wright, Jonah Nolan and in walks J.J. Abrams, so it was quite a day.

When I first walked in, I walked up to Jonah Nolan, and I had never met Jonathan, and we did it at one of the buildings on the Western set. Jonah comes walking out, and he introduces himself. “So glad to have you on board.” I said, “So glad to be on board.” And there’s Anthony Hopkins and Jeffrey. I can’t remember how he introduced him, whether it was Anthony or Sir Anthony, but first thing out of his mouth was, “Call me Tony.”

Wow, how was it being in that room?

I’ll be honest with you, Bill. I was more intimidated in that rehearsal by the time J.J. walked in than I was doing the scene with Anthony.

So words are important in this show.

Every word. Every word. There are no mistakes.

There’s a word that both Dolores and Peter seem to repeat a lot, and that’s “splendor.”

As soon as Dolores said, “Have you ever seen anything with so much splendor?” And I thought immediately, you know Papa Peter, I was like, “Yeah, baby. That’s my girl.”

I loved that. That was very exciting to me. I hang on every word everyone says anyway, because I’m kind of a nutty fan like everybody else, but it’s always kind of gratifying when you get a piece of inside information like that. I think it’s just a word she’s been programmed to know.

For sure. It seems like there’s always something more happening, though.

The biggest mystery to me, quite frankly ― and it’s because I was part of it ― is why did Peter have the trigger [“These violent delights ...”] first of all? Because Dolores didn’t have it until I gave it to her. Well, it had to come from Arnold.

Also, was that picture that set him off planted there?

Well, I guess that’s the other part. I kind of question that. OK, it fell out [of William’s pocket]. It took 30 years to find, but it kind of lasted?

I’m totally with you. Something’s going on there.

Yeah, something’s going on.

I just interviewed the woman in the photo.

Oh, did you? I’m dying to see that.

Yeah, and I said, “You know, you really messed up Peter Abernathy’s life.” She’s into meeting up and reconciling. Would you be up for that?

[Laughs] I would love to. I would love to.A new book about Robin Williams features a heartbreaking anecdote about his shattered confidence toward the end of his life.

While shooting the 2014 film “Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,” the Oscar-winning actor was in the throes of a deep depression, according to “Robin” by David Itzkoff.

“He was sobbing in my arms at the end of every day. It was horrible. Horrible,” makeup artist Cheri Minns says in the book, according to Deadline. “I said to his people, ‘I’m a makeup artist. I don’t have the capacity to deal with what’s happening to him.’”

Minns said she advised him to return to stand-up comedy to shed his depression. “He just cried and said, ‘I can’t, Cheri. I don’t know how anymore. I don’t know how to be funny.’”

Williams killed himself at age 63 in 2014.

He was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, but an autopsy revealed that he actually had Lewy body dementia, which progressively attacks thought, memory and movement and can even cause hallucinations.

On Friday, a 2014 interview with DJ Khaled resurfaced and went viral. In it, the musician admitted that when he gets wild, wild thoughts they don’t include performing oral sex on his wife, Nicole Tuck.

“I don’t do that,” Khaled said at the time. He, however, also believes that his wife should return the favor that apparently she’s never received.

“You gotta understand, I’m the don. I’m the king,” he told the hosts of radio show “The Breakfast Club” when asked if he’d be OK with his wife refusing to go downtown on him. “It’s different rules for men. You gotta understand, we the king,”

On Sunday, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson caught wind of this double standard and decided to not only throw in his two cents, but also let everyone know that the Scorpion King takes care of his queen.

In a sweeping enforcement change, Donald Trump’s administration will increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who cross the border illegally, even if that means splitting children from their parents and regardless of whether they’re seeking safety in the U.S., Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday.

It’s already happening. On April 27, Border Patrol officers picked up a 30-year-old Salvadoran woman, Morena Mendoza Romaldo, with one of her children after she crossed into the U.S. near San Diego. She fled El Salvador because of sexual violence, according to court filings. She clearly told Border Patrol that she was afraid to return there; an arrest narrative filed in court has “credible fear claim” written on it.

Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. But previously the Justice Department rarely targeted family units — as the Border Patrol describes parents who cross with their children — for prosecution. Instead, authorities typically routed migrant families to immigration courts, and they were often released from detention after three weeks because of a court order limiting how long undocumented children may remain locked up. People with credible fear of being returned to their native countries were likewise often sent to immigration court instead of being criminally prosecuted.

But now, with the Trump administration looking for ways to crack down on policies its officials deride as “catch and release,” the response has gotten harsher.

Mendoza’s case was one of 11 immigration prosecutions filed against alleged members of a caravan of asylum-seeking Central Americans. At least two others were also separated from their children after facing prosecution for illegal entry.

Sessions and Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting Director Thomas Homan said during a press conference in San Diego that the Department of Homeland Security would refer for prosecution all cases of people crossing illegally, as part of a zero-tolerance policy — regardless of whether they’re fleeing persecution or traveling with children.

“People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border,” Sessions insisted. He later said, “We don’t want to separate families, but we don’t want families to come to the border illegally.”

It will be up to individual U.S. attorneys to decide how many of the migrants will face criminal charges. In the past, limits on the number of government attorneys or courtroom capacity led authorities to instead route most people caught at the border through the traditional deportation process without convicting them of a crime first. Last week Sessions announced that the Justice Department hired 35 more assistant U.S. attorneys to help prosecute immigration crimes in the five federal districts that touch the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration prosecutions have taken up roughly half the federal criminal docket since 2008, after policy changes pioneered by George W. Bush, institutionalized under Barack Obama and now enthusiastically embraced by Trump.

The zero-tolerance policy won’t apply to those who seek asylum at ports of entry, which is not illegal, although the Trump administration has publicly urged migrants to stay in Mexico instead. At least two of the 11 alleged caravan members facing prosecution for illegal entry — Olga Esmeralda George and Marbel Yaneth Ramirez-Raudales — said they tried to initiate asylum claims at a nearby port of entry but were turned away, according to court filings.

Sessions’ plans are already facing opposition from the San Diego Federal Public Defenders’ Office. Illegal entry prosecutions are often open and shut cases. But attorney Eric Fish has asked the court to dismiss three of the 11 alleged caravan members’ cases, arguing that his clients, including Mendoza, were targeted for political reasons that amount to unconstitutional discrimination.

“If other countries treated people seeking refugee protection in this way, the United States would be appalled.” - Eleanor Acer, refugee protection program director, Human Rights First

In court filings littered with Trump’s tweets excoriating the caravan, Fish contended that Border Patrol agents arrested the three defendants at the same time as a group of Indian nationals. But the Indians were never prosecuted.

“The government cannot choose its defendants based on their alleged country of citizenship, but that’s exactly what it did here,” he wrote in a court filing. “The Court should not stand for such invidious discrimination, and should dismiss the complaint.”

Fish is also disputing the $10,000 bonds set by the court, arguing that his clients present no flight risk and could be instead monitored by GPS and released on their own recognizance.

The cases highlight how much energy Sessions is devoting to some of the pettiest crimes possible. Until he announced his zero-tolerance policy, illegal-entry prosecutions were all but unheard of in San Diego. And in the three contested cases, the government offered to free the defendants on time served if they pleaded guilty.

At least two of the defendants said they intend to seek asylum, which generally exempts people from criminal prosecution for illegally crossing the border. One of them, Yaneth, attempted to turn herself in at a legal port of entry but was turned away, according to court filings. Under U.S. law and international treaty obligations, Customs and Border Protection is required to let in migrants who say they fear persecution in their country of origin. But CBP faces a lawsuit in the Southern District of California alleging that the agency often flouts those rules.

Organizers with the caravan disputed that the migrants facing prosecution were affiliated with their group, though they said it’s possible that some had joined the caravan and later left it. At its peak, the number of migrants traveling with the caravan topped 1,000, but its numbers dwindled to fewer than 300 as some decided to remain in Mexico, were counseled that their asylum claims would be hard to press in U.S. courts or were repelled by the open hostility of top Trump administration officials.

“It’s pretty obvious that they don’t know who is part of the caravan or not,” said Alex Mensing — an organizer with Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which coordinated the caravan — noting that one of the defendants, Eric Alberto López Robles, is a Mexican national and that the caravan did not work with any Mexican adults. “It just doesn’t add up.”

Those crossing with the caravan were instructed to go through a legal port of entry to make their claims and were advised against crossing illegally, according to Nicole Ramos, the director of Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit group that is offering legal services to the caravan’s members. Ramos, who once worked as a federal public defender, said that in legal workshops, she warned about the threat of prosecution.

“After people were given transit visas, perhaps some of them went in other directions, but they were not integrated into the caravan,” she said. “The goal of the caravan was to get to Tijuana and present themselves legally. And as part of the legal orientation we gave, we specifically advised people about criminal prosecutions.”

Prosecuting people who are seeking asylum could violate international law, according to human rights advocates. Border Patrol was warned about this at least once, when the DHS Office of the Inspector General issued a report in 2015 saying the agency risked violating U.S. treaties by referring people for prosecution even though they expressed fear of persecution in their native country.

Immigrant rights advocates have been hearing for months from parents who were separated from their children and in some cases aren’t sure how to get in touch with them. The practice “is simply barbaric,” said Eleanor Acer, who leads the refugee protection program at Human Rights First.He is Groot. Marvel Studios

Spoilers ahead for “Avengers: Infinity War.”

James Gunn, director of “Guardians of the Galaxy” decided to ruin everyone’s Sunday by interpreting Groot’s final line from “Avengers: Infinity War” — and man, will it give you a case of the sads.

As most fans of the Marvel cinematic universe already know, Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) is a talking tree with a very limited vocabulary. In fact, the only thing he ever says is “I am Groot,” and Rocket — a gun-slinging raccoon with the voice of Bradley Cooper — is one of the only characters that can decode what the adorable plant is actually saying.

In “Infinity War,” a teenage Groot suddenly dies when Thanos (Josh Brolin) kills half the life in the universe with a snap. As Groot is fading into oblivion, he says one last “I am Groot” to Rocket, which only the foul-mouthed critter could understand.

That is, until now.

When a fan asked Gunn on Twitter what Groot actually said, the director offered up a translation.

“Dad” — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) May 6, 2018

When another fan questioned him about the interpretation since Gunn does not have a writer or director credit in “Infinity War” (though Drax actor Dave Bautista said he did write some dialogue for the film), Gunn gave a pretty pragmatic answer:

It was in the screenplay. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) May 7, 2018

Needless to say, many fans felt a whole lot like this.

Gunn sure likes to drop mind-blowing fact-bombs about Groot on Twitter.

In February, he shook the social media platform when he revealed that Baby Groot in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” was actually the son of Groot — a full-grown tree man who gave his life to protect his friends in “Guardians of the Galaxy.”

In “Guardians of the Galaxy,” Baby Groot is grown from a twig of the dead Groot, and many fans assumed that Baby Groot was a reincarnation of Groot and not his son.

Anything related to Kanye West these days comes with a massive caveat due to his still-unfolding Twitter meltdown (side note: please, PLEASE stop), but if there’s one saving grace, it’s his relationship with Kim Kardashian.

It’s been four years since the couple’s lavish Italian wedding, which was somewhat surprisingly not featured on the family’s reality show. On Thursday, Kardashian threw back to the big day with a previously unseen photo of the two. Predictably, West is not smiling in the pic.

“4 years down and forever to go.... Thank you babe for giving me our family and caring so much about us,” she wrote alongside the sun-kissed photo of the couple at their wedding. “Thank you for inspiring me on a daily, I’m so lucky. I can’t wait for forever... Happy Anniversary.”

In case you forgot, their wedding was a gorgeous display of what money can buy.

After pre-wedding festivities in Paris at iconic locations like the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles, where Lana Del Rey performed, guests were then whisked off to Florence, Italy, with no warning. There, Kardashian, stunning in a custom Givenchy gown, married West at the historic Forte di Belvedere in front of two towering flower walls.

The 200 attendees included famous types like Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Rachel Roy and La La Anthony. Jay-Z and Beyoncé famously did not attend ― a snub that would become a point of contention in the rappers’ rift later.

Kardashian’s mother, Kris Jenner, was apparently feeling the anniversary spirit as well.

“4 beautiful years and 3 gorgeous babies later, I’m beyond happy for you and so proud of your precious family. Your wedding was a memory I will never forget,” she wrote on Instagram. “Such a beautiful memory for such an amazing beautiful couple and I will cherish it for the rest of my life.”

While Kim and Kanye have certainly had their own ups and downs over the last four years, Kimye seems to be as untouchable as ever.Check it out in the clip above.

Now some fans are worried that he might not be coming back.

Given that HBO renewed the show last year to run through 2020, however, it was almost certainly just a joke involving Russell Crowe, koalas and chlamydia.

Oliver made headlines last month after he purchased a bunch of Russell Crowe memorabilia ― including a jock strap worn during the 2005 film “Cinderella Man” ― in the actor’s divorce auction. He then sent the jockstrap to one of the last Blockbuster video stores in Alaska.

When Crowe got wind of it, the Oscar-winning actor announced that the money from Oliver’s purchases would be used for wildlife. Specifically, it would help koalas with chlamydia. And so, the Irwin family released a video formally unveiling The John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward:

“That may honestly be the greatest thing I’ve ever seen,” Oliver said on Sunday night, explaining that a koala chlamydia ward was actually his goal from the very beginning. “What I’m essentially saying here is, we’ve accomplished everything we set out to do on this show. Which means thanks very much everyone, but we are fucking done here.”

Then, Oliver said “goodbye forever,” dropped his mic and walked off stage, sparking a chain reaction on Twitter:

@iamjohnoliver You got me good. Started to tear up😢 — Cat Brooks (@CatAcc8) May 7, 2018President Donald Trump on Monday urged voters in West Virginia to reject former coal executive and GOP Senate candidate Don Blankenship, throwing his support behind the two other major contenders in Tuesday’s primary.

To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018

All three leading candidates in the GOP primary have tried to attach themselves to Trump by emphasizing their commitment to his agenda. Last month, Trump invited two of them, Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), to appear with him at a White House event on taxes. Blankenship was not asked to attend.

Claiming that Blankenship “can’t win the General Election,” Trump on Monday alluded to the U.S. Senate special election in Alabama last year, where he made a similar endorsement. He initially endorsed the establishment candidate, then-Sen. Luther Strange (R), over challenger Roy Moore, who had a history of controversy.

When Moore defeated Strange in the primary, Trump quickly backed Moore and essentially disavowed his support of Strange, deleting his tweets about the latter.

Moore later lost to Democrat Doug Jones, after facing sexual misconduct allegations from nearly 10 women, including accusations of child molestation. After the election result, Trump tried to distance himself from Moore by reverting back to his previous argument that Strange would have won the general election.

Republican operatives are reportedly worried that Blankenship could win Tuesday’s primary in West Virginia. The former CEO of Massey Energy served a year in prison for his involvement in the deadly Upper Big Branch mine explosion. Blankenship continues to deny any responsibility for the accident, despite his conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws.

He has also made bizarre attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a major part of his campaign platform, standing by his use of the racial slur “Chinaperson” to describe McConnell’s father-in-law, and arguing in a campaign ad that McConnell “has created millions of jobs for China people.”

The winner of Tuesday’s contentious race will challenge incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in November. Manchin’s seat is a top target of Republicans in this year’s midterm elections.

In a statement Monday, Blankenship dismissed Trump’s tweet, calling the president “a very busy man and he doesn’t know me and he doesn’t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.”

“The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the president’s agenda,” Blankenship continued. “Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message — no one, I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.”

Meanwhile, Jenkins said he was “honored” by Trump’s tacit endorsement.

“I’m honored that President Trump encouraged voters to cast their vote for me to Make America Great Again,” he said in a statement. “I’m the only candidate in this race who has backed Donald Trump since day one, and as senator, I’ll continue working side-by-side with him in the best interests of West Virginia and our conservative values.”Connecticut’s legislature has passed a bill that would give the state’s Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationally.

The state Senate voted 21-14 on Saturday to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which includes 10 states and the District of Columbia. The state House passed the measure last week, 77 to 73.

The #CTSenate just adopted legislation opting #CT into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, under which states allocate electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes.



It next moves to the Governor's desk for his signature. https://t.co/HDRl0Yr7kY — Governor Dan Malloy (@GovMalloyOffice) May 5, 2018

The compact requires its members to cast their Electoral College ballots for the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. The agreement goes into effect once states representing at least 270 electoral votes — the number needed for a candidate to win the presidency — signs the compact.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) has promised to sign the legislation committing his state to the interstate agreement. Once he does so, the compact will have 172 electoral votes. California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia have already signed the accord.

Malloy has described the current Electoral College voting system as “fundamentally unfair.”

“With the exception of the presidency, every elected office in the country, from city council, to United States senator, to governor, is awarded the candidate who receives the most votes,” the governor said, according to the Connecticut Mirror. “The vote of every American citizen should count equally, yet under the current system, voters from sparsely populated states are awarded significantly more power than those from states like Connecticut.”

In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump lost the popular vote by almost 3 million ballots, but won the electoral vote 304 to 227, thus clinching the presidency.

According to The Associated Press, Connecticut ― which cast its seven electoral votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 ― will be the first state to join the National Popular Vote agreement since Trump’s victory.

State Rep. Matthew Lesser (D) said it’s taken a decade of lobbying to convince Connecticut lawmakers to join the compact.

Trump’s victory, Lesser told AP, appears to have given the issue “some renewed momentum.”

AdvertisementA California Republican candidate for U.S. Senate who praises Adolf Hitler and believes Jewish representation in government should be limited was booted from the state’s GOP convention on Saturday.

Patrick Little hopes to become the Republican candidate to face off against Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who’ll be running for a fifth term in the fall. In a SurveyUSA poll last month, Feinstein was backed by 39 percent of the people surveyed in the poll while Little came in second place at 18 percent.

State GOP spokesman Matt Fleming told CBS News that Little has never been active in Republican politics. He added that the GOP condemns “anti-Semitism and any other form of religious bigotry.”

In a video posted on BitChute, Little railed against his ejection while standing ― and spitting ― on an Israeli flag. He called participants in the GOP convention “zionist stooges.”

The 33-year-old IT engineer is a Marine veteran who served in Afghanistan. He describes himself as a “white advocate” who aims to “crush ... anti-white racism in U.S. institutions,” and has called Hitler “one of the greatest leaders in history.” Little’s campaign slogan is: “Liberate the U.S. from the Jewish oligarchy.”

Last month, Little protested outside Twitter headquarters in San Francisco after the company suspended his account. He held a sign that read: “It’s not okay to be white @ Twitter.” Two counter-protesters flanked him, one holding a sign with an arrow pointing at Little and the message: “Fuck this white supremacist.”

Little told a reporter from KPIX-5 TV that Twitter was “run” by the Jewish Anti-Defamation League and that he wanted to debate if the Holocaust happened.

“Oh, the Holocaust happened, Patrick Little,” the reporter told him (see video above).UPDATE: May 8 ― The Office of the First Lady released a statement on Tuesday explaining that Melania Trump’s “Talking With Kids About Being Online” booklet was re-branded from the former Trade Commission booklet called “Chatting With Kids About Being Online.” The first lady added Be Best branding “in an effort to use her platform to amplify the positive message within.”

The White House altered language linking to the booklet to clarify that the booklet is “promoted” by the first lady rather than authored by her.

PREVIOUSLY:

When first lady Melania Trump released a pamphlet on Monday about children’s online habits as a part of her new Be Best initiative, she gave some Twitter users deja vu.

The booklet, “Talking With Kids About Being Online,” is almost an exact replica of an Obama administration brochure ― specifically, a 2014 Federal Trade Commission booklet called “Chatting With Kids About Being Online,” the Twitter account The Rude Pundit noted.

Both booklets include nearly identical language on cyberbullying, hackers and oversharing online.

Fun fact: The White House trumpets “Talking with Kids about Being Online" as "a booklet by First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission." Except for an intro, it's exactly the same thing Obama's FTC put out. pic.twitter.com/AEf6F0gBbt — The Rude Pundit (@rudepundit) May 7, 2018

Trump’s version of the booklet had a few minor variations, including updated artwork and information on technology. The most notable difference between the two pamphlets is that the one released Monday opens with a letter from the first lady about the lessons inside the booklet and ends with information on Be Best.

Otherwise, though, the two guidebooks on cyberbullying share nearly the exact same content.

Some observers have hailed Be Best as an effort by Melania Trump to forge her own path in the White House, separate from her husband, President Donald Trump, and his policies. The project is designed “to educate children about the many issues they are facing today,” she told reporters at the unveiling in the Rose Garden on Monday.

The current first lady previously relied on text from the Obamas in her 2016 address to the Republican National Convention, where she repeated several lines from a speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008.

People on social media are calling the pamphlets another example of Trump “plagiarizing” the Obamas and have accused her of being lazy. Other users have suggested that repurposing an old pamphlet indicates that she doesn’t truly care about the Be Best program.Jay-Z’s mother, Gloria Carter, was greeted with a standing ovation as she accepted a special recognition award at the 2018 GLAAD Media Awards in New York.

Carter was honored at Saturday’s ceremony for documenting her coming out process on “Smile,” a track from Jay-Z’s acclaimed 2017 album, “4:44.” The song, she said, “became a reality because I shared with my son who I am. Not that people didn’t know.”

“For me, this was the first time that I spoke to anyone about who I really am,” she recalled in her acceptance speech, which can be viewed above. “My son cried, and said, ‘It must have been horrible to live that way for so long.’ My life wasn’t horrible. I chose to protect my family from ignorance. I was happy, but I was not free.”

Carter devoted much of the speech to her partner, who helped her free herself “from being in the shadows.”

“Love gave me the courage to take the power that I allowed other people to have over my life for fear of them revealing my secret that wasn’t really a secret. Here I am,” she said. “I’m loving, I’m respectful, I’m productive, and I’m a human being who has a right to love who I love. So everybody, just smile, be free.”

“Smile,” of course, made headlines last year, as it was the first time Carter had spoken about her sexuality publicly.

“Mama had four kids, but she’s a lesbian. Had to pretend so long that she’s a thespian,” Jay-Z rapped in the song. “Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate. Society shame and the pain was too much to take.”

Last month, the rapper opened up about “Smile” in an episode of Netflix’s “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,” telling host David Letterman he hit the studio to record it just one day after his mother came out to him.Facebook

The old saying “everything is big in Texas,” now applies to inclusion ― at least in one border town.

On Saturday, 62 percent of voters in Del Rio ― located about 110 miles west of San Antonio ― elected gay Air Force veteran Bruno “Ralphy” Lozano as its mayor.

The 35-year-old Lozano is both the town’s youngest mayor and first openly gay official. He previously served as a security law enforcement officer in the Air Force and then was an activist who worked to help clean up local waterways, according to OutInSA.com.

Although Texas is known for its conservative politics and Republicans dominate statewide offices, Lozano’s sexual orientation was not an issue during the mayoral campaign in the city of about 41,000 people.

In addition, there was barely a peep when he wore high heels to march in the city’s Veteran’s Day parade last year ― just a single Facebook post from a non-supporter who attacked him, according to IntoMore.com.

Lozano said he served in the Air Force during the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward gays, and decided not to re-enlist because he was “not ashamed of who I am.”

Instead, he took inspiration from previous generations of gays who made it possible for people like him to run for office without hiding who he is.

“Stonewall happened because drag queens and a minority group stood up to animosity, and I had to go back in the closet [while in the Air Force] because of that same hatred,” he told IntoMore.com. “I know what that was like, and it translates to today’s campaign. I’m not going to bow down. I am who I am. Accept me or not.”

“It is time for new ideas and new visions of the future. It is time the next generation takes action and get involved in local politics,” he said. “We can continue our heritage through proper investments in infrastructure, culture, and services and that can start with accountability.”

Lozano’s election is definitely a sign of progress, but Del Rio, home to Laughlin Air Force base, is by no means a gay mecca.

The town lacks a place where LGBTQ locals can meet or get access to services dedicated to their particular needs, and the closest gay bar is nearly three hours away, according to IntoMore.com.Lupe Valdez has her eyes set on a doubly historic feat ― a victory in the November elections that would make her both Texas’ first Hispanic governor and the first openly queer person to hold that office.

It won’t be easy. The former Dallas County sheriff, who is running on a progressive platform, faces a May 22 runoff for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination against Andrew White ― a straight, white Houston businessman and son of a former governor, who is running as a centrist.

Should she win that race ― and she’s favored, having come out well ahead of him in March’s nine-candidate primary ― Valdez will then confront an uphill battle to defeat Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. He beat his 2014 opponent, then-state Sen. Wendy Davis, in a landslide. And Texas hasn’t elected a Democrat to any statewide office since 1994 (the last one to win the governorship was Ann Richards in 1990).

But for Valdez, overcoming obstacles is nothing new.

The 70-year-old grew up one of eight children of Mexican-American migrant workers. Embarking on a career in law enforcement after a stint in the Army, she navigated the challenges of being a lesbian woman of color in conservative Texas ― ultimately making history in 2004 as the nation’s only Latina sheriff, and among the state’s first openly gay sheriffs.

“You want to see my scars?” Valdez joked to HuffPost in March, speaking of the discrimination she faced as a queer woman in Texas law enforcement. “The first four or five years [as sheriff] were extremely difficult. I got hate email and faxes. I got pushback from a lot of the good old boys.”

“You can make them stepping stones,” she said of her experiences overcoming prejudice, and “become a leader who is sensitive to the issues of people who have been discriminated against.”

For Latinos in the border state, who comprise nearly 40 percent of Texas’ population, a Valdez victory this fall would mark a triumph of representation ― they would finally see someone like themselves in the governor’s chair. Analysts say the Latino vote will be key for Valdez to win, as she and her campaign deal with the difficulty Democrats have long faced in Texas of trying to increase historically low turnout among that demographic.

“It’s long overdue to have Latinas sit in these halls of power,” said native Texan Amy Hinojosa, president of national Latina organization MANA. “When you think of the generations of girls to come, to see a Latina, a queer woman in the state house, that just represents such power for young women to be able to aspire to that.” For some Democrats in Texas, it is precisely Valdez’s personal history and her background coming from underrepresented groups that makes her so appealing. “Her story is very compelling. It’s a lot like that of a lot of people in Texas,” Ed Espinoza, executive director of progressive media group Progress Texas, told HuffPost. “She’s from an immigrant family, has military and law enforcement [background], is Latina, a lesbian. She came from nothing, went through the ranks.” “That’s exactly what we’re lacking in statewide office,” he added. “Having a background that looks like the people you’re representing.” Still, some Texas Latino activist groups have called out Valdez’s record as sheriff on immigration issues. They specifically note her department’s cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement ― and challenge whether her actions live up to her progressive platform.

Valdez was born in San Antonio, Texas, and until she was about seven years old she traveled with her parents and siblings as family members worked fields in Michigan and other states, picking green beans and other crops. Her parents, both U.S.-born Latinos, faced significant discrimination in the Texas of the 1940s and ’50s and struggled to find jobs, she said. After giving up migrant work, her dad was a ditch digger for the city of San Antonio.

Valdez paid her own way through college, earning a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Southern Nazarene University in Oklahoma and then a master’s in criminology and criminal justice from the University of Texas at Arlington. Joining the Army, she became a captain.

“The poorest zip code in San Antonio ― that’s where I came from,” Valdez said. “What that says to me is, someone who was able to go from that to college to the military, then a sheriff ― that’s a big jump. My passion is to be able to give that same type of opportunity to all of Texas.”

As sheriff, Valdez made a point of seeing that more employees of color were able to rise through the ranks. Her successor when she stepped down last December to launch her gubernatorial race was Marian Brown, Dallas County’s first black sheriff, who Valdez recommended for the post.

“When you think of the generations of girls to come, to see a Latina, a queer woman in the state house, that just represents such power for young women to be able to aspire to that.” - Amy Hinojosa, President of national Latina women's organization MANA

Valdez is part of a cadre of Latinas shaking up the Texas political landscape. The state has never had a Latina member of Congress. But that is poised to change, with Latinas heavily favored to win in two House districts.

“I can remember when I was a kid in Texas, seeing how powerful former Gov. Ann Richards was,” Hinojosa said of the state’s second woman to hold the position. “The fact that she was a woman standing up to all of the good old boys, that was monumental in my development and my thinking of where a woman’s place is.”

“For a state that will soon be majority Hispanic, to see a Hispanic woman on the ballot ― this is really a pivotal moment,” she added.

When Valdez was a girl, she never imagined she’d become a politician. In her own family, she said she was often treated “less than” compared to her brothers.

“In our family, women did not have as much opportunity,” Valdez said. “I remember getting angry at my dad ― he would show my brothers how to fix a car, but wouldn’t show me. He’d say, ‘You’ll never need it, you just take care of the kids.’ And I would get so angry.”

Later in life, she asked her brothers why they had teased her so harshly.

She recalled one of them telling her: “You don’t understand, Lupe, you’ve done everything we wanted to do, and we were not able and you did it. And you’re the woman.”

After she left home, Valdez continued to face barriers ― from the public as she ran for sheriff, and her own coworkers when she got the post ― particularly as a queer woman.

“When I ran for sheriff, it was quite conservative,” Valdez said. “They’d say: ‘A lesbian, how can they care about the community?’”

As a result, while Valdez was never closeted, she also “didn’t publicize it and wear my flag around me,” she said.

“If I was asked I didn’t deny,” Valdez said. “I would have preferred it didn’t come up.”

Along with the landmarks Valdez’s election would set in Texas, she would be the nation’s first lesbian governor (Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who took office in 2015, identifies as bisexual). Valdez has won the endorsement of several prominent LGBTQ groups, including the national Victory Fund, the Equality Texas PAC and several state chapters of Stonewall Democrats. For the runoff, the Houston GLBT Caucus endorsed her opponent, White.

When speaking to HuffPost, Valdez hesitated to place her identity as a queer woman and a Latina as central to her platform. “That’s not where I’m putting my emphasis,” she said.

Instead, Valdez insisted that the issues she is focusing on ― better education, health care and the economy ― were ones “all Texans” care about.

Valdez has faced criticism from some immigrant advocacy groups over her record as the Dallas County sheriff on issues of concern to them. Lupe Valdez

“There are a lot of things she could tap into: being a woman, Latina, queer ― but how those identities are going to play out with Texas voters is a big question,” said Brittany Perry, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University who specializes in U.S. politics and Latino representation. “You want to appeal to the Latino population, but there’s also a lot of conservative tendencies [there].”

While the Latino community, like any, “is not a monolith,” as Perry put it, Latinos in Texas tend to vote Democrat. Still, in his 2014 run, Abbott received 44 percent of the Latino vote.

In Valdez’s case, Hinojosa speculated that having a Hispanic name on the ballot would draw some Latinos to support her. But ultimately, most wouldn’t vote for her simply because they want to have someone who looks like them in office, but also because Valdez reflected many of the values important to Latinos, and to many Texans at large: her Christian faith, working-class roots, law enforcement and military experience. All of those factors could help win over more moderate Texans, as well as older Latino voters, who tend to lean more conservative on social issues.

A key issue in the campaign will be immigration. While Latinos don’t all come down the same way on immigration issues ― especially in Texas, where many are not immigrants and have been in the U.S. for generations ― it is still a hot-button issue in the state where President Donald Trump wants to build part of his border wall. While Abbott has expressed support for sending National Guard troops to the border and having a wall in certain areas, Valdez said she would fight against a wall “with everything I have.”

“There are no perfect politicians, and Texas needs a change.” - Angie Junck, director at Immigrant Legal Resource Center

Valdez has positioned herself as staunchly pro-immigrant and has made a name in recent years as a fierce opponent of Abbott’s anti-immigrant policies. She clashed with the Republican in 2015 when she said Dallas law enforcement would only cooperate with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on a case-by-case basis.

Last year, Abbott signed the notoriously anti-immigrant Senate Bill 4 into law, meant to punish “sanctuary cities” that limit local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal agents. (A lawsuit against SB4 is moving through the courts.)

“People who rape, murder and abuse, commit violent crimes, I have no trouble saying no to ― and I often joke I wish I could say that to a lot of Americans,” Valdez told HuffPost.

“But people who came here for a better life, get picked up for a broken taillight or speeding, who make as many mistakes as the rest of us Americans make ... which one of us who has no sin can cast the first stone?” she continued. “We should just leave them alone.”

Some immigrant advocacy groups who work in the Dallas area contend that Valdez didn’t always go far enough as sheriff to counter state and federal pressures on cooperating with ICE. Several groups HuffPost spoke to said that Dallas law enforcement officers have often cooperated with federal immigration agents in handing over undocumented detainees.

“It’s exciting that more Latinos are running, and especially for a Latina to run in a governor race. But what’s important is for people to look at a person’s record to reflect what they do, and not just what they say,” Felix Villalobos, an attorney with the Texas immigration law organization RAICES, told HuffPost. “Valdez is a politician, not an advocate of the immigration community.”

Villalobos said that when he and his colleagues find out an undocumented client has been arrested, “it’s pretty much understood” that they’ll end up in an ICE detention center.

The Dallas “area of responsibility” for ICE ― which includes Dallas County, as well as the rest of Northern Texas and Oklahoma ― had the highest number of immigration arrests in the country in 2017, according to a Pew study.

Angie Junck ― a director at Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national immigrant rights organization that has worked frequently in Texas ― noted the difficulties Valdez faced as a local official trying to challenge strong anti-immigrant pressures from the state level.

Last year, Abbott pulled funding from Texas’ Travis County after Sheriff Sally Hernandez implemented a policy limiting local law enforcement’s cooperation with immigration agents. Hernandez’s policy was later invalidated by court rulings in the SB4 litigation.

“There are no perfect politicians, and Texas needs a change,” Junck said, calling Valdez a far better alternative on immigration than Abbott. “I hope Valdez takes [the] charge seriously and really fights for the rights of [immigrants]. Do I know if she’s there? I don’t.”

Last week, Valdez’s controversial record on immigration came to the fore at a local town hall event, as Dallas high school student Karla Quiñones challenged the candidate on her department’s apparent cooperation with ICE. After Valdez provided what some viewed as an insufficient response, the group hosting the event, Jolt Texas ― which aim to mobilize Latino voters in the state ― decided to endorse White in the upcoming runoff.

The next day, Valdez issued a lengthy apology, saying she “fell short” in her answer to the student, and noting tensions she faced as a local official navigating federal and state immigration policy.

In response criticisms on immigration, the Valdez campaign told HuffPost earlier in April that amid the anti-immigrant pushes at the state and federal levels, it was hard for Valdez to “compensate for a broken immigration system.”

“Sheriff Valdez’s position on the need for immigration reform and building trust in the immigrant community has been abundantly clear,” her campaign wrote by email. “There is no doubt that Sheriff Valdez knows Texas needs a governor who knows and trusts immigrants in our state.”

Lupe Valdez

A Valdez victory in the runoff against White will intensify speculation on whether the state’s growing Latino population will finally transform Texas ― long a solidly red state ― into a politically competitive one.

“Maybe not this year,” Perry speculated of Valdez’s chances against Abbott in the general election. “Maybe down the road. Maybe we’re paving the way for future Latino candidates in Texas.”

Abbott, who has raised more than $40 million for his re-election campaign, will be favored in a race against Valdez. But several upsets have occurred in elections in the post-Trump era ― such as the unexpected wins by Democrats Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania or Doug Jones in Alabama ― that suggest the 2018 elections may not all go as predicted.

For Valdez, there was one moment right after the March primary that cemented her potential to galvanize voters in a state she described as “changing”: A woman stopped her at a store, said she was a new citizen and that she had just cast her first vote as an American ― for Valdez.

“What a neat feeling,” Valdez mused, “to hear someone say my very first vote was for you.”
