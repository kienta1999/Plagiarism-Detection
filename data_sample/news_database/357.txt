Cindy McCain, wife of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), hit back at reports that a White House official mocked her husband’s health status during a Thursday meeting about CIA director nominee Gina Haspel.

According to multiple news outlets, White House aide Kelly Sadler responded to McCain’s opposition to Haspel’s nomination with the comment, “He’s dying anyway.”

The “joke... fell flat,” a source told CNN’s Jim Acosta.

Haspel’s controversial nomination has prompted Democrats and Republicans to raise concerns over her tenure at the agency, in particular her involvement in the CIA’s now-defunct torture program. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War and is currently fighting an aggressive form of brain cancer, has vehemently opposed her nomination.

Soon after reports about the insulting attack, McCain’s wife took to Twitter to reach out to Sadler directly.

“May I remind you my husband has a family, 7 children and 5 grandchildren,” she wrote.

CNN later reported that Sadler called McCain’s daughter Meghan, who is a co-host on “The View,” to apologize for her comment. Meghan McCain will reportedly respond to the comment Friday during the ABC morning program.

Cindy McCain also came to her husband’s defense earlier on Thursday, when a guest on Fox Business praised torture as an interrogation method, claiming it “worked” on John McCain.

Host Charles Payne issued an apology after the show, saying he regretted not confronting his guest about his incendiary comment.

The White House also issued a statement in response to Sadler’s comment. While they didn’t reference the aide or her remark, the White House reiterated its respect for McCain’s service to the U.S.

A post shared by Glossier (@glossier) on Jan 17, 2018 at 5:31am PSTBruce Weber has been accused of sexual misconduct by more male models who spoke on the record in an article published by Business of Fashion on Wednesday.

Model D.L. Janney told BoF that during a shoot for British Vogue in 1982, Weber tried to get him to pose for nude photographs, which the famed fashion photographer said were for “his own use, and to show” fashion designer Calvin Klein. Janney was modeling for Klein’s ad campaigns at the time, according to BofF.

During a separate shoot, Weber allegedly asked Janney and his brother to take off their shirts and “pretend to be boyfriends.” When the two refused, Janney said Weber became verbally abusive. The model accused Weber of “blacklisting” his career shortly after.

Christopher Cates accused Weber of sexual misconduct during a shoot in 2006. Cates said the photographer asked him to join in a room alone and take off his clothes. Once he was naked, Cates said Weber touched him inappropriately and took photographs the model said were never published.

Model Ryan Vigilant accused Weber of touching him inappropriately during a shoot in 2008.

Former model Alex Geerman said that Weber did “breathing exercises” with him during a shoot in 2008, and that as part of that activity the photographer touched him around his genitals. Geerman left the shoot, but told BoF: “It took me years to figure out, it wasn’t a sexual thing. It was an art thing.”

In a report published by The New York Times on Saturday, over two dozen models accused Weber and fellow fashion photographer Mario Testino of sexual exploitation. The current and former models said the alleged incidents involved nudity, inappropriate touching, masturbation and other sexual demands. After the allegations came out, Condé Nast announced it was cutting ties with the photographers.

In December, model Jason Boyce filed a lawsuit against Weber, alleging the photographer sexually harassed him at 2014 photoshoot. A few days later, model Mark Ricketson also accused Weber of misconduct at a 2005 shoot that took place at the photographer’s studio.

“He told me I ‘looked tense’ and proceeded to press his thumb on my forehead,” Ricketson said. “He then took my hand and told me to ‘find the energy’ by guiding my hand and rubbing it on one of three places: my forehead, chest or my stomach.”

Ricketson added, “Each time the ‘energy’ in my stomach would get lower and lower until I had to navigate the remaining space left before having to touch myself. I felt ashamed and embarrassed.”

In response the Times and BofF articles, Weber issued the same statement through a representative:The sister of the California woman accused of shackling and abusing her 13 children says her brother-in-law used to make her feel “uncomfortable” when she lived with the couple briefly during college.

In an interview Wednesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Elizabeth Flores said she lived with Louise Anna Turpin, 49, and David Allen Turpin, 57, in Texas for a few months when she was a college student.

“If I went to get in the shower, [David Allen Turpin] would come in there while I was in there and watch me,” Flores, 41, said. “It was like a joke. He never touched me or anything.”

The Turpins were arrested and charged with child endangerment and torture on Sunday after police discovered 12 of their children locked inside their home, some chained to furniture and starving, in Perris, California. The 13th child ― a 17-year-old girl ― had managed to escape and alert the authorities of their situation.

Flores said Wednesday that she didn’t witness the Turpins abusing their children while she lived with them briefly, but she said she did think they were “really strict.” She didn’t tell anyone about her brother-in-law’s habit of watching her in the shower because she was “young and scared,” she said.

“I was treated like one of the kids kind of, so I had rules,” she said. “Now that I’m an adult and I look back, I see things that I didn’t see then.”

Flores broke down in tears during the interview Wednesday, noting that her sister had cut her off from seeing the children for 20 years. She said she never thought to ask authorities to check on her nieces and nephews because her sister and brother-in-law had always been “private” people.

“If it had been like two years ago that she cut us off than we might think, ‘Wow, you know, something’s not right,’” she said. ”But this has been going on before they even had children.”

Officials said the 13 siblings, ages 2 to 29, had been living in “horrific” conditions and that many of them were dirty and malnourished. Still, Flores said, she is praying for her sister.

“I want her to know that she’s still my blood and I love her,” Flores said. ”I don’t agree with what she did and her actions have made the whole family suffer, but I want her to know that I’m praying for her salvation.”

AdvertisementSeth Meyers checked in on how the White House was dealing with the hurricane relief effort in Puerto Rico on Tuesday’s broadcast of “Late Night.”

After Hurricane Maria pounded the U.S. territory in September, President Donald Trump gave himself a 10 out of 10 for his handling of the aftermath.

“I bet young Donald Trump wasn’t one of those kids you’d let grade his own homework,” said Meyers.

Almost four months later, the island is still suffering from major power outages, and experts say more than 1,000 people may have died as a result of the disaster.

“If that’s what Trump considers a 10, what would a 9 be? Accidentally sending an ‘Outbreak’ monkey?” Meyers added.USA Gymnastics said Wednesday it will not seek to penalize Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney for breaking a confidentiality agreement to speak out against former team doctor Larry Nassar, an admitted sexual predator whose sentencing hearing began this week.

The organization “will not seek any money” from Maroney if she speaks in court during Nassar’s hearing, USA Gymnastics spokeswoman Leslie King told HuffPost in a statement Wednesday. A 2016 confidentiality agreement with USA Gymnastics exposes Maroney to fines if she publicly speaks about Nassar’s abuse.

“USA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,” King said. “This has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out. USA Gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority ― the safety, health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them.”

A sentencing hearing for Nassar began this week on 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct. The hearing is set to feature impact statements from 98 victims and family members. Nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges.

Maroney signed a confidentiality agreement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 as part of a $1.25 million settlement that requires her to keep her allegations against Nassar quiet. Her tweet, as well as an impact statement at Nassar’s sentencing, potentially violate the agreement.

Model Chrissy Teigen stepped forward on Tuesday, tweeting that she would be “absolutely honored” to pay any fines Maroney faces for speaking out against Nassar.

Maroney, in a statement through her attorneys, said she was overwhelmed by the offer.Courtesy of The Villa Casa Casuarina Gianni Versace's mansion is now a boutique hotel.

On the morning of July 15, 1997, Gianni Versace left his mansion on Miami’s Ocean Drive and walked to a nearby cafe to buy a coffee and magazines. Upon returning, he climbed the marble steps in front of his house and started to unlock the front gate when a serial killer named Andrew Cunanan shot him twice in the head, execution style. Versace died immediately.

Versace’s murder ― and the mystery surrounding the killer’s motive ― is the subject of the next installment in FX’s anthology series, “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” which premieres on Wednesday.

The show was filmed at the actual site of Versace’s killing ― Casa Casuarina, aka the Versace Mansion, the fashion designer’s home from 1992 until his death. The house is now The Villa Casa Casuarina, a luxury boutique hotel with 10 suites, a handful of event spaces and a restaurant called Gianni’s.

ROBERTO SCHMIDT via Getty Images Fans left flowers and notes on the steps where Gianni Versace was fatally shot.

“The design of the villa has remained from when Gianni Versace had it as his personal home,” the hotel’s general manager, Chauncey Copeland, told HuffPost, noting that they’d only made minor additions in the suites to give guests some of the modern conveniences people expect at a hotel.

The history of the hotel is a major draw for guests. “Some guests are really Versace-philes wearing Versace head to toe,” Copeland said, adding that notable visitors have included a man who knew Versace and stayed at his house in the ’90s, and a famous football player who is “enamored with Versace” and drove a car designed by Versace.

For most who stay at The Villa Casa Casuarina, it’s an opportunity to experience the place where Versace lived. But it’s also a chance to visit the place where he died. Indeed, hundreds of people stop by daily to take photos outside the gates and sometimes place flowers on the infamous front steps.

For many tourists, famous death sites are major attractions. When Whitney Houston died at the Beverly Hilton in 2012, fans flocked to the hotel in search of her room. The hotel rooms where Janis Joplin and Gram Parsons died still draw tourists from around the world. While it might seem morbid to some, it’s a dream vacation for others.

Dark Tourism

Scott Michaels is someone who’s drawn to these types of spots. Michaels is the owner of Dearly Departed Tours, a Los Angeles-based company that offers tours focused on “Hollywood’s most notorious deaths and scandals.” He previously ran a similar company called Grave Line Tours, which carted tourists around LA in Cadillac hearses. In 1996, he left the company to live in England with his then-boyfriend, Irish comedian and TV personality Graham Norton, before returning to LA in 2002.

ROBYN BECK/Getty Images Scott Michaels is the owner of Dearly Departed Tours, a company that gives tours focused on famous deaths and scandals in the Los Angeles area.

Michaels is also the creator of FindADeath.com, a website he started in 1999 to document the stories of notable deaths, beginning with Princess Diana’s.

“I’ve always gravitated toward the things that most people have aversions to,” Michaels told HuffPost. He said he became “desensitized” to morbid realities growing up in Detroit, where he lived near a common car crash site and also “knew a few people that had been murdered.”

Michaels is clearly not alone in his interests. FindADeath.com’s forum has more than 10,000 registered users. Dearly Departed Tours, which now boasts seven employees, offers one daily 15-person tour on weekdays and five to seven tours on Saturdays and Sundays.

“People who don’t understand it just assume what we do is rather ghoulish, and that’s all fine. I’m not trying to win them over.” - Scott Michaels, Dearly Departed Tours

The main tour, called “The Tragical History Tour,” covers about 70 different locations across 25 miles. Attractions include the houses of old Hollywood icons like Mae West and Bela Lugosi, hotels where modern celebrities like John Belushi and Whitney Houston died and places associated with famous scandals like Hugh Grant’s 1995 arrest with a sex worker.

“We’re sort of just taking people to the news,” said Michaels, who also leads the weekend “Helter Skelter Tour” dedicated to the Tate-LaBianca murders and an annual February tour on the anniversary of Karen Carpenter’s death ― “The CarpenTour.”

“It’s all done really with love. People come because they’re big fans. We’ll go for a cheap joke, but we do love these people,” Michaels explained. “People who don’t understand it just assume what we do is rather ghoulish, and that’s all fine. I’m not trying to win them over.”

Via Dearly Departed Tours And Museum/Photo by Brian Donnelly Michaels opened a Dearly Departed shop and museum in 2012. In 2017, he moved to a bigger space across from Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

In addition to the tours, Dearly Departed also has an artifacts museum with items such as Mae West’s dentures, a tile from the pool where Brian Jones drowned, a piece of fireplace from Sharon Tate’s house and the car Jayne Mansfield was killed in. It’s all part of the phenomenon some people call “dark tourism” or “necro-tourism.”

Dearly Departed Tours attracts a mostly American, British and Australian demographic. “I would say it’s mostly women between 30 and 50 and gay men,” said Michaels. “Of course, there are exceptions. I’ve had 80th birthday parties. Teenagers who are terminally ill and people who’ve come back from cancer or have cancer and only have a few months to live ― they’ve taken my tour. It’s interesting, I’ve found that people who’ve had experiences with death don’t mind this stuff. It’s the people who are freaked out by it that do.”

What’s The Attraction?

Michaels believes the fascination with famous people’s deaths and the locations where they died is part of the general interest in their lives and careers. “These people were celebrities, and it’s just another facet of their life,” he said. “With regards to Versace, if I went to Miami, I’d go to the coffee shop and buy a newspaper and walk to his steps just like he did. It’s sort of like walking in the steps of these people but also giving you a perspective on them that people don’t generally have. It becomes part of the weird tapestry of their careers.”

But there’s more to it, he added. “People feel like they have an emotional connection to these people, their celebrities,” said Michaels. “I’ve stayed in room 105 at Highland Gardens Hotel where Janis Joplin died. For me, going to her hotel room and sitting where she died and listening to her music, there’s a real emotional trigger in there. That’s one of the things I like.”

“I live across the street from Paramount Studios, and sometimes I’ll take my portable DVD player and watch ‘Sunset Boulevard’ standing right where it happened,” said Michaels. “It’s a matter of immersing yourself into these locations in a weird way. These things have something you’ve always read about or have seen on television, but seeing them in real life, you get to become part of the story in a weird way.”

Michaels has visited the Chateau Marmont bungalow where John Belushi died and stayed in the room at the Cecil Hotel that housed Elisa Lam, the Canadian student who was found dead in the hotel’s water tower in 2013.

“There’s certainly a haunting feeling in those places,” Michaels said, adding that he’s never had any supernatural experiences in hotel rooms where people have died. “You’re there kind of just taking it in.”

The case of Lam’s hotel room represents another facet of so-called dark tourism, in which people visit places where noncelebrities have died or suffered. This can include one-off crime scenes and sites of massacres, wars and genocides.

What Psychologists Say

Psychologists have multiple explanations for the fascination with celebrity deaths and famous death sites.

“One motivation is to get a sort of intimate feeling of being close to the place where this person was probably at the rawest edges of experience,” Katherine Ramsland, a professor of forensic psychology at DeSales University, told HuffPost. “The sense is that something lingers there, not necessarily a ghost but some aura of the person is imprinted in the space. So if you go there to imbibe that, it’s because you’re trying to get this really intimate sense of a person that you admire and appreciate or want to be close with.”

“Celebrities are already larger than life types of people, so there’s a sense that their deaths are more significant in a way than an ordinary person’s.” - Katherine Ramsland, DeSales University

The other aspect is simply getting close to death, said Ramsland.

“Celebrities are already larger-than-life types of people, so there’s a sense that their deaths are more significant in a way than an ordinary person’s,” she explained. “They might think that the death of the celebrity in that place will linger enough for the fan to access the spirit or aura of that person and the feeling of what’s on the other side. It’s almost a primitive belief, a superstition, that if you go to one of these places, that somehow you’ll gain more knowledge or a deepening of your own experience of death.“

Ramsland has herself visited notorious murder sites, including the Lizzie Borden House and the Chelsea Hotel, where Sid Vicious was suspected to have murdered his girlfriend Nancy Spungen.

“It doesn’t matter what you believe or don’t believe, there is a sense that this is a significant place; I remember with the Sid Vicious one, there were a lot of rooms in the hotel, but there was distinctly something about it,” she recalled. “It’s all about perception. Obviously, there’s nothing objectively different once the rooms are cleaned out and celebrities’ bodies are removed. But there’s something different in the way we perceive it.”

Images Press via Getty Images Sid Vicious' girlfriend Nancy Spungen was killed at the Chelsea Hotel in room 100.

This applies to the Versace villa as well, Ramsland said. “I’ve been down there and seen the steps. And they’re just ordinary steps, nothing unusual. The blood’s not there anymore. But there’s this sense that somehow I’ll be able to envision the blood still there, that it left an imprint. That was a violent horrible death that lingers for us, and even this many years later, they’re making a miniseries about it.”

Ramsland noted that the interest in the Versace story stems in part from the lack of understanding as to why Cunanan shot him. “But partly it’s also that a person who had it all could be taken down so fast,” she said. “People really resist the idea that a celebrity can so easily succumb to ordinary things like being shot or overdosing on drugs or dying by suicide. I think we really resist that because we’ve made celebrities into immortals or gods in a way.”

For obsessed superfans, there’s also a sense that they have an ownership stake in celebrities’ lives and deaths, Ramsland added.

“Celebrities can be kind of a higher power to some people. And what’s more intimate than a person’s death? Being part of that in some way makes people feel special.” - Toronto-based psychologist Oren Amitay

Toronto-based psychologist Oren Amitay believes that the motivation to stay in a place where a celebrity died stems from humans’ natural fascination with death and need to feel connected to something greater than ourselves. “Celebrities can be kind of a higher power to some people,” he told HuffPost. “And what’s more intimate than a person’s death? Being part of that in some way makes people feel special.”

It’s all an illusion, however, Amitay said. “To put that much stock into someone you don’t even know, to feel that you can be touched or made greater just by connecting to them on this illusory level, that’s somewhat sad,” he remarked.

Amitay said there are similarities and differences in the process of mourning or honoring a celebrity versus an actual friend or family member.

GABRIEL BOUYS via Getty Images Celebrity-focused tours in Los Angeles often drive past Michael Jackson's home, where he died.

“When it’s someone you know, you’re honoring the shared memory and the face-to-face impact they had on you,” Amitay explained. “However, when you think of celebrities, Michael Jackson, for example, had an impact on people by singing the soundtrack to their teenager years and things like that. It’s a different sort of impact but an impact nonetheless. Paying tribute is almost like saying thank you.”

Still, mourning ― whether it’s a loved one or a stranger ― is a self-interested process, Amitay, added. “People are doing it for their own healing. They’re certainly not helping the person who’s passed. They’re finding a way to process their own grief, which might mean going to the place where they passed or playing their famous song 302 times because that was their favorite number.”

Of course, celebrities who have died have also left behind loved ones. Shortly after Whitney Houston’s death, her mother reportedly wanted to visit the hotel room where she died as a way to find closure and make a spiritual connection with her daughter. Later reports, however, suggested she did not want to sleep at the Beverly Hilton.

Is It Healthy?

Amitay said the interest in staying in a place where a famous person died isn’t necessarily unhealthy.

“Most things in life exist on a spectrum. It’s about moderation,” said Amitay. “If you’re on the extremes and feel your life is empty and lacking purpose without that, then you’ve got a problem,” he said. “But if you just have a passing interest or think, ‘Hey, this is kind of cool,’ there’s nothing wrong with it.”

Ramsland said that harboring a strong obsession is always unhealthy, but having so-called ‘morbid curiosity’ is not necessarily so. In fact, she takes issue with calling interest in darker things “morbid.”

“I don’t think it’s really necessary morbid to be curious about death. It’s something we all have to face. I think it’s just curiosity with the unknown,” she said.

“I’ve found that people who’ve had experiences with death don’t mind this stuff. It’s the people who are freaked out by it that do.”” - Scott Michaels, Dearly Departed Tours

Michaels told HuffPost many people have accused him of being “sick.” He has an email file called his “Vile File,” where he archives the death threats and calls for him to be investigated. “People who understand understand,” he said. “People that don’t never will.”

In response to these messages, Michaels often points to his company’s more philanthropic deeds, like raising money to mark graves for famous people who were placed in unmarked plots, sometimes because their loved ones didn’t have the means to buy gravestones.

“I like to say to these people, ‘How much money have you donated to Justice for Homicide Victims, or how many graves have you marked?’ That’ll shut them up. I like to think we’re making it good karmically by doing these other things. We’re not doing it because we feel like we should. I feel like it’s just a nice thing to do.”

“When I was doing Grave Line back in the ’90s, we’d pass Jimmy Stewart’s house, and he came out and poked his head in the hearse more than once and said hello to people,” Michaels recalled. “The day Jimmy Stewart died, we were passing his house like we did every day. But the press was there this time, and we got labeled these evil sickos. But Mr. Stewart used to really like us.”

“Now the world has sort of jumped on the bandwagon,” he added. “There’s not a single tour company that doesn’t pass Michael Jackson’s house where he died.”

The Hotelier’s Perspective

While some hotels where celebrities have died embrace interested fans like Michaels, others reject being associated with famous deaths.

“The hotel where Janis Joplin died is not a dive. It’s a cool little hotel. If you say ‘I want Janis’ room,’ they’ll be happy to rent it to you and talk about her,” said Michaels. “If you go to the Chateau Marmont and say you want John Belushi’s bungalow, they might quiz you, but if you’ve got the money, they’ll rent it to you.”

Barry King via Getty Images Fans paid tribute to Whitney Houston outside the Beverly Hilton, and some went searching for her room.

“Some people are a bit more precious about it, but it’s down to money more than anything else,” he continued. “If you go to the Beverly Hilton where Whitney Houston died, they’ll brush you off. They don’t want that kind of stigma.”

A spokeswoman for the Beverly Hilton told HuffPost that “out of respect for the family and fans of Whitney,” all original contents and furnishings of the room where she stayed have been removed and the space “thoroughly refreshed.”

“The Beverly Hilton will remember Whitney Houston for the joy she brought to her many fans,” she added. The room is reportedly back in circulation with a different number.

Still, Michaels said it’s easy to figure out which room was Houston’s, based on the other hotel floors. “Same with Chris Cornell when he died in a casino in Detroit,” he said. “It’s really easy to find it, but they don’t want to be associated with that.”

In the case of the Versace villa, Copeland told HuffPost that people are generally aware that it’s the location of Versace’s death. “We do get people who make inquiries, but that’s not as often. People are more interested in his legacy as a designer and his home,” he said. “We don’t get too many people who are focused on it being a place where he was killed.”

The most popular room requests are Gianni Versace’s suite and his sister Donatella Versace’s preferred suite, the Venus suite. Copeland said one or two people have suggested the property might be haunted, but the hotel has received no reports of fantastic phenomena.

Courtesy of The Villa Casa Casuarina Gianni Versace's bedroom, the Villa Suite. “Luckily, because the hotel is so similar to how it was when Gianni Versace had it, the production crew didn’t have to make many changes. It’s so faithfully kept,” said Copeland.

“I know there’s that whole subculture where people like to go to places of famous murders, but we really haven’t seen that. If we’ve had someone like that, they’ve really kept it to themselves for the most part,” he said. “Maybe after the show, we will.”

Changing Attitudes

Michaels believes more people have felt comfortable embracing the weird and morbid parts of popular culture over time, thanks in part to the internet.

“Thirty years ago, people were buying these True Detective magazines and slipping them into their grocery carts because they didn’t want anyone to see that they were interested. When Elvis’ dead body was on the National Enquirer in 1977, people would buy it, but they’d hide it,” he said. “Nowadays there are TV networks and primetime movies devoted to deaths and murders. It’s become really mainstream.”

He also hopes that people will continue to change their attitudes toward those who are interested in the darker side of tourism and celebrity culture.

“We’re not ghouls. I won’t say there’s not a ghoulish element to it ― there can be. But we’re not goths; at least I’m not. The people who take my tour aren’t doing it to say, ’Ooh, aren’t I dangerous” or impress anybody. They’re doing it because it’s their own interest.”Democrat Patty Schachtner won a special election for a state Senate seat in Wisconsin on Tuesday, scoring a huge upset victory for her party in a district that President Donald Trump handily captured just over a year ago.

It was the latest in a string of election victories for Democrats since Trump took office, and a sign of hope for the party that the energy from the base and frustration with the president could lead to more wins in November.

Schachtner, the chief medical examiner for St. Croix County, won by 11 percentage points.

Republican Sheila Harsdorf had held the seat since 2001, but she left in November to become Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s agriculture secretary. In 2016, Harsdorf won re-election by 26 percentage points, and Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 17 points. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won the district in 2012.

“This campaign was about investing in people and revitalizing our area, whether that is making sure that every Wisconsinite has access to affordable health care, funding our public schools, technical colleges and UW campuses, or investing in good-paying jobs right here in Western Wisconsin,” Schachtner said in a statement. “Tonight, voters showed that they share those priorities, and I am deeply grateful for their support.”

Attorney Adam Jarchow, Schachtner’s GOP opponent, conceded the race Tuesday night.

I just called Patty Schachtner and congratulated her on her victory tonight. I look forward to working with her as our new state Senator. Thank you to all who worked so hard for our campaign — Adam Jarchow (@AdamJarchow28) January 17, 2018

Republicans clearly sensed that this district was vulnerable. The conservative Americans for Prosperity spent at least $50,000 on ads, and the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform and Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce threw in another $80,000.

On the Democratic side, Greater Wisconsin spent $30,000, and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee spent $10,000.

Republicans will still control the state Legislature, with an 18-14 majority and one vacancy in the Senate.

Democrats have fared well in other special elections since Trump became president, scoring big wins in Virginia, Alabama, Oklahoma and other places around the country. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state office, said that, with the win in Wisconsin, there are 34 districts that have flipped from red to blue since Trump’s inauguration.

Walker is up for re-election this year, and he has built up a formidable political machine in the state. So far, there’s a crowded field of Democrats running to unseat him, but there’s no solid front-runner.

The governor tweeted Tuesday night, however, that Republicans needed to acknowledge that 2018 was shaping up to be a tough year.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) is also running in 2018, and her seat is a prime target for Republicans. Conservative groups have so far spent at least $3.1 million against Baldwin, which is more than what all the other Democratic Senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Eric Trump set Twitter alight Wednesday with a flimsy defense of his father against accusations of racism.

President Donald Trump’s second son told “Fox & Friends” his dad couldn’t possibly be racist because he only “sees one color, green.”

“That’s all he cares about. He cares about the economy. Right, he does not see race,” Eric Trump said. “He’s the least racist person I have ever met in my entire life. It is total nonsense.”

“My father sees one color: Green. That’s all he cares about. He cares about the economy” - @EricTrump pic.twitter.com/dbiEICQkb2 — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) January 17, 2018

Eric Trump offered the defense during a discussion of last week’s White House meeting on immigration, when participants said his father described Haiti and some African nations as “shithole countries.” Trump denied using those words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) who was present, contradicted him and said the president repeatedly used the racist insult.

Eric Trump said it was “very sad” that his father’s critics would continue to demonize the president, even if he cured cancer.

Many people, however, called out the Trump scion’s defense, claiming it shows how the Trump administration was only looking out for itself.

Here’s a sampling of reaction on Twitter:

Eugene Koprowski’s temper earned him a reputation around the office pretty quickly.

Koprowski started work as the marketing director at the Heartland Institute, a right-wing think tank based outside Chicago, in July 2015. Former colleagues say he frequently raised his voice and threw tantrums if they questioned him. One described him as “violent generally.” He sent condescending emails to a female colleague, reprimanding her in almost comically sinister terms: “We will have no more insubordination.”

Despite these outbursts, former colleagues say Koprowski enjoyed protected status in the office because of his friendship with Joseph Morris, a conservative Chicago lawyer who is also a major fundraiser for Heartland and a close ally to its chief executive, Joseph Bast.

HuffPost spoke to three former staffers who confirmed these accounts, but requested anonymity for fear of retribution or jeopardizing future employment in the libertarian policy community.

Heartland, they said, fostered a culture that allowed Koprowski, 52, to relentlessly harass a female subordinate half his age ― to the point where she took out a restraining order against him in October 2015. And though Koprowski was apparently fired sometime after the woman complained to human resources, her former colleagues say his termination came in response to other misbehavior ― not his repeated, undesired romantic pursuit of the woman who reported to him.

Even after he was allegedly fired, Heartland kept the former executive in its protective orbit, former staffers say. Morris, who is listed on Heartland’s website as a policy adviser, is defending Koprowski in court against charges racked up when he contacted the woman over and over again, violating the protective order. Some of those charges were dropped in December, days after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a cyberstalking law used to charge Koprowski was unconstitutional, but the case is ongoing.

The previously-unreported case of alleged stalking comes to light just as Heartland has become more powerful than ever. The think tank transformed itself over the past two decades from a defender of the tobacco industry ― under the banner of “smokers rights” ― to a leading proponent of climate change denial and champion of fossil fuels. Since the Trump administration came to power, Heartland has enjoyed unprecedented influence at the Environmental Protection Agency, and works closely with hard-line science skeptics in Congress such as Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt joined the members of Congress in November to speak at Heartland’s America First Energy Conference in Houston.

Heartland’s contrarian skepticism on policy issues has extended to sexual harassment itself. In 2011, the organization posted a blog defending Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain against harassment accusations under the headline: “Women Crying ‘Sexual Harassment’ Should ’Man Up.’” In May 2017, the group republished an op-ed from Newsmax accusing female Fox News employees of making “disingenuous” sexual harassment allegations “seeking monetary ‘compensation’ into the millions of dollars.” Fox News hosts who dressed “sexily” in “short, short skirts and high, high heels with skimpy, skimpy tops,” it said, had “no standing to complain about male advances.”

Heartland categorically denied any wrongdoing in a statement posted to its website in response to a list of questions from HuffPost.

“The Heartland Institute is being targeted because our mission is fighting for a smaller, less-intrusive government and advancing free markets and greater individual liberty,” Bast said in the statement. “Our opponents in this debate cannot win on the merits of their arguments, so they stoop to circulate lies about our dedicated staff. Shame on them, and no, we will not stop until freedom is rising again.”

The woman, whose name HuffPost is withholding to protect her privacy, repeatedly declined to be interviewed on the record. A former staffer contacted this reporter about Koprowski’s case after HuffPost published an article about Heartland putting a convicted child sex offender on a list submitted to the EPA. HuffPost corroborated the employee’s account with two other former staffers, internal emails provided by the tipster, and by obtaining hundreds of pages of court filings and police reports.

The documents paint a disturbing picture of a man’s unabated obsession and how it terrified a younger woman who worked under him. Koprowski’s attorney has defended the relationship in court as misunderstood courtship.

The alleged harassment began in September 2015. That month, Koprowski started flooding the woman’s Facebook and email with messages, mostly related to work and office gossip, according to police reports and court filings that included screenshots of the conversations. He offered her mentorship. She had lunch with him a few times. It was soon clear he wanted more. In October 2015, the woman told Koprowski that she wanted their relationship to remain strictly professional, and keep their conversations focused on work.

But the woman’s account to police suggests he didn’t listen. He sent her a text message telling her how attractive she looked and how beautiful her eyes were. He emailed her to say the way she phrased a Facebook post about apple picking with her boyfriend suggested she knew, deep down, that Koprowski would be a superior lover to “that boy.” He emailed her again to tell her he was trying not to fall in love with her.

“It was just crazy. The whole thing with Gene [Koprowski], to see an organization not take action at all after knowing that someone in their organization was being stalked and harassed, was disappointing to say the least.” - Female former staffer at the Heartland Institute

The report, filed with the Tinley Park Police Department in Chicago’s southwest suburbs, states that she said she had already placed a complaint with Heartland’s human resources department on Oct. 19, 2015, and was working from home to avoid the office.

What happened next is not entirely clear. According to the police report, the woman told officers Koprowski was “either terminated or resigned from her company” the next day on Oct. 20. In a company-wide email dated Nov. 21, 2015, and obtained by HuffPost, Bast said Koprowski had departed weeks later: “It didn’t work out, and he left in November.” The three former staffers say Koprowski was fired sometime that month ― because he lost his temper in front of a human resources executive and a coworker recorded one of his yelling fits, not because of the sexual harassment allegations. Either way, the former employees say Heartland gave Koprowski a week to clear out his desk, allowing him to linger in the office.

“They were very responsive to donors, but very hands off in terms of its employees,” a former female staffer, who said she filed complaints about Koprowski’s abusive tirades, told HuffPost. “There wasn’t a lot of responsiveness if you had a complaint about another employee. It was very much, ‘you can deal with it yourself.’”

“There’s protected status that is given to people who are friends with people who donate large sums of money,” said the former staffer, noting that work culture there made the woman who accused Koprowski of stalking “scared” to report him to higher-ups because she expected them to have his back.

“It was outrageous, the things that happened at Heartland,” she added. “It was just crazy. The whole thing with Gene [Koprowski], to see an organization not take action at all after knowing that someone in their organization was being stalked and harassed, was disappointing to say the least.”

According to the police report the woman filed, the woman worked from home the day after complaining to human resources, too afraid, a former colleague said, to come into the office. That day, Koprowski sent the woman an early-morning email. “I am worried about your health,” he wrote in English. Then, in Polish: “May the Lord heal you from illness.” He concluded, in Polish: “You were my joy … my love for you always.” The police included a translation in their report.

The next day, Oct. 21, an attorney working for the woman sent Koprowski a cease and desist letter. He responded by calling her a liar and, according to the police report, insisting he hadn’t contacted her and that she had been stalking him.

The woman told police she received a Halloween card in her mailbox the next day with a return address that listed a P.O. box in Koprowski’s name. “Let’s stay in touch! Gene,” the card read, with a smiley drawn after his name, according to the police report. The woman and her boyfriend continued to receive bizarre emails and calls that they believed were from Koprowski, including one in which he told the boyfriend he’d had sex with the woman on a work trip.

This led her to file the report with the Tinley Park police on Oct. 26. A Will County judge ordered Koprowski to appear at a hearing the following month, and on Oct. 28 issued an order of protection that barred Koprowski from contacting the woman.

But the police reports show Koprowski continued to contact the woman, sending a series of emails between Nov. 28 and Dec. 6. On Dec. 17, Tinley Park police arrested Koprowski for violating the order. The next day, the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office charged Koprowski on three counts of violating a stalking no-contact order, a misdemeanor in Illinois. He hired Andy Sotiropoulos, the attorney who represented him before Morris.

While an intentional violation of a no-contact order is a Class A misdemeanor in Illinois, a second or subsequent violation can escalate to a Class 4 felony, according to a legal analysis on the Illinois State Bar Association’s website by Lori Levin, a Chicago attorney who handles domestic violence and stalking cases. Thomas Glasgow, founder of the Schaumburg, Illinois-based law firm Glasgow & Olsson, said how someone is charged for violating a stalking no-contact can vary by case.

“The person may have violated the order of protection, and in a vacuum, each of those charges is a misdemeanor,” Glasgow told HuffPost. “But when you have multiple charges, that enhances it.”

Five months after his initial misdemeanor charges, a grand jury indicted Koprowski on two felony charges of stalking, arguing that, under an existing cyberstalking statute, his repeated contact with the woman knowingly caused her emotional distress.

On May 23, 2016, Sotiropoulos appeared in court and said he would no longer work for Koprowski. Reached by phone, Sotiropoulos declined to comment, citing “attorney-client privilege.”

“I know where this is going and I don’t want it either way,” he said after asking from which outlet the reporter was calling. “It’s done and over.”

It’s unclear when Morris took over the case. But in September 2017, he filed a motion to dismiss the felony charges, arguing that an appeals court ruling that found the cyberstalking law unconstitutional and that “ordinary, daily life consists of a series of encounters, events, conduct and speech that cause emotional distress,” makes “such a standard … nonsensical.”

“If wooing a potential friend, lover, or romantic partner who is not interested in the wooer is a criminal act, then every human on the planet, male and female, runs the risk at one time or another in life of being a criminal under such a standard,” Morris wrote in the court filing.

In December, the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office dropped two felony charges against him. That same month, Morris filed a motion to dismiss misdemeanor charges of violating the no-contact order, and a Will County Circuit Court judge declined to renew the woman’s order of protection. Koprowski is due back in court on Feb. 1 for another hearing.

After HuffPost emailed Heartland spokesman Jim Lakely more than a dozen detailed questions, the organization responded by posting the aforementioned statement on its website, denying what it described as “false allegations” by a former employee.

“We understand HuffPost may be writing an article based on a disgruntled former employee’s false allegations that The Heartland Institute has tolerated sexual harassment in the past. The accusation is completely false,” Bast said in the statement. “Heartland always has had policies and procedures in place to ensure a professional and safe environment for its employees.”

Heartland then linked to a 2014 Gawker article that detailed sexual harassment allegations made against a former managing editor at HuffPost, and a recent Gizmodo story that accused the site’s former editor-in-chief, Arianna Huffington, of ignoring the alleged sexual misconduct.

After this story published, Heartland reposted its statement on its website under the headline: “HUFFPOST ATTEMPTS TO SMEAR HEARTLAND AGAIN.”

Heartland did not respond to questions about where the organization stands on Morris’ decision to represent its former employee. Neither Morris nor Koprowski returned calls and emails requesting comment.Jazz Jennings doesn’t hold back in an emotional new video, slamming those who’ve implied that her parents are child abusers for allowing her to live authentically.

The 17-year-old transgender activist and author has risen to fame in recent years thanks to the TLC reality series “I Am Jazz.” Along the way, she’s been hit with more than her share of close-minded, transphobic criticism, much of which has also been directed at her family, who have supported her decision to express her gender identity since age 6.

“It breaks my heart seeing my family being trashed and talked about poorly just because of loving me,” Jennings said in the Jan. 15 clip, which can be viewed above. “That’s all anyone can ask for from a family ― to love and embrace their child. I feel loved and embraced by them.”

Parents Greg and Jeanette Jennings, she added, are “absolutely incredible.”

“They have guided me down a path of unconditional love and support, and without them, then I would be depressed,” she said. “Then I would be so upset and unable to express myself authentically.”

The teen has been frank about her struggles with anxiety and depression, but clarified in the video that none of that stems from her gender identity.

AdvertisementWelcome to burlesque! On Thursday, the gypsies, tramps, and thieves of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 10 turned back time, portraying different Chers over the years. True, none of the contestants were as moonstriking as “All-Stars” winner and “professional” Cher impersonator Chad Michaels, who made a cameo at the start of the episode. And, since they were all singing live, not lip-synching for their lives, some of them did need “Believe”-style AutoTune more than others.

However, the end result — “Cher: The Unauthorized Rusical” – still needs to go straight to Broadway and win all the Tonys. I could watch ”Cher: The Rusical” over and over, and I’d never want to snap out of it. (Side note: This top seven episode’s “Moonstruck”-inspired slapfest mini-challenge was extremely, oddly satisfying to watch, even though RuPaul accidentally clocked Asia O’Hara for real!)

Cher (whose mother, Georgia Holt, and son, Chaz Bono, have guest-judged the show in the past) disappointingly did not live-tweet the episode. But “Drag Race” superfans conspiracy-theorized that the diva’s reply to a fan about her love of tomato soup — a tweet she first posted over a year ago, but then randomly mentioned again while “Drag Race” was in session Thursday — was in fact a Nostradamus-style prediction that contestant Miz Cracker, who played a vocoder-assisted “’90s Comeback Cher” this Thursday, will be crowned the next winner.

Cracker had some competition. Among the standout queens was bodybuilder-by-day/drag-queen-by-night Kameron Michaels — opening the show as “’60s Cher” with her flat-ironed hair and pinstriped flares, and getting Cher’s famously froggy speaking voice just right. Monet X Change also executed a flawless hair-flip as “Variety Show Cher” in a Mackie-worthy halter onesie, and Eureka O’Hara, despite her singing phobia, was ultimately fearless as the cannon-straddling, sheer-bodysuited “Rock Star Cher” of the late ’80s. These queens created some truly Eastwickian magic on the “Drag Race” soundstage.

We’ll find out which queen is “strong enough” when the Season 10 finale takes place in a few weeks’ time.

Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:Reynolds Woodcock, the fussy 1950s London couturier played by Daniel Day-Lewis in “Phantom Thread,” is ostensibly the star figure of Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest movie. Yet, throughout the film, Woodcock is gloriously upstaged by a variety of supporting characters: namely, the elegant dresses of his own design, and the women who wear them.

Enter Mark Bridges, who has designed the clothes for each of Anderson’s films, including “Boogie Nights,” “There Will Be Blood,” “The Master” and “Phantom Thread.”

Embedding himself in sartorial history, Bridges used the sudden opulence of post-World War II Europe to imbue the House of Woodcock with necessary contradictions: The patterns are customary and militaristic, worldly and modern, marked by both lace and “heavy, rich fabrics and colors.” Bridges and his team created more than 50 costumes for “Phantom Thread,” including wedding dresses, ball gowns and casual daytime looks.

Bridges drew inspiration from the British fashion world, creating regalia based on “research and archeology” from the era. He was given access to the famous dresses housed at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum ― including pieces by Givenchy, Balmain, Balenciaga, Charles Frederick Worth, Victor Stiebel and Norman Hartnell. “We could touch [them], see the fabrics,” the New York-born Bridges told HuffPost. “But, also, finding incredible knits and tweeds and things already in existing garments from the period ― and being able to use that as a costume [during scenes set] in the countryside ― [made the clothes feel] a little more lived-in [...], which Paul really loved. We had both sides of it: I had to do a movie story, and then I had to do a fashion-house story at the same time.”

Ahead of the movie opening in wide release on Jan. 12, Bridges walked us through the designing of four key looks from “Phantom Thread,” in which Woodock finds a muse in Alma Elson (Vicky Krieps), whose initial meekness gives way to unlikely resolve. As the impetuous Woodcock incorporates Alma into his life, their romance becomes a game of wit and light sadomasochism. But, amid the lush drama, we never lose sight of those dresses.

The Crimson-and-Lace Debut

Focus Features

Alma’s debut as the House of Woodcock’s muse comes during a fashion show for the boutique’s spring line, when she models a crimson tea-length dress adorned with lace. Pockets sewn into women’s garments made a comeback around the turn of the 20th century, after being sidelined in favor of slender waistlines and restrained designs, according to an enlightening historical overview published by Racked.

Even though pockets were popular with suffragette suits, couturiers did not incorporate them for functional purposes. “Men have pockets to keep things in, women for decoration,” Christian Dior said in 1954.

Mark Bridges on the pockets in Alma’s crimson dress: “I think when you’re at home entertaining your guests, yes, [you can incorporate pockets]. There are things that Queen Victoria wore that she had pockets sewn into for her own convenience. I think because it’s a custom garment, anything’s possible. And it’s a hostess thing. I think it’s interesting [Alma] would wear that in the fashion show because she is, in an unspoken way, the hostess of the house. And then that was just an unusual thing of the period, and very British, where there was occasion dressing. At home in the evening, it’s an incredibly opulent outfit. But for this clientele of women, they also did casual clothes for their clients, too.”

The Lavender Pièce de Résistance

Focus Features

One of the movie’s most ravishing gowns, Alma’s lavendar ensemble came from Daniel Day-Lewis himself ― or, rather, from Reynolds Woodcock. Famously immersive in his acting process, Day-Lewis selected the hue in character.

Mark Bridges on Alma’s lavender dress: “I actually had Reynolds choose that color of satin. He had the input on that. We knew we needed a real piece of some kind of fabric. [Paul Thomas Anderson] had written that this was some special piece of fabric that [Woodcock] had rescued in the war. I think the way it was originally written it was supposed to be satin from some place in France. But then it developed that the House of Woodcock was a house that used a lot of lace. I decided it should be lace [and tried] to find a vintage piece of lace.

“One of my assistants dug around with some dealers over there in London and had found this 17th-century piece of Flemish lace. There were three meters of it. It was only 18 inches wide. It was linen, and linen doesn’t self-destruct like silk, which shatters. You can get intact linen from the Egyptian tombs and stuff because it’s just really durable. It was really intact and really special, so it had the right energy and vibe for Daniel to believe in it. It had the right decorative quality for me. And [it was] bold enough to mean something. It wasn’t little tiny lace that, again, photographed mushy. It had enough zip to be something special.

“And then what do you make it into? It was kind of a combination of this ’50s dress that kind of had a vague Restoration period look to it, so we did the lines of that ’50s dress, but then played with the substituted lace for it. There’s a turn-of-the-century quality with using the lace down at the hemline as well because there’s always some vague historical feeling to the Reynolds clothes, too, which, as our research found out, was quite common in the ’50s. Some of the designers would riff on another period, like the Tudor period, and reimagine it in the ’50s.”

The Defiant Dress

Focus Features

In the span of one scene, Alma transitions from subservient muse to gentle firebrand. During a fitting, she tells Woodcock she doesn’t like the fabric he’s chosen, launching a quick war of words between the two. “Maybe you have no taste,” Woodcock tells her, to which Alma responds, “Maybe I like my own taste.”

Mark Bridges on Alma’s moment of defiance: “It’s interesting because in the story [that dress is] allegedly part of the spring line. There were several dresses that were in the running for which would be the fabric that she would comment on, like, ‘I hate this pattern.’ I had found one at a vintage show; it was a gown that had never been used. It was sort of blue with black flowers. My idea was there was something vaguely odd and depressing or dramatic about whatever she was going to comment on, like a dark storm or something. For the idea of this to be a floral based in black and purple, which are colors of mourning, and then this blue, you can see why a young girl would not think this was attractive. But then [Woodcock’s clients] would think it was fabulous. So that’s why we settled on that.”

“I’m really scared and really excited at the same time,” she wrote on Instagram, per People.

Using prayer-hand emojis, Rose added that her doctors “are gonna take care of me.”
