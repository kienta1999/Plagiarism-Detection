The Interior Department took six months to respond to investigators probing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s apparent effort to bully Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) into supporting Obamacare repeal last year, and ultimately skirted their questions.

In a letter HuffPost obtained, Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch brothers adviser appointed principal deputy solicitor in May, refused to give the Government Accountability Office details about Zinke’s July phone call to Murkowski and fellow Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan.

Details about what Zinke said to the lawmakers “are immaterial to the legal issues you have raised,” Jorjani wrote to Edda Perez, a managing associate general counsel at GAO.

As Anchorage Daily News first reported, Zinke phoned Murkowski and Sullivan after Murkowski voted in July against a measure to begin debate on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Sullivan told the paper that Zinke had delivered a “troubling message,” indicating that Murkowski’s defection could jeopardize future energy projects in Alaska.

In the end, despite an online scolding from President Donald Trump, the Alaska senator stood her ground and joined two other Republicans in defeating a “skinny” repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Zinke and Murkowski both disputed media reports about the phone call. Zinke dismissed the idea that he threatened the senator as “laughable,” E&E News reported. Murkowski called the conversation “difficult” and said Zinke was simply “sharing the concern that the president had expressed to him to pass on to me,” according to The Hill.

The Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General launched a preliminary investigation into Zinke’s alleged attempt to pressure Murkowski in early August, but both Alaska senators refused to be interviewed, effectively shutting those efforts down, according to a letter the inspector general sent to Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Raul Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.).

The GAO followed up with its own investigation in early September at the request of Pallone and Grijalva. In their letter, the two Democratic lawmakers requested a formal determination regarding possible legal violations.

Later that month, the Interior Department received an inquiry from GAO counsel Perez, as Jorjani noted in his response six months later.

Along with details about the call, Perez asked the department if it believes money appropriated for Zinke’s salary and related expenses “is available for the purpose of communicating with senators about pending healthcare legislation.”

“In our view,” Jorjani responded, “this appropriation was available for the Secretary’s call with the senators regardless of the topic that was discussed because the Secretary is authorized to engage in activities beyond his statutory duties and entitled to his salary incident to the office he holds — not the performance of any particular matter.”

Jorjani also said he was unaware of the agency failing to meet its obligations or withholding money from the state of Alaska. There is no evidence that Zinke or the Interior Department retaliated against Murkowski for her vote.

The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Thursday.

Asked about the GAO’s investigation into Zinke’s call, Charles Young, GAO’s public affairs managing director, told HuffPost that “no final determination has been made yet.” Young said he was unable to provide HuffPost with Perez’s initial letter to the Interior Department or comment on Jorjani’s response to it.

In an emailed statement, Grijalva said the Interior Department’s letter suggests Zinke believes he’s above the law.In 1986, Ellen DeGeneres got her big break when she became the first woman Johnny Carson invited to sit on the couch after she performed her famous comedy bit “Phone Call to God” on “The Tonight Show.”

Yet, the hilarious routine — in which she calls God on the phone to ask why fleas exist — was inspired by a very tragic time in DeGeneres’ life.

On Monday’s episode of actor Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” podcast, the comedian said she began writing the gag shortly after a former girlfriend was killed in a car accident.

The TV host explained that at the time she wasn’t doing comedy. She was a struggling 20-year-old waitress and couldn’t afford the couple’s shared apartment anymore. So, she moved into a “basement apartment” and slept on a mattress “infested with fleas” on the floor.

It was during this time that she thought, “‘Why is this beautiful, 21-year-old girl just gone and fleas are here?’” DeGeneres recalled to Shepard. “And I just thought it would be amazing if we could pick up the phone and call up God and ask questions and actually get an answer.”

Inspired, she began writing the idea down, coming up with other funny tidbits until the whole routine “just unfolded,” the comedian said.

“When I finished, I read it and I thought, ‘Oh my God, that’s hilarious. I’m going to do this on Johnny Carson and I’m going to be the first woman in the history of the show to be called over to sit down.’”Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) began his federal court defense of a state law requiring people prove citizenship when they register to vote, but his first witnesses failed to make a compelling case.

Kobach, who claims nothing short of requiring proof of citizenship can prevent noncitizens from voting, presented two experts whose conclusions were challenged, and a voter who explained how she managed to overcome the voter registration requirement without documents.

The ACLU is suing Kobach over the 2013 law, saying it’s unnecessary and has blocked at least 35,000 people from voting. The ACLU finished its case on Monday, giving Kobach the opportunity to defend the law, which a federal judge blocked in 2016 pending the outcome of the trial. Kobach, who is representing himself in the case, claims as many as 18,000 noncitizens are on Kansas voting rolls, and proof of citizenship can prevent that from happening.

Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, testified he saw no statistically significant difference in voter registration from 2010, before the law, to 2014, after it took effect on Jan. 1, 2013, according to The Wichita Eagle.

An ACLU witness pointed out last week that Camarota’s analysis assumed the only thing that changed from 2010 to 2014 was the proof of citizenship law, and failed to account for such variables as the competitiveness of Kansas elections in that time, according to KCUR.

Camarota said he didn’t need to control for other factors in his analysis, Talking Points Memo reported.

Jesse Richman, a political science professor at Old Dominion University began testifying at the end of the day Monday, but his testimony was quickly derailed when the ACLU objected he was presenting data not included in his report, according to Talking Points Memo.

Richman’s testimony prompted a scolding from U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson, KCUR reported. The professor continued speaking over the judge, arguing his new numbers should be included. But Robinson, who has rarely lost her patience during the trial, snapped at him, according to ProPublica. The judge earlier in the trial reprimanded Kobach and his legal team for failing to follow evidence procedures.

Richman’s testimony continues on Tuesday.

A perplexing moment on Monday came when Kobach called Jo French, a retiree in her mid 70s, to the witness stand. French is one of six people since 2013 who lack a birth certificate or other citizenship documents, but have been approved by the state election board to register to vote. Kobach hoped to show how easy it was for people to be approved to vote even without documents.

But French testified there was a burdensome process, even before she could get a hearing with the state election board, according to Talking Points Memo.

She said she was blocked from registering to vote when she went to get a Kansas driver’s license in 2016. She was born in Arkansas, and paid $8 in an unsuccessful effort to get her birth certificate, which she knew the state wouldn’t have because she was born at home and tried to get it before. She eventually got a copy of her family Bible, baptismal records and high school records.

After hunting down the records, French said she got someone to drive her 40 minutes to a hearing in Topeka with the election board.

Though she said she supports the proof of citizenship law, she said she was insulted that no one believed she was a citizen.

She also said she had become friends with Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker, and agreed to appear in court to make Kobach look good.

Kobach and his lawyers have repeatedly claimed during the trial that it’s easy for anyone to make their case to his office and the state election board that they could be registered.

Donna Bucci testified last week for the ACLU as another example. She was blocked from registering because she doesn’t have a birth certificate, but was told to call the Secretary of State’s office during her lunch break to schedule a hearing. Bucci said she works from 3 a.m. until noon as a prison cook and can’t even use a cell phone inside.

Kansas Gov. Jeff Coyler (R), who is running against Kobach in the GOP primary for governor, and Attorney General Derek Schmidt, both declined to say Monday whether they still had confidence in Kobach’s ability to defend the law.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointedly avoided saying the word “Russia” on Monday when very specifically questioned about that country’s culpability in the poisoning last week of a former Russian spy with a deadly nerve agent.

British officials have determined that Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a nerve agent developed in Russia. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced Monday that it was “highly likely” that Russia was responsible for the attack. “We must now stand ready to take extensive measures,” May said.

But when asked ― three times ― at a White House press briefing about Russia’s link to the poisoning or any possible repercussions for the country from the U.S., Sanders carefully did not say “Russia” — or otherwise address who may have been responsible for the attack. She characterized it as an “indiscriminate” attack, although British authorities have concluded that Skripal was clearly targeted.

“We’ve been monitoring the incident closely, take it very seriously,” Sanders said. “The use of a highly lethal nerve agent against U.K. citizens on U.K. soil is an outrage. The attack was reckless, indiscriminate and irresponsible. We offer the fullest condemnation.”

“So you’re not saying that Russia was behind this?” a reporter asked.

“Right now, we are standing with our U.K. ally,” Sanders said again. “I think they’re still working through even some of the details of that.”

Pressed a third time, an annoyed Sanders answered, “Like I just said, we stand with our ally and we certainly fully support them and are ready if we can be of any assistance.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry has dismissed the U.K.’s accusations about Skripal’s poisoning as a “circus show.”

Former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was fatally poisoned in London in 2006 with radioactive polonium-210, which it’s believed he drank in a cup of tea. A British investigation concluded that his assassination was likely approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.

The White House’s extreme reluctance to criticize Russia — ever — has raised increasing concerns, particularly as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates possible collusion by Donald Trump’s campaign in the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Early this month, Putin boasted of his nation’s nuclear capabilities to strike anywhere in the world. A simulated video presented by Putin appeared to depict next-generation nuclear missiles striking Florida. Yet Trump has yet to respond and chose instead to attack actor Alec Baldwin on Twitter the following day.

Former CIA director John Brennan said at the time that he was rattled by Trump’s apparent lack of concern about the video.“It’s so interesting being Jazlyn and Skyler," said actress Chloe Bailey, who acts alongside her sister Halle Bailey in "Grown-ish." Freeform

“Everybody’s always checking for the girl who looks black, but no one wants the girl who actually is.”

Jazlyn Foster, played by actress and musician Chloe Bailey, couldn’t have been more spot on in the latest episode of “Grown-ish.”

Chloe and her sister Halle Bailey, of the R&B duo Chloe x Halle, star as twin track stars in the “Black-ish” spinoff, which explores issues college students grapple with, like social media, drugs and dating.

Wednesday’s episode addressed the double standard that black women face while dating. At the beginning of the episode, Zoey, played by Yara Shahidi, introduced the 2014 OKCupid study that found 82 percent of non-black men show some bias against black women.

As the twins are talking about this bias with friends at a party, they note that black men aren’t checking for them, either. But the non-black girls with curves, full lips and cornrows get all of the play.

Jazlyn and Skyler, Halle’s character, just want a normal dating life without getting overlooked for girls with lighter skin ― a sentiment many black women can relate to in real life.

“It’s so interesting being Jazlyn and Skyler. As we were playing these roles, we were feeling some type of way, too,” Chloe told HuffPost. “Everyone has their insecurities, and it was just painting that picture for the world to see how society is, whether it’s subconsciously or not.”

“Grown-ish” directly tackles the issues young adults face ― from wrestling with societal beauty standards to achieving school-life balance ― and it does so with black and brown women at the forefront, a rarity for TV.

Chloe x Halle don’t take that lightly.

Twins Jazlyn and Skyler struggle to hit a dating stride on an episode of "Grown-ish." Freeform

“That personally means so much to us,” Halle told HuffPost. “The fact that we have our beautiful friend Yara representing Zoey and black girls her age and being able to be a part of a show like this as our characters, Jazlyn and Skyler.”

“We just feel really blessed and grateful we’re given this opportunity,” she continued, “so that other little black girls can see that ‘I can do this one day, you’re beautiful, if I can see myself on TV, then I can grow up and I can do this.’”

The sisters’ single “Grown” is the show’s theme song, and they try to inspire their audience through both their acting and music. Their forthcoming album, “The Kids Are Alright,” is aimed at empowering teens and young adults.

“This album means so much to us, cuz as we are growing into young women, we’re still children,” Chloe said. “We’re still kids inside, and we’re just so happy to be a part of this generation who [is] not afraid to use our voice[s]. We’re not afraid to say what’s wrong. And everyone always worries about us, and they question if the kids will be alright. The answer is yes, we will be alright, we got this, you don’t need to worry about us.”Taylor Swift, who has been called a snake and Regina George in sheep’s clothing in the past, is now being called another offensive animal-oriented nickname — a copycat.

On Monday, the musician released the video for her song, “Delicate,” and it didn’t take Twitter users long to point out that it looks pretty similar to a nearly 4-minute ad Spike Jonze directed for Kenzo World perfume in 2016 starring actress Margaret Qualley.

Many users made the case by taking screen grabs of both the video and the short film ― and placing them side by side.

In the video and the ad, Swift and Qualley both make silly faces and dance awkwardly throughout a fancy venue wearing gowns. Many of their dance moves are similar as well.

Although the video and ad aren’t completely identical, they are conceptually alike.

The video for “Delicate,” directed by her frequent collaborator Joseph Kahn, is about an international celebrity — in this case, Swift — who suddenly becomes invisible to the masses while attending a fancy event.

The idea of not being seen is so freeing for Swift that she joyously tears off part of her long gown, kicks off her shoes and dances barefoot à la Maddie Ziegler-style through the venue, the subway and then in a city street in the rain.

In Jonze’s ad, Qualley excuses herself from a fancy event. Though she is not rendered invisible, the idea of leaving and finding herself alone in the huge venue is so liberating that she begins to crazily dance throughout the space (and at one point, shoots lightning from her fingers, because, why not?).

So far, no word from Swift or Kahn about the commentary surrounding the similarities.“I wanted the world to know the talent he had,” Toney told the Daily News. “It was something I wanted people to enjoy, but it was cut short because he was very religious and wanted to go to church.”

President Donald Trump’s decision to nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state has alarmed America’s top Muslim advocacy organizations, whose leaders say Pompeo’s past statements about Muslims, and his ties to hate groups, indicate a serious bias against Islam.

After Trump tweeted Tuesday about his plans to replace current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Pompeo, several advocates pointed out that Pompeo has long had a “toxic relationship” with American Muslims ― so much so that in 2016, he won a top award from Act for America, an organization the Southern Poverty Law Center considers an anti-Muslim hate group.

Hoda Hawa, director of policy and advocacy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, called Pompeo a “divisive” figure whose confirmation would further erode American Muslims’ trust in their government.

“As the top diplomat for the United States, it is crucial that the Secretary of State carries out a foreign policy agenda that doesn’t marginalize American communities,” Hawa told HuffPost in an email. “Pompeo has shown, both as a Member of Congress and as the CIA Director, that his personal feelings inform his policies.”

Scott Simpson, a spokesperson for Muslim Advocates, expressed similar concerns.

“Mike Pompeo has made a career of bigotry and hate,” Simpson said. “This announcement should concern every congressmember and American who values religious freedom.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

“Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts, and more importantly still, in those that may well follow,” Pompeo said in that speech.

Robert McCaw, director of government affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told HuffPost that Pompeo has “made no attempt to make amends” for this false allegation.

McCaw said he fears that Pompeo’s “toxic” relationship with American Muslims would impede his ability to build lasting relations with Muslim-majority countries as secretary of state.

“All Americans, especially American Muslims, need a Secretary of State that is willing to push back” against the “rising tides of anti-American sentiment and Islamophobia that is spreading overseas in response to the Trump Administration’s American First and anti-Muslim policy agenda,” McCaw told HuffPost.

Pompeo has also been criticized for his ties to Brigitte Gabriel and Frank Gaffney, two prominent anti-Muslim activists.

Gabriel is the founder of Act for America, one of the nation’s largest grassroots anti-Muslim groups. In the past, Gabriel has claimed that practicing Muslims cannot be loyal citizens of the United States. Her group has successfully lobbied state legislatures to introduce bills banning “foreign” law in U.S. courts. Last year, Act for America organized nationwide “March Against Sharia” protests against the nonexistent threat of Sharia law.

Pompeo has repeatedly spoken at Act for America’s national conferences, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also reportedly sponsored an Act for America legislative briefing at the Capitol in 2016.

In a post on Act for America’s site, Gabriel said Pompeo has been a “steadfast ally” since the day he was elected to Congress. She said that in 2016, the group gave Pompeo its “highest honor,” a National Security Eagle Award.

The SPLC says that Trump’s appointment of Pompeo betrays the president’s “anti-Muslim agenda.”

“At a time when we’re seeing hate groups have unprecedented access to the White House, Pompeo’s ties to anti-Muslim hate groups are extremely alarming,” the SPLC said Tuesday in a statement. “This new position gives anti-Muslim extremists another ally in a high place.”

In the past, Pompeo has indicated that he can distinguish between Islam and terrorism. According to The Wichita Eagle, Pompeo visited the Middle East for a “fact-finding” trip in 2015. Afterward, he told Wichita’s Republican Pachyderm Club that “there are many Muslims of good will” who “despise this extremism as much as anyone of any other faith.”

“Pompeo must make amends for his past Islamophobic actions and stances. However, there is not enough time before his confirmation hearing to gain CAIR [or] the Muslim community’s support for his nomination,” McCaw said.

Khaled Beydoun, author of American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, told HuffPost that Trump’s appointment of Pompeo reflects the administration’s “commitment to a ratcheted-up War on Terror.”

“Trump has been critiqued for his rhetorical Islamophobia,” Beydoun said, “but appointments like this manifest that his state-sponsored Islamophobia is far more harmful.”This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.

The immigration debate seems to have gone crazy.

President Obama’s widely popular Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which offered some 750,000 young immigrants brought to the United States as children a temporary reprieve from deportation, is ending... except it isn’t... except it is... President Trump claims to support it but ordered its halt, while both Republicans and Democrats insist that they want to preserve it and blame each other for its impending demise. (Meanwhile, the Supreme Court recently stepped in to allow DACA recipients to renew their status at least for now.)

On a single day in mid-February, the Senate rejected no less than four immigration bills. These ranged from a narrow proposal to punish sanctuary cities that placed limits on local police collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to major overhauls of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act that established the current system of immigration quotas (with preferences for “family reunification”).

And add in one more thing: virtually everyone in the political sphere is now tailoring his or her pronouncements and votes to political opportunism rather than the real issues at hand.

“On a single day in mid-February, the Senate rejected no less than four immigration bills.”

Politicians and commentators who once denounced “illegal immigration,” insisting that people “do it the right way,” are now advocating stripping legal status from many who possess it and drastically cutting even legalized immigration. These days, the hearts of conservative Republicans, otherwise promoting programs for plutocrats, are bleeding for low-wage workers whose livelihoods, they claim (quite incorrectly), are being undermined by competition from immigrants. Meanwhile, Chicago Democrat Luis Gutiérrez ― a rare, reliably pro-immigrant voice in Congress ― recently swore that, when it came to Trump’s much-touted wall on the Mexican border, he was ready to “take a bucket, take bricks, and start building it myself... We will dirty our hands in order for the Dreamers to have a clean future in America.”

While in Gutiérrez’s neck of the woods, favoring Dreamers may seem politically expedient, giving in to Trump’s wall would result in far more than just dirty hands, buckets, and bricks, and the congressman knows that quite well. The significant fortifications already in place on the U.S.-Mexican border have already contributed to the deaths of thousands of migrants, to the increasing militarization of the region, to a dramatic rise of paramilitary drug- and human-smuggling gangs, and to a rise in violent lawlessness on both sides of the border. Add to that a 2,000-mile concrete wall or some combination of walls, fences, bolstered border patrols, and the latest in technology and you’re not just talking about some benign waste of money in return for hanging on to the DACA kids.

In the swirl of all this, the demands of immigrant rights organizations for a “clean Dream Act” that would genuinely protect DACA recipients without giving in to Trump’s many anti-immigration demands have come to seem increasingly unrealistic. No matter that they hold the only morally coherent position in town ― and a broadly popular one nationally as well ― DACA’s congressional backers seem to have already conceded defeat.

Good Guys and Bad Guys

It won’t surprise you, I’m sure, to learn that Donald Trump portrays the world in a strikingly black-and-white way when it comes to immigration (and so much else). He emphasizes the violent criminal nature of immigrants and the undocumented, repeatedly highlighting and falsely generalizing from relatively rare cases in which one of them committed a violent crime like the San Francisco killing of Kate Steinle. His sweeping references to “foreign bad guys” and “shithole countries” suggest that he applies the same set of judgments to the international arena.

Under Trump’s auspices, the agency in charge of applying the law to immigrants, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has taken the concept of criminality to new heights in order to justify expanded priorities for deportation. Now, an actual criminal conviction is no longer necessary. An individual with “pending criminal charges” or simply a “known gang member” has also become an ICE “priority.” In other words, a fear-inspiring accusation or even rumor is all that’s needed to deem an immigrant a “criminal.”

And such attitudes are making their way ever deeper into this society. I’ve seen it at Salem State University, the college where I teach. In a recent memo explaining why he opposes giving the school sanctuary-campus status, the chief of campus police insisted that his force must remain authorized to report students to ICE when there are cases of “bad actors... street gang participation... drug trafficking... even absent a warrant or other judicial order.” In other words, due process be damned, the police, any police, can determine guilt as they wish.

And this tendency toward such a Trumpian Manichaean worldview, now being used to justify the growth of what can only be called an incipient police state, is so strong that it’s even infiltrated the thinking of some of the president’s immigration opponents. Take “chain migration,” an obscure concept previously used mainly by sociologists and historians to describe nineteenth and twentieth century global migration patterns. The president has, of course, made it his epithet du jour.

Because the president spoke of “chain migration” in such a derogatory way, anti-Trump liberals immediately assumed that the phrase was inherently insulting. MSNBC correspondent Joy Reid typically charged that “the president is saying that the only bill he will approve of must end what they call ‘chain migration’ which is actually a term we in the media should just not use! Because quite frankly it’s not a real thing, it’s a made up term... [and] so offensive! It’s shocking to me that we’re just adopting it wholesale because [White House adviser] Stephen Miller wants to call it that... [The term should be] family migration.”

Similarly, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand claimed that “when someone uses the phrase chain migration... it is intentional in trying to demonize families, literally trying to demonize families, and make it a racist slur.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed: “Look what they’re doing with family unification, making up a fake name, chain. Chain, they like the word ‘chain.’ That sends tremors through people.”

But chain migration is not the same as family reunification. Chain migration is a term used by academics to explain how people tended to migrate from their home communities using pre-existing networks. Examples would include the great migration of African Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west, the migrations of rural Appalachians to Midwestern industrial cities, waves of European migration to the United States at the turn of the last century, as well as contemporary migration from Latin America and Asia.

A single individual or a small group, possibly recruited through a state-sponsored system or by an employer, or simply knowing of employment opportunities in a particular area, sometimes making use of a new rail line or steamship or air route, would venture forth, opening up new horizons. Once in a new region or land, such immigrants directly or indirectly recruited friends, acquaintances, and family members. Soon enough, there were growing links ― hence that “chain” ― between the original rural or urban communities where such people lived and distant cities. Financial remittances began to flow back; return migration (or simply visits to the old homeland) took place; letters about the new world arrived; and sometimes new technologies solidified ongoing ties, impelling yet more streams of migrants. That’s the chain in chain migration and, despite the president and his supporters, there’s nothing offensive about it.

Family reunification, on the other hand, was a specific part of this country’s 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which imposed quotas globally. These were then distributed through a priority system that privileged the close relatives of immigrants who had already become permanent residents or U.S. citizens. Family reunification opened paths for those who had family members in the United States (though in countries where the urge to migrate was high, the waiting list could be decades long). In the process, however, it made legal migration virtually impossible for those without such ties. There was no “line” for them to wait in. Like DACA and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), the two programs that President Trump is now working so assiduously to dismantle, family reunification has been beneficial to those in a position to take advantage of it, even if it excluded far more people than it helped.

Why does this matter? As a start, at a moment when political posturing and “fake news” are becoming the norm, it’s important that the immigrant rights movement remain accurate and on solid ground in its arguments. (Indeed, the anti-immigrant right has been quick to gloat over Democrats condemning a term they had been perfectly happy to use in the past.) In addition, it’s crucial not to be swept away by Trump’s Manichaean view of the world when it comes to immigration. Legally, family reunification was never an open-arms policy. It was always a key component in a system of quotas meant to limit, control, and police migration, often in stringent ways. It was part of a system built to exclude at least as much as include. There may be good reasons to defend the family reunification provisions of the 1965 Act, just as there are good reasons to defend DACA ― but that does not mean that a deeply problematic status quo should be glorified.

Racism and the Immigrant “Threat”

Those very quotas and family-reunification policies served to “illegalize” most Mexican migration to the United States. That, in turn, created the basis not just for militarizing the police and the border, but for what anthropologist Leo Chávez has called the “Latino threat narrative”: the notion that the United States somehow faces an existential threat from Mexican and other Latino immigrants.

So President Trump has drawn on a long legacy here, even if in a particularly invidious fashion. The narrative evolved over time in ways that sought to downplay its explicitly racial nature. Popular commentators railed against “illegal” immigrants, while lauding those who “do it the right way.” The threat narrative, for instance, lurked at the very heart of the immigration policies of the Obama administration. President Obama regularly hailed exceptional Latino and other immigrants, even as the criminalization, mass incarceration, and deportation of so many were, if anything, being ramped up. Criminalization provided a “color-blind” cover as the president separated undocumented immigrants into two distinct groups: “felons” and “families.” In those years, so many commentators postured on the side of those they defined as the deserving exceptions, while adding further fuel to the threat narrative.

President Trump has held onto a version of this ostensibly color-blind and exceptionalist narrative, while loudly proclaiming himself “the least racist person” anyone might ever run into and praising DACA recipients as “good, educated, and accomplished young people.” But the racist nature of his anti-immigrant extremism and his invocations of the “threat” have gone well beyond Obama’s programs. In his attack on legal immigration, chain migration, and legal statuses like DACA and TPS, race has again reared its head explicitly.

Unless they were to come from “countries like Norway” or have some special “merit,” Trump seems to believe that immigrants should essentially all be illegalized, prohibited, or expelled. Some of his earliest policy moves like his attacks on refugees and his travel ban were aimed precisely at those who would otherwise fall into a legal category, those who had “followed the rules,” “waited in line,” “registered with the government,” or “paid taxes,” including refugees, DACA kids, and TPS recipients ― all of them people already in the system and approved for entry or residence.

As ICE spokespeople remind us when asked to comment on particularly egregious examples of the arbitrary detention and deportation of long-term residents, President Trump has rescinded the Obama-era “priority enforcement” program that emphasized the apprehension and deportation of people with criminal records and recent border-crossers. Now, “no category of removable aliens [is] exempt from enforcement.” While President Trump has continued to verbally support the Dreamers, his main goal in doing so has clearly been to use them as a bargaining chip in obtaining his dramatically restrictionist priorities from a reluctant Congress.

The U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) made the new restrictionist turn official in late February when it revised its mission statement to delete this singular line: “USCIS secures America’s promise as a nation of immigrants.” No longer. Instead, we are now told, the agency “administers the nation’s lawful immigration system, safeguarding its integrity and promise... while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our values.”

Challenging the Restrictionist Agenda

Many immigrant rights organizations have fought hard against the criminalization narrative that distinguishes the Dreamers from other categories of immigrants. Mainstream and Democrat-affiliated organizations have, however, generally pulled the other way, emphasizing the “innocence” of those young people who were brought here “through no fault of their own.”

Dreamers, TPS recipients, refugees, and even those granted priority under the family reunification policy have all operated as exceptions to what has long been a far broader restrictionist immigration agenda. Trump has now taken that agenda in remarkably extreme directions. So fighting to protect such exceptional categories makes sense, given the millions who have benefited from them, but no one should imagine that America’s policies have ever been generous or open.

Regarding refugees, for example, the State Department website still suggests that “the United States is proud of its history of welcoming immigrants and refugees... The U.S. refugee resettlement program reflects the United States’ highest values and aspirations to compassion, generosity, and leadership.” Even before Trump entered the Oval Office, this wasn’t actually true: the refugee resettlement program has always been both small and highly politicized. For example, out of approximately seven million Syrian refugees who fled the complex set of conflicts in their country since 2011 ― conflicts that would not have unfolded as they did without the American invasion of Iraq ― the United States has accepted only 21,000. Now, however, the fight to preserve even such numbers looks like a losing rearguard battle.

Given that a truly just reform of the country’s immigration system is inconceivable at the moment, it makes sense that those concerned with immigrant rights concentrate on areas where egregious need or popular sympathy have made stopgap measures realistic. The problem is that, over the years, this approach has tended to separate out particular groups of immigrants from the larger narrative and so failed to challenge the underlying racial and criminalizing animus toward all those immigrants consigned to the depths of the economic system and systematically denied the right of belonging.

In a sense, President Trump is correct: there really isn’t a way to draw a hard and fast line between legal and illegal immigration or between the felons and the families. Many immigrants live in mixed-status households, including those whose presence has been authorized in different ways or not authorized at all. And most of those felons, often convicted of recently criminalized, immigration-related or other minor violations, have families, too.

Trump and his followers, of course, want just about all immigrants to be criminalized and excluded or deported because, in one way or another, they consider them dangers to the rest of us. While political realism demands that battles be fought for the rights of particular groups of immigrants, it’s no less important to challenge the looming narrative of immigrant criminalization and to refuse to assume that the larger war has already been lost. In the end, isn’t it time to challenge the notion that people in general, and immigrants in particular, can be easily divided into deserving good guys and undeserving bad guys?

As a result, the tribute tweet may be the most unintentionally truthful thing the former White House press secretary has ever said.

Shortly after President Donald Trump publicly dumped Tillerson on Tuesday, Spicer posted this message:

Secretary Tillerson is a true patriot that has severed our nation well. Thank you for serving. Mike Pompeo will be an outstanding Secretary of State - the Senate should act swiftly to confirm him https://t.co/J8Eo0harb9 — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) March 13, 2018

Spicer probably meant to write “served our nation,” but “severed” may be more apt, considering the way that Tillerson, among other things, hollowed out the State Department’s diplomatic corps and failed to spend any of the $120 million allocated by Congress to combat foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections.

Foreign policy experts say Tillerson’s tenure did damage to the State Department that could last a generation, according to Vox.com.

No wonder many Twitter users were quick to bust Spicer’s chops about the tweeted typo.

William Otis, adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School and former member of the Bush administration, was announced as one of President Donald Trump’s nominees for the U.S. Sentencing Commission — a bipartisan agency that dictates federal sentencing guidelines — earlier this month. Since then, critics have pointed to Otis’ history of making “racially charged” comments online as a reason to question his fitness for the job.

In a 2013 post he wrote for blog Crime and Consequences, Otis indicated he agreed with a judge’s remarks that “blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites.” In a follow-up comment, he maintained that racial disparity in the prison system was not due to systemic racism, but “making choices.” Otis held up Asian individuals to bolster his argument, using the derogatory term “Orientals.”

“The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks,” he wrote, “is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in others.”

Among the problematic views on display in Otis’ argument, his last comment perpetuates a false representation of Asian-Americans as “model minorities.”

Aarti Kohli, executive director of Advancing Justice - Asian Law Caucus, told HuffPost in an email that Otis’ comments essentially paint a broad picture of the Asian-American community, ignoring the complexities within the minority group.

While little data exists on the Asian-American prison population, the research available shows that it has not been exempt from contact with the criminal justice system.

“In the California prison system, APIs [Asian-Pacific Islanders] are officially categorized as ‘Others,’ a fitting description for a population so often overlooked,” Kohli said. “There is plenty of evidence that shows that the criminal justice system is a form of social control [that] is biased against people of color.”

In the 1990s, the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community saw its prisoner population balloon, increasing by 250 percent. A significant portion of these Asian-Americans came from refugee groups who fled from Southeast Asia following the Vietnam War ― a fact that was particularly evident in areas with high concentrations of this group. Laotian and Vietnamese individuals, for example, were among the top four most arrested groups in 1990 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Kohli noted that the Trump appointee’s comments allude to the “good immigrant” and “perpetual foreigner” stereotypes, denying Asian-Americans of their “Americanness.”

John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC, said that Otis’ comments pit racial minorities against each other.

“Otis’ statement is racist because it stereotypes and suggests others do not value family, work and education,” he told HuffPost.

Otis told HuffPost in an email that he is “honored to have been selected by the President for this nomination” but declined to comment on criticisms regarding his previous comments.

Yang also added that Otis’ use of the term “Oriental,” — which former President Barack Obama had formally removed from federal law in 2016 — speaks volumes.

Ultimately, such beliefs would impede Otis’ ability to effectively serve on the commission, Yang said.The actress hilariously teased the bromance between her husband Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman on Thursday by jabbing at the hunky actors’ awkward pose in an Instagram photo.

AdvertisementA longtime personal assistant to President Donald Trump was reportedly fired and escorted out of the White House on Monday, with one report claiming the ouster was due to a criminal investigation.

John McEntee was unceremoniously removed from his position because the Department of Homeland Security is investigating him for “serious financial crimes,” CNN reported, citing an unidentified source familiar with his termination. The alleged crimes are said to not be related to Trump.

The Wall Street Journal, which was the first to break the news of McEntee’s ouster, reported that he was removed because of an “unspecified security issue,” citing an unidentified White House official.

McEntee wasn’t allowed to collect his belongings ― including his jacket ― before being escorted out, according to the Journal.

The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

McEntee previously served as an aide to Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, and the Trump campaign announced Tuesday that he will rejoin the organization as a senior adviser for campaign operations. He’ll work alongside Katrina Pierson, who served as the 2016 campaign’s national spokesperson and will now oversee the campaign’s national grassroots outreach.

If there was any issue with McEntee inside the White House, Trump’s campaign hasn’t acknowledged it.

“As we build out our operations for the 2018 mid-term elections and the 2020 reelection campaign, we are pleased to welcome back two outstanding members of our 2016 team,” Brad Parscale, the Trump for President campaign manager, said in a statement. “We need the help of proven leaders such as Katrina and John to promote the President’s growing portfolio of achievements across the country.”

News of McEntee’s reported removal came Tuesday morning, when Trump also announced he had moved to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. He said he had nominated Gina Haspel to be the new director of the CIA.

The news also came nearly a week after it was reported that several White House staffers were either terminated or reassigned because of issues related to their security clearances. More than 30 White House staffers were stripped of their top-level security clearances, pending the completion of a background check. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who is a senior Trump adviser, also had his clearance downgraded.

AdvertisementIn early January, a Tennessee pastor who stood accused of sexual assault received a standing ovation from members of his evangelical Christian congregation after confessing to a “sexual incident” with a woman 20 years before. Now, the woman who went public with her allegations against her former youth pastor is again speaking out about her experience, this time urging American churches to more fully reckon with their responsibility to sexual assault victims.

“We as a church, of all places, should be getting this right,” Jules Woodson said in a New York Times op-ed video published on Friday. “It’s unfathomable to me that the secular world, Hollywood, are taking a stand. The church should have been the first group to stand up and say, ‘We will not allow this.’”

Woodson came forward in January with allegations against her former youth pastor, Andy Savage. She claims that when she was 17 in 1998, Savage drove her to a private location after a church event in Texas and forced her to perform sexual acts. She said church leaders at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church (which later changed its name to StoneBridge Church) urged her to keep quiet and promised the church would take care of the matter internally.

Savage later moved to Memphis, where he eventually became a pastor at Highpoint Church.

After Woodson came forward with her story in January, Highpoint Church initially said that it had “total confidence in the redemptive process” Savage went through after he allegedly assaulted Woodson. Savage was placed on leave after the church received backlash in the national media ― one critic called the congregation’s response, which was streamed online, the standing ovation “heard round the world.” Savage said during his apology that he told Highpoint’s lead pastor about the incident before coming on board as staff.

The New York Times filmed Woodson’s reactions to a video recording of Savage delivering his apology at Highpoint Church. Woodson criticized the apology, pointing out that Savage called what happened to her a “sexual incident” and repeatedly referred to the fact that it happened decades ago.

“I was and remain very remorseful for the incident and deeply regret the pain I caused her and her family as well as the pain I caused the church and God’s kingdom,” Savage said during his apology. “My repentance over this sin 20 years ago was done believing that God’s forgiveness is greater than any sin. And I still believe that.”

Woodson was in tears as she spoke in the op-ed video about the alleged crime and her church’s response.

“I looked up to him. I trusted him,” Woodson said about Savage in the video. “What happened was a crime. This is not something that the church should handle internally.”

“I want our churches to change how they handle sexual assault,” she added. “Sexual assault in the church. It’s a crime, not just a sexual sin.”

Woodson’s words echo the reflections of other survivors of sexual abuse in Christian communities. Inspired by the Me Too movement, survivors have used the hashtag #ChurchToo to share stories of abuse that happens in church settings.

Hannah Paasch, one of the founders of #ChurchToo, claims that a culture of purity in evangelical church settings has created the ideal of a “gentle and quiet” woman who accept the authority and leadership of men.

“The stories that have poured in through the hashtag prove to me that the evangelical church, in its current iteration, actively supports the confessing abuser over the victim and, in the name of ‘having no appearance of evil,’ has managed to silence thousands of sexual and physical abuse allegations throughout the years,” Paasch wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost.

Historian Neil J. Young, who studies the religious right, wrote that evangelical churches often tend to place the abuser at the center of the story, making the priority “forgiveness for his sins rather than justice for her injury.”

“It is his words of confession and embarrassment, but also often rationalization, that a church body gathers together to hear on a Sunday morning, not her cries of rage and pain that they must confront,” Young wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost. “If #MeToo has been about breaking the silence, the evangelical response has been to allow the abuser’s voice to fill the void.”

Highpoint has initiated two investigations into how the church handled the allegations against Savage, and whether its current policies are sufficient to safeguard the safety of children. On March 4, the church released a statement saying that the investigation was “wrapping up” and that its initial findings “give us assurance that we can begin the long process of moving forward as a church.”

Highpoint did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Actor Chris Pine’s character in “A Wrinkle In Time” is reminding people of Gary Johnston, one of the puppet characters in the 2004 film “Team America.”

But many schools are seeking to discourage protest, and some have warned they will punish students for participating in the walkout. Threatened penalties vary, from suspensions to docked grades.

As students across the country, motivated by the Stoneman Douglas students-turned-activists, plan actions to advocate for gun control, the question of rights and punishment can become complicated.

A 1969 Supreme Court case, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, affirmed that students and teachers have a right to protest, unless schools can prove an act “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.”

“It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,” the justices wrote in favor of junior high and high school students suspended for wearing armbands protesting the Vietnam War.

But schools that typically impose penalties for missing class can still punish those who participate in Wednesday’s walkout. Georgetown University law professor Heidi Li Feldman told HuffPost that students should not expect “a guarantee that your school won’t sanction you,” but they cannot explicitly say that they are punishing students due to the gun violence walkout.

“There’s a lot of legal doctrine which protects speech, political speech in particular, against penalty,” Feldman said. “What they cannot do is penalize students for expressing a particular viewpoint.”

However, schools can place restrictions on protest if they deem it “too much of a disruption — it’s not an appropriate time, manner, or place,” she said.

Schools with a history of allowing administrators “to exercise a lot of discretion, case by case” in enforcing policy could find themselves in legal trouble, she said. For example, a school that usually allows a parental note to excuse an absence, but won’t on the day of the protest, may have a problem.

“If I were a lawyer advising a school district, I would say ... it’s not worth risking a claim that you’re infringing the First Amendment.”” - Heidi Li Feldman, Georgetown Law professor

Schools are in a stronger legal position if they enforce policies consistently, or “can give a good explanation of when they make exceptions,” Feldman said.

Students also plan a national walkout on April 20, the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.

Anticipating questions about students’ rights, the American Civil Liberties Union has put together training materials and other resources, pointing out that “the law in most places requires students to go to school,” so “schools can discipline you for missing class.”

The ACLU advised students to learn their school’s policies for missing class, and to monitor whether the rules “are being applied differently when it comes to your walkout.”

The high-profile walkout and attention from groups like the ACLU may make it unwise for schools to impose punishments, Feldman suggested.Michael Hari in a 2017 police mugshot. Michael Hari mugshot via The News Gazette

An Illinois contractor bidding to build President Donald Trump’s wall on the Mexican border was among three men arrested Tuesday in connection with the bombing of a mosque in Minnesota and the attempted bombing of a women’s health clinic in Illinois.

Michael B. Hari, 47, was arrested and charged Tuesday in federal court in lllinois with arson and possession of machine guns.

According to the complaint, Hari and two accomplices — 29-year-old Michael McWhorter and 22-year-old Joe Morris — were responsible for the bombing of a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota, on Aug. 5, 2017, and the attempted bombing of the Women’s Health Practice in Champaign, Illinois, on Nov. 7. All three are now facing federal arson charges.

Confidential informants told the FBI that Hari said he would pay McWhorter and Morris $18,000 for their participation in the mosque bombing, according to the FBI affidavit. All three men allegedly drove up to Minnesota in a rented truck for the attack.

Five parishioners were inside the mosque when it was bombed. No one was hurt. The attack, occurring at a time of rising anti-Muslim hate, garnered national headlines, especially after Trump’s apparent refusal to denounce it. (Trump’s then-adviser Sebastian Gorka defended the silence on the explosion, stating it might’ve been “faked by the left.”)

The affidavit states that McWhorter later confessed to the FBI that he, Hari and Morris bombed the mosque to “scare [Muslims] out of the country” because they think they push their beliefs on non-Muslims. McWhorter said the bombing was mostly to say, “Hey, you’re not welcome here, get the fuck out.”



The bomb thrown into the women’s health clinic in Illinois did not detonate. The criminal complaint notes that the clinic provided abortions.

Hari is a former sheriff’s deputy who lives in Charence, Illinois, where he ran Crisis Resolution Security Services Inc., which had put in a bid for Trump’s border wall.

In a YouTube video promoting the proposal, a narrator says the wall would be “culturally significant, a powerful architectural statement of the determination of the American people to defend their nation and its Anglo-Saxon heritage, western culture, and English language” and would defend “our way of life from other people who have different value systems.”

“Build that wall. Make America great again,” the narrator states.

His border wall proposal called for placing a pedestrian roadway on top of the wall in an effort to make it a tourist attraction, like the Great Wall of China. They called it the Great Western International Border Wall.

“People can go up there, walk it or bicycle it,” Hari told the Chicago Tribune last year. “We’re probably the only ones who have submitted a proposal making it recreational.”

The website of Hari’s company warned of the threat of Muslims in America. “Since the 9/11 attacks, 1.6 million Muslims have been admitted to the United States, 26% of Muslims in the US are homegrown converts, and 80% of Muslim prison inmates converted in prison,” the website claimed. “While many Muslims are peaceful people, only a small percentage of troublemakers will result in many incidents with a growing population of about 2.5 million Muslims total.” It linked to the conspiracy website formerly known as World Net Daily.

The company, which claims to sell evacuation services at a cost of $3,995 for a 10-year period, also names riots and protests on its page about threats, including unrest in Berkeley, California, when right-wing activist Milo Yiannopoulos was due to speak and the anti-Trump protests leading up to his inauguration.

Madihha Ahussain, special counsel for anti-Muslim bigotry at Muslim Advocates, said the group could not ignore the context surrounding the attack.

“Anti-Muslim rhetoric from the administration and public officials has led to an unprecedented spike in hate violence against Muslims and mosque attacks, just like this one,” he said. “When the administration fails to swiftly condemn the bombing of a house of worship and instead makes excuses for the perpetrators, it sends a clear and unmistakable statement to the nation that these bombers ― whoever they are ― have a friend in the White House.”

Hari has an extensive criminal record. He was found guilty of child abduction in 2006 after he took his daughters to Central America because he worried he’d lose custody. He was tracked down by an investigator for the “Dr. Phil” show and was later sentenced to 30 months of probation.

On Tuesday, a federal judge assigned Hari a federal public defender and ordered him detained.
