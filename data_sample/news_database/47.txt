Donald Trump’s first wife has an observation to share with the world: Not many men “can keep their zippers up.”

Ivana Trump divorced her husband in 1992 after 15 years of marriage when she discovered he was cheating on her with his soon-to-be-second wife, Marla Maples. He later married Melania in 2005.

As for how she feels about her ex now, Ivana Trump told The New York Post’s Page Six Saturday that The Donald probably shouldn’t run for re-election — but play golf instead because she thinks he has been surprised by the demands of the job.

“He has a good life, and he has everything ... maybe he should just go and play golf,” she said. “I don’t think he knew how much is involved being the president. It’s so [much] information; you have to know the whole world.”

In another pressing family matter, Trump said she was upset to learn of eldest son Donald Trump Jr.’s possible affair with pop star Aubrey O’Day, whom he met on the set of his dad’s reality show “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2011. His wife, Vanessa Trump, filed for divorce last month. Neither Donald Jr. nor O’Day have confirmed that they had an affair.

Ivana called it “distressing because I’ve been there.” But she added: “Who am I to judge? It’s a long time ago now, so I think Vanessa knew it all along and maybe she just couldn’t get over the hurt to forgive him. But I honestly don’t know that many men who can keep their zippers up.”

Trump said she believes Donald Jr. won’t have any trouble finding another “girl” because he’s a “good-looking guy” and “successful.” But Vanessa, not so much.

“Maybe Vanessa might have a little problem because she was five kids,” said Trump, who failed to note the children are also her son’s. “Who is going to date and marry the woman who has five children?”

Ivana told Page Six she feels bad for the first lady amid continuing news of the Stormy Daniels saga.“We want to make everyone aware of a student’s social media post that has caused a very concerning situation. It involves one of our seniors and his ‘promposal’ to another student.

“It was racial in nature and administration became aware of it last night. Many who saw the post are understandably upset with its contents as well as the subsequent commentary to the post. Riverview High School absolutely does not condone or support the message conveyed in this post.”Actress Zendaya spoke on a panel during Beautycon Festival in New York City, on April 22, 2018.

Zendaya knows how important it is to use your privilege for good.

The singer and actress stopped by Beautycon Festival in New York City on Sunday to discuss beauty standards and representation. Zendaya, 21, dropped some serious knowledge during her discussion with Uber’s chief brand officer, Bozoma Saint John, and called out colorism in the entertainment industry.

“As a black woman, as a light-skinned black woman, it’s important that I’m using my privilege, my platform to show you how much beauty there is in the African-American community,” she said. “I am Hollywood’s, I guess you could say, acceptable version of a black girl and that has to change.”

Her comments were met with applause from the crowd at the Javitz Center in Manhattan.

“We’re vastly too beautiful and too interesting for me to just be the only representation of that,” Zendaya continued. “What I’m saying, it’s about creating those opportunities, sometimes. You have to create those paths. And that’s with anything, Hollywood, art, whatever.”

While Hollywood has come a long way in a short period (think “Get Out” and “Black Panther”), there’s still a lot of progress to be made. According to an analysis done by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, 68 percent of all female characters in the top 100 films of 2017 were white, while only 7 percent were black. Additionally, black actresses and actresses of color are often confined to stricter archetypes because they have to consistently combat colorism in the industry.

This isn’t the first time Zendaya has addressed the lack of diversity among actresses of color on-screen. In a June 2016 cover story for Cosmopolitan, she stressed how important it is for her to understand her privilege as a light-skinned black woman.Give me a T-H-A-N-O-S! What does that spell?

Meh, never mind. It doesn’t really matter now anyway.

Crazy theories about “Avengers: Infinity War” keep cropping up, since so little is actually known about the movie. Some people think all the dead characters are coming back, while others speculate that all the past villains could make an appearance.

But in the lead-up to the new movie, one theory has risen above the rest: The name of the main villain, Thanos, has been secretly revealing the locations of the infinity stones.

There are six infinity stones. There are six letters in Thanos’ name. Thanos is after the infinity stones. It just makes sense.

It even seems to line up, as Nerdist laid out:

T is for Tesseract, the Space Stone

A is for Aether, the Reality Stone

N is for Necklace, the Time Stone

O is for Orb, the Power Stone

S is for Loki’s Scepter, the Mind Stone

Fans have been using this theory to try to figure out the location of the final missing infinity stone, the soul stone. The popular guesses are that the H may stand for Idris Elba’s character, Heimdall, or that N stands for Nebula rather than Necklace. Nebula is one of Thanos’ daughters, a character who plays a big role in the “Infinity Gauntlet” comic that served as an inspiration for the movie.

HuffPost’s Leigh Blickley asked Karen Gillan, who plays Nebula, for her thoughts over the weekend, and she was intriguingly vague.

“I can’t say whether that’s going to happen,” Gillan said of the theory. “Nebula has a significant role and has a lot of stuff to do because her father is Thanos, who is the villain of the movies. She has some serious daddy issues with him, so she has a lot to confront.”

That made it sound to us like the theory might be right. But then I talked to “Avengers: Infinity War” writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on Sunday.

While reflecting on the wildest theories he has heard, McFeely settled on one that was “obviously crazy.” You guessed it: spelling out T-H-A-N-O-S to reveal the locations of the stones.

And just like that, the theory was O-V-E-R.

“That seems fairly random,” McFeely said.

“I don’t think that’s how you go about writing a good script,” Markus added.

“It really isn’t,” McFeely agreed, laughing and imagining what that writing process would look like. ”‘You know, it’d be great to put the soul stone here but it’s not an O,’ or whatever the hell it is.”

“We need an O planet,” Markus joked.

Look, Nebula could still have something to do with the soul stone. After all, Gillan confirmed she has a “significant” role. But it won’t have anything to do with spelling out her dad’s name.

The writers also set us straight on some other rumors and theories.

There won’t be a Sherlock Holmes joke.

It doesn’t take a detective to figure out there was the opportunity for a great Sherlock Holmes joke in “Infinity War”: Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch appear together in scenes, and both actors have played popular versions of the character in recent years.

Unfortunately, we’re not going to see that in “Infinity War.”

“I don’t want to ruin people’s fun, but the idea is that that’s a meta joke, right?” McFeely said. “That’s a joke that those two guys are actors and have careers outside of these movies. For our purposes, they’re not actors, and they don’t have careers outside of these movies.”

“Now both Watsons [Martin Freeman and Jude Law] are in the MCU too, so it’s still some sort of situation,” Markus added, referring to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Could Ant-Man secretly be in other Marvel movies? Maybe.

Another theory that’s been floating around is that Ant-Man has possibly secretly been in all the Marvel movies from the start, just miniaturized.

“Even if I could confirm or deny it, how could I confirm or deny it?” McFeely joked.

Both Markus and McFeely speculated that even if Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) was originally out there as Ant-Man, he still isn’t old enough to be in “Captain America: The First Avenger.”

So it’s possible Ant-Man has made appearances, but maybe he hasn’t been in all the movies.

Loki probably didn’t intentionally lose in the first “Avengers.”

Marvel and Disney

One theory says Loki (Tom Hiddleston) may have intentionally failed in his plan to take over Earth in the first “Avengers” movie.

The idea is that Loki always wanted to take over Asgard. Failing on Earth was his way to be taken back there by his brother. He eventually takes over at the end of “Thor: The Dark World.”

The writers were skeptical about that theory, too.

“It sounds like a long and inefficient plan,” Markus said. “He could’ve just gone to Asgard.”

Sure, maybe. But Loki is all about theatrics, and we wouldn’t have had scenes like this if he went straight to Asgard:

He may not get a crown, but Loki at least deserves an Oscar.Westend61 via Getty Images

On Thursday, the 20-year-old resident of Grand Junction, Colorado, was bitten by a shark while boogie-boarding off the island of Kauai, Hawaii.

This is less than a year after McWilliams was attacked by a 300-pound black bear while camping in Boulder County, Colorado, according to CBS Denver.

McWilliams was about 30 yards from shore when he was knocked off his board and suddenly felt a searing pain in his right leg.

“At first I panicked,” he told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “I didn’t know if I lost half my leg or what.”

McWilliams said he believes the animal that attacked him was a 6- to 8-foot tiger shark — he saw the stripes — and he kicked it hard before attempting to swim to shore.

“That was the scariest part. I didn’t know where the shark was, and I didn’t know if he would come after me again,” he told the paper.

McWilliams did make it to shore where bystanders helped him get to an emergency room.

Although the injury wasn’t life-threatening, McWilliams suffered some deep cuts based on the photos he posted on Facebook.

Although an experience like that might make some afraid of future ocean swims, McWilliams was mad the cuts kept him from boogie-boarding.

“I’m just mad that I can’t get back in the water for a couple days,” McWilliams told Hawaiian TV station KGMB.

Of course, McWilliams is almost used to being attacked by large creatures with big teeth after his bear encounter last year.

“The bear grabbed the back of my head and started pulling me and I was fighting back as best as I could,” he said. “It dropped me and stomped on me a little bit, and I was able to get back to the group and they scared it away.”

Oh, and three years ago, he was bitten by a rattlesnake while hiking in Utah.

Despite being a magnet for animal attacks, McWilliams holds no grudge: He just figures he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.The actress and Goop guru told The Sunday Times that her fiance, writer-director Brad Falchuk, is taking her places that she’s never gone.

“Now, for the first time, I feel I’m in an adult relationship that is sometimes uncomfortable, because he sort of demands a certain level of intimacy and communication that I haven’t been held to before,” she told couples counselor Esther Perel in an interview. “What came up in the first couple of years of our relationship was how incapable I was in this realm, how I feared intimacy and communication.”

The Oscar winner, of course, was famously involved with Pitt and Affleck before her 10-years-plus marriage to Coldplay frontman Martin, which resulted in two children and a “conscious uncoupling.” She announced her engagement to Falchuk in January, more than three years after they met when Paltrow did a guest arc on “Glee.”

Discussing no man in particular, Paltrow told the therapist: “In the past, I’ve been in relationships with men who had intimacy issues, so I could be, like, ‘I’m fine, I’m ready to do this,’ and let myself think he’s the one with the problem. In a way, some of the relationships were designed to keep me out of intimacy.”

She continued: “I had two typical types of relationships: one where I was constantly chasing and trying to win someone over, and one where I was put off by the person’s capacity for the relationship ― and those relationships were very short-lived.”

Check out the full interview at The Sunday Times.“Westworld” star Thandie Newton said it was “very painful” to be excluded from Hollywood’s Time’s Up movement after years of speaking out against a casting director who sexually abused her.

“When Time’s Up was put together, to not be invited to be a part of it, was very, very painful,” Newton told Australia’s Herald Sun newspaper. “It’s hard for me, as someone who has been talking about it for a long time. ... It’s lonely.”

Newton, who plays the renegade robot sex worker Maeve in HBO’s “Westworld” series, said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph that she “wasn’t hot enough” or “mainstream enough” to be asked to join Time’s Up, the Hollywood campaign against workplace harassment and inequality. She speculated she was shunned because she wasn’t at this year’s Oscars, “even though I am having a renaissance in my career.”

Newton talked about her experience with sexual abuse in an interview with W magazine in July 2016. She told the story to help others, she said in her interview with the Telegraph.

“I felt if there was one girl whose family was thinking about putting their child into show business, that would help them decide. That was all I cared about,” she said.

Newton told W that “a director, on a callback, had a camera shooting up my skirt and asked me to touch my tits and think about the guy making love to me in the scene.” She continued: “I thought, ‘Ok, this is a little weird,’ but there was a female casting director in the room and I’d done weird stuff before so I did it.”

Some years later, Newton said she learned “the director was showing that audition tape to his friends after poker games at his house. And they would all get off on it.”

“I was so so naïve when I started out and I realize now that we have to prepare our kids— I’ve got two beautiful daughters, one is 16 one is 11,” she told W.

“So many people in our business, they don’t want to be the ones to say something that’s a bum out because then they become associated with a bum out and nobody wants to read about so-and-so because they’re always blabbering on about a bum out, but one person will read this and it will stop them getting sexually abused by a director. That’s the person I’m interested in.”One of the 700 movies and TV shows that Netflix still has in its pipeline includes a modern retelling of The Hunchback of Notre Dame from Idris Elba.

The “Avengers: Infinity War” actor will star, direct and produce the movie for the streaming service, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Based on a script by Michael Mitnick, the film is being described as “sonic and musical experience” and will feature an original score.

Victor Hugo’s classic French novel has seen many screen adaptations, but none more popular than Disney’s 1996 animated film. A darker entry in the Disney canon, the film introduced the story of Quasimodo, a hunchbacked bell-ringer, who falls in love with the gypsy Esmeralda to a whole new generation.

Elba has struck gold with Netflix before, earning critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for his role in “Beasts of No Nation.” He’s also set to star and executive produce the upcoming comedy “Turn Up Charlie” about a struggling DJ.

The “Luther” actor has stepped behind the camera before, making his feature directorial debut earlier this year with “Yardie,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

And while he has received more attention for his filmmaking, Elba is also a rapper and DJ, most recently making an appearance on Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ album “This Unruly Mess I’ve Made.”Macaulay Culkin appears on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show." Michael Rozman/Warner Bros

Leave Macaulay Culkin alone, ya filthy animals.

The ’90s child star turned self-proclaimed “world-famous recluse” made a rare appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Monday. Culkin was there to talk about his lifestyle brand ― yes, Kevin McCallister has a lifestyle brand ― but, of course, all roads lead to “Home Alone.”

Culkin revealed that he won’t watch the classic film anymore, or do “the face” upon request (don’t even think of asking, OK?) after years of being hounded in public.

“I’ve been there, done that already. I’m 37, OK? OK, Mom?” he joked.

The last time he watched the film was for the taping of a DVD commentary track on the 15th anniversary edition.

The actor described his celebrity as both a “curse and blessing,” saying that while he’s only acted sporadically over the last two decades, people still approach him all the time. He actually avoids going out in public during Christmastime, so he won’t come face to face with fans of the “Home Alone” franchise.

“It’s my season,” Culkin said. “It’s Macaulay season. I try to go out less and less around that time of year.”

Around 1994, Culkin took an extended break from Hollywood at age 14 to attend high school and attempt to have a normal adolescence.

“I was tired of it, to be honest. I did like 14 movies in six years or something like that,” he said. “I was away from home a lot. I was away from school. I needed something else. … It was great to be around people my own age for once. … It was the smartest thing I could have possibly done was to take eight years off.”

While child superstardom has certainly complicated life for Culkin, it has allowed him to pursue other interests. He was the lead vocalist of a comedy rock band thanks to the Hollywood payday.

“I felt like some kid worked really, really hard and I inherited all of his money,” he explained. “It allows me to treat everything like a hobby.”It takes a big voice to cover a Beyoncé song.

On Sunday, it took three big voices from three little guys performing on the U.K. version of “Little Big Shots.”

The trio calling themselves the TNT Boys sang “Listen” and maybe Bey herself should hear this.

Francis Concepcion, Mackie Empuerto and Kiefer Sanchez were finalists on the Filipino amateur singing show “Tawag ng Tanghalan Kids,” according to ABS-CBN News. The trio had taken a shot at “Listen” previously on the Filipino comedy talk show “Gandang Gabi, Vice!” and also sang another cover of a Beyoncé song on “Little Big Shots” in the Philippines.

As for the trio’s latest performance, the U.K. show summed it up on Facebook: “GOOSEBUMPS.”Herb Green

Picture this: an 18-year-old Jerry Garcia strumming at a birthday party ― before the Grateful Dead, before fame, before the “Deadheads” came to be.

That’s what can be heard on “Trouble in Mind” and “All My Trials” ― two previously unreleased recordings believed to be Garcia’s earliest known recorded performances.

The tracks, premiering on HuffPost, feature Garcia and fellow singer/musician Robert Hunter playing at a 16th birthday party for their friend Brigid Meier in Menlo Park, California, on May 26, 1961. Meier’s father worked at the Stanford Research Institute and had access to their Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder. So, he captured a young, pre-psychedelic Garcia exploring folk music for one of the first times in front of an audience.

“The most remarkable thing about this is it’s a very intimate group. There’s probably about 10 or 15 people in the room,” author and historian Dennis McNally told HuffPost. “You got an 18-year-old kid... He semi-talked his way out of the Army... He had played a little electric guitar at a pickup band in high school, and then had learned fingerpicking from a friend of his while in the Army.”

“Not counting the high school stuff, you’re like four months into his serious practice of a guitar,” he went on. “Mostly he strums. But he does some fingerpicking.”

Garcia, of course, would make a career out of music ― playing in various groups and eventually forming the Grateful Dead in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the counterculture of the 1960s.

“As you listen to this and as you listen to people listen to him, you realize that at 18, he had this presence. People were just glued to him,” McNally said. “Even at 18, people are just attracted to him as a presence.”

The performance at Meier’s party will appear on the upcoming box set “Before the Dead” ― but we’re premiering two of the tracks here first.

“All My Trials” is a traditional song often associated with both the civil rights movement and Joan Baez, who included it on her debut album.

“Trouble in Mind” is a popular eight-bar blues song written by the jazz pianist Richard M. Jones.

As organ music played and mourners thumbed through their programs, Obama leaned over and appeared to say something to Trump. Both briefly smiled ― and now, that moment has gone viral on Twitter:

A new app aims to make dating in the digital age a little easier for the transgender community ― but its developers may need to reconsider some of its presentation before that can be successfully achieved.

Billed as “Tinder for trans people,” Transdr aims to help connect reliable partners and friends. At the same time, the app’s developers hope it will fill a long-existing void as a legitimate dating app focused exclusively on transgender users and trans-attracted people.

The app, which launched last month and is currently available for free, operates in a similar fashion to predecessors Tinder and Grindr. Users can swipe right or left on a profile depending on their level of interest, and if both users swipe right— indicating mutual interest — they can communicate with each other. There’s also a search feature that allows users to narrow their preferences.

Transdr’s co-founder Sean Kennedy described the app as “a new place for trans people who are looking for serious relationships.”

Transdr’s co-founder, Sean Kennedy, described the app as “a new place for trans people who are looking for serious relationships.” Transdr

As noble as Transdr’s aims may be, however, some of the app’s marketing relies on language many interpret as transphobic. After this story was first published, HuffPost readers flagged that the app included several derogatory terms such as “tranny” and “shemale” on its Apple Store landing page and its website.

A representative for Transdr told HuffPost in an email that such words were used “to improve the search ranking.”

“Those terms … were used for SEO purposes because a lot of people search [for] them every day,” the representative said. “We didn’t mean to offend people who care about this.”

The company is looking at updating its Apple Store description to remove the offending terms, they added, but the process may take some time since Apple needs to approve any changes.

Interestingly, Transdr arrives at a time when previously existing apps have already expanded their services to include trans users. In 2016, Tinder announced an update that made it possible for users to specify gender identities like “transgender,” “trans man,” “trans woman,” and “gender queer.”

Previously aimed at gay men, Grindr followed suit last November, offering users customizable gender identity and pronoun fields.

In spite of those efforts, questions about those apps’ inclusivity for all users remain. Last month, a transgender woman in Oregon reportedly filed a lawsuit against Tinder, arguing that her profile was removed from the app for “violating its terms of service” after she indicated that she was a “preop trans woman.”

Meanwhile, Craigslist shuttered its personals section in late March, removing yet another social networking resource for trans people.

“Life has been so hard for trans people because they have to overcome the social stigma of being transgender. When it comes to dating, it’s even harder for them,” Kennedy, who is based in Canada, said in an email statement. “They need a comfortable place to meet and date with other trans people without judgment.”Relatives of victims carry an injured man outside a hospital after a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, on April 22, 2018.

By Qadir Sediqi and Sayed Hassib

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a voter registration center in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday, killing at least 57 people and injuring more than 100, in the most serious attack yet on preparations for elections scheduled for October.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on a project of key importance to the credibility of President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which has been under international pressure to ensure long-delayed parliamentary polls take place this year.

Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said a bomber on foot approached the center where officials were issuing identity cards as part of the registration process for around 10 million voters across Afghanistan. Registration began this month.

President Ghani issued a statement condemning the attack and said it “cannot divert us from our aims or weaken this national democratic process”.

A spokesman for the ministry of public health said at least 57 people, including eight children, were confirmed dead and 119 wounded, but the total could still rise.

The explosion destroyed cars and shattered windows in nearby buildings, leaving rubble strewn across the blood-stained street.

It was the deadliest blast in Kabul since about 100 people were killed in January by a bomb concealed in an ambulance and it came after repeated warnings that militants could try to disrupt the election process.

Tadamichi Yamamoto, the senior United Nations official in Afghanistan, issued a statement condemning the attack.

“Compounding the callous disregard for the lives of civilians, the killing appears to be part of a wholly unacceptable effort by extremists to deter Afghan citizens from carrying out their constitutional right to take part in elections,” he said.

After weeks of relative calm, the blast took place in Dasht-e Barchi, an area of western Kabul inhabited by many members of the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority, which has been repeatedly hit by attacks claimed by Islamic State.

“There were women, children. Everyone had come to get their identity cards,” said Bashir Ahmad who had been near the blast, which occurred despite heightened security after the January attack.

According to U.N. figures, more than 750 people have been killed or maimed in suicide attacks and bombings by militant groups during the three months to March ahead of an expected start of the Taliban’s usual spring offensive.

BITTER REACTION

Afghanistan’s international partners have insisted that the elections should be held this year before a presidential vote due in 2019, although there has been widespread scepticism that they will go ahead.

More than 7,000 voter registration centers have been set up across Afghanistan to handle about 10 million registrations in a process that has been repeatedly disrupted by technical and organizational problems.

Officials had pledged tight security to ensure the process, which will be vital to ensuring a ballot broad-based enough to be accepted as legitimate, proceeded safely. But those caught by Sunday’s attack voiced frustration at what many Kabul residents see as government shortcomings in securing the capital.

“They should be keeping the country safe, if they can’t, someone else should be in their place,” said Sajeda, who was wounded in the blast along with three other members of her family as they lined up for their cards.

The voter registration process, designed to reduce the electoral fraud that has marred past ballots, began this month but there have already been several security incidents.

On Sunday, a roadside bomb near a registration center in the northern city of Pul-i Khumri killed six members of a family and wounded three, although there was no indication that the incident was directly linked to the Kabul attack.

Last week, two police officers in the eastern city of Jalalabad were killed outside a voter registration center, while a voter center in the central province of Ghor was burned down last week and electoral officials briefly abducted.

The vote could be postponed to next year if registration of voters, many of whom do not have national identity cards, is not completed before winter sets.

Parliament is still sitting three years after its term officially expired and further delays would seriously weaken already fragile confidence in the political system.

There was an additional scare on Sunday when a NATO military convoy in Kabul accidentally hit and injured a child and triggered a protest that police dispersed by firing into the air. A NATO spokesman said the child had been taken to hospital and was in a stable condition.The world’s oldest known person, a Japanese woman, has died at the age of 117.

Nabi Tajima died in a hospital Saturday on her native Kikai Island, one of Japan’s southernmost islands, located roughly 900 miles southeast of Tokyo, local media outlet Kyodo News reported. She had been hospitalized since January, according to the publication.

“She passed away as if falling asleep,” Tajima’s 65-year-old grandson Hiroyuki told Kyodo News. “As she had been a hard worker, I want to tell her ‘rest well.’”

Tajima reportedly had nine children ― seven sons and two daughters ― and at least 160 descendants. She claimed her secret to longevity was eating “delicious food” and sleeping well, reported The Washington Post.

Born on Aug. 4, 1900, Tajima was the last known person born in the 19th century, which includes the years between Jan. 1, 1801 and Dec. 31, 1900. The same year she was born marked the second iteration of the modern Olympic Games. She was born roughly 14 years before the start of World War I and had just turned 45 when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan during World War II.

Tajima was one of just 37 living supercentenarians ― people who are at least 110 years old. Nearly half of the world’s remaining supercentenarians were born in and live in Japan, according to the Gerontology Research Group.

Retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) could muster up only lukewarm praise for his party’s leading contender to replace him in November’s election, and again offered kind words for the main Democratic candidate.

“I’m supporting the nominee,” Corker said of Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “I have worked with the nominee for some time. And I don’t know what else to say.”

After Corker chose not to seek a third term this year. Blackburn quickly declared her candidacy and is expected to win the GOP’s Aug. 2 primary. The expected Democratic nominee is former Gov. Phil Bredesen.

Corker recently found himself in a bit of hot water after praising Bredesen and saying he’s “got real appeal.”

“He was a very good mayor [of Nashville], a very good governor, a very good business person,” Corker told reporters last week. “Look, I’m not going to campaign against someone who I’ve been friends with and worked with.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later pulled Corker aside and told him his comments risked the party losing its thin majority in the chamber in November, according to The Washington Post.

And a day after Corker’s comments, President Donald Trump tweeted his support of Blackburn.

.@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2018

On Sunday, Corker said he has donated to and intends to vote for Blackburn, but he again said he likes Bredesen.

“Look, I have sent the maximum contribution to the Republican nominee on our side. I have said I’m going to plan to vote for this person,” he said. “I was in a long meeting where ... [reporters] were asking me about Gov. Bredesen. He is my friend. I’m not going to campaign against him, but I am supporting our nominee.”

When asked why Blackburn would be better for the state than Bredesen, all he said was that she is, at the end of the day, a Republican.

AdvertisementStreaming service Netflix has been looking to buy its own series of movie theaters, according to The Los Angeles Times.

The newspaper, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that the company attempted to reach a deal with L.A.-based Landmark theaters, but negotiations went south because Netflix believed the asking price was too high.

Why the streaming giant would need to buy theaters may have something to do with its strained relationship with the Cannes Film Festival.

Netflix, still looking to be seen as a legitimate filmmaking entity, pulled out of Cannes this year after the festival decided movies without theater distribution in France would not be allowed to compete for prizes. This continues a storied war between the streaming service and the French festival.

The Netflix original film “Okja” was featured at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017, but when the film was shown, the Netflix logo drew boos from the festival crowd.

Netflix original films have been gaining critical acclaim in recent years. “Mudbound” received four 2018 Oscar nominations and “Icarus,” a film about the doping scandal surrounding Russian Olympic athletes, won this year’s Oscar for best documentary.

Mitt Romney failed to secure the Utah Senate Republican nomination outright at a party gathering over the weekend and must run in a June 26 primary.

The 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump to replace retiring Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, fell short of the 60 percent needed to clinch the nomination at the Utah Republican Convention and will face state Rep. Mike Kennedy in the primary.

Kennedy edged Romney in the vote among convention delegates, 51 percent to 49 percent, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. But the convention result is often a poor indicator of the preferences among the state’s Republican rank and file. In 2012, for example, Hatch similarly failed to clinch the nomination outright but went on to win his primary by 30 percentage points.

Romney sought to put a positive spin on the convention vote and the need for a primary.

“This is terrific for the people of Utah, and I really want to thank the delegates who stayed so late to give me the kind of boost that I got here,” he said after the vote. “We’re going to have a good primary.”

The former governor of Massachusetts long has had a home in Utah and is popular in the state. He remains expected to cruise to victory ― both in the primary and the general election.

Although Romney accepted Trump’s endorsement, he had attacked him as a “phony” and “fraud” during the 2016 presidential campaign. Romney was especially critical of Trump’s negative rhetoric about immigrants.

On Saturday, Romney said he’s not ready to commit to endorsing Trump for re-election in 2020, calling that a decision he would make “down the road.”

“As a person of political experience, if I endorse someone, I’ll want to know what’s in it for Utah and what help would he provide for us on key priorities in Utah,” Romney told CNN.Church leaders Joshua Wright, Donald Jackson and William Wright have been charged with child abuse and other sex offenses. Prince Georges County Police

Police in Maryland have charged three church leaders with sexually abusing four teenage girls over a decade ago who were enrolled in a faith-based program meant to help at-risk youth.

Prince George’s County detectives have identified the suspects on Wednesday as Oxon Hill Assembly of Jesus Christ head pastor Joshua Wright, his son and church minister William Wright, and the elder Wright’s son-in-law and church member Donald Jackson. All three men have been charged with child abuse and various other sex offenses.

The men allegedly abused the teens between 2001 and 2008, when the victims were between 15 and 18 years old. The women took their stories of abuse to police as adults.

The victims were placed under the suspects’ care as part of a church-run program called Children Having Overcoming Power (CHOP) that dissolved in 2011. It was designed to provide troubled teens with safe living accommodations in church members’ houses.

The police report alleges that the suspects abused the victims in different locations, including the suspects’ homes, various parks and the church itself.

Oxon Hill Assembly of Jesus Christ and Joshua Wright’s lawyer did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. William Wright’s lawyer, Tom Mooney, declined to comment. The District Court of Maryland’s website has not yet listed a lawyer for Jackson.

Jackson is a United States Capitol Police officer. The USCP told HuffPost that the department has placed him on “non-duty status.”Indie pop singer-songwriter Natti Vogel hopes his new video, “Brown Rice,” will encourage viewers to “empathize with some real, modern-day pitfalls” of queer life.

Vogel’s video, viewed above, is at once steamy and melancholic. It follows a gay character (played by Matthew Wilkas) who, on the surface, has it all: chiseled good looks, an active lifestyle and a lively social media presence.

Far from the gaze of Instagram, however, Wilkas’ character struggles to fill an emotional void. He finds a temporary escape from his depression through a night of drugs and casual sex with a stranger (adult film star Tegan Zayne). At the video’s conclusion, he locks eyes with Vogel in an empty Manhattan nightclub, and the two men share a moment of solidarity.

Released March 29, “Brown Rice” arrives at a prolific time for Vogel who, until now, had been known primarily on New York’s indie music circuit, with performances at the Brooklyn Museum and National Sawdust. The video is the third to be released from his six-track debut EP, “Serving Body,” and had racked up more than 40,000 views as of Sunday afternoon. (By comparison, the clip for the catchy second single, “I Don’t Want To Find The One,” had received just over 1,100.)

Much of the buzz on “Brown Rice” has focused on Wilkas’ presence. The actor, whose credits include 2012’s “Gayby” and HBO’s “Looking,” has become a media fixture in recent weeks due in part to his relationship with Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthy. Footage of the two men sharing a kiss during the Winter Games made global headlines and received praise from LGBTQ rights advocates.

Though grateful that Wilkas’ rising star has boosted interest in “Brown Rice,” Vogel is hopeful that discerning viewers will see the video as an “unfiltered and uncompressed” portrait of the queer “emotional experience” rather than simply a serving of beefcake.

“I want the general audience to feel the desperation of needing to be approved of and to question the lengths they are willing to go to gain that approval at the expense of whatever it is that might make them amazing to begin with,” the singer told HuffPost. He added that he wrote the song about “a super-athletic, super-arrogant ex I never felt good enough for.”

“I want audiences to actively yearn for whatever parts of themselves that they’ve been suppressing,” he said.

To help execute his vision, Vogel tapped director Eamon Foley, a veteran Broadway performer and choreographer who recently co-founded a production company called Grind Arts.

“I felt the story for years emotionally, as I think most of us gay men have, and we just had to express it artistically,” Vogel said of his "Brown Rice" video. Haley Varacallo

Calling Vogel’s song “haunting and gorgeous,” Foley aimed to paint a picture of “a man chasing a thrill or some sort of climax, but falling short of satisfaction.” Still, he stressed that “Brown Rice” isn’t meant to “judge a certain subset of gay men or cast a shameful light on certain actions.”

“I wanted everyone to be able to find themselves in this character, and question if what consumes them is leading them towards happiness,” he said. “Even the man who looks like he has it all with his 100K followers and free underwear feels inadequate ... [Many] gay men are organizing their lives around an unachievable ideal that won’t take care of them in their old age.”

Ultimately, Vogel said he hopes to portray other aspects of queer life in his work, noting, “It’s important that we not tone our truth down for anyone.”

“I felt the story for years emotionally, as I think most of us gay men have, and we just had to express it artistically,” he said. “We’ve been pressured, threatened, forced, advised to do that our whole lives and it hasn’t worked ― it’s left us with a ton of anxiety and loneliness.”Twitter was incensed Saturday after Donald Trump used Barbara Bush’s funeral as an opportunity to tout his private business in a tweet, dubbing his Mar-a-Lago golf resort the “Southern White House.”

Trump noted that he would be watching Bush’s funeral — on TV — at his golf resort.

The latest “southern” title of Trump’s private “White House” was particularly galling to many who called it a “dog whistle” to racists. Trump used to refer to Mar-a-Lago as the “Winter White House.” The “Southern White House” was where Confederate president Jefferson Davis lived during the Civil War.

Angry tweets also pointed out that it’s the only “White House” where taxpayers have to either pay a $200,000 membership fee to visit it or know a member who can afford those fees to invite them to visit.

There were also the usual complaints about Trump mixing his private businesses with his role as president — and traveling almost weekly to Mar-a-Lago and boosting its reputation on the taxpayer dime.

This reference to the "Southern White House" is part of the campaign to monetize the presidency.

Trump used to slam Barack Obama for wasting time playing golf as president. But Trump has spent far more time on a golf course, according to several estimates, at an additional added cost of millions of dollars.

He has played golf at one of his properties every 5.1 days — 89 rounds — since his inauguration, according to The Washington Post. If Trump didn’t play again until mid-November 2019, he would finally match Obama’s playing time his entire first term, according to the Post.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has warned the United States not to pull out of the nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama's administration. Resul Rehimov/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

Iran’s top diplomat warned President Donald Trump to not pull out of the 2015 nuclear agreement, saying the United States would suffer extremely negative consequences if it did so.

“If the decision comes from President Trump to officially withdraw from the deal, then Iran will take decisions that have been provided for under the [agreement] ... as the United States has a habit of saying, ‘all options are on the table,’” The country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in an interviews on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday.

The Iran nuclear deal was President Barack Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement and is therefore, not surprisingly, reviled by Trump. During the presidential campaign, he called it “the highest level of incompetence.”

Trump, so far, has not pulled out of the deal, but he has given himself a May 12 deadline to either waive sanctions against Iran, as outlined in the deal, or to leave it. Five other countries ― the U.K., Russia, France, China and Germany ― are also parties to the agreement.

Zarif said the United States would suffer a serious blow to its international standing if it doesn’t hold up its end of the bargain because it would show that the country can’t be trusted.

“It will lead to U.S. isolation in the international community,” Zarif said. “The reason that President Trump has not withdrawn from the deal over the past 15 months, in spite of the fact that he did not like the deal, has been the fact that everybody has advised the administration that this is not a bilateral agreement between Iran and the United States, and withdrawing from it would be seen by the international community as an indication that the United States is not a reliable partner.”

“It would not be pleasant for the United States ― the reaction of the international community, and as I said Iran has many options and those options are not pleasant,” he added.”

Providing relief for Iran from crippling economic sanctions is central to the deal. In return, Iran promised to halt its nuclear program. But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that even if Trump refuses to waive the sanctions for Iran next month, that somehow doesn’t necessarily mean the deal will collapse.

Another option, as Trump sees it, is to renegotiate the terms of the deal. The administration may try to get its European allies to at least commit to changing the deal over the time, in return for the United States sticking with it.

Britain, France and Germany are looking at imposing new European sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles program and its role in the Syrian conflict in an attempt to keep Trump from pulling out.

On Sunday, Zarif said that any such side agreement between the other nations would be unacceptable to Iran.

“What is important is for the Europeans to bring the United States into compliance because Iran has been in compliance with the deal,” he said. “It’s been the United States that has failed to comply ... President Trump has made it very clear that it is trying to dissuade our economic partners from engaging with Iran and that’s a clear violation of the deal.”

Trump recently nominated Mike Pompeo, who was serving as his CIA director, to be his new secretary of state. Pompeo is expected to be more in line with Trump on Iran than was his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. He recently said he wanted to “fix” the nuclear agreement.

International experts, as well as U.S. national security officials, have said Iran is complying with the deal ― even though it continues to pursue other policies that the U.S. administration believes pose a threat.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he expects that Trump will pull out of the deal, unless something changes.Pennsylvania state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R) took aim at his Democratic colleagues, whom he deemed “liberal losers,” in a blistering, eyebrow-raising Facebook post on Friday.

An outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ causes, Metcalfe had particularly harsh words for Democratic Rep. Brian Sims, whom he’s been clashing with for years.

In the post, he blasted Sims ― who became his state’s first openly gay elected state legislator in 2012 ― as a “lying homosexual.”

Metcalfe didn’t back down from his comments in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday. He told the AP he mentioned Sims’ sexuality because he believes being gay is “immoral behavior.”

On Friday, Sims shot back at Metcalfe with a cheeky tweet inspired by an iconic moment in “Mean Girls.”

My most infamously bigoted colleague, Rep. Daryl Metcalfe took to his “burn book” to attack my colleagues of color and myself call me a “lying homosexual.” I could use your help as I go up against this type of blatant homophobia and bigotry in the Capital. https://t.co/Oc7iLDN2qt pic.twitter.com/FVC4dBgbuY — Brian Sims (@BrianSimsPA) April 20, 2018

In a lengthier Facebook post Saturday, he deemed Metcalfe “a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, bigot.”

“Those of us in Pennsylvania have known this for a long time,” he wrote. “All of those words have definitions. His behavior, his public statements, and his legislation over the years all clearly rise to the level of those definitions.”

Metcalfe’s war of words with Sims has been ongoing for years. In 2013, he invoked a legislative rule to keep Sims from talking about same-sex marriage, because he believed the representative’s words would have been “an open rebellion against Almighty God and God’s word.”

In July of last year, Metcalfe complained that Sims called him an “ignorant, racist bigot” after a legislative dispute. In a YouTube video titled “The Intolerant Left,” Metcalfe also referred to a “crimson-faced and emotionally unhinged” lawmaker who he later identified as Sims.

Metcalfe found himself in hot water once again last December when he accosted another Democratic lawmaker with homophobic language for tapping him on his arm.Famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took a moment on Earth Day to remind those calling for the planet’s “saving” to revise their message.

The author, podcast host and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History tweeted the advice on Sunday.

The perennial cry to “Save Earth" is odd. Planet Earth survives massive asteroid strikes -- it'll survive anything we throw at it. But Life on Earth will not. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 22, 2018

His message is a familiar one (for scientists and George Carlin fans alike). But as science communications guru Aaron Huertas put it, “Save the Planet” has a better ring to it than the reality.

Soon after, climate scientist Gavin Schmidt offered a solution:Ever wanted to zoom near that central bulge in the Milky Way in the Sagittarius constellation where stars are born? NASA has almost made it possible thanks to the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. As a kind of a 28th Hubble birthday gift for all of us, the space agency has posted astounding videos and photos of what’s known as the Lagoon Nebula.

The main video takes viewers from far away into the very heart of the massive, colorful nebula, what NASA calls a “raucous star nursery full of birth and destruction,” 4,000 light-years away from Earth.

At the Lagoon Nebula’s heart is a massive “young” star (the million-year-old Hershel 36), 200,000 times brighter and eight times hotter than Earth’s sun. It roils the region with ultraviolet radiation and winds carving out an exploding, undulating “fantasy landscape of ridges, cavities, and mountains of gas and dust,” gushes NASA.

The space agency has also released a video that dissolves to an infrared version that cuts through gas and dust to reveal a multitude of stars:

This is an imagined three-dimensional flight across the core of the Lagoon Nebula using images from Hubble:

Hubble was launched April 24, 1990, aboard the space shuttle Discovery and was a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. Once a year the telescope takes a break from its assigned observations to take a detailed image of a particular spot of the cosmos.

The Hubble “has offered a new view of the universe and has reached and surpassed all expectations for a remarkable 28 years,” said NASA and the ESA. The telescope has “revolutionized almost every area of observational astronomy.”Former presidents and first ladies came together Saturday to honor the life of former first lady Barbara Bush, who died Tuesday at the age of 92.

President Donald Trump did not attend the funeral, in which some 1,500 mourners gathered to pay their respects. The White House announced his absence from the ceremony earlier this week. According to the statement, the move was intended to respect the Bush family and “avoid distractions” that might be caused by his security detail.
