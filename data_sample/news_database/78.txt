Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced hours of questioning Tuesday before Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees about Cambridge Analytica, which used personal data for its political strategies, and other security concerns on the social network.

Throughout the hours of grilling, several senators alluded to Facebook’s inscrutable and complex user agreement, arguing that the text is written so that the average user likely does not understand how their data is being used by the company. But no one put it as bluntly as Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).

“Your user agreement sucks,” Kennedy said to Zuckerberg. “The purpose of that user agreement is to cover Facebook’s rear end. It’s not to inform your users about their rights. Now, you know that and I know that.”

The senator then urged the Facebook CEO to “go back home and rewrite it.”

He added, “Tell your $1,200-an-hour lawyers ― no disrespect, they’re good ― but tell them you want them written in English, in non-Swahili, so the average American can understand.”

Folks on Twitter noted Kennedy’s blunt delivery and also called him out for making a disparaging remark about Swahili to get his point across.

I was totally with Senator Kennedy just now until he made a totally racial slur about #Facebook’s privacy policy needing to make sense and “not be in Swahili” 😩 #Zuckerberg @SenJohnKennedy — Lisa Rose (@ecotist) April 10, 2018

Senator Kennedy made an inappropriate "Swahili" wisecrack to #Zuckerberg. Pretty poor choice of punchlines from a Southern Republican. Seems like he wanted to go beyond the drawl and ensure that he gave us a full caricature. — Adam Best (@adamcbest) April 10, 2018

Did Sen. Kennedy just say "and not Swahili," so the basic American can "understand"? #Zuckerberg pic.twitter.com/FhlpfzvzoD — Taylor Barfield ❤ (@TaylorInChief) April 10, 2018

Though the questioning was tense, Zuckerberg and Kennedy shook hands following the hearing.The Florida school district that includes Parkland, the city where a mass shooting in February left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has decided not to arm its teachers.

Broward County Public Schools officials on Tuesday unanimously voted against participating in a program that would train some faculty members to carry guns.

The state legislature recently passed a school safety law that created the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program. The plan, named after the Stoneman Douglas football coach killed in Feb. 14 shooting, allocates $67 million for sheriff’s offices affiliated with participating school districts.

President Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have pushed for arming more teachers with guns in the wake of the Parkland shooting. But many gun safety advocates, including survivors of the Feb. 14 massacre, have railed against the idea.

“Teachers are meant to be educators,” Alfonso Calderon, a junior at Stoneman Douglas high school, told CNN in February. “They are meant to teach young minds how to work in the world. They are not meant to know how to carry AR-15s. They are not meant to know how to put on Kevlar vests for the other students or for themselves.”

School board officials are pushing for the $67 million to be redirected as additional funding for school resource officers, according to a statement released Tuesday by the school district.

“We should definitely launch a campaign to persuade the governor, for those districts who do not want to arm their employees, that they give us the money to keep kids safe in other ways,” school board member Robin Bartleman told CBS Miami.

Tuesday’s decision marks the second time the school board has voted on whether to arm teachers in the wake of the Parkland shooting. On March 6, the school board unanimously passed a resolution that opposes asking or incentivizing teachers to keep weapons in their classroom.TONIGHT: Stephen has a message for the FBI agents involved in raid on Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/PX3m12i7CT — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 11, 2018

Stephen Colbert suggested Tuesday night that the FBI raid on President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen is getting uncomfortably close to the Oval Office.

Jerry Brown said Wednesday he would accept federal funds to add hundreds of new members to the National Guard to support the state’s “ongoing program to combat transnational crime.” But he emphasized that the troops wouldn’t be enforcing federal immigration policies.

The announcement comes in response to President Donald Trump’s directive to the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to work with governors across the country to deploy National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

In a letter to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Brown said he would accept funding from the federal government to increase the state’s guard by some 400 troops. Of these new guard members, some would be stationed at the border, he said, while others would be deployed to the coast and other parts of California.

“Let’s be crystal clear on the scope of this mission,” he wrote. “This will not be a mission to build a new wall. It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life. And the California National Guard will not be enforcing federal immigration laws.”

It isn’t clear how many of the 400 would be deployed to the border. But Brown noted in his letter that the state currently has 250 personnel across the state, 55 of whom are stationed at the border, as a part of its program to combat transnational crime.

“The location of Guard personnel – and number specifically working in support of operations along the border, the coast and elsewhere in the state – will be dictated by the needs on the ground,” Evan Westrup, a spokesperson for Brown, told HuffPost on Wednesday.

Brown said the additional members would contribute to the guard’s ongoing efforts, which include “targeting transnational criminal gangs, human traffickers and illegal firearm and drug smugglers along the border, the coast and throughout the state.”

The governor also noted that the state’s National Guard “agreed to similar targeted assistance” under the past two presidents.

Brown’s announcement comes amid growing tensions between California and the Trump administration. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a federal lawsuit targeting the state’s so-called “sanctuary” policies that don’t fully cooperate with federal deportation efforts.

Governors act as the commander-in-chief of their respective states’ guards, which is why Trump isn’t authorized to direct the troops as he sees fit. Earlier this month, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said she would flat-out reject the president’s request.

WASHINGTON ― Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday he wants a vote as soon as possible on legislation to limit President Donald Trump’s ability to fire a special counsel like Robert Mueller.

Grassley said if he gets agreement from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, the measure will “be ready for action a week from tomorrow.”

Feinstein, though, said she and Grassley agreed to delay consideration of the legislation because of her concerns about a proposed amendment “that could undermine” Mueller’s investigation, according to a statement by her office released later on Wednesday.

The amendment that Grassley is preparing would require the Justice Department to report to Congress when the scope of a special counsel’s probe is altered or the special counsel is fired.

Feinstein has said in the past that she generally supports legislation to shield Mueller from political interference.

Grassley in his Wednesday comments didn’t make specify what kind of special counsel bill he’s looking to push. But The Washington Post reported it would require the president to provide advance notice to Congress of plans to fire a special counsel, and give the reasons for such a move.

Also on Wednesday, Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced they were merging two prior efforts meant to protect the special counsel into one bill, titled the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act.

The legislation would codify existing Justice Department regulations to ensure that a special counsel can only be fired for good cause by a senior Justice Department official. It would also give a special counsel a “10-day window” to seek judicial review of whether removal had been based on good cause.

“This compromise bipartisan bill helps ensure that special counsels ― present or future ― have the independence they need to conduct fair and impartial investigations,” Tillis said in a statement. “The integrity and independence of special counsel investigations are vital to reaffirming the American people’s confidence in our nation’s rule of law.”

The Senate efforts to shield the special counsel come amid Trump’s intensifying attacks on Mueller, who is leading an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has reportedly spoken about firing Mueller several times, and also is said to be considering firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel.

“Why don’t I just fire Mueller?” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question earlier this week. “Well, I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s really a sad situation. ... Many people have said you should fire him. Again, they found nothing, and in finding nothing, that’s a big statement.”

Several GOP lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have maintained that additional protections aren’t necessary for the Russia probe, even after reports this week about the president fuming at Mueller and his own top staff at the Department of Justice.

“I haven’t seen a clear indication that we need to do something to keep him from being removed,” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday, referring to Mueller.

Grassley said Monday he believed it would be “suicide” for the president to fire Mueller.

“I think the less the president says about this whole thing, the better off he will be,” Grassley said. “I think that Mueller is a person of stature and respected, and I respect him. Just let the thing go forward.”NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images

WASHINGTON — Three months before Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) announced his bid to unseat Sen. Bill Nelson (D), the Trump administration handed its longtime ally and soon-to-be Senate candidate a political victory.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke made a special visit to the Sunshine State in early January to announce that he was removing the state’s coastal waters from consideration for future offshore oil drilling. He called the state “unique” and praised Scott as a “straightforward leader that can be trusted.”

Zinke’s seemingly arbitrary decision came less than a week after Trump and his team unveiled the sweeping plan, which would open nearly all U.S. waters to oil and gas drilling, just two days into a 60-day public comment period and amid the administration’s push for “energy dominance.” The trip, which POLITICO Florida revealed was orchestrated well in advance, seemed aimed at helping Scott garner support among environmentalists and boosting his chances against Nelson in November.

But at a Senate hearing in March, Zinke walked back his initial comments on Florida, saying “Florida is still in the process.” And last week, at an offshore wind energy forum in New Jersey, he told The Associated Press that “no one was exempted.”

Florida Republican strategist Mac Stipanovich told HuffPost that if the administration has indeed taken Florida off the table, Scott would stand to benefit in this year’s race. But no one is quite sure that’s the case.

“It appears to have been an attempt to inoculate Rick Scott against his previous pro-drilling stance — an attempt that has gone somewhat awry and left a lot of ambiguity and unanswered questions,” Stipanovich said.

In its effort to help Scott, the Trump administration has walked into a legal mess, which likely explains Zinke’s sudden change in tone. In a February letter to the interior secretary, the attorneys general of 12 states threatened legal action if the administration did not terminate its proposal or drop areas off their respective coasts from consideration. And last week, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) called on the United States Office of Special Counsel to investigate whether Zinke’s Florida trip violated a federal law prohibiting government employees from engaging in political activities.

That an administration hell-bent on boosting domestic fossil fuel production chose to wade into the race on this particular issue is surprising. And it’s hard to see how the potential benefit to Scott was worth the trouble the administration created for itself.

Stipanovich said he expects Nelson’s campaign and the green lobby will continue to point to Scott’s support for expanded offshore drilling during his first campaign for governor in 2010, in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. (PolitiFact declared Scott’s recent reversal a “Full Flop.”) But with both candidates now publicly opposing offshore drilling, Stipanovich doubts it will become a hot-button issue in the race.

““It appears to have been an attempt to inoculate Rick Scott against his previous pro-drilling stance — an attempt that has gone somewhat awry and left a lot of ambiguity and unanswered questions."” - Republican strategist Mac Stipanovich

Steve Schale, the Democratic strategist who helped former President Barack Obama carry Florida twice, said Scott’s campaign style is to take potentially contentious issues off the table.

“In Scott’s world,” he said, “getting to a push on oil drilling is a good thing.”

Scott — who rejects the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by humans and as governor slashed the budget of the state’s Department of Environmental Protection — has apparently realized that environmental issues could play big in the Senate election. In October, he proposed increasing funding for Florida environmental projects by $220 million, to $1.7 billion. And in a statement swinging back at the Trump administration’s offshore drilling proposal, Scott said his “top priority is to ensure that Florida’s natural resources are protected.”

Schale said that the election will likely be decided in the margins and that oil and gas development could be a significant conversation point among moderate swing voters, in particular in the western part of the state. But he added that important issues during a conventional election — in this case, oil drilling or gun control — could nonetheless be completely sidelined by a referendum on Trump.

“I’m just not sure any of that matters anywhere near as much as” Trump’s approval come November, Shale said.

Scott officially announced his Senate candidacy Monday, saying it’s time to “stop sending talkers to Washington” and promising to “shake up” the nation’s capital. He made no mention of offshore drilling, but on his campaign website he notes that Florida has made “historic investments” in the environment under his watch.

Nelson, a three-term incumbent, has fought for years to prevent new drilling off the Florida coast and notched a 95 percent on the League of Conservation Voters’ 2017 scorecard. He has repeatedly skewered Zinke over the Florida decision, calling it a “political stunt.”

On Sunday, a day ahead of Scott’s official announcement, the League of Conservation Voters launched a campaign called ”Rick Roll Rick Scott.” In a blog post on Medium, the advocacy group accused the Florida governor of “attempting to deceive Floridians about his record on offshore drilling, climate change, and protecting the beaches and other special places that drive Florida’s tourism economy.”Pope Francis attends his weekly general audience in St Peter Square at the Vatican, Wednesday, April 11, 2018.

Pope Francis acknowledged that he committed “serious errors” in handling a sex abuse scandal that has roiled Chile’s Roman Catholic Church and resulted in one of the most heated controversies of his papacy.

Francis made the admission in a letter sent to Chilean bishops that was published online Wednesday.

Francis wrote that hearing about the “crucified lives” of the victims has caused him “pain and shame.”

“I recognize and I want you to communicate this accurately, that I have made serious errors of judgment and perception of the situation, especially due to lack of truthful and balanced information,” Francis told the bishops in the letter dated April 8, according to a translation by the Catholic news site Crux.

In the coming weeks, Francis will also meet with Chilean victims of clergy sexual abuse and ask each one personally for forgiveness, according to Jaime Coiro, a spokesman for the Chilean bishops’ conference.

Pope Francis drew the ire of Chilean abuse victims and their allies during a trip to Chile in January. In interviews, Francis defended Bishop Juan Barros, who victims claim protected and in some cases observed abuse carried out on teenage boys by his mentor Rev. Fernando Karadima. The Vatican convicted Karadima of abuse in 2011. Barros denies having any knowledge of the abuse.

During his Chile trip, Francis was caught on tape accusing victims of slandering Barros. In a follow-up press interview on board the papal airplane, Francis again rejected the claims against Barros, claiming that victims hadn’t come forward and that the accusers should present “proof” of their claims.

Shortly after the pope’s trip, The Associated Press reported that Francis had, in fact, received a letter in 2015 about how Barros witnessed the abuse carried out by Karadima and did nothing to stop it. The letter was written by one of Karadima’s victims, Juan Carlos Cruz. It is unclear whether the pope actually read that letter.

In an unusual move, Francis also announced that he was summoning all 32 members of Chile’s bishops’ conference to Rome in May to hear the results of an investigation into the crisis.

The last time a pope issued such a summons was in 2002, when former Pope John Paul II called U.S. cardinals to the Vatican to address the escalating clerical sex abuse scandal in America, according to the Catholic News Agency.

The pope’s words in Chile drew harsh criticism from survivors’ groups. Boston’s Cardinal Sean O’Malley, head of the pope’s sex abuse commission, said in a statement that the words were a “source of great pain” for survivors.

In response to the backlash, Francis sent the Vatican’s most respected sex abuse investigator, Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the claims against Barros.

“I can affirm that all the testimonies collected speak in a stark manner, without additives or sweeteners, of many crucified lives and I confess that this has caused me pain and shame,” the pope wrote in the letter to Chile’s bishops after reading through the results of Scicluna’s investigation.

On Wednesday, Cruz said that the Vatican had contacted him and two other victims to arrange a meeting with the pope. In a statement posted to Twitter, Cruz said they are evaluating whether they can attend.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has achieved a lot of “firsts.”

She was the first Asian-American woman elected to Congress in her state back in 2012. The Iraq war veteran was the first disabled woman ever elected to Congress. She was the first member of Congress born in Thailand. And, most recently, she became the first woman to give birth while in the Senate.

So, it’s no surprise Duckworth is a bit tired of firsts.

“I have won historic elections, but it feels like these ‘firsts’ are so overdue,” she recently told Elle magazine. “I never set out to be the first in anything, and with a lot of these ‘firsts,’ it really makes me wonder how it’s taken so long. It also underscores how much farther we have to go to have representation in our government.”

Although women make up half of the U.S. population, women only account for 19 percent of members of Congress. Additionally, less than 25 percent of all state legislators are women, and only six of the country’s 50 state governors are women.

Duckworth discussed some of her firsts and what it’s been like serving her country ― first in the military, then in politics ― as an Asian-American woman.

“I often felt underestimated, not so much by the people I served with ... but by people from other nations,” she told Elle. “It was a double whammy with both my ethnicity and my gender.”

She recalled going on international missions while serving in the Army. Many foreigners were surprised that she was the only woman ― and often the commanding officer ― in an otherwise all-male unit.

“People would ask, ‘Who is in charge of the unit?’ And my team would respond, ‘It’s the short Asian girl, she’s the one who is actually in charge of all of us.’ And people would always say, ‘Her? Is she even American?’” Duckworth said. “There’s a perpetual foreigner syndrome with Asian Americans where, even as native, natural-born American citizens, we’re often still not seen as being true Americans.”

Duckworth said that whenever she gets a bit “overwhelmed” by all of it, she hangs out with her daughter: “She doesn’t care about the Senate or Congress ― it’s just mom-time.”

WICHITA, Kan. — The defense attorneys for three men from rural Kansas charged in a terrorist plot to murder Muslim refugees have begun building their defense against federal charges that could send the men to prison for life.

One key argument: They’re idiots.

Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright are currently on trial in Wichita, charged in a plot to use bombs to kill Somali immigrants living in an apartment complex in Garden City around the time of the 2016 election. The prosecution rested on Monday following testimony from an FBI informant as well as an undercover officer who posed as an arms dealer and extensively interacted with Stein about his plot to blow up a Muslim community.

HuffPost was the sole media outlet in attendance last week during testimony from an undercover officer identified as “Brian.” During cross-examination, Rich Federico, a federal public defender representing Allen, asked why the FBI didn’t inform the local police department about the domestic terror plot, so that local officers could knock on the plotters’ doors and, essentially, tell them to cut it out.

“Hey knucklehead,” Federico suggested the police say. “We know what you’re talking about. Knock it off.”

The comment from Federico, who has represented detainees in Guantanamo, illustrates an ongoing theme ― that the three men, swindled by fake news about Muslims, had merely engaged in hateful locker room talk. Defense attorneys have argued that the plot never would have moved forward without the federal government’s involvement.

Other defense attorneys representing clients arrested in FBI counterterrorism stings have tried similar tactics, suggesting that the federal government essentially entrapped them. But it’s much easier for the government to convict those who claim an affiliation with a foreign terrorist organization than it is to convict domestic extremists. According to The Intercept’s Trial and Terror project, 67 percent of terrorism defendants in FBI stings were charged with material support, a law not applicable to domestic extremists.

Additionally, most other terrorism sting defendants ― typically young Muslim men ― aren’t as likely to convince a jury that they’re incompetent fools rather than a national security threat.

The characterization of the militiamen charged in a domestic terrorism plot as “knuckleheads” popped up shortly after the FBI takedown. The arrests happened a few weeks before the 2016 election, when Muslim refugees were a hot topic on the campaign trail. The Kansas GOP sent out a mailer depicting a member of the Islamic State militant group and warning voters about “new neighbors,” which they claimed was about the idea of Guantanamo detainees being transferred to Fort Leavenworth, not Muslim refugees moving into the state. Speaking to a reporter about the mailers, the executive director of the Kansas Republican Party referred to Stein, Allen and Wright as “knuckleheads.”

During the trial last week, Risa Berkower, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division prosecutor, shot down the idea that the police should have warned the trio not to attack Muslim refugees when she questioned the undercover agent known as Brian.

“Have you ever heard of law enforcement responding to a plot to commit mass murder by going to the person’s house and knocking on the door and saying ‘Hey knucklehead, knock it off’?” Berkower asked Brian. He hadn’t.

“Have you ever heard of a law enforcement officer responding to a plot to blow up a building by saying ‘Hey knucklehead, knock it off’?” He hadn’t.

When Stein discussed plans to use a fertilizer bomb to level an apartment complex, did Brian consider him a mere knucklehead? He did not.

This week, after the prosecution rested, Wright’s team moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that no rational jury could convict Wright because the prosecution had provided insufficient evidence.

Neither Wright nor Allen met with the undercover agent. Federal prosecutors have their strongest case against Stein, who had extensive interactions with the undercover officer he thought was a high-level weapons dealer. In encrypted texts, Stein said they were “dedicated patriots... willing to die for this country if that is what it takes to get it back.” He refused, he wrote, to “go down in history as the generation who lost the best country on the planet.”

Stein wrote that they would set off bombs on both sides of the building, “set them off at the same time and throw a fucking party! LOL.” He wrote that the shock wave from the blast would make “jello out of their insides.” He spoke of his hope that “people from miles and miles away will take note of the beautiful job we did!!” and be inspired to launch similar attacks.

Stein bought wholeheartedly into the idea that the undercover officer was a weapons dealer. He delivered fertilizer he believed would be used to make the bomb. Prosecutors played a video of him in a vehicle with the undercover officers as they scouted out the location of the planned attack.

“That apartment over here on the end... This is their fucking mosque... Just this one apartment on this one end... That’s where they pray to fuckin’ Allah,” Stein told the undercover officers. He spoke of his desire to see the bomb go off himself.

“I’d give anything to have a fucking camera set up that would WiFi that shit to me so I could watch it live,” he said.

HuffPost has been in Wichita, Kansas, to cover this domestic terrorism trial. Follow reporters Christopher Mathias and Ryan Reilly for updates. Here, and above, is HuffPost’s coverage of this case:Chicago Tribune writers have never before formed a union. Jim Young / Reuters

Staffers at the Chicago Tribune have announced they will try to successfully organize the newsroom for the first time in the paper’s 170-year history.

On Wednesday, employees sent out a letter to the newsroom announcing their plans to form a union. Shortly after NPR broke the story, multiple employees went public with their intention over social media as well.

“We decided we needed a voice,” Charlie J. Johnson, a home page editor and key union organizer at the Tribune, told HuffPost. “We needed a say in how this place operated and the union was the tool that was available to us.”

If successful, the Tribune could follow a growing number of news organizations that have joined unions in recent years as the industry grapples with increasing uncertainty.

Last year, the Tribune’s corporate owner, Tronc, ran an aggressive union-busting campaign at another of its papers, The Los Angeles Times. But LA Times staffers voted to form a union in January anyway. The paper was sold off weeks later to an area billionaire.

Johnson told HuffPost that the Times’ decision to push for a union proved critical in the Tribune’s own unionization efforts.

“They basically poured gasoline on an extinguishing kindle fire,” he said.

Wednesday afternoon, Tronc issued a statement from Tribune publisher and editor-in-chief Bruce Dold, who said everyone in management “has the utmost respect for the decisions you make and for your rights on this issue.”

Dold went on to emphasize a recent pay bump and previously announced diversity goals, and said that the paper is undergoing a “newsroom reorganization” so it may “thrive in an intensely competitive media environment.”

He concluded: “My door is open. Please come on in.”

The union letter sent around the Tribune newsroom was signed by dozens of organizers and cited concerns including “a series of corporate owners — Tronc being only the most recent” that have “jeopardized our ability to do great work.”

Others included concerns over job stability, regular raises, parental leave, diversity in the newsroom and availability of resources.

“We believe the union is an investment — in our work, in ourselves, in our readers, in our city and state,” the letter read in part. “For the Chicago Tribune. For Chicago.”

Since its founding in June 1847, the paper and its staffers have earned more than two dozen Pulitzer prizes. But over the past six months, the Tribune has been hit by two rounds of layoffs.

“We have lost many talented colleagues to higher-paying jobs that offer better protections and more possibilities for advancement,” the staffers’ letter read.

Some told NPR that corporate pay at Tronc has also sparked outrage. For example, controlling shareholder Michael Farrow will still receive $5 million a year through 2020 even after stepping down as chairman last month amid sexual harassment complaints.

In recent years, news organizations including the Intercept, Vox, Vice, Slate, MTV News, ThinkProgress, Thrillist, HuffPost and the now-defunct Gawker. (Gizmodo Media Group, which comprises Gawker’s sister sites, is still unionized.) The Onion announced late last month that it intended to unionize, too.

In some cases, as with the LA Times, the process has led to significant conflict. Writers at a string of local news sites including Gothamist voted to unionize late last year and, days afterward, found themselves jobless. Gothamist and some of its sister sites were later saved by public radio stations including WNYC.

The Tribune’s staffers seek to join the NewsGuild-Communication Workers of America, the same union that now represents the LA Times, along with thousands of other journalists and media workers.

“We hope that Tronc will realize the strength of the support for this in the newsroom and voluntarily recognize us,” Johnson said, “and if they don’t, we’ll go to an election.”

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Romance “Call Me By Your Name” may have won a screenplay Oscar, and Disney’s family-friendly “Beauty and the Beast” had a gay character, but movies from Hollywood’s major studios last year had the lowest percentage of lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual characters since 2012, according to a report released on Tuesday.

Gay and transgender media advocacy group GLAAD said in its annual Studio Responsibility Index that of the 109 releases by the seven largest movie studios in 2017, just 14, or 12.8 percent, included LGBTQ characters.

GLAAD called on Hollywood to have 20 percent of annual film releases include a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or gender fluid character by 2021, rising to 50 percent of output by 2024.

Box office hits like “Wonder Woman” and “Black Panther” have smashed old Hollywood notions that movies that champion women and people of color do not have global appeal, GLAAD said.

“It is time for LGBTQ stories to be included in this conversation,” GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in the report.

GLAAD praised movies like tennis film “Battle of the Sexes,” Oscar best picture winner “The Shape of Water” and independent transgender tale “A Fantastic Woman” from Chile that won the best foreign language Oscar in March.

But it gave the thumbs-down to “Thor: Ragnarok” for deleting references to two characters who are bisexual or queer in the original Marvel comic book source material, criticized “Baywatch” for its “many jokes relying on gay panic for cheap laughs,” and said “Pitch Perfect 3” sidelined a lesbian character.

Despite the slide in LGBTQ characters in 2017, GLAAD said 2018 had already shown welcome progress, with movies like gay young adult film “Love, Simon” and the raunchy teen comedy “Blockers.”

The report expressed hope for upcoming films, such as musical “Mamma Mia 2,” where GLAAD said it would like to see Colin Firth’s gay character further explored, and “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” where lead character Lisbeth Salander is bisexual in the original Stieg Larsson novel.

As for “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the upcoming biopic about Queen singer Freddie Mercury who died in 1991 of AIDS complications, GLAAD said it hoped the film would “make a powerful impact by fully exploring his queer identity.”

The raids had the president fuming on Monday and Tuesday.

Trump was reportedly weighing a number of potentially drastic options, including firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, CNN reported Tuesday, citing multiple unnamed sources familiar with the matter. But officials said the most probable target, if the president acts, would be Rosenstein.

The New York Times also cited several people briefed on the Cohen investigation who said Trump was privately discussing whether or not to fire Rosenstein in the wake of the Cohen raids.

According to a source close to Rosenstein’s office, since the raids, the White House has not put any pressure on the deputy attorney general to resign, nor has the White House indicated to the deputy AG’s office that Rosenstein will be fired.

At a military leadership meeting on Monday, Trump also openly discussed the idea of firing Mueller.

“Why don’t I just fire Mueller?” Trump asked, repeating a reporter’s question. “Well, I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s really a sad situation .... Many people have said you should fire him. Again, they found nothing, and in finding nothing, that’s a big statement.”

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that Trump “certainly believes he has the power” to fire Mueller.

Republicans have warned Trump against firing the special counsel, a course of action Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday said “would be suicide for the president.”

The president also renewed his critique of Sessions this week over the attorney general’s decision last year to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.

Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since Sessions’ recusal and has been frequently criticized by Trump. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to take over the Russia inquiry after the president fired former FBI Director James Comey last year.

Trump has relentlessly attacked Sessions, Rosenstein and the Justice Department. He has twice weighed firing Mueller ― first in June 2017 and again, the Times reported on Tuesday, last December.

The president also reportedly considered firing Rosenstein last summer around the same time that he considered firing Mueller.

Democrats, meanwhile, said they would treat firing Rosenstein as equally bad as firing Mueller.

“I’d like to make something crystal clear to the president: Mr. President, any attempt to remove Rod Rosenstein will create the exact same constitutional crisis as if you fired special counsel Bob Mueller,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on Tuesday.

At the root of Trump’s anger this time is Monday’s raids, which sought information in Cohen’s office and hotel room regarding payments to two women who have alleged that they had affairs with Trump more than 10 years ago. Agents seized documents relating to a $130,000 payment Cohen made to former adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, as well as emails, tax records and business documents, according to the Times.

They also were reportedly looking for information about Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she had a nearly yearlong affair with Trump in 2006. American Media Inc., parent company of The National Enquirer, reportedly paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story and then didn’t run one, which is thought to have been an attempt to silence her. The company’s CEO, David Pecker, is known to be a friend of Trump’s.Arizona GOP lawmakers are pushing legislation to require women seeking abortions to give a reason. Alex Wong via Getty Images

The Arizona state House of Representatives passed a bill that would require women seeking abortions to fill out an invasive questionnaire that asks the reason for the procedure.

The legislation, passed on Monday, would force women to answer questions, including whether the abortion is elective for economic reasons, if the pregnancy was from a rape or incest, if the woman does not want children at this time, if the abortion is due to fetal or maternal health, and if the patient is having “relationship issues” such as domestic abuse or an extramarital affair.

The bill passed along party lines, 35-22, the Arizona Star reported. A version already has been approved by the state Senate, which now must decide whether to accept House amendments.

State Rep. Eddie Farnsworth (R) said the bill was about “getting information,” according to the Arizona Star. But when Rep. Daniel Hernandez (D) suggested the questionnaire add questions asking women whether they lacked access to affordable health care and had access to comprehensive sex education, Farnsworth shut the idea down.

“Sex education is not a health-care issue,” Farnsworth said. “Having access to contraception is not a health-care issue.”

Research shows that when women are given access to safe and affordable contraception, abortion rates drop.

The bill does not require women to disclose their identity on the questionnaire, but they would have to provide their race, ethnicity, age, educational background, marital status and the number of prior pregnancies and prior abortions.

Jodi Liggett, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona,

told Bustle that the questionnaire is an anti-abortion tactic designed to shame women for their health care decisions.

“This is about making the abortion experience as shaming and degrading as possible for people, to thereby discourage them from following through with their decision,” Liggett said. “Nothing more.”Rene Wassenbergh/EyeEm via Getty Images

People are alarmed by the idea that one company could have control of the content of many local television stations, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.

But considerably fewer are tuned into the controversy currently surrounding Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 193 stations in the United States. That allows it to reach 39 percent of the nation’s households, according to Vox ― the maximum household reach allowed by the Federal Communications Commission. A proposed acquisition deal would allow the company to expand further.

Just 13 percent of Americans in the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they know that a station in their area is owned by Sinclair. Another 16 percent said they don’t believe there is a Sinclair-owned station in their area, while the vast majority, 71 percent, aren’t sure. Most said they haven’t heard anything in the news lately about Sinclair, and aren’t sure how they feel about the group.

Among those who said that Sinclair owned at least one of their local stations, about three-quarters believe the company has some or a lot of influence on the news aired by that station.

Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they are at least a little bothered by the fact that many local television stations are owned by the same company, with just under a third saying it bothers them a lot. About two-thirds say they’d be at least a little bothered to learn that such a company was requiring them all to air the same statements or commentary, with just under half saying it would bother them a lot.

That’s the case with Sinclair, which distributes content, often favorable to President Donald Trump, that its constituent stations are mandated to run. In the past year, those “must-run” segments have included commentary up to nine times a week from Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump official.

Last month, in a move that drew praise from Trump on Twitter, stations were required to read a statement condemning “fake news.”

“We’re concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories … stories that just aren’t true, without checking facts first,” the statement on fake news read, in part. “Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control ‘exactly what people think.’ ... This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.”

About a quarter of Americans, including a slim majority of those aware that they live in an area with a Sinclair station, said they recall hearing the statement about fake news.

The content of the statement itself caused less consternation with the public, many of whom have little trust in the news media: 48 percent of the public said they approve of the message, while just 27 percent disapprove.

Nearly 80 percent of voters who backed Trump in the 2016 election said they approve of the statement, compared with 43 percent of non-voters and 27 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton. Clinton voters were also 50 points likelier than Trump voters to hold an unfavorable view of Sinclair.

Other questions showed less stark political divides. Although Clinton voters were most likely to express strong concerns, a majority of Trump voters and non-voters also said they are at least somewhat bothered that many local stations share a single owner and that stations can be required to run segments.

Yuri Gripas / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump and his choice to be the next secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have both said it might be time for the U.S. to begin using torture methods like waterboarding again.

At least one of them might be forced to answer for that view on Thursday morning, when Pompeo appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing. And Pompeo’s response might reveal how the Trump administration has not just praised torture in theory but dealt with a real U.S.-linked application of it ― thousands of miles away, in the poorest country in the Arab world and the home of al Qaeda’s most potent branch.

Neither Pompeo nor Trump has ever commented publicly on the growing mountain of evidence that the United Arab Emirates, the chief American partner in the battle against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has tortured significant numbers of detainees in Yemen in the name of fighting terror. The evidence raises serious questions about the administration’s counterterror-focused foreign policy and the prospect of once again embroiling the U.S. in human rights violations reminiscent of the worst moments in the post-9/11 War on Terror.

Amid other concerns about Pompeo’s ability to serve as America’s top diplomat ― like the former Kansas congressman’s track record of Islamophobia, saber rattling and climate change denial ― the torture issue has gotten short shrift so far, congressional sources told HuffPost. But as director of the CIA since January 2017, Pompeo has been intimately involved in overseeing American intelligence collection, drone strikes and raids in Yemen as part of a campaign closely intertwined with the UAE.

Yemen is currently embroiled in a hugely destructive civil war, with multiple outside forces stepping in. Al Qaeda has had a presence there since the 1990s. UAE forces entered in significant numbers in 2015 at the invitation of Yemen’s internationally recognized government to help fight an Iran-backed insurgency. They made targeting al Qaeda a priority within months.

During Pompeo’s time at the CIA, four separate reports based on on-the-ground interviews have revealed that the UAE and two proxy militias, the Security Belt and the Hadrami Elite Forces, are torturing Yemenis in secretive facilities.

On June 8, 2017, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published the first report, describing prisoners being beaten, stripped and packed into metal containers.

On June 22, two more appeared: A Human Rights Watch investigation noted the existence of 11 informal prisons and claims that detainees were being electrocuted. An Associated Press story revealed that U.S. personnel were interrogating detainees at UAE-controlled facilities, providing questions for UAE interrogators and receiving transcripts of interrogations.

And on Jan. 26 of this year, a United Nations panel of experts announced that the UAE was still holding more than 200 prisoners in at least three facilities in Yemen, subjecting them to torture and refusing “to conduct credible investigations into such abuses or to act against the perpetrators.”

The Trump administration has not revealed the existence of any official U.S. investigation of these claims, although it did provide a classified response to powerful lawmakers angered by the reports last summer. In October, a Defense Department spokesman told HuffPost that an internal inquiry did not find any credible allegations to support the AP report. The spokesman declined to answer a follow-up question about the Human Rights Watch findings.

Now neither the CIA nor the State Department will say what Pompeo knew or did about torture by the UAE. Asked for comment, the agencies pointed HuffPost to each other.

But it’s hard to pretend that this isn’t Washington’s problem.

“Given that the U.S. touts its relationship of cooperation, including intelligence cooperation, with the Emiratis, it certainly seems likely that there would be sharing of information from interrogations,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the national security project at the American Civil Liberties Union. “And to the extent that any of those interrogations are abusive, there would be reason for concern that the U.S. is obtaining unlawfully coerced information.”

The administration has not responded to ACLU and Human Rights Watch requests for internal documents on the matter, and the Pentagon told HuffPost the State Department should handle comment for this story. While State refused to comment on Pompeo’s knowledge of the reported torture, a department official said, “We take all allegations of abuse seriously and continue to call on and all parties to the conflict to treat prisoners and detainees humanely, ensure that abuses are investigated, and those responsible involved are held accountable, and act in accordance with international law, including human rights law and the laws of armed conflict.”

The UAE has repeatedly denied mistreating or even holding prisoners in Yemen.

The Emirati activity in that country mimics the Bush-era rendition program that the UAE once helped the CIA run, in which terror suspects taken to secret prisons were often tortured. Experts say it poses two broad legal concerns. U.S. officials could be in direct legal trouble at home and abroad if they were present when abuse was taking place. And more generally, the U.S. could be violating international law if it is benefiting from the practice, including by receiving intelligence obtained through torture.

American silence on the matter could also hinder counterterror efforts by fueling Yemeni resentment and making it harder for the U.S. to prosecute militants. The Trump administration has already struggled with how to handle an al Qaeda suspect called Abu Khaybar who was captured by the UAE in 2016 and is being held in Yemen. The FBI had wanted him to face trial in a civilian court, but there his treatment by Americans and Emiratis might come under scrutiny.

The FBI declined to comment for this story.

The UAE’s heavy-handed approach could be guaranteeing future instability in Yemen, a country that’s long been a source of threats to the territorial U.S.

Many of the forces in Yemen’s civil war use unsavory tactics. Al Qaeda and ISIS, the targets of the U.S.-UAE cooperation, are brutal. And the UAE is also, with limited American assistance, helping Saudi Arabia fight a Yemeni militia called the Houthis who are backed by Saudi regional rival Iran. The Houthis have their own track record of major rights violations, including the use of torture.

The Emiratis have worked hard to build American confidence as an ally. “U.S. soldiers are willing to go downrange to knock on doors with the Emiratis in ways that they would never do with the Saudis,” said Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

But in neglecting to establish any kind of judicial investigation or grievance process and in empowering militias, the UAE does not seem to have a long-term plan for Yemen, Radhya Almutawakel of the Yemeni nonprofit Mwatana for Human Rights told HuffPost.

Mwatana for Human Rights has documented 34 cases in 2017 in which forces aligned with the UAE-backed Yemeni government tortured detainees. Ten of them resulted in death.

Progress since last year’s reports has been limited. In January, the International Committee of the Red Cross was permitted to visit one UAE-linked detention facility to observe detainees and pass on news to their families. Some prisoners have been moved to central facilities, which might help improve oversight, Kristine Beckerle of Human Rights Watch said. But there are still smaller UAE-associated prisons dotted across the south and east of Yemen operating with impunity.

“Some of the people who we know personally were involved in abuse still maintain positions of power and authority,” Beckerle told HuffPost. “And we have not seen any clarity coming from the U.S.”Score one for persistence.

Andre Ingram, a graying 32-year-old with fading hopes from a decade in the minor leagues, made his NBA debut for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Houston Rockets in LA on Tuesday.

He sank his first shot ― a three-pointer ― and kept making them. He hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts, and was 6 of 8 from the field overall, scoring 19 points. It was the highest total in a first game by a Lakers rookie since 1993.

If you don’t get choked up a tad by the highlights, you need to turn in your human card.

The week began routinely enough with what Ingram thought was an exit interview for the Lakers’ G-league team. Instead, he got a hug from Magic Johnson and word that he was being promoted to the actual Lakers.

Ingram’s wife, Marilee, in Richmond, Virginia, screamed when she got the news over the telephone, the Los Angeles Times reported. Then she and their two daughters flew out to LA to watch the dream come true.

“I just felt some electricity out there,” Ingram told NBA.com. “It was amazing. The crowd, the lights — it was once in a lifetime.”

Ingram played 384 games in the minors on paltry salaries, earning side money as a math tutor, he told TNT. He thanked Marilee for sticking by him.

The Lakers lost, 105-99, but that’s so besides the point. A star was born ― at least for a night ― after he had waited so patiently for his chance.

As @TurnerSportsEJ would say, this story is "good for the soul."

Trump directed a morning tweet at Russia, the Syrian government’s primary ally in the years-long civil war President Bashar Assad has waged against rebel groups. The Kremlin has warned the U.S. it planned to shoot down any U.S. missiles headed for Syria.

“Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” Trump tweeted. “You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!”

Trump, with his rhetoric, has taken an unusually hard line against the Assad regime’s brutality, condemning the attack as “sick” and “atrocious” and even coining a new nickname for the country’s leader: “Animal Assad.”

The president said Monday that he’d respond within 48 hours, though his administration has yet to formally announce any strikes. Trump did, however, speak with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday about a possible coordinated response, according to the White House.

Trump reacted forcefully one year ago, following a similar chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun. He ordered cruise missile strikes on a Syrian airbase, a move experts said did little to deter Assad’s campaign against his own people. Conventional and chemical attacks have continued in the past year, focused on the eastern Ghouta region, one of the last remaining rebel strongholds.

The United Nations refugee agency estimates that more than 133,000 people have fled the region in the past month. More than 1,000 have also been killed in the last two weeks, according to Doctors Without Borders.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg testifies in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, one day after answering questions from members of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees about Cambridge Analytica and security on the social network.Bill Hybels founded Willow Creek Community Church in the Chicago area 42 years ago. Willow Creek Community Church / Screenshot

A Chicago-area pastor is stepping down from the leadership of one of America’s largest megachurches after allegations emerged that he engaged in inappropriate behavior with female members of his congregation.

The Rev. Bill Hybels, an evangelical pastor who founded Willow Creek Community Church 42 years ago, announced Tuesday that he was retiring six months ahead of schedule.

Hybels, who has repeatedly denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, spoke to church members during a Tuesday night meeting at the church’s main branch in South Barrington, Illinois. (See the video here.) Hybels said he was “grieved” by how the controversy surrounding him was hindering the church’s ministries. Since May 2012, he had indicated that he planned to retire as lead pastor in October 2018. But he decided to move that date up and step away from other church responsibilities, he said, in order to allow the Willow Creek congregation to “flourish.”

He also said again that the accusations against him were “misleading” or “entirely false” and that an outside investigation had found no evidence of inappropriate behavior. He did acknowledge, however, that he had too often placed himself in “situations that would have been far wiser to avoid” and had been “naive” about the dynamics those situations created.

“I realize now that in certain settings and circumstances in the past, I communicated things that were perceived in ways I did not intend, at times making people feel uncomfortable,” Hybels said. “I was blind to this dynamic for far too long. For that, I’m very sorry.”

In March, the Chicago Tribune published the allegations of several women who accused Hybels of behaving inappropriately with them during encounters that stretched back to the 1990s. The behavior allegedly included lewd comments, extended hugs and, in one case, an unwanted kiss and an invitation to a private hotel room. Another woman told the Tribune that she had a consensual affair with Hybels, although she later retracted the claim.

Willow Creek Community Church says that it conducted multiple investigations into those allegations, starting in 2014. These included an outside inquiry that the church commissioned from a Chicago law firm. The investigations all cleared Hybels of any inappropriate behavior. But a group of former church members and leaders in the Willow Creek community were dissatisfied and are demanding more scrutiny.

Willow Creek has not made the full report from the law firm’s investigation public. The church explained on its website that the report was shown only to church elders because the 29 people interviewed had been assured that their conversations would be kept confidential.

Church elders didn’t inform the broader congregation that these investigations were taking place. The statement on the website says that since the results were negative, it would have been “dishonoring” to Hybels if they had shared the “false allegations.”

Hybels is a prominent leader within American evangelicalism. He helped Willow Creek grow into one of the country’s largest megachurches, with seven satellite sites. The church also has international reach through the Willow Creek Association, a leadership training initiative that has ties to more than 11,000 churches worldwide. More than 25,000 people attend services at the church’s main campus in South Barrington on any given weekend, the Tribune reports.

On Tuesday, Hybels announced that longtime church leader Heather Larson, whom he’d nominated as his successor last October, will immediately take over as lead pastor.

Larson told congregants at Tuesday’s gathering that she is “extremely grateful” for Hybels’ legacy and that the church is working on an “appropriate way” to honor him and his family in the future.

She also said that some of the women who brought the accusations against Hybels were once her own mentors. And she acknowledged that many of the women in the congregation may feel “confused or frustrated” by the recent events.

“Some of the language you have heard in the media does not resonate with your experience or what you know to be true of our church. I want to assure you we can at the same time respect someone’s story and stand up for our own,” Larson said.
