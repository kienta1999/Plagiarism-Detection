The daughters of the man who wrote “The Snake” ― a 1960s soul song that President Donald Trump has appropriated for his own anti-immigrant agenda ― blasted Trump on Sunday for twisting their father’s lyrics into a message of hate.

The president is using the song, written by the late Oscar Brown Jr., to “serve his own campaign and climate of intolerance and hate — which is the opposite” of what the songwriter intended, one of his daughters, Maggie Brown, said Sunday on MSNBC.

Trump is “perversely using ‘The Snake’ to demonize immigrants,” said Maggie’s sister, Africa Brown. “My father never stood against immigrants. He was always standing up for people, and not about separatism.”

Oscar Brown Jr., a soul singer, radical black activist and onetime member of the Communist Party from Chicago, wrote the song in 1963. The song is based on an Aesop fable, “The Farmer and the Viper,” that warns that kindness can be betrayed.

During numerous public appearances, Trump has pulled out the lyrics to “The Snake” after attacking immigrants, then read them like a gruesome instructive bedtime story. The lyrics concern a woman who takes a snake into her home, saving it from freezing outside. The snake then fatally bites her.

Trump read the lyrics to “The Snake” at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday as a way to smear immigrants, likening them to reptiles who have been welcomed into America only to fatally attack their hosts.

The president delivered the last line ― “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in” ― with sinister glee, as he’d done several times on the campaign trail.

“It’s extremely ironic,” Maggie Brown said. Her father, she said, believed that “with the grace of God, you need never fire a shot. He was against guns in the schools... or any of this stuff Donald Trump stands for.” She added: “That is super insulting.”

Her sister said Trump’s use of their father’s work is “an insult to the deep respect for humanity” that Oscar Brown Jr. believed in.

Both women accused Trump of “stealing” their father’s song, and demanded that he stop appropriating it.

Law enforcement told TMZ and ET Online that a call was received about a domestic disturbance at a residence in Thousand Oaks, California. A spokesperson for the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office told ET that deputies responded to the call around 10 p.m. and that Locklear was “uncooperative with the deputies and actually battered three of our deputies.”

“We initiated an investigation, which revealed that she had actually battered a boyfriend at the residence prior to our arrival,” the spokesperson said.

“[Locklear] had claimed that she was injured prior to our arrival, although we did not see any evidence of it,” the spokesperson added. “Out of an abundance for caution, she was transported to a local hospital where she was evaluated prior to being booked into jail.”

The actress was arrested on one count of felony domestic violence and three counts of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, according to the sheriff’s office. The spokesperson said she posted a $20,000 bail and was released.

AdvertisementRoy Moore, the Republican who lost the Alabama Senate election after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers, is backing a Missouri GOP Senate candidate who calls feminists “nasty” and “snake-filled.”

Moore, whose December defeat was a shocking upset, announced Monday his endorsement of Courtland Sykes, who is attempting to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a top target of Republicans in this year’s elections. He praised Sykes as “a man of impeccable character, courage, and Christian faith” and “a leader who will do what is right!”

Sykes has fully aligned himself with President Donald Trump’s agenda, pledging to support the president’s “MAGA and America First programs in 2018.” Trump endorsed Moore’s candidacy, but hasn’t yet backed anyone in Missouri, where the GOP field includes front-runner Josh Hawley.

Sykes says he opposes “career-obsessed banshees who forego home life and children and the happiness of family to become nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.” A recent campaign questionnaire describing his “views on Women’s Rights” also says he wants his future daughters “to become traditional homemakers and family wives.”

Sykes wrote that he expects “to come home to a home cooked dinner at six every night,” and attacked “the non-stop feminization campaign against manhood.”

Sykes supported Moore’s failed Alabama bid. At Moore’s election night party, he told HuffPost that Moore’s defeat to Democrat Doug Jones was “100-percent an effort by the Washington establishment” against what he called “MAGA candidates.”

Sykes’ fiancee, Chanel Rion, attacked Moore’s accusers during the campaign as “floozies.”First lady Melania Trump, whose husband routinely attacks and insults people online, said Monday that adults should “take the lead” in helping children develop positive social media habits.

The first lady discussed the need for children to have a healthier relationship with technology while speaking at a White House luncheon for spouses of governors.

″It is important that as adults we take the lead and the responsibility in helping our children manage the many issues they are facing today,” Trump said. “This means encouraging positive habits with social media and technology, even limiting time online and understand the content they are exposed to on a daily basis.”

Trump vowed in November 2016 to make cyberbullying one of her top priorities if her husband, Donald, was elected to the presidency. She has yet to take significant steps to combat the issue.

Meanwhile, the president continues to bully his critics and spread misinformation via Twitter, where he has 48 million followers. Earlier this month, he tweeted that media icon Oprah Winfrey was “very insecure,” and has repeatedly tried to humiliate MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski by calling her “dumb as a rock” and accusing her of undergoing plastic surgery.

Last Friday, Lauren Hogg, a 14-year-old survivor of the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, pleaded with the first lady to stop her stepson Donald Trump Jr. from “cyberbullying” her family.

Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, had “liked” two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory about Lauren’s 17-year-old brother, David Hogg, another Parkland survivor. The conspiracy theory claims that David has been coached to speak out against guns by his father, a retired FBI agent, in order to somehow deflect blame from the FBI for not preventing the shooting.

Hey @FLOTUS you say that your mission as First Lady is to stop cyber bullying, well then, don’t you think it would have been smart to have a convo with your step-son @DonaldJTrumpJr before he liked a post about a false conspiracy theory which in turn put a target on my back — Lauren Hogg (@lauren_hoggs) February 23, 2018

&created a safe space for people all over the world to call me and my family horrific things that constantly re-victimizes us and our community. I’m 14 I should never have had to deal with any of this and even though I thought it couldn’t get worse it has because of your family. — Lauren Hogg (@lauren_hoggs) February 23, 2018Actress Emma Chambers, who charmed audiences with roles in the 1999 romantic comedy “Notting Hill” and the BBC series “The Vicar of Dibley,” has died at age 53.

“Over the years, Emma created a wealth of characters and an immense body of work. She brought laughter and joy to many, and will be greatly missed,” agent John Grant said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly on Saturday. “At this difficult time we ask that the privacy of the family and loved ones be respected.”

Chambers died of “natural causes” on Wednesday, according to her agent, who gave no additional details.

She was perhaps best known for her role in “Notting Hill” as Hugh Grant’s quirky on-screen sibling, Honey, who quickly bonds with his love interest Julia Roberts.

Grant led tributes to Chambers over the weekend, remembering her as a “hilarious and very warm person and of course a brilliant actress.”

“Notting Hill” screenwriter Richard Curtis also paid his respects.

“We’re obviously terribly sad. She really was a great, great comedy performer and a very fine actress. And a tender, sweet, funny, unusual, loving human being,” Curtis said in a statement to EW. “In my work, she worked opposite Dawn French and Julia Roberts, and was more than the measure of the pair of them.”

Chambers, who was born in Doncaster, England, was beloved by British TV fans for her work on the the BBC comedy “The Vicar of Dibley,” which ran for decades.

She won a British Comedy Award for best television actress in 1998 for her role as Alice Tinker, a village church verger, in the sitcom.

Actress Dawn French, who starred alongside Chambers in the series, shared a sweet photo of the two together, and added that she “loved her. A lot.”

Jon Plowman, executive producer of “The Vicar of Dibley,” described Chambers as “bright and clever,” according to BBC.

“Emma was a gifted comic actress who made any part she played ― no matter how ditzy or other worldly ― look easy,” Plowman said.HUFFPOST

Adding value to our users is one of the guiding principles for every product we build at HuffPost. With that goal in mind, right after the 2016 election we were inspired to create the first version of The Flipside as a tool with a very simple premise: to allow readers to explore the diversity of stories trending on Twitter at any given time on a handful of topics.

Shortly after the initial launch in April of 2017, our team evaluated performance along with user feedback, and immediately identified areas of improvement. In addition to some design and functionality issues, we also realized the experience was not ideal for mobile users.

Taking in all these lessons learned, we reimagined and rebuilt The Flipside from the ground up. We’re proud to introduce this new and improved version today. Some of the most noticeable changes include:

A simplified experience focusing on only one axis that classifies the different media outlets on a scale ranging from liberal to conservative, eliminating clutter and bringing the stories to the foreground.

A user experience designed with a mobile first approach, listing the stories from each source in a stacked column view, making it easier for readers to navigate through the different topics whether you’re browsing on your phone or reading on your laptop.

An overall refined experience, adding small moments of delight throughout, such as animated background for the intro screen

We use Twitter’s Stream API to pull real time tweets that contain a set of editorially chosen terms associated with four topics: freedom of information, international politics, war on terror, and national security. We then parse the tweets for those that contain links to entries from those news sources we’re interested in, and then we list the most recent tweet and stories.

Regarding the methodology: Ideological rankings come from a 2016 study on the political stances of news outlets by the American Association for Public Opinion Research. Not all of the news organizations featured in The Flipside were ranked in this study, so the tool does not include the toggle for those sources.

The Flipside experience is a brand-sponsored initiative which will launch in conjunction with the premiere of the upcoming Hulu Original, ‘The Looming Tower’. It includes promotional ads, quotes and fact cards based on the pulitzer winning book by the same name.

We strongly believe in the value this provides to our users so expect more iterations around this concept in the future!Isolation is such a powerful tool to the subjugator. And yet I don’t believe I would have felt so isolated had it all happened today. One of the most inspiring aspects of this newly energized movement is the sheer number of women who have spoken up in support of one another. And the volume in numbers has translated into volume of public voice. Historically, he who shapes the story (and it is so often a he) creates “the truth.” But this collective rise in decibel level has provided a resonance for women’s narratives. If the Internet was a bête noire to me in 1998, its stepchild ― social media ― has been a savior for millions of women today (notwithstanding all the cyberbullying, online harassment, doxing, and slut-shaming). Virtually anyone can share her or his #MeToo story and be instantly welcomed into a tribe.

The Me Too movement also has helped Lewinsky confront her own story and address it with more nuance. She’s still trying to grasp grey areas of consent between her and Clinton. While she believes what happened “was not sexual assault,” she said it was a “gross abuse of power.”

“I’m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,” she wrote. “I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances ― and the ability to abuse them ― do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)

“I want to be thoughtful,” she continued. “But I know one thing for certain: part of what has allowed me to shift is knowing I’m not alone anymore. And for that I am grateful.”

Head over to Vanity Fair to read Lewinsky’s full essay.Gonzalez reiterated that students who survived the shooting are “tired of being ignored.”

“We are speaking up for those who don’t have anyone listening to them, for those who can’t talk about it just yet, and for those who will never speak again,” she wrote. “We are grieving, we are furious, and we are using our words fiercely and desperately because that’s the only thing standing between us and this happening again.”

She chastised those who have criticized her and her fellow teen activists for being too emotional.

“Adults are saying that children are emotional,” she wrote. “I should hope so ― some of our closest friends were taken before their time because of a senseless act of violence that should never have occurred. If we weren’t emotional, they would criticize us for that, as well.”

And she had a clear message for any adults who believe her and the other teens are being disrespectful.

“Adults are saying that children are disrespectful. But how can we respect people who don’t respect us? We have always been told that if we see something wrong, we need to speak up; but now that we are, all we’re getting is disrespect from the people who made the rules in the first place. Adults like us when we have strong test scores, but they hate us when we have strong opinions.”John Dean, one of the leading figures in the scandal that ended the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, said Donald Trump could be nearing his own Watergate moment.

Former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy against the United States and lying to the Special Counsel’s Office and the FBI. He also agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller.

On Saturday, Dean said the news should be of great concern to former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who faces multiple charges in the case, as well as the White House:

Mueller is throwing everything he can against Manafort, including Gates who can nail him. Increasingly it appears Manafort is the link to Russian collusion. If Gates can testify that Manafort was acting with Trump’s blessings, it’s the end of his presidency. That’s substantial. https://t.co/t6pHNno1xL — John Dean (@JohnWDean) February 25, 2018

Dean added that the possibility Trump could pardon Manafort may not be an issue:

A number of folks have expressed concern in this Manafort thread that Trump will pardon him. Many of the counts in both the VA and DC indictments have state law counterparts that can be charged in NY and VA, where Trump had no pardon power. Checkmate is coming for Paul Manafort. — John Dean (@JohnWDean) February 25, 2018

Dean served as White House counsel to Nixon and was dubbed the “master manipulator” of the Watergate cover-up by the FBI. However, he ultimately cooperated with prosecutors. He has been highly critical of Trump and his administration.Somebody has finally put some numbers on what the Republican effort to undermine Obamacare will mean for everyday Americans.

Come 2019, the number of people without health insurance will rise by nearly 5 million, while millions more will enroll in “short-term” plans, according to Urban Institute research released Monday. The study is the first serious effort to assess the combined effects of several major health policy changes that President Donald Trump and his allies have made over the past year.

Those short-term plans will be popular because they are dirt cheap, relative to the usual price of health insurance. But that’s only because they aren’t available to people with pre-existing conditions and leave out key benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescriptions ― which at least some of those beneficiaries will need when they get sick.

Meanwhile, some people who need or want more comprehensive coverage will have to pay more for it, as the study predicts premiums for such plans will rise 18 percent. And the federal government, which subsidizes plans for lower-income consumers through tax credits, will have to spend more money.

This is still a far cry from full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is what Trump and the Republicans tried to pass last year. But it represents a significant reversal of the changes that the 2010 health care law unleashed.

What Trump And The Republicans Have Done

One of the most significant recent policy shifts is the decision to end the individual mandate, which imposes a fine on people who could afford to pay for insurance but decline to do so. Trump signed tax legislation in December that ends the mandate starting next year.

But that is not the only big change Trump and congressional Republicans are making. Trump is using his executive authority to undermine Obamacare’s insurance rules, including those that prohibit insurers from declining coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, as well as some that require insurers to cover 10 “essential benefits” such as mental health, maternity and prescription drugs.

The most vivid example of this is a regulation the Trump administration formally proposed last week. It would allow insurers to sell “short-term” or “limited duration” plans that would last for up to one year. Such plans can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and don’t have to cover all of the essential benefits, engaging in the sorts of practices that the 2010 health care law sought to prohibit altogether.

These plans have existed for a long time. But they could not last for more than three months under regulations the Obama administration put in place ― and they would not count toward the individual mandate.

The rule didn’t go into effect until in 2016, and some insurers already flout it by packaging together multiple plans so they last for a year. Still, with the mandate in place, the plans have mostly served a relatively small niche market: those with brief lapses in coverage.

What These Changes Would Mean ― And For Whom

With the dissolution of the individual mandate, these changes have potential to shake up the markets for people buying coverage on their own.

People in relatively good health will increasingly sign up for short-term plans, which will be cheaper because they are less widely available and cover fewer services than more regulated Affordable Care Act plans. People with more serious medical needs won’t make the shift, leaving existing plans with a less healthy pool ― forcing insurers to raise premiums for those plans by 18 percent, according to Urban Institute researchers.

To be clear, that is 18 percent above and beyond any other premium increases.

It’s also an average figure, with considerable variation from state to state, and even within individual states. Under the Affordable Care Act, anybody with household income of less than four times the poverty line ― about $100,000 a year for a family of four ― is eligible for tax credits that discount premiums. As the premiums go up, so do the tax credits, insulating these people from the effects of the increases.

But that also means the tax credits will end up putting a greater strain on the federal treasury. The cost of tax credits will go up by about 9 percent, according to the study.

Meanwhile, the number of people without health insurance will go up by several million, according to the Urban study. The actual number depends on how you define insurance.

Overall, Urban’s researchers predict, the number of uninsured people in 2019 should be 4.7 million higher than it would have been if Republicans had not touched the Affordable Care Act at all. That reflects a number of smaller shifts in coverage ― including a decline in Medicaid enrollment because the mandate encourages people to investigate their insurance options and some inevitably discover they fall within Medicaid’s eligibility guidelines.

But even that figure doesn’t fully capture the coverage impact of GOP changes. In particular, it doesn’t include more than 4 million additional people who would be “insured” but have these short-term plans without the pre-existing condition and essential benefit guarantees, the researchers say.

Putting those two numbers together would mean the number of people without comprehensive coverage ― in other words, the type that meets the Affordable Care Act’s standards ― will rise by nearly 9 million, according to the Urban study.

Some Will Win, Some Will Lose, Some Will Lose Big

That is not to say 9 million people will be unhappy.

Some people prefer not to buy insurance, and by next year they won’t have to choose between going without coverage and paying a penalty.

Many who buy short-term plans will appreciate the chance to get insurance for much lower monthly premiums. If not for the availability of short-term plans, some of them would not have gotten any insurance at all. But those plans also don’t provide the same kind of protection against medical bills, which means that some people who buy the plans will discover ― upon getting sick ― they don’t have coverage they need.

Meanwhile, those who already have pre-existing conditions generally won’t have access to these policies. Higher premiums will “disproportionately” hit middle-income Americans who already have health problems, according to the Urban researchers.

Like all projections on the effects of health care policy changes, this latest one is subject to plenty of uncertainty ― in other words, the precise figures aren’t actually that precise. But Urban’s model is widely cited and respected, and few experts would dispute that it is “directionally” correct.ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’ top lawyer Felix Ehrat is leaving the Swiss drugmaker, saying a $1.2 million contract he co-signed with U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney was a mistake.

The contract with Michael Cohen’s Essential Consultants, the same firm used to pay porn star Stormy Daniels, has distracted Novartis’s efforts to improve its image.

“Although the contract was legally in order, it was an error,” Ehrat, 60, said on Wednesday. “As a co-signatory with our former CEO, I take personal responsibility to bring the public debate on this matter to an end.”

Novartis ended the $100,000-per-month contract, signed in early 2017 by Ehrat and former Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez, this year. It was part of efforts to learn more about how the Trump administration might approach U.S. healthcare, Novartis said.

U.S. lawmakers have demanded Novartis and AT&T, which also made payments to Cohen’s firm, provide details and Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has initiated an investigation.

Ehrat, Novartis’s general counsel since 2011, had been expected to leave within the next 1-1/2 years, while Jimenez stepped down on Feb. 1 and was replaced by Vas Narasimhan.

Novartis has said Narasimhan had nothing to do with the Cohen contract and Chairman Joerg Reinhardt said that the board of directors was not aware of it at the time it was signed.

Ehrat will be replaced by chief ethics officer Shannon Klinger who Narasimhan elevated to the executive committee this year as he made cultural change a priority. Novartis said she had not been aware of the Cohen contact.

Front-Page Test

Narasimhan called the contract a major mistake at a meeting with investors in Basel and said Novartis is developing a principles-, not rules-based system to avert corruption.

“There will always be a way around the rule, whereas if you ask the question, ‘Is this the right thing to do, are you comfortable with this being on the front page of the newspaper?’... that’s going to help get us to a better place.”

Since 2015, Novartis has paid out hundreds of millions in settlements and fines as a result of kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China and faces an investigation of alleged bribery in Greece. A trial for another U.S. kickbacks case is scheduled for 2019.

Novartis shareholders have urged Narasimhan to exert more “moral influence” over perceived ethical shortcomings that Jimenez in 2016 blamed on a “results-oriented” sales culture and some bad actors.

Klinger cited changes to bonus schemes for Novartis’s drug sales force that are meant to avoid potential for corruption.

“Any one sales rep can have no more than 40 percent (bonus), so we think that by doing this we have also embedded our values and behaviors for our sales reps,” she said.

Deal Or No Deal

Narasimhan highlighted a dozen medicines in its pipeline that Novartis believes have $1-billion-plus annual sales potential, placing it on track to grow sales and expand profit margins through 2022.

The company will also consider pruning non-core operations, including its U.S. generic pills business, while weighing further bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen its drug portfolio.

Novartis is also considering whether to spin off its Alcon eye surgery division, with any move likely in early 2019, while priority areas for M&A include cancer medicine, cell and gene therapies, liver disease and digital and data science.

Narasimhan made a big bet on gene therapy with an $8.7 billion deal to buy AveXis last month.

But Novartis is unlikely to mimic deals such as Takeda’s $62 billion takeover of Shire which are transforming the pharmaceuticals industry, Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch said.

“I don’t think there is a domino effect if some others were to merge or acquire large scale, that our hands would be forced in any way,” Kirsch told analysts.Prominent NBA agent Dan Fegan died Sunday in a car accident near Aspen, Colo.

Fegan, 56, was driving an SUV that was struck by a bus while trying to cross or merge onto Highway 82, Colorado State Trooper Gabe Easton told the Aspen Times.

Two passengers riding with Fegan, his 5-year-old son and a 29-year-old California woman, sustained serious injuries and were airlifted to a hospital in Denver, Easton told the newspaper.

The bus driver and the one passenger on board reportedly were unhurt. The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority operates the commuter bus, which was headed to Glenwood Springs, Colo.

RFTA chief executive officer Dan Blankenship told the Aspen Times, “The bus didn’t have time to avoid the collision, so it broadsided the other vehicle and knocked it into the median.”

Fegan’s family issued a statement via spokesman Terry Fahn: “Today we lost a great man, father, son and brother who always stood up not only for his clients but also for what he knew was right. We are all shocked and saddened by this tragic development and appreciate the outpouring of support. We ask for privacy at this difficult time.”

Fegan’s client list had included Dwight Howard, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Nene and Ricky Rubio, according to the Aspen Times. The newspaper reported that last year he was fired from his agency, Independent Sports & Entertainment, and the sides subsequently were involved in a lawsuit.

Many colleagues and friends took to social media to remember Fegan:

Ensa Cosby, the second-youngest of the entertainer’s five children and the third of his four daughters, died from renal disease, according to the spokesman, Andrew Wyatt. But he declined to give further details about the circumstances of her death.

“The Cosby Family thanks many people for their prayers for their beloved and beautiful Ensa, who recently died from renal disease,” Wyatt said in a statement.

The celebrity news website TMZ.com reported that Cosby’s daughter died on Friday night in Massachusetts.

The elder Cosby lost his son, Ennis, to gun violence more than a decade ago.

Ensa Cosby made headlines in May 2017 when she released a statement with her older sister, Erinn, on the popular radio show, “The Breakfast Club,” proclaiming their father’s innocence against the multiple rape allegations lodged against him.

The daughters said they were faithful listeners of the show and wanted to use it as a platform to criticize the media’s portrayal of their father, who was best known for his television role as the wise, witty dad on the long-running situation comedy “The Cosby Show.”

“The accusations against my father have been one-sided since the beginning, and when he tried to defend himself he was sued in civil court,” Ensa said in an audio statement that was aired during the morning show. “I strongly believe my father is innocent of the crimes alleged against him and I believe that racism has played a big role in all aspects of this scandal.”

“My father has been publicly lynched in the media,” she added.

Cosby, 80, is scheduled to appear in a Pennsylvania court next week for a hearing on pretrial motions ahead of his scheduled retrial on April 2.

Cosby’s son, Ennis, an educator who had been pursuing a doctoral degree at Columbia University, was shot to death in 1997 by a young Ukrainian immigrant in a botched robbery attempt after the entertainer’s son stopped by the side of a road just off a Los Angeles freeway to change a flat tire. He was 27 at the time.

The film is centered on the Yakuza, or the organized crime groups that work in the shadows in Japan. While the story takes place in Japan, Jared Leto, who is white, was cast as the lead.

Asian-Americans, who’ve long struggled with the lack of representation on-screen, weren’t happy with what they saw.

Yay, another story set in an Asian background, but Asians aren't the protagonist.

Why not have "The Outsider" be about Jared Leto going through an emo phase and then joining an American gang? — Little Drummer Vinh ❇❄⛄ (@Supervinh47) February 24, 2018

In the film, Leto plays an American soldier, Nick Lowell, who finds himself indebted to the Yakuza after World War II and serves the organization to earn his freedom.

Many criticized Netflix for casting a white man as the lead in a film filled with Japanese people and cultural elements, and questioned why a story about the Yakuza couldn’t feature an Asian lead. Others mentioned how the film speaks to the way Asians are cast as background characters but cannot be seen in Hollywood as strong leads.

Netflix did not respond to a request for comment about “The Outsider.” In recent years, the streaming service has been at the center of several casting controversies involving the erasure of Asian-Americans. Back in March, the company found itself in hot water for casting white actor Finn Jones for the lead role of Danny Rand in “Iron Fist.”

Lewis Tan, who ended up playing Zhou Cheng in “Iron Fist,” was passed over for lead, though he is of Asian descent. Tan appeared in just one episode of the series. His performance drew praise, with many referring to the actor as the best part of the series.Rick Santorum, former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, suggested that absent fathers and broken homes could be part of the reason for mass shootings.

“Gun control is a debate that we need to have,” Santorum said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. However, he also said there was “another debate” we should have, and that’s “the fact that these kids come from broken homes without dads.”

“That is not something we’re talking about and that is the commonality,” Santorum said. “We want to talk about things we can work together on? How about working together to try to see what we can do to get more dads involved in the lives of the kids.”

See the full discussion in the clip above.

Santorum has a history of making disparaging comments about single mothers as well.

“What we have is moms raising children in single-parent households simply breeding more criminals,” he said in 1994 per Mother Jones.

Santorum also said single mothers just needed politicians who weren’t afraid of “kicking them in the butt.” His plan at the time would’ve denied benefits to women who did not identify the fathers of their children.

In 2011, Santorum dismissively called single mothers the base of the Democratic Party because they need government.A shadowy white supremacist group’s extensive chat logs, obtained by ProPublica, reveal shocking comments hailing the murder of a gay Jewish college student.

Californian Samuel Woodward is charged with the stabbing death of University of Pennsylvania student Blaze Bernstein, 19, in January. His body was buried in a shallow grave in Orange County, California. Woodward has pleaded not guilty.

Woodward, 20, is an avowed member of extremist group Atomwaffen Division (“nuclear weapons division”), whose members idolize Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson. Other group members have been linked to four other murders in the last eight months.

Atomwaffen Division promotes hatred of minorities, gays and Jews, and advocates a race war. The group’s YouTube videos show masked members firing weapons and burning the U.S. Constitution.

Among the 250,000 encrypted messages written over a six-month period that ProPublica obtained, one person hailed Woodward as a “one-man gay Jew wrecking crew.” Another said of an earlier ProPublica report on the slaying: “I love this.” Some were concerned about leakers talking to the media, and one warned: “Rats and traitors get the rope first.”

One person hoped Bernstein’s killing would inspire “copycat crimes.” Another commented that Bernstein “deserved” to die, but wasn’t certain if life imprisonment was worth it.

Woodward used to be part of the chats, and had railed at “Jews and mongrels” and gays, ProPublica reported. He praised Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and war rapes.

Group members also praised mass murderers, including Timothy McVeigh, who blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people, including children at a day-care center inside.

The Anti-Defamation League has issued a warning about Atomwaffen and its preparations for a “race war.” The group promotes the idea that “democracy and capitalism have ‘given way to Jewish oligarchies and globalist bankers resulting in the cultural and racial displacement of the white race,’” notes the ADL, quoting the group. Members “have been linked to violent crimes including murder and alleged plots to attack civilians, nuclear facilities and synagogues.”

The chats reveal information about some 20 Atomwaffen “cells” throughout the country, and “hate camps” training sessions where members practice shooting, according to ProPublica. The chats also include talk of terrorism, including attacks on water and power systems.

There were no helicopters flying in with a cure. There were no healthy people pretending to be zombies. There were no zombies wearing uninfected dentures.

Despite everyone’s desperate attempts to theorize how Carl (Chandler Riggs) would survive the zombie bite he received in Season 8, Episode 6, nothing could stop the inevitable from happening in Sunday night’s midseason premiere: Carl Grimes finally bit the dust.

Some other things happened in the episode, like Carol (Melissa McBride) and Morgan (Lennie James) fighting the Saviors, but who really cares? That’s just superfluous action taking away from the real point of the show, which was saying goodbye to Carl, who is pretty definitely dead.

After the younger Grimes shared some emotional moments with various characters, including his baby sister, and schooled his dad, Rick (Andrew Lincoln), with a speech on making the world a better place and not just murdering all the Saviors, we hear a gunshot as Carl takes his own life offscreen. Cut to seeing him under a sheet as Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Rick prepare to bury him.

Sure, he might show up in future dream sequences or hallucinations, but that’s basically it for the character.

Riggs said his farewell in a tweet.

my final episode of the walking dead airs tonight.



i’ll be on talking dead afterwards to elaborate on how much the cast, the crew, and the show as a whole meant to me.



i hope i’ll see you there. — chandler riggs (@chandlerriggs) February 25, 2018

Plus, AMC probably wouldn’t have sent out these delicious pudding bars if Carl was gonna survive.

AMC puddin' us down lightly. HuffPost

I actually wish they’d kill Carl every week, if it means more pudding bars. But for others, the gesture wasn’t so sweet.

Everytime I see this bite on Carl's abdomen I stupseee because this is the shittiest way they could've killed him off. Chandler and Carl deserved better than this.

Truly, the backlash to Carl’s death has been going on since the Season 8 midseason finale late last year, when fans learned he was suffering from a zombie bite and would likely die in the next episode.

The character is pivotal in the comics ― and still has a lot of storylines that the show hasn’t explored ― so viewers were livid, calling for showrunner Scott Gimple to be fired. Even Chandler Riggs’ father posted (and later deleted) a scathing Facebook comment about Gimple after Carl’s upcoming death was revealed. (Riggs’ father did not reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.)

In a conference call a few days before Sunday’s episode, Riggs gave his response to the intense fan reaction and his thoughts on his character’s impending death.

“When [the midseason finale] first aired, the amount of messages that I got on Reddit, the amount of comments that I got on Instagram and then Twitter and everything, it was really just kind of overwhelming to see the amount of support from fans that were super sad to see my character go,” he said. “But the majority of them were just really, really excited to see where I go next, and that’s kind of the attitude that I had towards it, and I’m really happy that a lot of my fans had the same attitude towards it as well.”

More upsetting than his character dying is the manner in which Carl got the zombie bite, which was objectively pretty lame. After surviving seven seasons of zombies and making it out of impossible situations, Carl decides to try to kill a small group of walkers with the help of Siddiq (Avi Nash). After struggling with a one of them, he falls over. And boom. A bite. Oh, and he had a gun, so he could’ve just shot them the whole time.

Riggs himself joked about the death on Twitter.

when u spend like 3 years in the apocalypse but die bc you tripped and fell — chandler riggs (@chandlerriggs) February 2, 2018

Regardless, he claims he’s not salty. During the conference call, he explained how the death and the speech he gave to Rick will affect the show in the future.

“I’m not bitter about it. It’s such, like, an innocent way to go out, and it’s kind of what Carl’s really embodying in these last episodes and kind of sums up Carl as a whole and proves that he knows that there is something after the war. It’s not just killing and killing and killing and killing. There’s got to be some sort of hope for Judith and for Maggie’s baby and anyone,” he said.

In an interview with HuffPost late last year, we asked Gimple (the man who had the final word on Carl’s death sentence) about fans’ responses to the reveal, and he admitted, yeah, it’s been rough.

“I’m focused more on the show itself. I’m just thinking about Chandler, and the cast and crew and all the people put together, but it’s tough,” he said. “I knew it would be tough for the people who have been following the story for so long, and it’s the kind of turns the story takes that are so painful.”

Gimple also stressed that the events of the midseason premiere were critical to the “whole story” and how it will affect the other characters.

AdvertisementTV news is really for the birds sometimes.

Just ask Nichelle Medina, who co-hosts the morning news on San Diego station KFMB.

On Friday, Medina was doing a tease for an upcoming segment with the San Diego Zoo Safari Park when one of the guests literally flew in for a cameo right on cue, according to Inside Edition.

The unexpected guest was “Sophie,” a 10-year-old scarlet Ibis who flew in when Medina said: “Good for weeding your garden of bugs.”

When the bird landed on her noggin, she immediately winged this line: “Or flying onto my head.”

Medina’s co-anchor, Eric Kahnert, was impressed by the bird’s impeccable timing.

“How’s that for an introduction?” he asked.

Sophie managed to be removed from Medina’s head before it could build a nest.

For her part, the anchorwoman tried to see the positives from her impromptu Ibis interaction by pointing out it was a nice scalp massage.

“I needed that,” she quipped.

The video has started to go viral, something that Kahnert thought was ironic.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he would have personally fought off the school shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School even while not armed, despite the fact that he previously deferred military service due to bone spurs in his foot.

“I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,” he said during a White House event with the nation’s governors.

Trump was referring to criticism against law enforcement officials, including an armed guard at the school who failed to swiftly respond to the gun massacre in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month.

When later asked to clarify Trump’s comments, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that he didn’t actually mean that he would “run in” to the school.

“I think he was just stating that as a leader, he would have stepped in and hopefully been able to help,” she said.

Trump has previously expressed disgust for seeing blood, saying that “it’s just not my thing.”

“I’m not good for medical. In other words, if you cut your finger and there’s blood pouring out, I’m gone,” he told radio host Howard Stern in 2008.

In the same interview, he went on to describe a charity event at his Mar-a-Lago resort, during which he looked away when a man fell off the stage and started bleeding.

“He was right in front of me and I turned away. I didn’t want to touch him … he’s bleeding all over the place, I felt terrible,” Trump said. “You know, beautiful marble floor, didn’t look like it. It changed color. Became very red.”

Last week, Trump proposed that one of the solutions to the nation’s epidemic of school shootings should involve arming teachers, and that teachers who receive training to carry a weapon at school should receive a pay bonus.

“A teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened,” the president said Friday while addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Earlier Monday, Florida attorney general and Trump ally Pam Bondi (R), similarly claimed that she would have gone after the shooter without a weapon.About 13.4 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority customers are still without electricity five months after Hurricane Maria ― a situation that Akon feels he could have helped prevent.

During a TMZ interview posted Saturday, the rapper revealed that his philanthropic venture Akon Lighting Africa had proposed to restore power on the island but was turned down by the U.S. government.

“We actually presented a program for Puerto Rico and we got rejected,” Akon told TMZ. “We have the solution for Puerto Rico, clearly. We would’ve had power up in less than 30 days and they rejected us.”

Hurricane Maria plunged Puerto Rico into near darkness in late September, when the deadly storm ravaged the island’s decades-old power grid. The job of restoring power initially went to Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based firm. That $300 million contract was heavily criticized due to the company’s limited experience, its suspected connections to the Trump administration and a lack of transparency during the contract’s bidding process. The Puerto Rican government canceled the contract in late October.

Akon’s organization says it has brought electricity to people in at least 14 African countries using multiple modes of solar energy ― including solar street lamps, micro-generators, charging stations and home kits.

When asked why his bid to help Puerto Rico was denied, Akon said it was a matter of “politics, special interest and propaganda.”Name a truly awesome matchup for “Celebrity Family Feud.”

Survey says: Kanye West’s family versus the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Yes, it’s a real thing ― the episode taped this past weekend.

On Saturday, West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, stoked internet curiosity with this tweet:

Guess what the fam is doing today!?!?! — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 24, 2018

Apparently, she couldn’t keep the secret for long. Five minutes later, she spilled the beans:

The couple played on the same team, along with three of West’s relatives. The Kardashian-Jenner team included Kris Jenner, her mother Mary Jo “M.J.” Campbell, and daughters Khloe Kardashian and Kendall Jenner. Family friend Jonathan Cheban was also at the taping, though E! News reported it was unclear which team he was on.

West’s appearance on the show was the culmination of a lifelong dream for him, according to a Snapchat video Kim Kardashian posted before the taping.

“If you guys don’t know, Kanye and I are the biggest fans of ‘Family Feud,’” she said in the post. “Kanye said he’s waited his whole life for this moment: ‘Family Feud.’ We’re playing against the Kardashian Jenners vs. the Wests. And I have a really good feeling about this, that we’re going to win.”

However, she didn’t do well on at least one question, according to an insider quoted by Page Six.

At one point, host Steve Harvey reportedly asked Kardashian, “What is a body part that you’re constantly bumping into things with?”

“Her reply was ‘my butt,’ and the answer resulted in a zero,” the insider said.

In June 2018, there will be 2,823 emoji in the Unicode Standard ― the global specification that ensures characters are interpreted the same across platforms. But nowhere in that list ― which has everything from zombies (both male and female!) to smiling poop ― is there an emoji to signify birth control. At least, not yet.

This April, Nora Hamada and her friend Megan Giller, sent in an application to the Unicode Consortium for what they believe is the first-ever emoji to represent birth control (Disclaimer: Giller freelances for Engadget as a copy editor). Hamada came up with the idea earlier this year when she joined an emoji proposal workshop in New York City out of curiosity. The workshop was run by Emojination, a grassroots organization dedicated to making emoji more inclusive. Emojination was created because the Unicode Consortium, the organization that selects and approves of emojis, is mostly comprised of multinational tech companies. There are 12 full voting members, which include Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, German software company SAP and Shopify. The only non-tech entity in this list is the government of Oman. In order to be a full voting member, you have to pay $18,000 a year (There are lower membership tiers as well, but not all of them have voting privileges). Emojination co-founder Jennifer 8. Lee found it odd that just a handful of corporate and government entities decide the world’s emoji. Now, she helps people submit applications for emoji they think is missing from our cultural lexicon. Some of Emojination’s more successful projects include the dumpling (universal cross-cultural food), the hijab (muslim women representation) and the ballet flat (a woman’s shoe that’s not a high heel).

Lee happened to be the one leading the Emojination workshop the day Hamada attended. Hamada was inspired by Lee’s story, and was fascinated that anybody ― even you and me ― can submit an emoji application. She thought about what new emoji she could introduce that would be a positive change to the world.

“I immediately came up with the birth control emoji,” said Hamada. “When you search for emoji to represent women and safe sex, the things that come up most often are breastfeeding and babies.” But she feels that there should also be an emoji for women like herself, who have decided not to have children. Giller feels the same way, which prompted their collaboration.

Hamada and Giller posit that the invention of the birth control pill in the 1960s also signifies a historical turning point, where women were finally able to take control over their own bodies and subsequently, their own lives. A Smithsonian magazine article in 2013 noted that “the successes of the feminist movement, and the mass entry of women into the workforce, the professions and academia, might not have been possible without the pill’s power of predictability.”

As such, Hamada and Giller believe that the birth control pill is also a symbol for feminism and female empowerment. “It stands for equality and the right to choose,” said Giller. “Frankly, I can’t believe a birth control emoji had never been done before,” said Hamada.

Durex

Well, that’s almost true. Back in 2015, condom-maker Durex applied for a condom emoji to be added to the Unicode Standard. It even ran a publicity campaign on social media and elsewhere to promote the idea, complete with a #CondomEmoji hashtag. “An official safe sex emoji will enable young people to overcome embarrassment around the discussion of safe sex,” the company claimed, adding that it would also raise awareness of protection against STDs.

Ultimately though, the condom emoji application was denied. Engadget was unable to get an answer as to why from Unicode or Durex, but through conversations with Hamada, Giller and Lee, there are a few possible reasons.

One is that the condom emoji application was spearheaded by a company that would benefit financially from the popularization of said emoji, and that might not have been acceptable. Lee also said that the proposal itself likely was not a very good one (you can study it for yourself here). Another, more official answer, is that Unicode turned it down because industry partners like Facebook and Google didn’t support it, perhaps for not being family-friendly enough.

When asked why she thinks there might not have been a birth control emoji before, Hamada says that it could be because Unicode is an international organization, and is therefore averse to anything deemed too political. “There are groups of people that look down on birth control,” she said. “It’s possible that’s part of it.”

“Remember that the emoji are universally implemented on keyboards around the world,” said Lee. “So the emoji have to be things vendors [like Apple and Google] are comfortable putting in all markets and all cultures.” She pointed out, for example, that the same sex family emoji was frowned upon in Russia, and that alcohol emoji like wine and beer was an issue in Muslim countries. Unicode got around the latter issue by calling them “wine glass” and “beer mug” emoji respectively, which was deemed acceptable.

Perhaps savvy to this nuance in language, Hamada and Giller titled their emoji “Pills in a circular case.” But it was still clearly defined as an emoji symbolizing birth control, complete with a lengthy description as to the historical importance of the pill and how relevant it is in today’s society. They also included various cases in which it would be suitable, and how it’s frequently requested in social media.

The emoji is that of a circular case because of its iconic imagery, which Hamada and Giller say is generally recognized as synonymous with the pill. Using the standard pill emoji is insufficient, they argue, because that’s often used in reference to illegal drugs and parties. On the other hand, using other emoji like eggplant, hot dog and lipstick to talk about safe sex isn’t right either. There are examples of workarounds like a baby emoji followed by a giant X and then a pill, but that’s a little too complex.

Birth control pill emoji version 1 and version 2 Aphee Messer

Hamada and Giller made their case in a lengthy nine-page application, which they compiled and submitted with the help of Lee and Emojination. Lee also matched them with a designer, who created a mock up of what the emoji might look like.

After a few weeks, the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee ― which processes all the emoji applications ― came back asking for some revisions. They wanted a different version of the image ― the first one was tilted to the side, so it wasn’t as obvious as to what it was ― along with some statistics that would compare its use against an already existing emoji. They had the designer create a newer, cleaner emoji, and are now working on including those aforementioned stats.

Of course, it’s still early days, and the application process is a fairly lengthy one. Unicode says on its site that it often takes up to two years for an emoji to go from application to approval. And even then, each of the vendors (eg. Apple, Google, Facebook) need time to create their own version for their platform.

Hamada remains hopeful. After all, the subcommittee didn’t outright deny it, and seemed to express some interest. In the meantime, Hamada said they were recently interviewed as part of an upcoming yet-to-be-named documentary about emoji. “I find the whole process fascinating,” she said.

Plus, she thinks the application is particularly timely during a climate where female reproductive rights might be in danger. “Our rights for birth control are being taken away. In a way, this is a small form of protest against that.”

Upon its release in 2013, the animated Disney film was praised for its perceived pro-LGBTQ themes, with the lyrics of the Oscar-winning song “Let it Go” being read as a “coming-out anthem.”

Conceal don’t feel, don’t let them know

Well now they know ...

Let it go, let it go

Can’t hold it back anymore - “Let it Go,” “Frozen”

Eventually, fans took it the next step, with petitions and a campaign for Disney to #GiveElsaAGirlfriend in “Frozen 2.”

#GiveElsaAGirlfriend cuz damn if there was representation when I was a kid I would have known that luv isn't only between a guy and girl — gabzy (@gabzydiana) May 2, 2016

Idina Menzel, who voices Queen Elsa, said she’s excited people are talking about the possibility. “Frozen” writer and co-director Jennifer Lee has heard the speculation, too.

In an interview ahead of the release of her new movie “A Wrinkle in Time,” we asked Lee her thoughts on the idea of Elsa having a girlfriend, and whether there’s been any coupling talk between creators behind the scenes.

“I love everything people are saying [and] people are thinking about with our film ― that it’s creating dialogue, that Elsa is this wonderful character that speaks to so many people,” Lee said. “It means the world to us that we’re part of these conversations.”

“Where we’re going with it, we have tons of conversations about it, and we’re really conscientious about these things,” Lee added. “For me ... Elsa’s every day telling me where she needs to go, and she’ll continue to tell us. I always write from character-out, and where Elsa is and what Elsa’s doing in her life, she’s telling me every day. We’ll see where we go.”

A few recent Disney moments have received attention for being pro-LGTBQ.

For example, there was the scene in 2017′s “Beauty and the Beast,” when we see a glimpse of LeFou dancing with another man. (Although director Bill Condon called the scene an “exclusively gay moment” ahead of the film’s release, some critics later said it fell short of expectations.)

And after “Finding Dory” hit theaters in 2016, fans wondered whether one scene featured a lesbian couple. (“Finding Dory” director Andrew Stanton said, “They can be whatever you want them to be.”)

Even though Disney continues to be coy when it comes to discussing LGBTQ themes in its movies, the idea that there are “tons of conversations” about Elsa’s future ― and that Disney is being “conscientious” with the story ― should give supporters some hope.

Much like the themes in “Frozen,” Lee’s new film “A Wrinkle in Time” is also about accepting yourself and sharing that with the world.

It’s “about giving hope, but how hope is earned,” Lee said. “It’s earned by hard work. It’s earned by believing that no matter who you are, where you are, what you think about yourself, you have an important role to play in the world. Accept yourself and just get going. We need you.”

Those themes will most likely still be present when “Frozen 2” rolls out in 2019. Whether Elsa’s future girlfriend is also present remains to be seen.
