Faith is supposed to be a source of strength for believers, especially during times of struggle and sorrow. However, a new study suggests that religiosity may be linked to negative feelings among queer individuals ― including increases in suicidal behaviors.

The study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine last month, is a chilling revelation of the ties between suicide and theology that doesn’t affirm queer identity.

“Religious groups who stigmatize LGBT people should be aware of the potential damage they can do to an individual and families, and honestly the damage they do to themselves as an organization,” study co-author John R. Blosnich told HuffPost.

Blosnich, of West Virginia University’s Injury Control Research Center, said that for decades, studies have indicated that religion generally protects people against thoughts of suicide. But the research has also shown that religion specifically doesn’t have that impact on those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning.

In order to study religiosity and suicidal ideation among sexual minorities, Blosnich and his fellow researchers turned to data collected by the University of Texas at Austin’s Research Consortium. The consortium produces national, large-scale studies on the mental health of college students. Its latest 2011 study surveyed 21,247 students aged 18 to 30 years old.

Out of this group, about 2.3 percent identified as lesbian or gay, 3.3 percent identified as bisexual and 1.1 percent said they were questioning their sexuality. (About 0.2 percent identified as transgender, which was too small of a sample to analyze.)

The students were asked to rate how important their religious or spiritual beliefs were to their personal identity. They were also asked a number of questions about whether they had ever seriously considered or attempted suicide.

Analyzing this data, the research team found that while 3.7 percent of heterosexual young adults reported recent thoughts of suicide, the percentages were significantly higher among queer youth. Those questioning their sexuality had the highest rate of recent thoughts about suicide at 16.4 percent, followed by bisexual individuals (11.4 percent) and lesbian or gay individuals (6.5 percent).

Five percent of heterosexual youth reported attempting suicide in their lifetimes, compared to 20 percent of bisexual youth, 17 percent of questioning youth and 14 percent of gay or lesbian youth.

Notably, the study authors found that religion may have acted as a protective factor against suicide attempts among heterosexual youth. Each increase in the level of importance of religion among straight youth was associated with a 17 percent reduction in recent suicide attempts.

On the other hand, for lesbian and gay youth, increasing levels of religious importance were associated with increased odds of recent suicidal ideation. In fact, lesbian and gay youth who said that religion was important to them were 38 percent more likely to have had recent suicidal thoughts, compared to lesbian and gay youth who reported religion was less important. Religiosity among lesbians alone was linked to a 52 percent increased chance of recent suicidal ideation.

Questioning youth who said religion was important to them were nearly three times as likely to have attempted suicide recently, compared to questioning youth who reported religion was less important.

For bisexual individuals, the importance of religion was not significantly associated with suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.

Overall, sexual minorities were also more likely than straight youth to report that religion was not important to them.

Blosnich said that sexual minorities who have greater religious belief may experience conflict between their faith and their sexual identity.

“It can be very scary to be caught in a space where your religion tells you that you are a ‘sinner’ just for being who you are,” he told HuffPost. “Sexual minority people may feel abandoned, they may experience deep sadness and anger, and they may worry what this means for their families ― especially if their families are very religious too.”

Studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also found that lesbian, gay and bisexual youth seriously contemplate or attempt suicide at higher rates than heterosexual youth.

Blosnich said he’s not sure if societal changes since 2011 ― most notably the national legalization of same-sex marriage ― would lead to different results today. Large-scale surveys that ask about suicidal behavior, sexual orientation and religion are “very rare,” he said, which is why the team used the 2011 data. That survey looked only at college students, which means the findings may also not be generalizable to the broader LGBQ community.

The authors noted that the original data also did not include questions about whether respondents’ religions advocated stigmatizing beliefs about sexual minorities.

“There are some serious questions we have to begin asking ourselves if maintaining one interpretation of our sacred text is demonstrably linked to bodily harm and spiritual devastation for an entire group of people.” - Amelia Markham, a queer Christian activist

While these conservative denominations instruct believers to treat lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals with love, most encourage queer people to either remain celibate their entire lives or enter into mixed-orientation marriages.

Amelia Markham is a queer Christian activist with The Reformation Project, which works for the inclusion of LGBTQ people in the Christian church. They think Blosnich’s study demonstrates that for many queer people, non-affirming theology is at best problematic and at worst lethal ― “no matter how kindly or compassionately” it is articulated.

A number of Christian leaders are working toward a more nuanced view of queer sexuality, Markham said, but more needs to be done.

“There are some serious questions we have to begin asking ourselves if maintaining one interpretation of our sacred text is demonstrably linked to bodily harm and spiritual devastation for an entire group of people,” Markham said. “That is something I hope religious folks across the board would begin to think and pray more critically through.”

In 2015, the Mormon church adopted a new policy that declared Mormons in same-sex marriages to be apostates subject to excommunication. George Frey via Getty Images

The Mormon church views queer relationships as sinful. In November 2015, it declared that Mormons in such relationships were to be considered apostates.

Diane Oviatt, a Mormon mother with a gay son, is part of Mama Dragons, a group of parents who have banded together to advocate for their queer children. She believes that non-affirming theology has a “direct” effect on suicidal ideation among LGBTQ youth and young adults. The Mormon church prioritizes marriage and formation of a “traditional” family, she said, and LGBTQ Mormons struggle with the fact that they don’t fit into that mold.

“There is absolutely no room for homosexuality anywhere in the doctrine,” she told HuffPost. “Our kids are stripped of hope and faced with the notion that they, by virtue of their sexual identity, are ruining their celestial ‘forever’ family and will be separated from them in the hereafter if they choose a same-sex partner.”

The only options left to queer Mormon teens are celibacy or mixed-orientation marriages, “both of which have extremely high levels of dissatisfaction and despair,” Oviatt said.

What LGBTQ kids need, she said, are religious communities that accept them wholeheartedly.

The Naming Project is one such community. The Christian ministry, which seeks to create safe spaces for LGBTQ youth, organizes an annual summer camp in Minnesota for teens of any sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.

Project director Ross Murray said that ministries like his aim to provide support and affirmation to youth who may feel rejected by their own faith communities. When more religious groups affirm LGBTQ teens as their “whole and authentic selves,” he said, it will lead to healthier adult LGBTQ people of faith.

“When religious communities are affirming and supportive of identity, including sexual orientation and gender identity, then the people within those communities are going to develop into much healthier and better-functioning individuals who understand themselves and how they relate to the rest of the world,” Murray said.

As a child growing up in a non-affirming church, Isaac Archuleta said he experienced depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and substance abuse. Today, he identifies as bisexual and serves as the interim executive director of the Q Christian Fellowship. As a Colorado-based psychotherapist, he focuses on providing therapy to LGBTQ clients and their religious families.

Archuleta said he believes mental health providers should always affirm their clients’ sexual orientation and gender identity. Counselors who, for religious reasons, do not truly accept their LGBTQ clients end up promoting the shame from which their clients need to be rescued. They’re “working against love even though they preach a message of love,” he said.

Studies like the one conducted by Blosnich’s team are necessary, Archuleta argued, to help educate the non-affirming church.

“The most devastating effect for children in non-affirming religious environments, in my opinion, is an identity distortion that teaches the child to feel valueless as a relational being,” Archuleta said. “When a child feels unwelcome, too damaged for relationships, we strip them of their very purpose and sense of worth.”

“For a religion to have such a capacity and the willingness to maintain that maladaptive power is, in my opinion, antithetical to the God of love.”Lukas Schulze via Getty Images

Since opening the brothel doors, Schwarz said men all over Germany have patronized the establishment -- and claims 70 percent have come back. "For many it is not a fetish but more of a curiosity," she said, according to the Mirror.Neopets, a virtual pets website popular in the early aughts, employed business practices connected to the Church of Scientology, according to a recent report.

The Outline revealed in a Wednesday report that former Neopets’s CEO and investor Doug Dohring was a Scientologist who used the so-called Org Board method. Scientology creator L. Ron Hubbard designed this trademark business model for his followers.

To fully educate yourself on Org Board, you need to complete introductory workshops so information about how it works exactly isn’t completely available. However, the Outline broke down the business model by describing its seven divisions. There are the “Communications, Dissemination (sales/marketing), Treasury, Production, Qualifications (quality control), Public (public relations), and, most important to the system, Executive.”

While this doesn’t seem that odd considering most businesses have hierarchy structures in place, Patricia Illingworth, a professor at Northeastern University and a Senior Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government’s Carr Center for Human Rights at Harvard, told the publication that “the model is less ethical than it appears.”

Illingworth noted that a department in the communications division, the department of inspections and reports, essentially spied on other employees and shared “pertinent” information with executives.

“The [department of inspections and] report’s section on ethics is really about a very primitive sense of justice, an eye for an eye, getting back at people who have in some sense harmed the organization,” Illingworth told The Outline.

“If someone in or outside the organization has done something that undercuts the mission of the organization, which is basically making money, then the organization, in the name of ethics, is advised to retaliate against the person in order to ensure that they don’t do it,” she said.

She went on to say that the entire business model was “morally problematic,” adding that “the idea that an organization should fire employees for having views that are different from those of the organization is morally disconcerting even when we don’t share the views, or we are adamantly against them.”

Like Illingworth, Neopet’s founders were against associating the company with Scientology. Co-creator Donna Williams said in a Reddit AMA in 2014 that the company “hired this lady who wanted to bring Scientology onto the site.” Williams said she, alongside co-creator Adam Powell, “fought that as hard as we could and they got rid of her.”

“At one time there was some talk about putting Scientology education on the site, but we killed that idea pretty sharpish,” she wrote. “Adam [Powell] and I made sure that it never made its way onto anything site related. Religion and politics were two big no-nos for us as far as site content went.”

Williams also said she and the other founders suspected the connection about six months after the new staff started working there. She then Googled the employees and discovered that “were all Scientologists.”

“When we realized it was a bit of a shock,” she said. “Somewhat awkward moment when you realize you started the biggest entertainment site visited by millions of children and teens, but the upper management you just signed the company over to are part of some weird religion that is banned in some countries.”

Neopets’ business model has since changed, as the company was sold to Viacom in 2005. The Outline said that representatives for Viacom and former employees with Neopets did not reply to their requests for comment.

Many on social media were in total shock about the news that the children’s website site has such an unlikely background:

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A false alarm led to Syrian air defense missiles being fired overnight and there was no fresh attack on Syria, a commander in the regional military alliance that backs the Syrian government told Reuters.

Syrian state TV reported overnight that anti-aircraft defenses had shot down missiles fired at an air base in the Homs area, and a media unit run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah said missiles had also targeted an air base near Damascus.

The commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity, attributed the malfunction to “a joint electronic attack” by Israel and the United States targeting the Syrian radar system.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has delayed imposing additional sanctions on Russia and is unlikely to approve them unless Moscow carries out a new cyber attack or some other provocation, a senior administration official said on Monday.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday that Washington was preparing new sanctions on Russia over its support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“The ambassador got out ahead of things this time,” the senior administration official, who deals with the issue, told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The Washington Post first reported that Trump had put a stop to a plan for additional economic sanctions on Russia.

The official said Trump was concerned that immediately imposing more sanctions, on the heels of last weekend’s U.S.-led strike against Russian-backed Assad, would interfere with his efforts to negotiate agreements with Russian President Vladimir Putin on combating Islamic extremism, policing the internet and other issues.

The United States has taken a series of recent measures against Russia, including expelling diplomats over a poisoning case in Britain and imposing sanctions against 24 Russians, including Putin allies, over interference in the U.S. presidential election and other “malign activity.” Moscow has denied any wrongdoing.

On Monday, the administration accused Russian government-backed hackers of a global cyber attack on routers and other networking equipment.

The official said Trump had expressed concern that if the administration did not proceed cautiously, tensions between Washington and Moscow - already at their worst since the Cold War - could escalate dangerously, the official said.

Asked for comment, the White House gave an identical response to an earlier statement by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said: “We are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future.”

HOLDING OFF ‘A LITTLE WHILE’

Another senior administration official said Haley had gotten a little bit ahead of herself by saying more sanctions were coming, but not by much.

“They were discussed but it was decided to hold off for a little while,” that official said.

Haley’s office declined to comment.

Trump still believes he can negotiate with Putin, but that it is not likely to be productive if he is also criticizing him repeatedly, the first official said.

Trump criticized Putin after the suspected gas attack in Syria for backing “Animal Assad,” but he has not done so again.

Washington has said it had proof that Syrian forces conducted the deadly chemical weapons attack on April 7.

If the U.S. sanctions were enacted, they would be the second such batch in just over a year against Syria’s weapons of mass destruction program.A journalist who had been investigating the deaths of alleged Russian mercenaries in Syria died in a hospital on Sunday after falling from his balcony in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg.

Maxim Borodin, a 32-year-old reporter for the Yekaterinburg-based Ria Novy Den news agency, was known for his coverage of high-profile corruption and criminal cases. He fell from his fifth-floor balcony on Thursday, The New York Times reported, and neighbors found him critically injured at the foot of the building. He was rushed to the hospital, where he died from his injuries three days later.

A spokesman for the interior ministry for the Sverdlovsk region told CNN that Borodin’s apartment was found locked from the inside, suggesting that “no one exited the apartment and most likely there were no strangers in there” at the time of his fall.

Local investigators said they were considering several possible causes of death but that no crime was suspected at this time, the BBC reported.

Some of Borodin’s friends and colleagues, however, have expressed skepticism at this assessment. One friend, Paulina Andreevna, said in a Facebook post that Borodin had been hospitalized earlier this month after a stranger attacked him outside his home. Last October, an assailant reportedly hit Borodin over the head with a steel pipe shortly after he’d reported on a controversial movie about Tsar Nicholas II.

“[Borodin’s] work was very dangerous,” friend and local civil rights activist Vyacheslav Bashkov told The Guardian this week. “He was one of the best.”

“As Maxim had big plans for his personal life and career, there is nothing to support a verdict of suicide.” - Paulina Rumyantseva, editor-in-chief of Ria Novy Den

Bashkov said Borodin had contacted him early in the morning on the day before his fall to say that men in “camouflage and masks” were surrounding his apartment. He reportedly described “someone with a weapon on his balcony” and others “on the staircase landing.”

But Borodin later called back to say he may have been mistaken about the masked men and that they were security personnel taking part in a training exercise, Bashkov said.

Paulina Rumyantseva, editor-in-chief of Ria Novy Den, said Borodin’s fall could have been the result of foul play or an accident. But suicide, she said, was an unlikely cause.

“As Maxim had big plans for his personal life and career, there is nothing to support a verdict of suicide,” she told CNN.

As an investigative journalist, Borodin had written about many sensitive subjects over the course of his career. Most recently, he’d reported on the February deaths of alleged Russian mercenaries linked to a shadowy paramilitary organization known as the “Wagner Group” in Syria.

Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin is suspected of bankrolling the Wagner Group. The U.S. indicted him in February on charges of backing the so-called troll factory that spearheaded Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Thousands of Wagner mercenaries are allegedly involved in military operations in Syria. In February, dozens — or possibly hundreds — of them reportedly died in a clash with U.S. troops near the town of Deir al-Zour. As the New Yorker noted, it was the first time in half a century that Russian and U.S. military forces had engaged in direct combat.

Media watchdog groups have called for an impartial investigation into Borodin’s sudden death.

On Monday, Harlem Désir, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s representative on freedom of the media, expressed shock and “serious concern” over what had happened.

LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday she regretted Britain’s role in anti-gay legislation across its former colonies, seeking to address criticism of the Commonwealth at its gathering in London.

May is looking to reinvigorate the Commonwealth, a 53-country network of mostly former colonies, as Britain seeks new post-Brexit ways to project its influence in the world and establish a role as a leader of free trade.

Speaking on the second day of a week-long meeting in London, May addressed a wide range of humanitarian and environmental issues, including laws which outlaw same-sex activity in 37 of its 53 member nations.

“I am all too aware that these laws were often put in place by my own country. They were wrong then and they are wrong now,” May said.

“As the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister I deeply regret both the fact that such laws were introduced and the legacy of discrimination, violence and even death that persists today.”

London’s hosting of the summit has also been clouded by an official admission that the British government had treated migrants who arrived from Caribbean countries more than 50 years ago in an “appalling” way by incorrectly identifying them as illegal immigrants.

Speaking alongside May, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness drew loud cheers from the audience as he urged May to speedily respond to the issue.

“It is only fair,” he said. “It will lead to security, certainly for those who have been affected, and it is the kind of inclusive prosperity for which we stand as Commonwealth peoples.”

May herself apologised over the harsh treatment of the so-called “Windrush generation,” whose parents were invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls after World War Two, later to be caught up in a tightening of immigration rules overseen by May in 2012 when she was interior minister.

EDUCATION COMMITMENT

Although there is no Commonwealth free trade bloc and member states buy less than 10 percent of Britain’s exports, ministers in London see the group and its 2.4 billion residents as an important part of their post-Brexit strategy.

Commonwealth membership stretches from large developed economies like Australia and Canada to tiny island states like Nauru in the Pacific. On Thursday, leaders of almost all states will convene for talks on the future of the network, looking to agree trade, environmental and developmental goals.

The government is lobbying for Prince Charles to succeed his mother, Queen Elizabeth, as head of the organisation, despite reported unrest at that prospect among other members. The issue is expected to be discussed on Friday.

May committed 212 million pounds ($304 million) to try to make sure children living in developing Commonwealth countries receive 12 years of quality education.

“I want this to be the summit where the Commonwealth agrees to make that the goal for all our members – and begins to put in place the concrete measures that will allow it to become a reality,” she said.

May spoke alongside Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, also touching on the need to reduce malaria deaths, saying around 90 percent of Commonwealth citizens live in countries where the disease is endemic.

She urged fellow leaders to target a halving of malaria rates by 2023.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States has been having direct talks with North Korea “at extremely high levels” to try to arrange a summit between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“We’ve also started talking to North Korea directly,” he said at a picture-taking session with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “We have had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels, with North Korea. And I really believe this allows good will, that good things are happening. We’ll see what happens, as they always say, we’ll see what happens, because ultimately it’s the end result that counts, not the fact that we’re thinking about having a meeting or having a meeting.”Forget Fitbit. “Conan” sidekick Andy Richter has a better way to get you in shape.

Wilson, who faces a maximum of two years imprisonment, is the most senior Roman Catholic Church official to be convicted in abuse scandals that have swept through the church hierarchy in recent decades. He failed to act after learning that priest James Fletcher reportedly abused four boys.

“I am obviously disappointed at the decision published today,” Wilson said in a statement. “I will now have to consider the reasons and consult closely with my lawyers to determine the next steps.”

Peter Creigh, a former altar boy, testified during Wilson’s trial about the abuse he endured at the hands of Fletcher when he was 10 years old. Fletcher was charged with nine counts of sexual abuse in 2004. He died in prison in 2006.

WASHINGTON ― U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor broke her right shoulder in a fall at her home, but will continue performing her duties as usual, a court spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

“She will wear a sling for several weeks and will undergo physical therapy,” spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement.

The injury that she sustained on Monday marked the second medical issue that Sotomayor, 63, has faced this year. The lifelong diabetic was treated by paramedics for low blood sugar at her home in Washington in January.

Sotomayor, one of the nine-member court’s four liberal justices, was named to the court in 2009 by Democratic former President Barack Obama.

DC Entertainment is set to make history with its currently untitled all-female superhero movie spotlighting the stand-out character from “Suicide Squad,” Harley Quinn.

Cathy Yan has been tapped to direct the new film, according to Variety, which is reportedly based the “Birds of Prey” comic book. Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, is the only character currently attached, but the source material included appearances by fan favorites Batgirl, Black Canary and the Huntress.

A deal with Yan has yet to be signed, but the Chinese-American director would become the first Asian woman to direct a major studio-backed superhero film, and the second woman ― behind “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins ― in the DC cinematic universe.

Yan’s presentation for the film was “exceptional,” according to Deadline, with Robbie reportedly pushing the studio to hire a female director.

Screenwriter Christina Hodson, who was recently hired to write the upcoming “Batgirl” movie, penned the script for the Quinn flick.

Yan, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, made her feature film debut at the 2018 Sundance Fim Festival in January with the well-received “Dead Pigs, which won the World Cinema Dramatic Award For Ensemble Acting.

Singer Rachel Platten, known for “Fight Song” and the Nationwide insurance jingle, can now add national anthem bungler to her credits.

Her repeatedly botched rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” is making the rounds on the internet.

I'm so sorry to everyone - once again.https://t.co/69mGL9t88N — Rachel Platten (@RachelPlatten) April 17, 2018The Missouri attorney general’s office has uncovered “evidence of potential criminal acts of wrongdoing” by Gov. Eric Greitens, Attorney General Josh Hawley announced Tuesday.

At issue, Hawley said, is an electronic donor list Greitens obtained from a Missouri nonprofit called The Mission Continues. Evidence suggests Greitens unlawfully used that list to fundraise for his own political purposes, the AG said.

“[Greitens] did all of this without permission of The Mission Continues,” Hawley said at the Tuesday morning press conference. “This is known as computer tampering. Given the value of the list in question, it is a felony.”

Hawley said his office lacks the jurisdiction to prosecute the governor for the alleged crime. The AG’s office has passed the evidence along to St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who will make the decision on whether to charge the governor, Hawley said.

As for whether the evidence is grounds for impeachment, Hawley said that’s a matter for Missouri state lawmakers to decide.

Last week, a woman who Greitens previously admitted to having an extramarital affair with in March 2015 revealed their sexual encounters weren’t always consensual and were sometimes violent.

The governor was arrested in February on charges of felony invasion of privacy related to the affair. The woman says Greitens blindfolded and took a nude photo of her without her permission, then used the photo to blackmail her into silence.

When asked about Hawley’s announcement on Tuesday, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), the vice chairman of the Senate GOP conference, said both the legislative and legal process “should be allowed” to play out.

“I believe both of those are appropriate at this moment to find out what the real facts are,” he told HuffPost.

The Mission Continues, which Greitens co-founded in 2007, helps veterans transition back into civilian life by placing them in volunteer roles with community organizations.

The nonprofit’s president, Spencer Kympton, acknowledged the investigation into Greitens’ alleged misuse of its resources in a statement released late last month.

“We are supporting various document requests and are fully cooperating with the agencies that are reviewing this situation,” Kympton wrote. “We look forward to the completion of those efforts in a timely manner.”New AP guidelines can help all of us dig into poll results better. alexsl via Getty Images

The 2018 midterm elections are nearing, and they bring with them a new surge of campaign polls.

Don’t expect to see too many of them splashed across Associated Press headlines, though. In the latest update to its widely used stylebook, the news service has added a chapter devoted to polls, including a declaration that “poll results that seek to preview the outcome of an election must never be the lead, headline or single subject of any story.”

More broadly, the update urges AP journalists to consider a key question about any poll: “Are its results likely to accurately reflect the opinion of the group being surveyed?”

While the guidelines are written for reporters, they include some useful signposts for anyone to keep in mind when reading about horserace polling ― or public opinion surveys in general.

1. Look at how the survey was conducted.

From AP: “Reputable poll sponsors and public opinion researchers will disclose the methodology used to conduct the survey, including the questions asked and the results to each, so that their survey may be subject to independent examination and analysis by others.”

For a survey to be worth anything, the respondents must be representative of the population being measured ― that is, if a poll purports to be of Americans’ opinions, the people surveyed need to reflect the nation as a whole.

Traditionally, pollsters have done this by randomly calling phone numbers, which (if cell phones are included) theoretically gives everyone with a phone an equal chance of getting called. Others, especially those doing political surveys, will contact people named in voter files. In recent years, a growing number of pollsters have turned to online surveys, with varying levels of rigorousness.

Some kinds of people are more likely to respond to polls than other kinds of people. Pollsters correct for this by weighting their results based on demographics such as gender, age, race and level of education.

Surveys that don’t make an effort to reach a representative sample, or to use methods like weighting to make that sample representative, don’t say much about anyone but the people who answered them. That means it’s generally worth ignoring polls conducted among people who happen to use a specific app. And there’s almost nothing useful to be gleaned from “reader polls” that allow anybody to take them multiple times and that don’t track any sort of demographic information.

A pollster’s willingness to disclose information about how its poll was conducted isn’t an automatic stamp of quality, but an unwillingness to share those details is always a red flag. (Read more about how HuffPost/YouGov polling is conducted here.)

2. Remember that polls are not perfect.

From AP: “When writing or producing stories that cite survey results, take care not to overstate the accuracy of the poll. Even a perfectly executed poll does not guarantee perfectly accurate results.”

Many pollsters report a margin of sampling error ― that is, the error produced by interviewing a random sample of the population, rather than the population as a whole. Although that term is commonly shortened to the margin of error, there are other sources of error as well, including issues with the wording of questions and the possibility of certain groups disproportionately deciding not to respond.

Even surveys conducted by reputable outlets using the methods traditionally thought of as the “gold standard” of polling aren’t immune from error. Figuring out what lessons to draw from pollsters’ challenges in 2016 “would have been much easier if polls that on paper looked more rigorous than other polls performed better,” Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center, explained last year. “It would be very easy to say, ‘Well, you should really hang your hat on these polls that have these characteristics.’ We didn’t really find that.”

The upshot: It’s a good idea generally not to draw big conclusions from small differences. If President Donald Trump’s approval rating goes from 39 percent in one survey to 38 percent the next week, it’s “roughly stable,” not “dropping.” If a poll shows two candidates for a Senate seat separated by just 1 or 2 points, they’re “essentially tied.”

That’s especially true when it comes to subgroups within the pool of respondents ― like Republicans, women or adults under age 30 ― for whom the margin of error is even greater. If a subgroup has fewer than 100 people in a particular survey, the AP won’t even report the results. If the sample size for a group falls beneath that mark, or if it’s not clear how many people that group contains, skip those results.

On the flip side, remember that interviewing a ton of people is no guarantee that a poll is reliable.

3. Look at who’s behind the survey.

From AP: “Polls paid for by candidates or interest groups may be designed to produce results that are beneficial to that candidate or group, and they may be released selectively as a campaign tactic or publicity ploy. These polls should be carefully evaluated and usually avoided.”

Surveys released by a group with a vested interest in the results can contain interesting data, but those results should be taken with a grain of salt.

One example: Polls that claim people will be more or less likely to vote for a candidate based on a specific issue are often used by advocacy groups to push an agenda. But when people say they’d be less likely to vote for Candidate A if he opposed Issue 2, what they often mean is simply that they already dislike A or that they feel negatively toward 2 ― not that it’s really a deciding matter for them.

As an extreme example, 10 percent of people who didn’t support Trump in the 2016 election said that his taste in steaks made them less likely to support him. That was probably not a major factor in the election.

4. Pay attention to timing.

From AP: “Public opinion can change quickly, especially in response to events. ... Be careful when considering results from polls fielded immediately after major events, such as political debates, that often sway public opinion in ways that may only be temporary.”

Surveys aren’t conducted in a vacuum, and looking at when they were in the field ― and what was happening around that time ― provides important context. Support for tougher gun control, for instance, often spikes temporarily in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting. Public opinion on other issues can shift quickly too, as can candidates’ fortunes.

5. Be careful about apples-to-oranges comparisons and outliers.

From AP: “Comparisons between polls are often newsworthy, especially those that show a change in public opinion over time. But take care when comparing results from different polling organizations, as difference in poll methods and question wording — and not a change in public opinion — may be the cause of differing results.”

Examining multiple polls on a candidate or issue can, however, provide valuable information. When surveys on the same matter differ significantly in methodology and the wording of questions, considering them together can show just how much framing does (or doesn’t) affect public support.Fox News is standing by Sean Hannity after it was revealed Monday that he was once represented by Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer.

Cohen’s own counsel identified Hannity as one of Cohen’s clients during a court hearing Monday, after a judge rejected his request to withhold Hannity’s name.

“While FOX News was unaware of Sean Hannity’s informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday, we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support,” a spokeswoman for Fox News told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.

Cohen was in court Monday to request that a federal judge limit prosecutors’ access to documents seized during an FBI raid on the lawyer’s office and residence last week. The motion was denied.

Hannity, an avid Trump supporter, has come under fire over the court revelation. He’d been covering Cohen on his Fox News show in recent weeks, but failed to disclose his relationship with the lawyer. He has bashed the FBI for raiding Cohen’s office as part of a criminal investigation into the lawyer’s financial dealings.

Hannity has denied having been represented by Cohen, but said he believes his conversations with the lawyer are still protected by attorney-client privilege.

“Let me set the record straight. Here’s the truth: Michael Cohen never represented me in any legal matter. I never retained his services,” Hannity said on his show Monday night. “They never involved any matter ... between me, a third party, a third group at all. My questions exclusively almost focused on real estate.”

The Atlantic reported Tuesday that Hannity had previously sought legal counsel from two other Trump-connected lawyers. Victoria Toensing and Jay Alan Sekulow signed a cease-and-desist letter to an Oklahoma radio station in 2017, identifying themselves as “counsel for Sean Hannity,” according to The Atlantic.

Sekulow, a personal attorney for Trump assigned to deal with special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, announced in March that Toensing would be joining Trump’s legal team. But days later, Sekulow said “conflicts” prevented her from doing so. Both lawyers have been guests on Hannity’s show.

A representative for Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hannity’s reported relationships with Toensing and Sekulow.

Ingraham then jokes, "you're like my brother, but I'm glad for like a millisecond the heat is off me and on you." pic.twitter.com/jCIdhnnIXp — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 17, 2018

Two embattled Fox News hosts made light of their situations on Monday evening as Sean Hannity closed his show by bantering with Laura Ingraham.

Hannity was revealed earlier in the day as the “mystery” client of Michael Cohen, the personal attorney to President Donald Trump, while Ingraham has been the subject of a boycott since last month, when she mocked one of the survivors of the Feb. 14 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.

“You’re like my brother,” Ingraham said. “But I’m glad for, like a millisecond, the heat’s off me and on you.”

“I appreciate that... that’s like a sibling,” Hannity said, laughing. “I hope the heat’s on you, not me.”A new lawsuit accuses Missouri's top election official of violating federal law by not automatically updating voter registration records. ChrisBoswell via Getty Images

Missouri is violating federal law because it does not offer all residents the option to register to vote at the state’s motor vehicle agency or automatically update voter registration information when people notify the state that they have moved, according to a lawsuit civil rights groups filed against the state Tuesday.

Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft (R) and Joel Walters, the director of the Department of Revenue, which is responsible for issuing driver’s licenses, have violated the National Voter Registration Act, alleges the suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.

The 1993 law requires states to offer people the opportunity to register to vote when they interact with the motor vehicle agency and other state agencies. If someone wants to register to vote at the motor vehicle agency, the information provided on a driver’s license can also be used as a voter registration application for federal elections. The law also says states should update someone’s voter registration if they change their address at the motor vehicle agency, unless the person explicitly says not to.

But lawyers for the ACLU of Missouri, Demos and The Advancement Project say Missouri doesn’t comply with those requirements in several ways.

First, they say Missouri election officials aren’t automatically updating the voter information of people who change their address with the state. Second, they say the state requires military personnel to fill out a separate form to register to vote when they want to get or renew a driver’s license. Third, they allege the state is refusing to offer voter registration opportunities to people who can’t prove they are citizens during a licensing transaction.

The plaintiffs say the state’s process could block the hundreds of thousands of people who move within Missouri each year from casting a valid ballot.

The suit wasn’t filed on behalf of particular voters, but instead on behalf of the Missouri chapters of two groups that dedicate considerable resources to voter registration: the League of Women Voters of Missouri and the A. Philip Randolph Institute. Both organizations said in the court filing Tuesday that the DMV’s current processes prevented many people they interacted with from getting registered to vote.

“A large part of the reason our organization focuses so heavily on voter registration is to prevent these voters from being turned away at the polls,” Patricia A. Jones, president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute’s Greater Kansas City Chapter, said in a statement. “Each year we have to educate voters on the need to update their registration addresses and assist voters in making sure that their registration information is current.”

Demos and The Advancement Project sent letters to Ashcroft and Walters last year, in which lawyers for the groups said the men were violating NVRA and offered to work together on a remedy.Finally, they handcuffed him and began performing CPR after one of the officers said something in Clark’s hand looked like a gun.

“Shine me a light,” one officer said. “Come on buddy, wake up, breathe for me. Come on bud. Come on bud.”

After about a minute, the officers performing CPR stopped, saying he was unresponsive.

Authorities will now investigate whether police acted quickly enough to begin lifesaving measures, police spokesman Sgt. Vance Chandler told The Sacramento Bee.

“That’s part of our investigation, looking at when aid was rendered,” he said. “We will look at if it was appropriate given the circumstances.”

Experts said the time lapse appeared reasonable, given the need to verify that Clark wasn’t armed.

“They approached him as soon as was safely practical,” police training expert Ed Obayashi told the newspaper. “From what I am seeing and hearing, the officers in my opinion exercised good tactical decision making.”EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is facing mounting calls to step down. The Washington Post via Getty Images

The Environmental Protection Agency defended embattled Administrator Scott Pruitt against Republican criticism Tuesday over his use of multiple email addresses, insisting it was “standard practice since the Clinton administration.”

In an email sent Thursday under that subject line, Jahan Wilcox, a top agency spokesman, said Pruitt only used one of his four email accounts for correspondence, while the others were used to receive emails from the general public and allow staff to manage his calendar. The fourth address, he said, was deleted.

Pruitt’s email accounts, revealed five days ago by The Washington Post, raised concerns that the EPA failed to disclose emails linked to the secret accounts in public records requests. The controversy added to the rapidly cascading series of corruption scandals and ethical lapses that have caused dozens of Democrats and at least three Republican members of Congress to call for his resignation.

Wilcox listed the four email addresses Gina McCarthy, Pruitt’s predecessor, used, and linked to a 2012 Politico story detailing a controversy over former Administrator Lisa Jackson’s secondary email address. In that article, officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration said the “arrangement is nothing new.”

But that didn’t quell concerns from Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a staunch supporter of the Trump administration’s environmental agenda, who asked the Pruitt to “affirm that the EPA does in fact search all your official email accounts when responding to FOIA requests” in a letter sent to the administrator Friday.

“During your confirmation hearing, I specifically asked you to ‘refrain from taking any action — that makes it difficult or impossible for the public to access your official written communications under the Freedom of Information Act,’ ” Barrasso wrote to Pruitt, according to a transcript published by The Hill and The Washington Post. “You agreed to my request.”

After the Government Accountability Office released a report Monday saying that the $43,000 the EPA spent on a soundproof phone booth for Pruitt was illegal, Barrasso escalated pressure on the administrator by demanding that he “give a full public accounting of this expenditure and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law.”“Solo: A Star Wars Story” hits this weekend and even though that film is struggling a bit at the box office, Twitter would prefer if we could add “Star Wars” to every film.

Lookin' For Love In Alderaan Places — Adam Busenlehner (@Adbusenlehner) May 26, 2018BEIRUT (Reuters) - A senior Iranian military commander poured scorn on U.S. threats to tighten sanctions on Tuesday, saying the Islamic Republic’s people would respond by punching U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the mouth.

Pompeo said on Monday Washington would impose new penalties if Tehran did not make sweeping changes, including dropping its nuclear program and pulling out of the Syrian civil war.

Two weeks after President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, his administration has threatened to impose “the strongest sanctions in history,” setting Washington and Tehran further on a course of confrontation.

“The people of Iran should stand united in the face of this and they will deliver a strong punch to the mouth of the American Secretary of State and anyone who backs them,” Ismail Kowsari, the deputy commander of the Sarollah Revolutionary Guards base in Tehran said, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency.

Limiting Iran’s missile capabilities was one of Pompeo’s main demands.

“Who are you and America to tell us to limit the range of ballistic missiles?” Kowsari said, according to ILNA. “History has shown that with the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, America is the top criminal with regard to missiles,” he added.

Qassem Soleimani, the head of the branch of the Revolutionary Guards that carries out operations outside Iran’s borders, was singled out by Pompeo as a top troublemaker in the Middle East.

Kowsari said that the Iranian people back Soleimani.

“Soleimani is not a single person. The great people of Iran support him,” Kowsari said.

Separately, Iran’s government spokesman said that the plan outlined by Pompeo would exacerbate the public’s hostility to the United States.

“Do the Americans think that the silk glove that they’ve taken out and the iron hand that they’ve extended to the people, a hand that’s backed by Israel and the [Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization], will make Iranian people think that America wants democracy?” Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday, according to state media.

The Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO) is an exiled Iranian armed opposition group which has called for the overthrow of the Iranian government for decades.

John Bolton, the U.S. national security advisor, has been a supporter of the MKO, which the Iranian government sees as a terrorist group.Jimmy Kimmel traveled back in time to the year of Donald Trump’s birth to offer the future president some heartfelt advice.

WASHINGTON ― The vanishing role of Congress in authorizing military force is nothing new. It’s a story that’s played out over decades with overly broad Authorizations for Use of Military Force and liberal interpretations of the president’s powers to conduct war. But if the reaction from a sample of lawmakers this week to President Donald Trump’s latest strike on Syria is any indication, Congress has very little concern ― or knowledge ― about the chief executive’s authority to pre-emptively attack a nation.

HuffPost asked more than 30 lawmakers about the Trump administration’s legal justification for bombing Syria, and while there isn’t a strictly correct answer, it’s clear from those interviews and other reactions since the strike that few lawmakers are concerning themselves with whether the president really has this authority. It’s just not a question they’re asking, despite a clear shift in the president’s rationale for conducting unauthorized war.

The Trump administration sent Congress a letter on Sunday claiming it was in the “vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States” to conduct the strike, which followed a suspected chemical weapons attack inside Syria by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The Trump administration seems to believe the president has the authority to strike a country, without congressional approval, under the powers granted to the office in the Constitution ― just as long as it can say such actions are in our national interests.

That was exactly the answer administration officials ― including Secretary of Defense James Mattis and acting Secretary of State John Sullivan ― gave lawmakers on Tuesday during a private briefing for all House members, according to lawmakers who attended the session.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has been vocal about his concerns regarding unauthorized war, said he asked what their legal justification was for the strikes. And, according to Massie, the officials said Trump had the authority under Article II of the Constitution, which outlines in the president’s broad powers as commander-in-chief.

But As Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) brought up to HuffPost, that ignores what’s said in Article I: that only Congress has the power to declare war. (Article II also makes clear that the president derives power to direct the military after there has been a declaration, not before.)

Still, the vast majority of lawmakers HuffPost talked to had no issue with the president striking Syria without a new AUMF. And before the briefing, several lawmakers seemed to have little idea under what authority the president claimed for bombing Syria. Some told HuffPost that it was the 2001 AUMF, which Congress quickly passed to authorize military action against anyone associated with the 9/11 attacks, that justified the president’s actions.

“Every president since post-9/11 has had the authorization to make these types of surgical, targeted strikes,” Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.) told HuffPost, saying she was referring to the 2001 AUMF.

“We have the legal justification right now under the current AUMF,” Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) said.

And Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) ― the daughter of Dick Cheney, who was vice president when that AUMF was enacted ― said Friday’s actions were lawful because of it. “I don’t think we ought to just assume that because a certain amount of time has passed, that you’ve got to pass new legislation,” Cheney said.

In a letter to Congress explaining his justification on Sunday ― which very few of the lawmakers interviewed by HuffPost seemed to have read ― Trump did not mention the 2001 AUMF. While the U.S. has routinely used that measure to justify actions against Islamic State fighters in Syria, these strikes were aimed at sending a message to Assad, who has no apparent connection to 9/11 and whose forces also have been fighting ISIS inside Syria.

Trump mentions in the letter that he is providing the report to keep Congress informed, “consistent with the War Powers Resolution.” But according to Massie, the administration officials didn’t mention that resolution when they were asked about the legal justification.

The War Powers Resolution allows the president to use military force after an attack on the U.S., or to strike when the country is in “imminent” danger. Neither of those conditions seem to apply in the case of Syria.

Almost exactly a year ago, Trump ordered a similar bombing campaign against Syria, and because it was also a one-time attack, no one seemed to care about his authorization for that order, either.

Of course, none of this focuses on how the White House views the strikes. Trump justified the attacks by noting his inherent authority as commander-in-chief ― a role that is not clearly defined in the Constitution but has certainly expanded over the course of time.

Some lawmakers acknowledge that Congress has abdicated its responsibilities to authorize military action ― “missing in action” was how California Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee (the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 AUMF) and Adam Schiff put it. But most interviewed by HuffPost seemed perfectly comfortable with the president claiming some nebulous authority to use the military any way he sees fit.

Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) told HuffPost that the president has the “absolute authority” to make war. And if Congress doesn’t like what the president is doing, then Congress could defund those military actions.

Asked if the president had the authority to bomb London if he decided it was in the national interest, King said the president could ― and there were plenty of lawmakers who implicitly agreed.

As Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) told HuffPost, “If he deems it right and it’s in the best concerns, I support him on it.”

Throughout the vast majority of these interviews ― which you can listen to in their entirety below ― it was clear most of the lawmakers did not have a level of familiarity with these issues or didn’t want to dwell on the matter.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump used his “Article II” authorities for this strike, suggesting he thinks those powers allow for military actions simply if in the view of the president it’s in the nation’s interests.

And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the administration felt it was on “firm footing” with its legal justification for the Syria strikes.

Pressed on how — presidential authority? The 2001 AUMF? — McConnell just walked away.

The precedent of virtually unlimited war-making power for the president has been taking hold for some time, but it’s becoming even more explicit under Trump.

Certainly, there still are lawmakers who are uncomfortable with the president using the military any way he sees fit ― such as Massie and a small group of Constitutional conservatives. And a number of Democrats are uneasy with the idea, too.

“That justification allows the president to wage war anywhere, anytime, any place that he might want to, simply saying it’s in the national security interest,” Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) said. “We can’t allow that. We simply cannot allow that to happen, with this president or any other president.”

But Democrats like Garamendi are in the minority in Congress. And what’s most notable about the question of the legal justification of striking Syria isn’t that there are a few voices on either side who are uncomfortable with the president conducting war anytime he wants to; what’s most notable is how many lawmakers are amenable to the idea.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has invited industry representatives to help shape his agenda. Win McNamee/Getty Images

An Interior Department advisory group relied on a top energy industry lobbyist to help draft a list of potential regulatory rollbacks, documents obtained by HuffPost show.

At least one suggestion ― reducing the role that local environmental concerns play in leasing federal lands for oil and gas development ― quickly became a reality.

The Onshore Work Group, charged with recommending how Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke ought to regulate federal lands available for fossil fuel development, already has deep ties to the energy industry. Its chair is Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the oil and gas industry group Western Energy Alliance and a vocal proponent of tearing down many Obama-era environmental protections.

But metadata from the working group’s first draft of recommendations further link the Interior Department with the industry it is tasked with regulating. According to the metadata, Tripp Parks, the Western Energy Alliance’s head of government affairs, was the initial author of the document.

The working group belongs to a growing cadre of industry-friendly advisory bodies Zinke has set up to guide his agenda. In November, he assembled a wildlife conservation advisory group dominated by people with links to trophy hunting. Most members of a public lands advisory group have connections to the outdoor recreation industry.

“It’s a huge concern,” said John DeCicco, a University of Michigan research professor who has worked for the environmental advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. Under previous administrations, DeCicco said, committees like these were usually composed of scientific experts. “What it really represents is that certain powerful interests, moneyed interests, they have the ear of policymakers who are running roughshod over due process and running roughshod over important checks and balances that are supposed to be there.”

The working group was set up under the umbrella of the Royalty Policy Committee, a group tasked with recommending the royalty rates the federal government should charge for drilling. Many of the committee’s members hail from the oil and gas sector or have significant ties to it. Whereas the same committee had a narrow, technical focus under previous administrations, under Zinke, it has been making sweeping proposals to roll back regulations on federal lands. The committee members who set up the working group have proposed measures like charging bargain-basement royalties for deepwater drilling operations and have described their mandate as “looking at steps to be taken to make DOI a better business partner to its investors.”

Some of those steps appear to have been come directly from the Western Energy Alliance. A document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveals that Parks created the draft recommendations one day before Sgamma circulated them to committee members overseeing the working group.

“It’s a very clear instance of regulatory capture,” said Pat Gallagher, the Sierra Club’s legal director. Of the recommendations, he said, “There is no other object than to get drill bits in the ground as quickly as possible.”

At best, Gallagher said, industry representatives are creating an echo chamber inside the Interior Department. Several of Parks’ recommendations mirror a report the department released in October on “energy burdens.” Sgamma told HuffPost that Parks’ name appears in the document’s metadata because she asked him to pull out relevant sections of the report. This was “the full extent of my staff’s involvement,” she wrote in an email.

“What it really represents is that certain powerful interests, moneyed interests, they have the ear of policy makers who are running roughshod over due process.” - John DeCicco, University of Michigan research professor

The recommendations included items that had been on Western Energy Alliance’s wish list for years, like a proposal to abandon the practice of re-evaluating long-term leases instead of automatically renewing them, which allowed federal regulators to plan around major changes to the landscape, such as new suburban developments.

Sgamma circulated the draft ― which she described as focusing on “increasing the competitiveness of federal lands” ― on Jan. 9, inviting her fellow group members to make changes. Some of Parks’ initial recommendations were cut from later drafts, but the agency has already taken action on one recommendation that survived: The Interior Department quietly ceased the Obama-era practice of planning local drilling sites according to local environmental concerns on Jan. 31. The industry had long argued that the practice created a redundant roadblock to new drilling projects.

“We’re very pleased,” Sgamma said at the time.

A handful of the most influential oil and gas developers in the country fund the Western Energy Alliance. Although it does not currently publicize the names of its members, the alliance has included Devon Energy, Halliburton, Anadarko Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources. Its political action committee donated $5,000 to Zinke’s campaigns while he served as Montana’s lone congressman.

The Western Energy Alliance fiercely opposed the Obama administration’s efforts to regulate the oil and gas industry, sometimes to the point of adopting a siege mentality. It invited Rick Berman, known for his ruthless, corporate-backed PR campaigns against environmentalists, to address its members in 2014. At the event, Berman framed the struggle against environmental groups as “an endless war.”

The draft recommendations are not the only example of the Western Energy Alliance having an outsized voice in the Trump administration. Parks, who is not registered as a lobbyist, previously presented an Interior advisory group with 15 recommendations for scrapping protections for the greater sage-grouse, which the industry felt impeded new energy projects; the advisory group adopted 13 of them.

The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about Parks’ role in drafting the recommendations. Sgamma has defended her role in making policy recommendations to the Interior Department by noting she has subject matter expertise. “I’m not an alternate member of the Royalty Policy Committee because of my sparkling personality,” she told HuffPost.

Sgamma added that the Interior Department had considered scrapping several of the Western Energy Alliance’s least favorite regulations even before the formation of her working group.

But the alliance’s relationship with the Trump administration also stretches back many months.

Entries in Zinke’s calendar show he met with representatives of the alliance in April 2017. A brief prepared for the secretary reminded him of a Trump administration order that for every new regulation created, agencies must place two old regulations on the chopping block.
