Trevor Noah isn’t likely to score an interview with Donald Trump anytime soon, given the president’s penchant for speaking with friendly media outlets. But if “The Daily Show” host did get a chance to grill the commander in chief, he’d ask the one question no one else has dared to:

“I would ask him what his get-out number is,” Noah said in an interview with BBC World that aired Tuesday night.

“Because I do believe he has one,” he added. “I think if people came together and offered him the right amount of money, he would take it.”We’ll just say it: This woman MacGyvered her baby’s birth.

Tia Freeman, a member of the U.S. Air Force who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, had Twitter users on the edge of their seats Tuesday when she decided to share her incredible delivery story.

Might as well tell you now lol. Give me a little time though because it’s sort of a long story 😂😂 — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 24, 2018

In early March, the pregnant 22-year-old chose to take a trip to Germany despite being close to the end of her term. Freeman only learned that she was pregnant in January, per BuzzFeed, when she was already in her third trimester, and she had booked her vacation flight before finding out.

“I was in shock,” Freeman told HuffPost. “I never saw myself as a mom before. I was more career-oriented. That’s probably why I was in denial after finding out.”

I didn’t know I was pregnant for awhile (already in my 3rd trimester) and before you ask the birth control I was on made it so I didn’t have a cycle every month. So not having a period wasn’t an indicator for me. On top of that I didnt really gain any weight.



Me when I found: pic.twitter.com/An5QA3hX8A — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 24, 2018

On March 7, she took a 14-hour flight to Istanbul, Turkey, where she had an overnight layover en route to Germany.

Freeman explained on Twitter that after eating an in-flight meal, she began to feel sick but chalked it up to food poisoning at first. At the airport in Istanbul, it dawned on her that maybe there was another explanation.

I’m literally gripping the railing trying to make it through the lines. At this point I feel like I’m about to pass out. I’m sweating. I feel like I have to vomit. I’m going through it. Then I’m like wait a minute bitch are you in labor?!!! pic.twitter.com/p6SMEfunP0 — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 24, 2018

When she finally made it to her hotel room, she began searching on YouTube for videos on how to deliver your own baby.

So in true millennial form I decided to @Youtube it 😂😂. If no one else had my back the internet would! So here my ass is in my hotel room all by my lonesome learning how to deliver my own baby pic.twitter.com/v13ZhF6O8h — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 24, 2018

Freeman told the Independent that she nixed the idea of going to the hospital for several reasons.

“Not many people spoke English that I encountered at first,” she told the news outlet. “And I didn’t know what the country’s emergency number was and I didn’t know how my insurance would work overseas so I just decided to DIY it.”

It’s weird how focused a person becomes when they’re adrenaline starts going. Because at no point ever did I freak out. Like I just did what I had to do. — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 24, 2018

Freeman then grabbed two towels — one to wrap her baby in and the other to bite onto while she gave birth — and filled the bathtub with warm water. Thanks to research on the internet, she began to push once her contractions were a minute apart.

After just a few pushes, the baby “popped out” and “floated right on up to the top of the water,” she wrote on Twitter. It was a boy!

Freeman then had to figure out a procedure for removing an umbilical cord without the proper tools. After checking online, she sterilized her shoelaces by boiling them in water and used them as clamps as she cut the cord.

After all this, the new mother still didn’t go to the hospital. Instead, she cleaned the bathroom because “it looked like the set of a horror movie” and went to bed with her newborn son.

So I clean up the bathroom, breastfeed my baby, and go to sleep. No I do not go to the hospital I take my ass to bed. 😂😂 so the next day I wake up for and get ready to go to the airport because I already paid for the cab the night before & even though I knew I couldn’t fly out — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 25, 2018

Naturally, when she got to the airport the next day, there was a lot of confusion.

“They thought I was a human trafficker trying to smuggle out a baby,” she wrote online.

When I get there the airport workers are freaking out bc you can tell this baby is fresh. I legit didn’t have any baby clothes & made him something out of my favorite blue oversized button down (RIP 😢). Anyway they thought I was a human trafficker trying to smuggle out a baby. pic.twitter.com/dc0BCDv75J — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 25, 2018

But once Freeman and her son were examined and her story checked out, airport staff apparently were very nice.

According to BuzzFeed, they even helped name her son, Xavier Ata.

“The ladies at the airport who helped me said that he should have a Turkish name,” Freeman told the site. “So I asked them for a cute boy name and they suggested Ata.”

Freeman was taken to the U.S. Embassy in Turkey where her son was issued a birth certificate and a passport.

She was then transported to the hospital where she and Xavier received a clean bill of health. She remained in Istanbul for two more weeks, a stay that Turkish Airlines paid for in full.

During her time in the city, Freeman’s incredible story made headlines at several local news outlets.

To wrap up I go to the hospital get checked out everything is fine. He’s perfectly healthy! Lol the doctors were shocked to hear my story. I made national news & people would stop us to take pictures all the time & a random elderly woman grabbed my boob as I was breastfeeding pic.twitter.com/gGp4lJvEvl — Tia Freeman (@TheWittleDemon) April 25, 2018

Freeman told BuzzFeed that no one in her family had known she was pregnant.

“They all found out a couple days after he was born.”

She said that she told her grandma, who told her mom, “and then my mom went crazy telling the rest of our family and every other person she came in contact with.”

“When I got back even our lawn care guys knew!”

People online absolutely loved Freeman’s story.

Freeman told the Independent that despite all the risks she took, she wouldn’t change a thing.

“The experience taught me so much. I learned how to be resourceful and calm under pressure. I was able to bond one on one with my son from his first breaths,” she said.A natural cloud of suspicion surrounds the act of selling a used car. Like, if it’s so great and dependable, why are you getting rid of it?

However, for one guy on Craigslist, selling his silver 1999 Toyota Corolla was all about lifting that cloud with brutal, unadulterated honesty. And after reading his hilarious ad, we’ll be damned if you won’t want to at least take it for a test drive.

The ad has since been removed from the site, probably for being too real, but one Twitter user was nice enough to preserve it for posterity.

Some of the highlights include:

- “Bluetooth: nope. Sunroof: nope. Fancy wheels: nope. Rear view camera: nope ... but it’s got a transparent rear window and you have a f**king neck that can turn.”

- “This car will outlive you, it will outlive your children.”

- ″In the owner’s manual, oil is listed as ‘optional.’”

- “You could take the engine out of this car, drop it off Golden Gate Bridge, fish it out of the water a thousand years later, put it in the trunk of the car, fill the gas tank up with Nutella, turn the key, and this puppy would f**king start right up.”

- “Let’s face the facts, this car isn’t going to win any beauty contests, but neither are you.”Blake Shelton woke up on the shadier side of the bed on Thursday morning.

The country singer seemingly took a shot at ex-wife Miranda Lambert, who’s been accused of beginning a relationship with her current boyfriend, Turnpike Troubadours frontman Evan Felker, while he was still married.

“Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up,” the “Voice” coach wrote on Twitter. “But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!”

Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!! — Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton) April 25, 2018

Shelton went on to retweet a fan’s response to the tweet with a lyric from girlfriend Gwen Stefani’s song “This Is What The Truth Feels Like.”

Shelton and Lambert, the country music world’s former golden couple, announced their split in 2015 after four years of marriage and another six years together.

While neither has commented on the reason for the divorce, rumors about Lambert’s infidelity have long swirled thanks to Shelton’s 2016 song “She’s Got a Way with Words,” which takes aim at a cheating ex.

“When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton told Billboard about the inspiration behind his post-divorce album. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”

Months after the split, Lambert found love with singer Anderson East, whom she dated for two years. Multiple outlets confirmed earlier this month that the two were no longer a couple.

In January, she invited Felker’s band to join her on her Livin’ Like Hippies tour. At the time, the frontman was reportedly still married to wife Staci Nelson, who later filed for divorce in February, according to People. Reports claim that Lambert and Felker’s romance began while they were both still in relationships.

“Staci found out that he had filed for divorce because a friend called her after seeing it in a local newspaper,” a source told E! News. “Staci wasn’t even served with divorce papers so she filed her divorce papers a couple weeks after finding out that Evan filed. He never communicated that to her.”

The “Tin Man” singer seemingly made mention of her recent relationship struggles in an ACM Awards speech earlier this month as she accepted the trophy for Female Vocalist of the Year.

“Thank you guys so much for sharing my broken heart with me,” she said onstage.

Shelton, meanwhile, has been dating Stefani for nearly three years after the fellow “Voice” judges bonded over mutual heartbreak. In 2015, the former No Doubt singer was also going through a divorce from her husband of nearly 13 years, Gavin Rossdale, who reportedly cheated on her with the family’s nanny.

″[I]t it was like being handed this gift of a friend who was going through the exact same thing at the exact same time,” Stefani told Vanity Fair in 2016.Amazon Prime has an unusual lineup this May.

Along with the typical strategy of adding dozens of movies and a few original shows, Amazon also acquired nearly three dozen forgotten-about miniseries from the last few decades. If you’ve been wanting to nostalgia-binge on mediocre television that you watched in the 1980s, Amazon finally has you covered this month.

Of course, there are many movies and shows that are actually worth your time, too.

Near the end of the month, the recent critical hit “Howards End” will be available. Another critical hit from last year, “Last Flag Flying,” is available May 4. Likely to be popular is the addition of the “Rocky” series and many James Bond movies. There’s “A Very Brady Sequel.” So many options.

May 29Comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty on Thursday in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, but the verdict’s also being felt in Hollywood.

Many celebrities tweeted after the news broke to express their belief that justice was served.She may have gotten her start on the BBC series “Doctor Who” in 2010 as the title character’s beloved, fan-favorite companion Amy Pond, but Karen Gillan’s evolved since then. Eight years later, she’s a bona fide action antihero.

After appearing in both “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies as the blue, bald-headed Nebula, the adopted sister of Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and daughter of evil warlord Thanos (Josh Brolin), Gillan registers to fans these days as the villain with a heart. Now, she’s got a “significant role” in “Avengers: Infinity War,” the Marvel movie predicted to make over $200 million this weekend.

The ensemble film features 60-plus characters from the Marvel universe, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). As you might expect, there’s a whole lot of men in that lineup, but ― if the rumors are true ― a women-only Marvel film could be on the horizon.

In fact, the 30-year-old Gillan said she’d volunteer to direct the all-female project if the studio moves ahead with the idea.

“OK, I’ll do it,” she told HuffPost at the Tribeca Film Festival last week, where she was promoting her directorial debut, “The Party’s Just Beginning.” Gillan doesn’t see any reason why a film featuring the many formidable women of the universe couldn’t be a possibility.

“Absolutely,” she said. “I know all of the Marvel actresses talk about it and we’re all for it. I don’t know whether it will happen or not, but everybody’s really up for it.”

Outside of her action persona, Gillan is hoping her latest indie movie opens a few new doors for her in terms of writing and directing. It takes on a darker coming-of-age tale revolving around a 20-something woman who turns to sex and alcohol to ease the pain of losing her best friend to suicide. In a sit-down interview at the Roxy Hotel in New York, the actress and filmmaker spoke in-depth about “The Party’s Just Beginning,” her blossoming career and Nebula’s “Avengers” role.

You’ve had a really busy past few years.

I know! It’s been incredibly exciting. Everything seems to be happening all at once.

“The Party’s Just Beginning” is a passion project of yours, about your hometown of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, which you’ve been working on for the past six years. What struck me, though, is how in tune the film is to very current topics of discussion in your industry, whether it be depression, suicide, gender identity, connectivity…

There’s a lot of stuff in there that really wasn’t being discussed when I wrote it and now it just seems to be discussed so much more. But that just makes me happy that it’s at the forefront of people’s minds ― these conversations ― because obviously they are issues that should be talked about.

When did you discover the statistic about the alarming rate of suicide in Inverness, and how did you want to go about addressing it?

I remember reading about that eight years ago roughly, and it was something that just always stuck with me. It struck me as so strange because I grew up there and it’s so idyllic and beautiful. It was just a contradiction to me. I was like, how is this possible to have this dark statistic looming over us? And then a couple of years after that I wanted to write my own screenplay, as I felt involved in telling other people’s stories so much as an actress that I really wanted to tell one of my own. And this just felt like the most natural thing to do, because it was something I felt was so strange and it hadn’t left my mind.

What was the scariest part of this: the writing, acting or directing?

I guess it’s the combination of acting and directing at the same time. It wasn’t scary so much as frustrating, because I love visuals so much that I really wanted to be behind the monitor watching everything that was going down the lens. Being in the scenes meant I couldn’t just sit behind the monitor. That provided an interesting form of directing, because instead of coming in with notes for the actors, I could just say to them, “Be responsive to what I’m giving you.” I provoked emotions within rather than discussing it beforehand, which feels a little more organic.

Was it then odd to direct yourself, jumping in front of and then behind the camera?

As an actor, I’ve made so many self-tapes ― which is something we just do now instead of auditions if we can’t get there ― and so I’ve developed, like most actors, this skill of knowing when you got it and when you don’t. So for myself, what I did was I gave myself options. I would do multiple takes and each one would be different so I could sit in the edit and pick and choose the performance.

What was the process like finding a producer to back the project?

I didn’t know how any of this stuff worked. I wrote this script in the U.K. and then I moved to America to do this film called “Oculus,” a horror movie. I showed the script to the director [Mike Flanagan] and he was like, “I know the producer who needs to make this movie.” And I was like, “Um, amazing! Bring me to her!” And then he’s like, “Actually, she’s right here.” And then [Mali Elfman] comes into the bar, this pub in L.A., and she had already read the script and she really connected to it. So that was just amazing ― one of those life moments where it was all in sync and really working. And then she and I worked together for four years to try and get funding for it.

Once you found funding, did you start creating a vision for the film or pull any inspiration from other directors?

Well, I feel like I might have taken a lot of inspiration from one of my favorite directors, Michael Haneke. My favorites are Haneke and Stanley Kubrick, and I don’t think this film looks like a Kubrick film. I mean, I wish! [Laughs] So maybe I’ve been influenced there subconsciously, but I had a really strong idea of what I wanted it to look like visually from the beginning, so much so that I storyboarded the entire film just for myself so I could essentially watch it by looking at the pages. But then I didn’t want my director of photography [Edd Lukas] to follow that, because I didn’t want to influence him too much. I wanted him to offer his ideas and bring them to the table and he totally agreed with that approach. But it’s scary how similar some of it is to the original storyboard.

“I’m so happy to see that more women are directing blockbuster movies because, frankly, more women should be. If you look at the audience numbers, it’s not as if they’re predominately male – just as many females watch those types of movies, so why can’t women make them?” - Karen Gillan

How did you find the time to do all this storyboarding? You mentioned “Oculus” and from there, your career really took off.

I was doing the storyboards on the set of “Jumanji.” [Laughs] And they were trying to get me out of my trailer and I’m like, “Just one more picture!”

This film compared to “Jumanji” is quite the leap.

I know. [Laughs]

You play with dark comedy in “The Party’s Just Beginning,” but what was your experience like working on “Jumanji” with Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black?

I loved it. Just working with such funny guys was such a cool, fun experience, and such a good learning curve, because they’re all so brilliant at what they do with comedy in such individual ways.

I’m sure it’s an interesting transition to go from filming big budget movies like “Jumanji” or “Guardians of the Galaxy” to filming your own indie project.

Yeah, the difference was so extreme.

Did it maybe inspire you to one day be a director who’s given the chance to helm a movie of that magnitude?

First of all, I’m so happy to see that more women are directing blockbuster movies because, frankly, more women should be. If you look at the audience numbers, it’s not as if they’re predominately male ― just as many females watch those types of movies, so why can’t women make them? We’re starting to see more of that now. I would definitely love to be a part of that one day, just because I feel like I’ve picked up a lot of knowledge on how they’re made by being in the environment. Therefore, I feel like I could put that to good use one day.

That Marvel environment must be insane. Talk about the filming aspect of those movies ― how crazy is it?

I’ve had nothing but great experiences working on Marvel movies. So many people think working on big budget movies presents a lack of creativity or something, and I just don’t find that to be true at all. If anything, having a bigger budget allows you to have more time, which means you can do more takes and try more things. As an actor, you can really start to explore, whereas on indie movies it’s like, “We’re running out of time!” So sometimes you only get one or two go’s at things. So I find [Marvel movies] incredibly rewarding, creatively. And it’s just so impressive the way the whole machine works ― it’s such a well-oiled machine and the technology is mind-blowing.

What was it like shooting “Avengers: Infinity War” with so many characters? And directly after shooting “Guardians 2.”

We have been shooting those [Marvel} films for the last year. So I essentially wrapped filming “The Party’s Just Beginning” and went straight onto “Avengers” and juggled the [“Party’s”] edit with “Avengers.” But it was cool since I already know the character of Nebula so well now because I’ve played her in a couple of movies, so it’s slightly different because you don’t have the whole research part. The whole thing just felt like such an event that I can’t believe even logistically they pulled off getting 60-plus actors in major roles in one movie ― I don’t know how they did that! I kept on wondering, “The crew must be so tired, they worked for a year straight!” The actors are in and out a little bit more, but the crew is consistent. And they were all so happy. I think the way they achieved that was from keeping the shoot to 10-hour days so that they wouldn’t wear everybody down, where sometimes we could do 18- or 20-hour days if you include makeup and everything.

When you signed on for “Guardians,” did you know you’d be a part of the whole “Avengers” world?

No! I thought I was going to be in “Guardians” for an eight-day shoot. [Laughs] That’s what I signed on for! And now we’re sitting here five years later talking about the “Avengers” movie, so it’s blowing my mind so much.

Marvel Studios

Is your role big in this upcoming movie?

Nebula has a significant role and has a lot of stuff to do because her father is Thanos, who is the villain of the movies. She has some serious daddy issues with him, so she has a lot to confront. But also, I don’t know, because I haven’t seen the movie and I haven’t read the movie.

Yes, they’re keeping it very secret. We’re on the edge of our seats waiting!

The actors, too! We don’t know how any of our scenes fit into the overall context. So I guess I’ll find out at the premiere [which occurred in Los Angeles earlier this week].

Do you know how it ends?

No, because it’s hard to know. It’s hard to know what you’re shooting and where that fits into the story. We could’ve shot the end and I wouldn’t know it’s the end. And also, you only get your scenes from that day and then they’re taken away from you at the end of the day.

That’s intense! But through Marvel, you met people like Lee Pace, who stars in “The Party’s Just Beginning.”

Yes! We were already in Scotland prepping the film, we still needed a Dale [his character] and then I just thought of him, and we were like, “We’ll never be able to get him. He’s too big of an actor and so brilliant. Will he even do it?” And I just rang him, and he happened to be free. He was like, “Yeah, all right, I’ll come to Scotland for an experience!”

You have a whole list now of Marvel actors you can cast in future movies!

Yeah! That sounds great ... hopefully. [Laughs]

Will you continue directing?

Yes, I’m incredibly passionate about it. I can’t wait to make another film. It’s all I want to do right now.

I feel like you should direct the all-women Marvel movie we’re all waiting for.

OK, I’ll do it. [Laughs]

Do you think that could even happen?

Yeah, why not? Absolutely. I know all of the Marvel actresses talk about it and we’re all for it. I don’t know whether it will happen or not, but everybody’s really up for it.

About 170 dogs and monkeys were rescued in 2010 from an abandoned pharmaceutical testing lab owned by Shri Thanedar, a Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate currently leading in the polls.

Thanedar had to shutter the New Jersey testing facility, AniClin Preclinical Services, after its parent company, Azopharma, which he owned, went bankrupt in April 2010.

Local animal rights activists learned in June of that year that 118 beagles were still stuck inside the facility. The lab’s workers had been jumping the lab’s fences to provide food and water for the dogs, according to a USA Today report.

Two animal welfare groups teamed up to find homes for the beagles and were finally able to take them from the shuttered lab on July 4 to shelters, where they would be matched with adoptive families. A video report conducted by the Times Herald-Record, based in Middletown, New York, showed the dogs arriving in a van from the lab to a staging area where volunteers groomed and attended to the forlorn animals.

Even before the beagles were abandoned, they led lonely lives in small plexiglass crates where they were subject to toxicology tests.

“We believe that they have never been outside, ever,” said an unnamed woman in the Times Herald-Record video. “I don’t think they’ve actually had their paws on the grass. When I walked in here it looked like they were walking on eggshells. They were kind of afraid to walk on the grass.”

A few days later, the California-based group In Defense of Animals rescued 55 long-tailed macaque monkeys that had been left in the shuttered AniClin testing facility.

Acting on an anonymous tip from one of the monkeys’ former caregivers, IDA negotiated with the company that was liquidating the facility’s assets to release the monkeys rather than sell them to another testing facility. IDA claimed that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had cited the lab before it closed.

Thanedar told HuffPost on Wednesday night that the lab was under the control of Bank of America, which seized it when he declared bankruptcy.

“I have no knowledge how well the bank took care of the animals,” he said.

Thanedar also defended the treatment of animals in his lab while it was operating, claiming that it adhered to all the necessary rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other government agencies.

“No animal was harmed or subjected to any harmful conditions. No electric experiments were conducted,” he said.

Thanedar issued a second statement on Thursday further denying responsibility for the animals’ suffering.

“It is my understanding that Bank of America made arrangements to assign caretakers for the animals and secure homes for them, but those decisions came from the bank after I left the company,” Thanedar said. “I am an animal lover and completely understand the sensitivity of this issue.”

The campaigns of Thanedar’s two main competitors, former Michigan Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer and former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed, declined to comment on the apparent mistreatment of animals left in the AniClin facility.

However, a veteran Michigan Democrat with ties to none of the campaigns called the reports “concerning.”

“There are Democrats, Republicans and independents in Michigan and around the country,” said the Democrat, who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of the topic. “They disagree on many things. But I wouldn’t be afraid to wager that everybody, no matter their partisan affiliation, would be wary of someone who would so cruelly disregard the life of a domestic animal.”

It “should cause many people deep concerns about what other potential problems will come up throughout the campaign,” the Democrat added.

Thanedar poses a unique challenge for Michigan Democrats ― both in the party establishment, which has thrown its support behind Whitmer, and among the progressive activists who have warmed to El-Sayed’s candidacy.

Many top Michigan Democrats believe Thanedar is simply borrowing the progressive label to advance his political career. While Thanedar has donated to Democrats in recent years, in 2008, he contributed $2,300 to the presidential run of Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.). He also reportedly asked Michigan political consultants whether he should run as a Republican or a Democrat when he was planning his gubernatorial bid. Thanedar claims he was “noncommittal” about party affiliation so as not to reveal information to the consultants until he announced his candidacy, and he explains that he supported McCain because a friend was running the Arizona senator’s bid.

The abandonment of test animals is not the only controversial feature of Thanedar’s business history. An over-the-counter male enhancement supplement, S.W.A.G., that Thanedar’s company Avomeen tested in 2013, was later revealed to contain Viagra. An employee of Thanedar’s told the Detroit News in March that he had notified Thanedar when he found the traces of Viagra in the drug, but Thanedar did not report it to the Food and Drug Administration. The employee then notified the FDA on his own.

Thanedar claimed that it was his obligation to test the drugs and inform his clients of the rules, not to inform the federal government about client misconduct.

“We told them you have to report it. It’s illegal to do that,” Thanedar told HuffPost earlier this month. “That was the extent of my obligation.”

But Thanedar’s personal wealth from chemical testing businesses appears to have allowed him to project a tailored image of his candidacy. He has spent millions of dollars plastering the airwaves with ads that call him the most progressive candidate in the race.

Thanedar received the support of 21 percent of Democratic primary voters in a March poll, compared with 18 percent for Whitmer and 10 percent for El-Sayed.

Michigan’s Democratic primary is Aug. 7. The Democratic gubernatorial nominee will have the chance to win back the seat for Democrats after eight years of GOP rule.Lili Reinhart and Hart Denton in "Riverdale." CW

Chic Cooper, we hardly knew ye. No, seriously. When Betty’s long-lost brother Charles aka Chic (Hart Denton) first arrived in “Riverdale,” there was clearly something a bit off, but we had no idea things would go from zero to tied up and tortured in a basement so quickly.

Sure, the constant lurking, extracurricular web-camming and, oh, that time he murdered someone in the family kitchen might have raised some red flags. But it’s “Riverdale,” after all, and we got a little distracted by last week’s deadly high school musical, OK?

All was revealed on Wednesday night’s episode when (Spoiler alert!) Betty, her mother Alice and Jughead confronted Chic in a bloody face-off that’s been building all season. We learned that not only has Chic been pretending to be Charles Cooper all this time, but he also claims to have accidentally killed him during a heated argument. At least that’s one story he’s selling ― he also told Alice that her real son overdosed on jingle jangle, a fictional drug with a name we will never take seriously.

And the most twisted thing is, we might never know. By the end of the episode, Betty essentially leads Chic to slaughter by arranging a death date between him and the Black Hood, a serial killer that’s been picking off the town’s residents one by one. She does give him a head start though, sending Chic running into the distance as a man ― who Betty later suspects is her father, Hal Cooper (!) ― chases after him.

Before the episode, HuffPost spoke to Denton about his character’s possible demise, why he would never judge Chic after all he’s done and if we might see him on “Riverdale” ever again.

Chic above all else is a survivor, so I have to ask: Is this really the last we’ll see of him? He seems a bit more sprightly than the Black Hood in that chase scene.

Chic is going to get away. I was sprinting and just hauling through that graveyard. To my knowledge, there’s no way [the Black Hood] could catch me because I’d definitely survive. I think there’s more Chic to come and some redemption left for him. I have so many more questions and I want to see those things answered. Everyone should hang in there and wait and see.

If Chic were to return one day, how do you think he might pop up?

He’s got to come back in a heroic fashion and save the town, Betty or somebody else, especially if he wants to get another shot, since he is so creepy.

Speaking of ... it’s been well-established that Chic is, to put it one way, creepy AF. Do you empathize with him more now that some of his backstory has been revealed?

Since he was rescued from a horrible situation in that very first episode, I’ve had such a soft spot in my heart for Chic throughout the season. He comes from a whole different world and he doesn’t know how to live in this utopian-like town. It’s a circle and a square situation. He was trying to escape and blend into a new environment, but it got to a point where it wasn’t possible for him to do so. But you don’t know what someone has been through, so hold judgment.

A post shared by Hart Denton (@hartdenton) on Dec 4, 2017 at 1:26pm PST

When did you learn about Chic’s real identity, and how did that inform your approach to playing him?

[Series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa] really wanted me to be in the dark for acting purposes and just live organically week by week. I talked to him to ask him some things like, “What is up with this guy?” and “What is going on?” But looking back on that now, I appreciate him keeping me on the edge and not revealing anything until I got the script. Everyone works in different ways, but I like that process.

Now we know Chic lived with and maybe killed Betty’s real brother, Charles. It’s clear the two shared a close relationship. Your character’s sexuality is never really established on the show, so did you imagine them as lovers?

I do think he genuinely loved Charles, but to what capacity, I’m not sure. I felt that this was his love and they shared a very deep connection with each other. Chic does have a very dark past, but also such a deep adoration for so many people. I think he’s a very loving person.

But can we actually trust anything he says since he’s been lying this whole time?

I don’t think so. In most situations, he just says what someone wants to hear which makes it difficult to know if he’s good or not. It’s “Riverdale,” so who knows? Hopefully, at some point he gets to a place where all the lying is done and he apologizes for taking so long to get to the truth.

For fans who don’t know you outside of the show, what are you really like? Lili Reinhart (Betty) has joked that you have the same personality as Austin Powers. Is that true?

She’s such a goof. We quote “Austin Powers” all the time because we watch it so much. That character is obviously not the most intelligent being, so I’m not identical to him [Laughs] but I’m just a genuinely smiley, happy person. Chic is the complete opposite of me in that sense. While we were shooting the season, Lili always said she couldn’t wait for me to do interviews, so people can see me smiling nonstop.

Sometimes you play a role that’s too close to who you are and then people can’t separate it. Everybody is pretty understanding that I’m not a psycho, creepy or lying about stuff. It was a bit of therapy to crawl into someone else’s skin and not be Hart all the time.

Looking back, what was it like to join such a tight-knit cast in the second season? Do you feel part of the “Riverdale” family now?

Yeah, everybody took me in pretty lovingly with open arms from the get-go. I didn’t know that it was going to become what is is now. This whole process has been so wonderful and the cast is a real pleasure to be around because we are very grateful of this platform we’ve been given. The show is so powerful and it’s a beautiful thing.

I have to ask about Coachella, because it seemed like everybody from the cast was there. How did K.J. Apa (Archie) end up performing onstage with Kygo?

Kygo’s manager reached out to me and said they’re fans of the show and would love for [us] to come. We got to talking about K.J. playing guitar and then I called and got him down to Coachella.

So you hooked it up?!

Yeah, it was amazing to see. He had a phenomenal solo at the end and killed it.The more than 50 women who have accused disgraced comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault are finally one step closer to vindication.

A jury on Thursday found the veteran entertainer guilty on three felony counts ― including penetration with lack of consent, penetration while unconscious and penetration after administering an intoxicant ― at a retrial in Montgomery County court in Pennsylvania.

Speaking to the press outside the courthouse in Norristown, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of Cosby’s accusers, denounced the 80-year-old entertainer’s legal team for trying to smear the victims’ reputations after they testified against him.

“You tried. You failed. The personal attacks did not work,” Allred said. “Bill Cosby, three words for you: Guilty, guilty, guilty.”

After the verdict, three of the women who came forward, Victoria Valentina, Caroline Heldman and Lili Bernard, left the courtroom crying, celebrating the judgment with an emotional embrace.

Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in the present case, did not speak publicly after the verdict, but she was seen holding friends and family as she exited the courtroom.

“We are vindicated, we are validated and we are now part of the tsunami of women’s power and justice,” Valentino, 73, said during a press conference with other accusers and Allred.

“We are not shutting up and we are not going away,” Valentino added. “Get over it.”

Valentino, a former Playboy playmate, says Cosby raped her in an apartment in the Hollywood Hills in 1969.

“We are not shutting up and we are not going away.” - Victoria Valentina

Bernard, an actress who said Cosby drugged and raped her while she guest-starred on “The Cosby Show” in the early 1990s, also spoke after the trial, praising the Me Too movement.

“I stand here in the spirit of Martin Luther King, who said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but today it has bent towards justice,” Bernard said. “Today, this jury has shown what the Me Too movement is saying: that women are worthy of being believed.”

She added: “This is a victory not just for Andrea Constand, who I consider to be the Joan of Arc in the war on rape. It is not just a victory for the commonwealth [of Pennsylvania]. ... It is also a victory for womanhood and it is a victory for all sexual assault survivors ― female and male.”

In a statement, Janice Baker-Kinney, a former bartender who said Cosby drugged her after inviting her to a house party in Reno, Nevada, said in a statement that she feels she can now move on from her assault.

The “years of this toxic chain of silence has been broken and we can now move forward with our heads held high as survivors and not victims,” Baker-Kinney wrote.

“This may be the end for Mr. Cosby, but this victory is just the beginning for many of us, to fight for justice, to do the right thing and support every person who has ever been shamed and humiliated and blamed.”A statue of suffragette Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in Parliament Square in London, England, on April 24, 2018.

There’s a new face in London’s Parliament Square, and for the first time, it’s of a woman.

A statue of British suffragist and feminist icon Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in the northwest area of London on Tuesday alongside 11 other statues of historic male figures. The bronze statue portrays a 50-year-old Fawcett (around the age she became the leader of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies) with her hair pulled back, wearing an unassuming dress and holding a banner that reads, “Courage calls to courage everywhere.”

“I wanted her to be standing there not at all sexualized, but statesmanlike,” Caroline Criado-Perez, the freelance writer who created the petition last year to erect a statue in Fawcett’s honor, told The New York Times.

Fawcett is the first statue of a woman and the first statue designed by a woman in the city’s historic Parliament Square. The iconic women’s rights activist joins the company of statues that include former British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, alongside other international figures like Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi.

“When you think of the great people in Parliament Square, and when you realize that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven’t been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn’t been built on the back of great women?” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said before the unveiling ceremony.

Hundreds of people gathered in Parliament Square Tuesday to witness the unveiling of the statues, the BBC reported.

Born in 1847, Fawcett was part of the first wave of feminist thinkers who pushed for women get the right to vote. She identified as a suffragist instead of a “suffragette,” a historically more well-known title but one used to identify a later wave of more militant women’s advocates. Fawcett was radical in her ideology but favored non-violent protest. In 1897, she created the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies. She died in 1929, a year after women won the right to vote in the United Kingdom.

During the unveiling ceremony, British Prime Minister Theresa May applauded Fawcett and her tireless work that changed the course of the country’s history.

“I would not be standing here today as prime minister,” May said, “no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett.”

“I know that being a first-generation college student can be scary, because it was scary for me,” the former first lady wrote. “I was black and from a working-class neighborhood in Chicago, while Princeton’s student body was generally white and well-to-do.”

A post shared by Michelle Obama (@michelleobama) on May 22, 2018 at 2:09pm PDT

Obama, 54, noted how she’d “never stood out in a crowd or a classroom because of the color of my skin before” but soon found close friends and a mentor who gave her the confidence “to be myself.”

“Going to college is hard work, but every day I meet people whose lives have been profoundly changed by education, just as mine was,” Obama said. “My advice to students is to be brave and stay with it.”

She captioned the post with the #ReachHigher hashtag, in reference to the program she launched at the White House in 2014 which aimed “to inspire every student in America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school.”

Obama paid tribute to her parents, Marian and Fraser Robinson, with this picture earlier Tuesday:

Her father “taught me to work hard, laugh often, and keep my word,” Obama wrote. Her mother “showed me how to think for myself and to use my voice.”

On Wednesday, she shared this photograph from her wedding day to former President Barack Obama.

“You can’t tell it from this photo, but Barack woke up on our wedding day in October, 1992 with a nasty head cold,” she wrote. “Somehow, by the time I met him at the altar, it had miraculously disappeared and we ended up dancing almost all night.”

Obama has promised over the coming days to share more old photographs from her upcoming memoir, BECOMING, which is scheduled for release in November.After Bill Cosby was found guilty Thursday on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault, one of his more than 60 accusers ran out of a Pennsylvania courtroom sobbing.

Actress Lili Bernard said Cosby drugged and raped her in the early 1990s while she was guest-starring on the final season of “The Cosby Show.” It’s a story many other women echoed, and today their pain was validated after a jury found Cosby, 80, guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting former college women’s basketball coach Andrea Constand in 2004.

After the guilty verdict was read, audible gasps could be heard in the courtroom. Bernard and her friend Caroline Heldman left the room and collapsed onto a railing, Bernard sobbing as Heldman embraced her. Longtime Cosby accuser Victoria Valentino was also seen in tears embracing Heldman.

Bernard said Thursday’s verdict has restored her faith in humanity.

“It is a victory for womanhood,” Bernard said at a press conference shortly after the verdict. “It is a victory for all sexual assault survivors, female and male.”

Lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing the Cosby accusers, said “justice has been done.”

“Finally, we can say women are believed, not only on hashtag ‘Me Too’ but in a court of law,” Allred said. “I truly hope that his long list of victims will now be able to find some kind of peace.”When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in meet for their summit on Friday, they will dine on cold noodles made by a special machine and a fried potato dish from Kim’s youth, officials announced.

Preparations are being finalized for the first meeting between the two leaders, which is set to take place within the Demilitarized Zone, the heavily fortified border that separates their countries. Seoul’s presidential Blue House announced the menu for the summit this week, and each course appears to carry significant meaning emblematic of the region.

Dishes include staples from the hometowns of three South Korean presidents, a potato rosti that is meant to pay homage to the time Kim spent studying in Switzerland and a bibimbap made with greens grown in the DMZ.

The cold noodle dish, called naengmyun, will be made by one of Pyongyang’s star chefs. He and his staff will use a noodle-making machine to create the dish.

“President Moon had requested Pyongyang-style cold noodles from Okryu Gwan be included on the menu and North Korea gladly accepted,” a spokesman for the Blue House told Reuters. Okryu Gwan is a well-known restaurant in the North and has branches in China.

No schedule has been released for Friday’s meeting, but the two leaders are expected to issue a joint statement signaling the North’s willingness to abandon its nuclear weapon program. Although experts have remained skeptical that the country will do so easily, Moon has touted his optimism in the lead up to the summit.

Jews and their allies donned kippas and joined in public marches across Germany Wednesday, a response to growing concerns about anti-Semitism in the country.

The call from Jewish community leaders for the public solidarity events came a week after an attack on two men wearing skullcaps in Berlin. Marches were held in the capital, Erfurt, Cologne and Potsdam, The Associated Press reported.

A video of the attack went viral in Germany, eliciting condemnation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as Jewish and Muslim groups. The suspect, a 19-year-old Syrian asylum-seeker, turned himself in to police Thursday.

Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, suggested on a Berlin public radio program this week that Jews should avoid wearing traditional skullcaps in the country’s big cities.

But other Jewish leaders are urging the community to march in public and wear the kippa with pride.

“Jewish identity is not something we should hide,” Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal, an Orthodox rabbi in Berlin, told the AP. “We have to be proud of who we are and at the same time fight anti-Semitism.”

More than 2,000 people took part in Wednesday’s “Berlin Wears Kippa” event in the capital, according to Reuters. The event featured speeches from Jewish and Christian leaders, as well as local politicians.

In the eastern city of Erfurt, about 150 people joined a solidarity rally, according to the AP. A representative for ACHAVA Festspiele Thüringen, the interfaith group that organized the city’s march, told HuffPost it was attended by local politicians and Catholic, Protestant and Muslim community leaders.

The German daily newspaper Tagesspiegel offered a photo of a kippa on its website for readers to print, cut out and wear for the solidarity marches.

Anti-immigrant groups in Germany have blamed the anti-Semitic attacks on the arrival of more than 1.6 million migrants since 2014, many from the Middle East.

German Muslim groups have spoken out against the rise of anti-Semitism in their country. The country’s Central Council of Muslims is listed as a supporter of Wednesday’s solidarity march and has long condemned anti-Semitic attacks in Europe. Its president, Aiman Mazyek, told a regional newspaper that “there is anti-Semitism present among some refugees.” Mazyek said that the council was running educational programs for refugees, including organizing trips to former concentration camps and meetings with Jewish neighbors.

“Anti-Semitism, racism and hatred are great sins in Islam, therefore we will also never tolerate that,” Mazyek told the regional Rheinische Post.

Gokay Sofuoglu, the leader of Turkish Communities in Germany, an umbrella organization for Turkish groups in the country, told a local paper that the fight against anti-Semitism is crucial.

“If you want to fight Islamophobia, then you can’t tolerate anti-Semitism either. And we know where anti-Semitism ended up in German history,” Sofuoglu said, according to Reuters.

Former President George H.W. Bush has been moved from the intensive care unit at a Houston hospital to a regular room after contracting an infection over the weekend.

The positive development came three days after the 41st president of the U.S. was hospitalized at Houston Methodist Hospital on Sunday when the infection spread to his blood, his office had said.

In a statement released Wednesday, Bush’s office described the 93-year-old as “alert and talking with hospital staff, family and friends.” His doctors “are very pleased with his progress,” the statement said.

His office expects the former president to remain at the hospital for several more days.

Bush’s abrupt hospitalization on Sunday came one day after he attended the funeral for his wife, Barbara, who died last week at age 92.

In a sign of good cheer, his office’s statement added that the former president and avid sports fan “is more focused on the Houston Rockets closing out their playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves than anything that landed him in the hospital.”

The Houston Rockets, catching wind of his enthusiasm, cheered on his recovery with a post on Twitter.
