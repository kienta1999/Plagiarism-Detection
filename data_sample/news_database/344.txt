WASHINGTON – At least from a ratings standpoint, America’s 45 presidency without a doubt has had a successful first season, tremendous even.

Donald Trump made himself the center of attention like no previous chief executive, turning his every public appearance into must-watch television. He picked fights with fellow world leaders in phone calls, in speeches and on Twitter. He hinted about the size of his genitalia in a threat about nuclear weapons. He made falsehoods a defining feature of his White House, averaging nearly a half-dozen each day and racking up more than 2,000 as president. He has, repeatedly, made his own ignorance, his mental fitness and his bigot-friendly racial views a focus of national conversation.

The former reality TV host who improbably became the leader of the free world has unquestionably earned superlatives, although likely not the ones he and his fans had hoped: On the anniversary of his inauguration, Trump is the least-liked president in modern history, at this point in his term. Strong majorities of Americans find him dishonest, uninformed and temperamentally unfit for the job. Abroad, the United States’ standing has plummeted in the past year, to the point where China is seen as a better world leader.

To Trump’s critics, none of this is the least bit surprising.

“He has not changed from the horrible human being that he’s always been,” said Kendal Unruh, a longtime Republican activist who was drummed out of her local party in Colorado for leading the effort to strip the nomination from Trump at the 2016 GOP convention. “And now the whole world can see him for who he is.”

Trump and his White House, of course, disagree with assessments like Unruh’s. As he has from nearly the day he took office last January, Trump claims that his presidency has accomplished more than any previous one. “I don’t think any administration has ever done ― has done what we’ve done and what we’ve accomplished in its first year, which isn’t quite finished yet,” he said at a recent Cabinet meeting after first telling reporters: “Welcome back to the studio.”

A closer look at Trump’s list of claimed “historic” accomplishments, though, shows that virtually all of the major ones are generic Republican Party objectives that any GOP president would have approved. What’s more, they were almost entirely the work of a Republican Congress led by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and which had been waiting years for a Republican president to come along.

Those federal judges Trump brags about, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch? With few exceptions, they are products of the Federalist Society, the conservative group to which Trump outsourced the choosing of judicial nominees in 2016, combined with McConnell’s readiness to ram those names through his Senate despite Democratic objections.

Cutting regulations? While Trump has started the process for rolling back environmental and safety regulations on industries, he has taken credit for slashing hundreds of other regulations that were cut under President Barack Obama or were blocked from being implemented thanks to legislation the GOP Congress started preparing before Trump even took office.

And the tax cuts, the only significant legislation to pass under Trump’s watch? While Trump’s White House participated in crafting the measure, the heart of the bill – a massive and permanent cut to the nation’s corporate tax rate – has been a GOP priority for many years, and was an important part of the platforms of the other Republican presidential candidates in 2016. Trump didn’t even mention tax cuts in his infamous campaign announcement speech in 2015.

“This came out of Mitch McConnell’s and Paul Ryan’s world, not Donald Trump’s. They just needed him to sign it. That’s all,” said Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and vocal Trump critic. “Donald Trump couldn’t name five tangible things in this tax law.”

Republican congressional leaders have not been shy about where they believe the bulk of the credit for these achievements should go.

“This has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment by any objective standard,” McConnell said at his year-end news conference, specifically mentioning judges he had confirmed and the tax cuts – but not mentioning Trump by name during his six-minute opening statement. “I think we’ve made a difference for the country in beginning to move it right of center, which was the opportunity presented to us by the American people.”

The Best Presidency Ever – Just Ask Trump

Low-key statements like McConnell’s, though, have tended to get buried in the blizzard of claims Trump has made nearly from his first day in office about how successful he has been.

“There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time,” Trump proclaimed in a White House news conference 27 days after taking office.

Trump boasts about having vanquished the terrorist group ISIS, even though “his generals” essentially continued the offensive in Syria and Iraq started by the military under Obama several years ago. He brags about the the economy and the number of jobs he has created, even though the economy has followed roughly the same trajectory it was on under Obama (the number of jobs added in 2017 was actually lower than the number created in 2016). Trump even claimed credit for the lack of any fatal commercial airline accidents worldwide last year – a circumstance he had nothing to do with.

Longtime Trump friend Chris Ruddy, CEO of the Newsmax website, said Trump continues his tendency to “overstate” his accomplishments, probably from his background as a television entertainer. “I think it’s a theatrical and rhetorical flourish,” he said.

Whatever the reason, the unsubstantiated boasts, combined with daily falsehoods large and small, have undermined not just his own credibility, but that of the party he now leads.

Republicans learned this firsthand after passing their tax cuts. Majorities of Americans said in polls that their own households would not receive a tax cut, and were more likely to see their taxes go up – even though, in truth, the vast majority of households will see at least a temporary reduction.

“I personally think he should be more focused on accuracy,” Ruddy added. “Because I think it would be better for him in the long run.”

But given all of Trump’s actual promises during the campaign, accuracy might be even worse for him.

Trump did pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, as he promised, and the Paris climate accord. He has also implemented a watered-down version of his promised “extreme vetting” of travelers from a group of mostly-Muslim countries.

Many, many more of his campaign promises, however, have not been kept.

Trump said he would “get tough” with China and label the country a “currency manipulator.” After a year, he has done no such thing. Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with better health care at a fraction of the cost. He has done neither. And repeatedly, day in and day out, Trump promised he would build a “great wall” along the nation’s southern border and, more importantly, would force Mexico to pay for it. While some wall samples are being built in California, Trump has made no attempt to force Mexico to pick up the bill. If a wall ends up getting built, it will be American taxpayers bearing the billions of dollars in costs.

And of the 10 major pieces of legislation Trump promised to get passed in his first 100 days, only one – tax cuts – actually did pass, although it happened in his 11 month. The End the Offshoring Act, the Clean Up Corruption in Washington Act, the Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act ― not one of the other nine promised legislative accomplishments exists outside of Trump’s October 2016 press release.

Growing Into The Job. Or Not.

If Trump’s chaotic, even juvenile approach to the presidency has surprised Americans who only started paying attention to the 2016 presidential race in its final weeks, GOP leaders who had followed the primary as it unfolded in 2015 had a much better grasp of what they were facing.

“When I first saw him go down the escalator, I was aghast,” said one top Republican National Committee official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “When I saw him attack Megyn Kelly, I booed.”

Yet, despite his outlandish statements and behavior, most Republican Party leaders largely bought into the same myth that millions of his fans had accepted for years: That Trump was a shrewd and successful businessman and would employ those skills in the Oval Office. And like those fans, they came to that view from watching his long-running TV series, “The Apprentice,” and its spinoff, “Celebrity Apprentice.”

“They elected the character Donald Trump played on TV. They elected the character on ‘The Apprentice,’ who’s smart, who’s decisive, who’s a global business leader,” said GOP consultant Wilson. “He stumbles into this office. Of course he’s overmatched since Day One. You would not put this person in charge of a Waffle House, let alone the White House.”

While Trump has claimed over the years that he is both successful and smart, his decades-long record suggests quite the opposite.

Trump took over his father’s real estate business in 1974, when it was worth $200 million, a figure that inflates to over $1 billion in current dollars – meaning that the billionaire status he so frequently brags about actually came about thanks to his birth.

Over the years, amid the successes of his Trump Tower building in New York and various golf courses around the world, Trump’s business career has been littered with failures. There were branding flops like “Trump Steaks” and “Trump Vodka.” Outright fraud in the case of Trump University. But most consequential was the spectacular cratering of his New Jersey casinos, which brought him to the brink of personal bankruptcy.

The loss of creditworthiness following the casino failures limited the scope of Trump’s subsequent businesses. Instead of constructing and owning big, expensive buildings, Trump largely had to settle for renting out his name on other people’s buildings – a much less lucrative endeavor. In fact, one longtime friend said privately that Trump’s decision not to run for president in 2012 was based on a $15 million-a-year contract he had just been offered by NBC to renew his TV show. It was money he could not afford to turn down – a remarkable admission for a supposed multi-billionaire.

Of course, that Trump was not anywhere near as successful as he claimed was not a big secret. It had been the subject of numerous articles and books over the years. And thousands of publicly available lawsuits outlined the sorts of business practices Trump had used – from refusing to pay contractors what they were owed to aggressively trying to silence criticism.

Republican Party leaders, nevertheless, failed to perform even cursory research into Trump’s background when he began his presidential run in June 2015. Instead, they bought into his self-proclaimed wealth and believed his threats that he would run as a third-party candidate using his own money if Republicans were not nice to him, a view that informed several key decisions in the weeks and months that followed. When Trump during the first GOP debate refused to promise to back the eventual nominee, then-party Chairman Reince Priebus could have informed Trump that he would not be participating in the second debate. Instead, Priebus traveled to Trump Tower and begged Trump to sign a pledge to back the nominee, whoever that might be. In so doing, Priebus instantly gave Trump the high status within the party that he had previously lacked.

When Trump ultimately won the nomination, party leaders did their best to keep Trump’s statements to prepared speeches delivered off a Teleprompter, in the hopes of limiting off-script remarks that could hurt the chances of Republican congressional candidates.

Few, if any, thought Trump could actually win, and therefore gave little thought to running and staffing the government’s executive branch.

The Chaos Theory of Governing

As the transition began following Trump’s stunning victory, with the job of governing less than three months away, many GOP leaders assured each other that Trump would grow into the job, that the responsibilities of the office would weigh on him.

That largely has not happened.

“You can’t look at 70 years of history and say, oh, he’s going to be transformed when he gets a new job,” Unruh said. She added that many in her former party saw in Trump’s unformed political history an opportunity to mold a rubber stamp for whatever they wanted. “They truly thought they could control him like a puppet. The agenda has come to a screeching halt because of the chaos.”

That Trump failed to grow and learn in office is a disappointment for Republicans, but probably should have been expected. In fact, Trump described his approach to work three decades earlier, in his Art of the Deal bestseller that led to the TV shows. “I leave my door open. You can’t be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you’ve got too much structure,” he wrote. “I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.”

That business model, questionable even for actual businesses, wound up generating pure turmoil in the West Wing in the early months. Trump would take meetings with whomever on his staff happened to stroll into the Oval Office. His tendency to accept the advice of the last person he has listened to meant the White House frequently was sending out conflicting messages on policy positions. When Republicans in Congress tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for example, they were often confronted by Trump’s own changing positions – confusion that was further compounded by his lack of knowledge or interest in the topic.

“The president likes to do things by trial and error,” said Ruddy, who said he predicted a “big adjustment period” after Trump took office. “He’s not a strategic planner.”

The arrival of retired Marine Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff last summer was supposed to bring order and structure to the White House, and in some measure it has. Oval Office visits are now strictly controlled, as are phone calls through the White House switchboard during business hours.

But Trump has responded to the reduced access by adopting a lighter work schedule – one that typically does not start until 11 a.m. and ends by 6 or 6:30 p.m. That has left plenty of time to watch cable television coverage about himself and then react to it in off-the-cuff remarks to the press and, more famously, brief statements he releases on Twitter.

The Tweeter-In-Chief

From the start of Trump’s presidency, his staff and entire administration have had trouble dealing with Trump’s tendency to say untrue and inflammatory things generally, but particularly on Twitter, which Trump jealously defends as his sure-fire method of getting his “unfiltered” message out to his supporters.

Former press secretary Sean Spicer, after first ridiculing reporters who asked about the value of presidential tweets, soon was forced to concede that Trump’s tweets were, by definition, official statements of the president. Since then, press staff and others have frequently responded to particularly absurd missives with the all-purpose: “The tweet speaks for itself.”

Sometimes, though, Trump’s habit of typing out an idea without thinking it through has generated real consequences.

Trump’s claims that Obama wiretapped him at Trump Tower in 2016 has required his own Department of Justice lawyers to concede, in official federal court filings, that Trump’s assertions are at times completely baseless.

“The tweet simply does not reference FISA and does not state definitively that any such surveillance occurred,” DOJ lawyers recently wrote in a case responding to a Freedom of Information Act request regarding the claimed wiretapping.

Last week, Trump’s habit of watching the “Fox & Friends” morning program and basing policy positions on what he sees nearly derailed renewal of a key law enabling electronic surveillance of foreigners overseas.

The bill had bipartisan support, with only small factions of liberals and libertarians opposing it, as well as the backing of U.S. intelligence agencies – all of which are now under Trump’s control. Trump nevertheless started tweeting against it, requiring an emergency intervention by Kelly and House Speaker Ryan to explain the bill to him and persuade him to write a follow-up tweet reversing his opposition.

Later in the week, Trump gave an hour-long, televised performance hosting a meeting on the plight of some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. Democrats and Republicans backing a bill protecting their status were stunned a day later, when Trump called a much smaller meeting – not televised – where he reversed his earlier position while reportedly refusing to help immigrants from “shithole countries” like Haiti or those in Africa.

And this week, it was again Trump’s Twitter feed generating chaos, as he started Thursday morning by attacking a compromise to keep the government funded past a Friday night deadline. This time, it was deputy press secretary Raj Shah who had to undo the damage, releasing a statement that Trump does, in fact, support the spending bill.

Now What?

With Trump’s first 365 days down with, at best, limited successes, Republicans confront a second year that is not merely challenging, but potentially devastating.

Midterm elections are just 10 months away, and the party faces the very real possibility of losing control of the House because of Trump’s unpopularity. State elections in New Jersey and in Virginia in November showed big energy among Democratic voters. A special state Senate election in Wisconsin this week in a solid GOP district was won by a Democrat.

“Very nervous,” is how a key RNC member described the consensus within the party, on condition of anonymity. “There’s not a whole lot that can be done. A lot of it depends on the national mood, and we don’t know what that’s going to be.”

In terms of a legislative record to run on, Republicans are unlikely to have much to add to the tax cuts from December. McConnell has already said he’s not inclined to make another run at Obamacare. The two issues most mentioned as congressional agenda items are infrastructure spending and immigration – neither of which appears terribly likely to pass at this moment.

Which means that the fortunes of congressional Republicans are in all probability tied to the president’s behavior in the coming months, with success riding on his ability to settle down and act more “presidential.” GOP leaders are not optimistic.

“We saw this during the campaign,” the RNC member said. “If you were thinking about it, you said: He’s 70 years old. He isn’t going to change. And he hasn’t changed.”

Friend and supporter Ruddy thinks Trump, for whatever reason, believes he must hold onto the 30 percent or so of Americans who fervently support him, no matter the cost.

“I think he’s sticking too closely to the Breitbart talking points. That’s fine with the base, but it’s not a broad governing strategy,” Ruddy said. “I think it may take the loss of the House, the Senate, or both, for him to reconsider the strategy.”At least 677,774 people in the United States followed, retweeted or liked content distributed by Russian government-linked Twitter accounts in a 10-week span prior to the 2016 U.S. election, Twitter announced Friday.

The social networking site also increased its tally of profiles linked to the Internet Research Agency, the organization behind the Russian propaganda effort, to a total of 3,814 accounts, responsible for 175,993 tweets over that same time period.

Those tweets were amplified by an additional 50,258 “automated accounts,” Twitter added, noting the propaganda they spread “represents a challenge to democratic societies everywhere.”

The company added, “We have since made significant improvements, while recognizing that we have more to do as these patterns of activity develop and shift over time.”

Twitter released five examples Friday of some of the Russian-backed content that received the most engagement, and pledged to notify via email those who had interacted with it:

Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter

Given Twitter’s relatively short 10-week timeframe for this analysis, it’s likely Russia’s reach was far greater. An investigation by Facebook spanning a two-year period before the election found similar content from Russia was seen by more than 126 million Americans.President Donald Trump and his party are likely to bear the brunt of public blowback for the shutdown, three polls released in the runup to the event all suggest.

But how pollsters ask about the situation matters. And using recent history as a guide, there’s good reason to suspect that any blowback from a shutdown could wear off long before November.

Americans said by a 20-point margin, 48 percent to 28 percent, that President Trump and Republicans would be more to blame than Democrats for the impending threat of a shutdown, in a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Friday. Nearly 80 percent of Democrats put the blame on the president and his party, while a smaller two-thirds majority of Republicans cast the blame on the Democrats.

A Quinnipiac poll out earlier in the week, which separated out Trump from the congressional GOP, found that 32 percent of voters would blame Republicans in Congress, 34 percent would blame Democrats in Congress, and another 21 percent would blame Trump. And a third survey from CNN and the polling firm SSRS, released Friday, which also asked a three-way blame question found that 31 percent would place the most responsibility on congressional Democrats, 26 percent would place it on congressional Republicans, and 21 percent would assign it most to Trump (a tenth volunteered that they’d blame everyone).

In both cases, that works out to a plurality of blame focused on Trump and the GOP, even if the Democrats don’t emerge entirely unscathed.

But the CNN/SSRS poll also posed another question with a very different framing, asking respondents to choose whether it was more important for Congress to “[approve] a budget agreement that would avoid a government shutdown” or to “[pass] legislation to maintain the program which allows immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the U.S.”

In response, Americans prioritized keeping the government open, 56 percent to 34 percents. Even Democrats were relatively divided, with 49 percent more concerned about the DACA program, but 42 percent more worried about a shutdown. Republicans and independents overwhelmingly said avoiding a shutdown was more important.

None of these questions are inherently better or worse ways of looking at the shutdown. But the discrepancy between the responses underlines how much it matters what frame Americans will use to think about the shutdown when they’re not being directly asked by pollsters ― or how much they’ll be thinking about it at all.

That’s especially challenging to gauge based on polls conducted before the shutdown, which required Americans to hypothetically assign blame for an event that hadn’t yet happened. And a lot will depend on both parties’ messaging in the days to come, as well as the length of the shutdown and the degree of tangible effects to come out of it.

Still, it’s not a stretch to suggest that a high-profile bout of government turmoil isn’t likely to do much good for the party that controls the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. If that holds true, it could stem what appeared to be a modest recent improvement for the GOP in voter preference polls ahead of this year’s congressional election, a measure in which they’re still currently lagging.

But Democrats hoping a shutdown would saddle the opposition in this year’s midterms should take a cautionary note from the shutdown in 2013 under the Obama administration. The GOP, which only controlled the House of Representatives at the time, also took the blame, causing an immediate, damaging effect on the party’s image, which plunged to a record low.

That effect, however, wore off long before Election Day 2014, when the Republicans saw sweeping gains.

Polling from that election cycle shows this in action ― the public’s preference for a Democratic candidate over a Republican one spiked sharply as the specter of a shutdown loomed in fall 2013, but receded almost entirely in October and November, returning to the status quo less than three months later.

There are a few differences this time around. Election Day is a little closer for one thing, and, Republicans’ control of the government may make it harder for them to disperse the blame. Democrats are starting from a far stronger electoral position in these midterms than they were in four years ago. But it’s far from clear that the shutdown will have much to lend to their arsenal by November.WASHINGTON ― One year ago, Donald Trump stood at the U.S. Capitol and took his place as the nation’s 45th president. He promised to be a man of action, taking charge of a government for the people and away from the establishment.

“We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done,” Trump promised.

“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ― constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he added. “The time for empty talk is over.”

But exactly a year later, on the anniversary of Trump’s big day, the federal government is shut down.

Congress was unable to come to an agreement to keep the government funded by midnight Friday, resulting in the first shutdown since 2013.

Trump and his GOP allies tried to pin the blame on Democrats, even attempting to give it the name #SchumerShutdown.

The fact remains, however, that Republicans control the White House, the House and the Senate. For years, they blamed Democrats for obstruction and told voters to give them full control of the executive and legislative branches so that they could finally govern.

But Republicans were unable to do the most basic task Friday night: Keep the federal government’s lights on.

In the most recent government shutdowns, the presidency and Congress have been controlled by different parties ― and they’ve pointed fingers at each other over who gets the blame. (The public has generally faulted the GOP-led Congress.)

But in this case, Republicans will be trying to argue that Democrats ― who control nothing because they’re in the minority ― are the ones at fault.

It’s clear, however, that the Trump administration is nervous about the fallout. The Department of the Interior was figuring out a way to keep national parks open during the shutdown, recognizing during the 2013 shutdown that the shuttered entrances and frustrated tourists became potent symbols of what Congress’ dysfunction had wrought.

One of Trump’s major selling points during the campaign was his ability to make deals. He could sit down with people and get them to agree to things that no one else could.

But Trump is part of the reason that Washington has found itself in such a mess this week.

Trump, after all, was the one who removed the protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, telling Congress that lawmakers had to instead put in place a measure to protect them.

Democrats, at various times, have believed that Trump would support a deal to protect the Dreamers, in exchange for certain border security measures. But that optimism was blown up last week when Trump reportedly denigrated immigrants from Haiti and African nations, saying they were “shithole” countries and he’d rather see people come from Norway, a very white European nation.

Trump received widespread criticism for his remarks, and the next day he announced there would be no bipartisan deal.

The Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate ― along with the Republicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate ― were unable to come to an agreement by the funding deadline Friday night, and now the federal government is shut down.

The last time the federal government shut down, in 2013, about 800,000 workers were furloughed without pay, and this time, a similar number is expected to be affected.

And Trump, despite his rhetoric in his inaugural address, is ill-prepared to deal with the shutdown. Federal employees said Friday that they had barely received any guidance about what to do in the event of a shutdown ― a big difference from what happened in 2013, under President Barack Obama. Trump still has failed to nominate people for a sizable number of important positions in the government, and many of the people in his administration don’t have experience dealing with past crises.

In his book The Art of the Deal, Trump boasts, “Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.”

But the first year of his presidency has exposed the hollowness of that rhetoric, showing it takes more than simply talking big to run the government.Ed Sheeran announced his engagement to girlfriend Cherry Seaborn on Saturday in an Instagram post that was pretty darn adorable.

“Got myself a fiancé just before new year,” the “Perfect” singer wrote. “We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well xx.”

A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on Jan 20, 2018 at 5:49am PST

People reports that Seaborn, 24, is a risk advisory consultant and that she and Sheeran started dating in 2015. But the two have known each other much longer ― they were childhood friends who went to school together, according to The Guardian.

Sheeran, 26, has credited Seaborn with helping him in his past struggle with substance abuse and in recovering after a bike accident.

And as for those “chuffed” (read: happy) cats, that would be Calippo and Dorito, who are social media stars in their own right.

A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on Dec 2, 2017 at 7:35am PST

Sheeran’s previously alluded to the felines being a symbol of stability in his relationship with Seaborn.

“I spent every day for a year with this certain person, we kind of have a strong relationship now, which is good,” he told BBC Radio 2 in February. “I’m really secure now, we live together and we have cats, and I think when you have cats that’s kind of it.”The Donald Trump presidency is now one year old and in many respects ― the unhinged tweeting, the contempt for democratic norms, the potential collusion with a hostile foreign power ― it has been unlike any presidency in history.

But there is one respect in which Trump’s tenure in office has been rather ordinary: his administration’s year-long effort to push familiar Republican initiatives that shift money and power towards corporations and the rich, and away from everybody else.

No, this is not the kind of presidency that Trump promised. As a candidate, he portrayed himself as a different sort of Republican, one who would attack the financial industry, govern independently of wealthy special interests, and protect public programs on which poor and middle-class Americans depend.

On Inauguration Day, speaking from the steps of the Capitol building, Trump reaffirmed those allegiances and priorities: “We are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.”

Of course, when Trump vowed to protect “the forgotten men and women of our country,” he likely had a specific subset of men and women in mind ― working-class Americans and, in particular, white working-class Americans. Stoking their racial resentment has been a theme of his presidency, just as it was a theme of his candidacy.

In public, Trump has assailed African-American football players for protesting during the national anthem. In private, he has said he wants to stop letting in immigrants from “shithole” (or, in some versions, “shithouse”) countries. In that sense, he has been exactly the kind of president he promised to be.

But the attacks on people of color, both abroad and home, look less and less like an effort to protect his supporters and more and more like a smokescreen for policies that will leave them ― along with most poor and middle-class Americans ― worse off than they were before. In a presidency that already has a reputation for dishonesty and graft, what Trump policies are doing to America’s workers may be the biggest con of all.

Giving Big Tax Breaks For The Wealthy

By far the clearest example of this is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which the Republican Congress passed and Trump signed in December. The legislation showers the vast majority of its benefits on businesses, investors and the wealthy ― by permanently reducing taxes for corporations, the owners of “pass-through” businesses, and holders of large estates. And although it also lowers some taxes for lower- and middle-income households, those cuts are smaller and temporary.

Ten years out, once the law takes full effect, more than half of all taxpayers will be paying more and most of the rest will see no change, according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center.

Center on Budget and Policy Priorities

Trump and his allies say those numbers don’t matter, because the tax cut will mean higher wages and more jobs ― both of which will benefit American workers. And lately Trump has been touting news of one-time bonuses that companies are offering, supposedly because of the tax cut, as vindication of the GOP argument.

But many of those same companies are laying off workers. And, in any event, the test of the tax cut’s impact will be what it mean over the long term. In a survey of 42 top economists by the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, just one ― one! ― thought Republican tax cuts would significantly improve growth.

Trying To Take Health Insurance From Millions

The tax cut is Trump’s only major legislative accomplishment, but it wasn’t supposed to be. He and his congressional partners spent more of the year focusing on health care, as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort fell short, in no small part because GOP repeal proposals looked nothing like what Trump had promised.

Instead of providing better, cheaper health care to all Americans ― a vow Trump made repeatedly in his campaign, sometimes using it to distinguish himself from rival GOP candidates ― repeal would have meant millions of poor and middle-class Americans losing their coverage. Some younger and healthier people would have ended up saving money, but only because older, sicker people would have ended up spending more ― or going without insurance altogether.

Stymied on the legislative front, Trump has carried on his war against “Obamacare” by using his executive authority. And here he has been more successful.

He cut funding for advertising for HealthCare.gov and for the groups that assist people with enrollment. He cut off a key set of payments to insurers, prompting some to raise rates and others to abandon markets altogether. And he’s given states a green light to change their Medicaid programs in ways that will make it harder for poor people, especially those with chronic physical and mental health problems, to get and keep coverage.

Undoing Rules To Protect Workers And Consumers

Trump’s tax cut and health care efforts have gotten a ton of attention. But they by no means capture the full extent of his governing agenda ― or the different ways his policies break his promise to American workers.

In March, Trump signed a Republican bill rescinding the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Act, an Obama-era law that required federal contractors to disclose and then address violations of labor law and worker safety regulations. In August, the Trump administration announced it was postponing implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule ― another Obama-era legacy ― that requires investment managers to act in the best interests of their clients. It’s widely understood that the administration is merely buying time for a more formal rewrite or outright repeal of the regulation.

“They’re just pandering to big corporations, They don’t care about family farms.” - Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) on a Trump administration regulatory change

In October, the Trump administration confirmed that it intended to rewrite Obama’s rewrite of overtime rules, which would have extended overtime pay to more than 12 million workers. The Trump administration intends to scale that back, although not completely. And just last week, the Trump administration announced it was putting the brakes on new regulations for payday lenders, designed to stop them from exploiting low-wage workers by loading them up with unpayable debts.

Another major thrust of Trump’s agenda is protecting businesses from lawsuits, even when they act in ways that exploit or harm consumers ― helping to foster what Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, has called a “Grifter Economy.”

An example of this was the reversal of yet another Obama-era rule that, for the first time, exposed banks and credit card companies to class action lawsuits by consumers who believed they were victims of fraud. The Trump administration and its allies claimed this was an effort to help consumers, because class action lawsuits merely enrich trial lawyers. But, as consumer advocates point out, fear of class action suits and their potentially big awards are precisely what it takes to keep large financial institutions in line.

Weakening Protections For Factory Workers And Farmers

In some ways, though, the most revealing policy changes of Trump’s first year are the ones that affect the very groups he always claims to champion.

Trump frequently talks about factory workers, and just this week he was in western Pennsylvania pledging to fight for them. But in the past year he has delayed implementation of rules designed to protect workers from inhaling toxic substances, including beryllium (a major hazard for steelworkers) and silica dust (a major hazard in construction). The plan, once again, is to scale back the rules in ways that expose many more workers to the hazards.

Yet another group that Trump loves to champion is farmers. But Trump this year overturned a regulation that made it easier for independent farmers to sue food companies and large agricultural conglomerates. And now the Environmental Protection Agency is talking about rescinding regulations that prohibit underage workers from handling toxic pesticides.

When defending the change in farmer lawsuits, Trump administration officials made the same basic argument they did for most of their regulatory changes: that they were merely reducing frivolous lawsuits and eliminating paperwork, so that businesses can create more jobs.

The idea that regulation stifles the economy, ultimately hurting consumers or workers more than they help, is one that conservatives believe sincerely ― and that, in any given case, is a reasonable subject for debate. But on the rule change for farmers, even some of the president’s allies thought it was more about helping powerful friends. “They’re just pandering to big corporations,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. “They don’t care about family farms.”

In public, Trump always suggests otherwise. Whether he’s talking about rules for farmers or bankers, or changes to taxes or health care, he always says what he did at the Capitol a year ago ― that he’s fighting powerful interests and protecting the “forgotten American.”

Advertisement“Sex and the City” co-stars Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker may have had their differences in the past, but the two are unanimous in their support of Ellen DeGeneres as Samantha Jones.

Parker, 52, first floated the idea of DeGeneres taking over for Cattrall in “Sex and the City 3” during a Tuesday appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

The star, who currently appears on HBO’s “Divorce,” said that she and the SATC team were in the midst of a “period of grief” after Cattrall, 61, announced she had no interest in appearing in a third “Sex and the City” film last fall. She gestured toward DeGeneres, noting that once the mourning period was through, “Then, perhaps, we’ll be able to consider, say, for instance, you playing Samantha.”

Parker’s suggestion garnered cheers and applause from the audience, and DeGeneres herself seemed on board with the idea.

“I am a sexual beast,” she quipped.

But the plan got the ultimate stamp of approval Wednesday. After People tweeted its report about Parker’s suggestion, Cattrall responded with two thumbs up.

She’d be fabulous! 👍👍 — Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) January 17, 2018

A day later, Cattrall suggested offering Tiffany Haddish and Sofia Vergara the role of Samantha if DeGeneres wasn’t available.

I am partial to @TheEllenShow but @Oprah was always my 1st ❤️. But then there are the goddess’s @TiffanyHaddish or @SofiaVergara So many fabulous actresses to choose from that will make Samantha their own! https://t.co/ZYRRBWh6QD — Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) January 19, 2018

Though Cattrall’s Samantha and Parker’s Carrie were best friends on “Sex and the City,” the actresses’ off-screen relationship has reportedly been contentious for years.

The drama came to a head last September when Parker announced that plans for a third “Sex and the City” film had officially been scrapped. Reports that Cattrall’s “diva demands” halted production prompted the actress to explain her decision to forgo another sequel in a series of subsequent interviews and social media posts.

“I have too much I want to experience before much time goes by,” Cattrall wrote on Instagram in October. “Going back to playing this role wouldn’t make me happy. I’ve worked hard and I’d like to enjoy what I’ve accomplished with the people closest to me.”

For her part, Parker seemed interested in keeping open the option to revisit the series later on down the line.We’re now a full year ― and more than 500 approval polls ― into Donald Trump’s presidency. Here’s what those polls show about how Americans view him so far, and what might happen in 2018.

1. Trump’s approval rating started off historically bad. It’s only gotten worse.

Trump marks his first anniversary as president more unpopular than he was when he took the job. That’s not unusual ― many first-term presidents see their numbers drop.

What’s unusual about Trump is just how little goodwill he began with. Unlike his recent predecessors, he took office with Americans equally split between approving and disapproving of his job performance, according to HuffPost Pollster’s average of public polling ― and that marked a relative high point.

Within a month, Trump saw his disapproval ratings begin to rise as those who’d previously been neutral became increasingly less likely to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Trump’s first months were marked by “no honeymoon period to speak of and approval ratings far worse than any president has received this early in his tenure” Gallup’s Jeffrey M. Jones wrote in April, after Trump posted the worst first-quarter ratings for any president elected to his first term since World War II.

A year later, surveys are consistent in showing that a majority of the nation is unhappy with the president’s performance. About 55 percent disapprove of the job he’s done, per Pollster’s average as of Saturday morning, while just under 41 percent approve.

That’s an improvement from December, but these are still easily the worst numbers for a first-year president since pollsters first began keeping track. Trump’s standing is similar to President Richard Nixon’s months into the Senate hearings on the Watergate scandal. And, according to data collected by Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, while individual pollsters’ assessments of Trump vary, nearly all find him lagging behind his immediate predecessor, former President Barack Obama.

Charles Franklin

2. Trump’s numbers are relatively stable.

In the last six months, Trump’s approval rating has remained between 37 and 42 percent in Pollster’s average, neither soaring nor dramatically crashing.

“Trump’s approval ratings aren’t just noteworthy because they are low,” CNN’s Ryan Struyk noted Wednesday in an analysis of Gallup data. “They are also the flattest, least fluid approval ratings for any elected president since modern surveys started.”

“During his first year, Trump’s approval ratings have stayed within a narrow 10-point range ― from 45% at his inauguration to a low of 35% multiple times over the last several months,” Struyk said. “Former President Barack Obama’s had moved 18 points, George W. Bush’s had moved 39 points and Bill Clinton’s had moved 22 points to this point in their tenures. In fact, only Lyndon B. Johnson had less movement in approval polling during his first year in office.”

That could indicate that Trump may be close to his natural floor of support for the current political situation (the not-inconceivable development of something like a foreign policy crisis or an economic slump would, of course, change the calculus.)

But it may also mean there’s little room for him to rebound to a neutral or positive rating. Most Americans who disapprove of Trump say that they don’t see anything positive about his record, and that there’s almost nothing he can do to change their minds.

By contrast, his numbers ticked up during last fall’s hurricane season, perhaps both because he saw some of his best ratings as president for his handling of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and because the weather-focused news cycle kept his name out of the headlines more than usual.

3. Opinions of Trump are deeply polarized, but he inspires more robust opposition than support.

Survey after survey conducted last year showed Americans to be immensely polarized on practically every political issue, with the clearest example being opinions of Trump himself. Opinions on many of the actions Trump has taken ― for instance, concerns about his administration’s relationship with Russia ― remain more or less intractably divided along party lines. That polarization is another factor in the stability of Trump’s ratings.

Americans’ willingness to support a president across the aisle has shrunk dramatically in recent years. That trend accelerated markedly under Trump, who has reasonably strong ratings within his own party but remarkably little backing from the opposition.

Last spring, we noted that Republicans were 78 points likelier than Democrats to approve of Trump’s first-quarter job performance. Between Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton, that gap was never above 50 points.

Although it’s entirely true that most of the president’s voters are sticking with him, it’s also true that “most” is not the same as “all.” And notably, Trump’s detractors are far more unified ― and vociferous ― than his supporters.

Nearly 60 percent of Trump voters strongly approve of his job performance, according to YouGov/Economist tracking data ― but nearly 90 percent of Clinton voters strongly disapprove.

HuffPost

Similarly, strong disapproval of the GOP’s failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its successful bid to pass tax reform has consistently outstripped the strong approval of such efforts.

4. Views of the economy are way out of whack with views of the presidency.

Throughout 2017, pollsters found Americans generally happy with the state of the economy, but less happy with Trump.

“If you take the president’s scores out of this poll, you see a nation increasingly happy about the economy,” pollster J. Ann Selzer told Bloomberg in July. “When Trump’s name is mentioned, the clouds gather.”

That’s unusual: Economic views are traditionally among the strongest drivers of presidential approval. As FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten noted last fall, past presidents dating back to Jimmy Carter had higher ratings on overall job approval than they did for their handling of the economy. Trump breaks that pattern in a major way.

It’s perhaps understandable that the public wouldn’t give Trump much credit for an economic revival that clearly predated his presidency. Nearly a year into Trump’s term, voters are still more likely to say that Obama is responsible for the state of the economy.

But Trump’s approval rating, Gallup found, is 9 to 14 points lower than the public’s views of the economy would predict.

Gallup

5. Trump’s low approval rating probably matters for this year’s elections.

It’s still a little too soon to be talking about Trump’s re-election prospects, but his unpopularity poses a more immediate problem for the GOP: The president’s party tends to do worse in midterms when the president’s ratings are low.

“Historically, when voters are unhappy with a president, they take it out on his party during the midterm elections,” The Weekly Standard’s David Byler wrote this week. “Trump’s approval rating and the Republican share of the generic congressional vote typically aren’t far off each other. This suggests that voters who disapprove of Trump are unwilling or at least hesitant to support the congressional GOP.”

And while good economic indicators would normally be a boon to the GOP, Trump’s unpopularity, and his tendency to dominate the news cycle, may overshadow them. This year’s midterms are still months away, and there’s plenty of time for things to change ― several recent surveys have shown the Democratic lead in congressional polling starting to taper.

But as things stand, Trump’s position at the head of the party seems unlikely to do down-ballot Republican candidates many favors.

“It’s hard to get any traction on anything, so far, other than the president personally,” Republican pollster Bill McInturff told NBC.

A few more roundups of the polling on Trump’s first year:In New York City, an electrified crowd — estimated at more than 120,000 people — stretched for some 20 blocks. Among those carrying signs was 30-year-old Nikki Vargas, an immigrant from Colombia. She told HuffPost she is “horrified by the blatant xenophobia, the blatant racism, the gender biases of this president.”

Vargas marched at last year’s event in New York, an experience she described as “incredible” and powerful. But she feels even more energy one year into Trump’s term.

“This march is even different from the last one, because of the #MeToo movement and the spotlight on sexual assault victims,” Vargas said. “This march ― there’s a lot more rage and a lot more anger in this march, and I think we’re gonna see a lot of women out there defending those who didn’t have a voice before.”Four Florida men who authorities say were the ones captured on surveillance cameras pummeling a gay couple last month are now facing felony hate crime charges.

Footage of the April 8 attack shows Rene Chalarca and his boyfriend, Dmitry Logunov, being brutally beaten by four men after the Miami Beach Gay Pride festival. The couple was holding hands just before the assault.

When a bystander, Helmut Muller Estrada, attempted to protect the victims, he too was beaten until he was knocked unconscious and awoke in a pool of his own blood, according to reports.

The suspects are Luis M. Alonso Piovet, 20; Juan Carlos Lopez, 21; Adonis Diaz, 21; and Pablo Reinaldo Romo-Figueroa, 21. They turned themselves in the following day after their faces were plastered on the news and social media. At the time, authorities charged them with aggravated battery. Now they’ll be facing new charges of aggravated battery committed with prejudice, the Miami Herald reported Friday.

During the assault, police said, the four men called the victims “maricones,” an anti-gay slur in Spanish. Chalarca said he believes he and his boyfriend were attacked simply because of their sexuality.

“We were together,” Chalarca told WPLG, a local ABC affiliate. “So for me, it’s like, yes, it was a hate crime.”

AdvertisementThe federal government shut down at midnight on Saturday after Republicans and Democrats in Congress failed to agree on a spending deal, leaving agency offices dark and federal employees around the country waiting to be furloughed.

The standoff could inconvenience millions of Americans, depending on how long it lasts. But if nothing else, at least we’ll save some money in the meantime, right?

Not at all, actually. We might assume that government grinding to a halt would spare us some taxpayer dollars. But past shutdowns have demonstrated that the opposite is true ― these interruptions are actually quite expensive, both for government and the broader economy.

There are lots of ways that government closures waste money. For starters, while members of Congress bargain and posture in the days leading up to the deadline, federal agencies have to prepare for the possibility of a shutdown, whether it happens or not. That means they’re basically spending time and money getting ready to close, rather than carrying out their basic functions.

Once Congress hashes out a deal and operations finally resume, these agencies have to play catch-up. They inevitably have backlogs to deal with, and the disrupted workflow hurts customer service and makes offices less efficient, as the Government Accountability Office has found in the past. Think about when you come back to work after being sick for a few days ― the work didn’t disappear, it just piled up on your desk.

But don’t we save money on labor costs with all the furloughs? Nope. In previous shutdowns, Congress has retroactively passed legislation to pay federal workers for all the work they missed ― as well it should. These folks have bills to pay and families to feed. Why should they pay a price because their representatives couldn’t get their act together?

That means the government ends up paying for work that simply didn’t get done. After the last shutdown ― a two-week closure in late 2013 ― the Office of Management and Budget was able to put a price tag on the squandered labor: roughly $2 billion for 6.6 million furloughed work days.

Of course, there are plenty of workers who end up losing paychecks altogether: federal contractors, who normally aren’t granted back pay by Congress. When the Smithsonian closes, the cook who handles a grill inside the Smithsonian is out of a job. He might recoup some his pay by applying for unemployment insurance, but it won’t cover everything he lost because the government shut down.

“The federal government ends up paying for work that simply didn’t get done.”

That’s money the cook normally would have pumped into the economy. And then there are all the visitors who won’t be going to the Smithsonian or other federal sites and spending money there.

During the 2013 shutdown, the National Park Service estimated it was losing 715,000 visitors and around $500,000 in revenue each day. (Knowing just how much Americans love their national parks, the Trump administration has been trying to find a way to blunt the political damage by keeping parks open ― even though experts say it’s foolish and dangerous to do so.)

The museum and park closures only hint at the broader economic output lost because of a shutdown. Standard & Poor’s estimated that the 2013 shutdown sucked $24 billion out of the economy, cutting quarterly gross domestic product growth by 0.6 percent. The ratings agency noted that shutdowns deliver a blow to consumer confidence, particularly for the hundreds of thousands of workers who don’t know if or when they’ll get paid.

It’s possible that lawmakers and the White House will strike a deal soon. But even if the shutdown is brief ― and even if the next one is averted entirely ― there will still be a cost to the way Congress does business now. That is, cobbling together short-term continuing resolutions, rather than long-term deals, and always taking brinkmanship to the midnight hour.A National Park Service ranger removes a closed sign from the Lincoln Memorial after the 2013 shutdown.

WASHINGTON — As a government shutdown grew increasingly likely this week, the Trump administration scrambled to find a way to keep America’s national parks and monuments open — albeit without rangers, restrooms and other visitor services.

While the federal government appears woefully unprepared for a shutdown generally, the motivation for this particular exception seems clear: President Donald Trump and his team are looking to avoid the fiery backlash that the previous administration faced when it shuttered parks and monuments in 2013.

It’s a move that puts natural and cultural resources at risk, critics warn.

Jon Jarvis, the former director of the National Park Service, dubbed it “incredibly idiotic.” The park service is not going to be able to live up to its stewardship responsibilities, he told HuffPost on Friday.

“The great thing about national parks is that when visitors come, they have a certain expectation of the experience,” Jarvis said. “That there will be rangers on duty. There will be information at the visitor center. … If they get lost, we’re going to find them. If they get injured, we’re going to rescue them.”

What makes the U.S. park system the best in the world, he said, “is a professional corps of managers in the field that provide for that experience and protect the resource.”

The Trump administration has notified National Park Service officials across the country to maintain public access at parks “unless access presents a serious and imminent threat to human life, safety, or health, or a serious and imminent threat to the condition of a sensitive natural or cultural resource.”

Major national parks, including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, were all scheduled to be open Saturday morning. Many war memorials and battlefields are also managed by the National Park Service. And Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke posted a photo early Saturday of himself with students at an open National World War II Memorial.

During a 16-day shutdown in 2013 — in the first year of President Barack Obama’s second term, when Republicans controlled the House of Representatives and Democrats had a majority in the Senate — national parks and monuments were closed across the country. Barricades were erected around the National Mall in Washington. Signs were put up that read “Because of the Federal Government SHUTDOWN, All National Parks Are CLOSED.” Vacations were ruined. TV news aired footage of military veterans busting through blockades to access war memorials.

If that experience proved anything, it was that closing parks and monuments is indisputably unpopular. And despite having previously threatened a shutdown, Trump seems to understand that Americans could be quick to blame him for any federal closures they don’t like.

A day before the 2013 shutdown, Trump told Fox News that “problems start from the top.” When people look back decades later, he said, they’re “going to be talking about the president of the United States — who was the president at that time?”

Similarly, Zinke — who oversees an agency that employs more than 70,000 people and manages 500 million acres of land, including the 59 national parks — has spoken about the important role those parks play in how Americans view the federal government. In a speech to agency staff on his second day as secretary, Zinke called the parks “the face” of the Interior Department.

“For a lot of the millions of people who visit our parks every year, you’re the face,” he said. “So your uniforms, showing up every day, your professionalism, is how most of America views our department. And that’s an enormous responsibility.”

With the Republican-controlled Congress proving unable to fund the government by midnight Friday, visitors to U.S. parks, monuments and memorials are expected to face bare-bones operations — open access without those welcoming uniformed professionals.

Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement Thursday that those public places would “remain as accessible as possible” in the event of a shutdown.

“The American public and especially our veterans who come to our nation’s capital should find war memorials and open-air parks open to the public,” she said. “Additionally, many of our national parks, refuges, and other public lands will still try to allow limited access wherever possible.”

But former Interior officials warned that the administration’s attempt to save face could backfire.

“With this new direction — where some things are open, some things are not, some things are going to be maintained, some things are not — and you’re asking them to figure this out on the fly in 24 hours,” Jarvis said. “That’s where it’s going to be a great deal of chaos.”

Sally Jewell, who served as secretary of the interior during the 2013 shutdown, told The Atlantic that clearly the administration is trying to “reduce the heat,” but it’s “naive” to think that a few police officers can protect these sites.

“It’s not realistic,” she said, “and I think it’s a lack of understanding of the roles that so many people play in the parks and, frankly, what [roles] volunteers play in the parks as well.”

And Kate Kelly, public lands director at the Center for American Progress and an Interior official during the Obama administration, accused Zinke of “using the national parks as pawns in some political game.”

“The National Park Service’s mission shouldn’t be held together by duct tape and bailing wire in order to lessen the public’s blowback on the party that controls Congress and the White House,” she said in an email.

As the head of the park service during the 2013 shutdown, Jarvis recalls facing a lot of the criticism. He remembers the deluge of media articles about parks being closed, the local economic suffering, the angry tourists, the weddings that had to be relocated.

“It’s painful,” he said. “The park service hates to do this stuff. We love to have the public come and see us.”

But that doesn’t justify keeping these sites open without proper staffing and services, he warned. Jarvis compared the plan to ordering the Smithsonian to close its doors but bring its collection outside for everyone to see.

“It’s not like these areas are impervious to impact, to vandalism, to terrorism attacks, to damage,” he said.
