President Donald Trump on Wednesday finally admitted that sometimes he just has no idea what he’s talking about.

In audio recordings obtained by The Washington Post, Trump told a crowd at a Missouri fundraising event about a trade meeting he recently had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

“Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed,” Trump said, according to the Post. “So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘But I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’”

Trump told his audience that he eventually admitted he was wrong, but he walked back the entire story in a tweet on Thursday.

We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018

This is hardly the first time Trump has been criticized for misinformation. While he often cites incorrect or misleading information with unflinching confidence, Wednesday’s comments add confusion to already complicated trade talks.

Trump, who has long complained about trade imbalances, recently decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Canada and Mexico were exempted from the tariffs, with the caveat that the ongoing talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement result in a deal that satisfies Trump. Trump’s admission of cluelessness could make it harder for NAFTA negotiators to take him at his word.

Then again, it might not come as much of a surprise.

I'm pretty sure that Justin Trudeau & every other world leader knows Trump is a bullshit artist. It's baked into the cake by now. — Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) March 15, 2018The school attended by President Donald Trump’s youngest child, Barron Trump, is calling on lawmakers to pass stricter gun laws in the wake of the Parkland massacre.

Robert Kosaky, head of St. Andrew’s Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, was one of more than 100 school leaders from the Washington, D.C. area to address gun violence in an open letter published Thursday in The Baltimore Sun.

"Children, our most most vulnerable citizens and our hope for the future, are dying from gun violence, again and again,” the letter stated. “We urge our President, our Congress, and our state leaders to enact specific, vigorous measures to reduce gun violence in our society, particularly in our schools.”

The letter went on to call for a more robust system of background checks and firearm registration, specifically toward weapons “capable of rapidly firing a vast number of deadly shots.” The call to action comes just over a month after a gunman opened fire using an assault-style rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people.

In response to the Feb. 14 massacre, Trump and many Republican lawmakers have focused more on arming teachers than passing tighter gun laws. Trump initially proposed raising the age minimum to purchase an assault-style rifle, like the one used by the Parkland shooter, from 18 to 21. But after meeting with representatives from the National Rifle Association earlier this month, Trump cooled on the idea.

The school officials bashed the idea of arming teachers in their open letter Thursday.

“We need stronger mental health services and more effective communication among agencies responsible for the well-being of children, adults and families,” the letter stated. “What we do not need is to arm our teachers with guns, which is dangerous and antithetical to our profession as educators.”

The company, which filed for bankruptcy along with some of its units, said it ‍reached the agreement with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt for a balance sheet restructuring, which would reduce its debt by more than $10 billion.

IHeartMedia, which has struggled with $20 billion of debt and falling revenue at its 858 radio stations, said cash on hand and cash generated from ongoing operations will be sufficient to fund the business during the bankruptcy process.

“The agreement ... is a significant accomplishment, as it allows us to definitively address the more than $20 billion in debt that has burdened our capital structure,” Chief Executive Bob Pittman said.

The filing comes after John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion, uniting the company with Liberty’s Sirius XM Holdings Inc satellite radio service.

Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia and one of the world’s largest billboard companies, and its units did not commence Chapter 11 proceedings.

IHeartMedia skipped a $106 million interest payment on Feb. 1, triggering a 30-day grace period during which the company has tried to hammer out a deal with it bondholders.

The company disclosed on Monday it was still exchanging proposals with its creditors, but had yet to reach an agreement.

Its most recent proposal would have given holders of secured loans, who are owed nearly $13 billion, about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia. These creditors also would have received iHeartMedia’s 89.5 percent stake in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings.

Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP control 68 percent of the voting stock of iHeartMedia, according to the company’s most recent annual report.

The private equity firms led a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc in 2008, just as the buyout boom was fading and as the signs of the financial crisis began to emerge.

Shares of iHeartMedia lost three-quarters of their value in the second half of 2015 and have never recovered since then. On Monday, the pink sheet stock closed at 48 cents.

IHeartMedia traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered. It also produces syndicated radio programs that feature “American Idol” host Ryan Seacrest and political personalities Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.“I’m just trying to learn the truth and figure out how much you knew, all this time my investigation never took its eyes off you,” Corden as Mueller told Shaggy as Trump.

“I like a good reposado or añejo,” said member Kevin Richardson during a seemingly casual conversation with the publication.

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) appeared to explain the value of so-called “enhanced interrogation” tactics to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) this week, McCain’s daughter Meghan stepped in.

“My father doesn’t need torture explained to him,” Meghan McCain tweeted at Cheney on Thursday. The senator, who fought in the Vietnam War, was held in solitary confinement and tortured while imprisoned in Hanoi for more than five years.

My father doesn’t need torture explained to him. https://t.co/ajrtr7Vn5A — Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) March 15, 2018

The senator had tweeted earlier in the week in response to news that President Donald Trump had nominated CIA deputy director Gina Haspel to lead the agency. Haspel was reportedly involved in a controversial CIA program in the early 2000s that involved torturing detainees. She allegedly was also involved in destroying evidence of such interrogation techniques.

McCain called the United States’ use of torture against detainees “one of the darkest chapters in American history.”

The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history. The Senate must do its job in scrutinizing the record & involvement of Gina Haspel in this disgraceful program. https://t.co/p2eZfMDF5N — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) March 13, 2018

Cheney responded to McCain by defending the CIA’s use of “enhanced interrogation” and saying it had “saved lives, prevented attacks.”

The Enhanced Interrogation Program saved lives, prevented attacks, & produced intel that led to Osama bin Laden. The techniques were the same as those used on our own people in the SERE program.

Trumpet player James Frost-Winn, who played in Tinsley’s band Crystal Garden in 2015 and 2016, filed a lawsuit in Washington state on Thursday.

He is accusing Tinsley, 54, of “sexually flirting with verbal sexual comments, physically touching [and] sexting,” “sexually predatory harassment” and “creepy, sex-based behavior” during his time in the band, according to the website Consequence of Sound.

Frost-Winn is seeking $9 million in damages against Tinsley, saying the alleged advances created a “hostile work environment,” according to court documents obtained by USA Today.

As a result, Frost-Winn says, he experienced “loss of enjoyment of life, pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and humiliation.”

Frost-Winn said he met Tinsley when he was homeless and busking in San Francisco. The two became friends, and hung out whenever Tinsley was in town.

In 2015, Tinsley asked Frost-Winn to be a part of Crystal Garden. He allegedly began abusing Frost-Winn that November.

Frost-Winn accused Tinsley of ejaculating near him, touching his bottom when he was trying to sleep, and sending text messages where he called Frost-Winn “boner material” and claimed to be masturbating to his photos.

Tinsley did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, but he denied the accusations via Twitter on Friday afternoon:

On Feb. 2, Tinsley announced via Twitter that he was leaving the Dave Matthews Band to focus on his private life.

The same day, Frost-Winn sent Tinsley a letter attempting to reach an out-of-court settlement on the assault and harassment claims, according to Consequence of Sound.

March Madness is upon us, and former President Barack Obama has released his bracket.

Since leaving the White House early last year, Obama has carried on his tradition of sharing his March Madness bracket with the public. While in office, he would fill out his bracket with ESPN, a custom President Donald Trump has chosen not to repeat. But according to USA Today, a recent poll found that 38 percent of Americans want Trump to fill out a bracket.

“Just because I have more time to watch games doesn’t mean my picks will be better,” Obama tweeted on Wednesday. He predicts No. 3 seed Michigan State will go all the way this year. Take a look at his picks below.Former White House strategist Steve Bannon says he doesn’t deny anything attributed to him in Michael Wolff’s controversial bestseller Fire and Fury.

“The book is what it is. The reader is the judge of what they read,” Bannon told French media the day after a conference for the country’s far-right National Front party.

The comments appeared Wednesday in the right-wing French media outlet Valeurs Actuelles, and were first reported in English by BuzzFeed.

Bannon said then-White House communications director Hope Hicks allowed Wolff to have total access, BuzzFeed reported.

“The book, having been authorized, I don’t deny any of the content,” Bannon said, according to a HuffPost translation of the remarks. He pointed out that “not one person” inside the White House had refuted anything that was in the book.

Here are some of the more outrageous Bannon quotes in Fire and Fury:

After a perceived win against Ivanka Trump over the Paris climate agreement, Bannon declared, “The bitch is dead.”

He called Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russian operatives “treasonous,” and suggested Trump himself had also met with foreign agents that same day.

He suggested Trump might end up getting impeached.

Bannon’s current stance is a far cry from statements he made in early January, when he backpedaled on many of his quotes in the book and heaped praise on Trump Jr. in a post for Axios, calling him “both a patriot and a good man.”Abdul El-Sayed has laid out one of the most progressive environmental platforms in 2018. Abdul El-Sayed

Abdul El-Sayed remembers coughing up black phlegm each night after spending the day in the smog-choked markets of Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, during summer visits to his grandparents, who were poor vegetable sellers.

It was a jolting experience for a kid born and raised in a manicured Michigan suburb. Yet when El-Sayed started working as a doctor in Detroit years later, he realized pollution wasn’t just some distant problem. In the shadow of the Motor City’s infamous trash incinerator ― where some 650,000 tons of garbage is burned annually, much of it from the surrounding suburbs ― El-Sayed saw soaring rates of asthma and lung cancer in majority-black neighborhoods.

That’s part of what inspired the 33-year-old physician to enter politics, first as Detroit’s top health official and now as a Democratic candidate for Michigan governor.

“In the 30 minutes it took to go from the community I grew up in to the city I worked in, you’d see a 10-year difference in life expectancy,” El-Sayed told HuffPost in a recent phone interview. “I see that as the human cost of failing our environment and failing sustainability.”

He pointed to Detroit’s high rates of asthma; to lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan; to the toxic sludge left behind in Kent County by the company behind Hush Puppies shoes.

“When we poison our air and water, we are poisoning people,” El-Sayed said. “Nowhere is that more clear than the state of Michigan now. When you talk about Flint, when you talk about asthma, when you talk about Kent County.”

In response to those failures, El-Sayed has laid out one of the most progressive environmental platforms of the 2018 election cycle, setting what could be the new standard for a national Democratic Party that has so far failed to rally around serious policies to deal with climate change and water contamination.

He has plans to increase environmental agency budgets, replace lead pipes and establish a green infrastructure bank to shore up funding for renewable energy projects. He has vowed to shut down an aging oil pipeline that is putting the Great Lakes at risk and sworn off all donations from fossil fuel companies. And he has articulated his vision in terms of tangible public health benefits, outlining what some see as a template for a populist approach to climate and environmental issues.

“This looks like a national model,” said RL Miller, president of the super PAC Climate Hawks Vote.

El-Sayed will face a crowded field in Michigan’s Aug. 7 Democratic primary. The eight candidates include former state Sen. Gretchen Whitmer, whose mainstream progressive campaign emphasizing skilled trades and a $15 minimum wage is backed by influential labor unions; by EMILY’s List, which raises funds for Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights; and by former Democratic Gov. Jim Blanchard. Whitmer is widely seen as the front-runner and has already raised over $3 million.

El-Sayed may face another challenge as well: whether he’s even eligible to run, due to an obscure state law that requires a candidate to have voted in the state in the four years prior to their run. He was registered to vote in New York from 2013 to 2015, while he attended medical school and taught at Columbia.

His campaign has dismissed calls for a legal test of his eligibility as “a racist, insider smear” aimed at kneecapping the most credible underdog challenger to Whitmer, the establishment candidate.

El-Sayed’s political brand as the young intellectual of color who could become the nation’s first Muslim governor has prompted some ― to his chagrin ― to call him “the new Obama.” But his grassroots support and embrace of progressive policies put him closer to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination helped revive a long-dormant fervor on the American left.

“He doesn’t talk like consultants say to talk,” Sean McElwee, a progressive policy analyst and researcher who hosted El-Sayed at a gathering in New York last October, told HuffPost. “He combines the sort of populist energy people are excited about with Bernie with detailed knowledge of how to implement policy.”

El-Sayed’s proposal to set aside $105 million in his first state budget to establish an infrastructure bank that would fund renewable and energy-efficient projects is the “centerpiece” of his plan to “reinvest in the capital-stock of Michigan,” according to a campaign white paper. His administration would eventually ramp up the institution’s public funding to $1.5 billion, with plans to generate at least $4.5 billion in energy and clean water infrastructure investments over 15 years. The public-private institution, dubbed the Pure Michigan Bank, could generate $3.3 billion in private investment by 2030, according to a Union of Concerned Scientists report.

“We want to put Michigan on the path to 100 percent renewable energies,” El-Sayed said. “What we’d be able to do is empower innovative financing that addresses the insecurity of those kinds of big-picture infrastructure projects and empowers individuals to use those mechanisms.”

The bank would provide low-risk seven-year loans at 5 percent interest for energy-efficiency projects and similar 10-year loans for renewable-energy plans. It would also offer credits to low- and middle-income homeowners to invest in efficiency upgrades, small-scale solar installations and other clean energy projects.

“We can’t just count on the free market to do it all by itself,” said William Lawrence, Michigan organizer for the climate campaign group Sunrise Movement. “We have to put public money behind this kind of infrastructure build-out and also create smart institutions like this infrastructure bank to get some of the private money flowing in the right direction.” (Sunrise endorsed El-Sayed for governor last month.)

The bank would operate independently of any state agency, reducing its vulnerability to funding cuts under a future administration. To help pay for it, El-Sayed has proposed instituting a carbon tax and diverting some of that revenue to the bank. Another option is to follow the model of Connecticut’s green infrastructure bank and impose a small ratepayer fee.

“The idea of creating an institution, capitalizing it and being designed in such a way that it’s likely to survive even if you have Rick Snyder 2.0 as governor, that’s appealing,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive Democratic operative, who was referring to the current Republican governor’s history of austerity cuts. “It’s intriguing to me that someone is thinking about how to create change that can entrench and build upon itself. That’s really key.”

It should be a popular platform among primary voters. Democratic voters in Michigan overwhelmingly support new rules raising fuel efficiency standards, giving the Environmental Protection Agency power to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and requiring a minimum amount of renewable energy in electricity generation even if that means a small price increase, according to 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies data provided by McElwee.

“We want to put Michigan on the path to 100 percent renewable energies.” - gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed

El-Sayed also wants a major public investment in clean drinking water. Michigan became the poster child for unsafe tap water four years ago when lead contamination in Flint turned into a long-running crisis and a national disgrace.

As a first step, El-Sayed said he would merge the state’s Department of Environmental Quality with its Department of Natural Resources and raise the combined agency’s budget to as much as $950 million a year. That would include restoring funds for the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance to their 2006 levels of about $16 million a year. El-Sayed has suggested raising money for that budget by closing the state’s corporate tax exemptions and loopholes.

He has proposed spending at least $690 million annually to replace aging water pipes, which would create 13,800 jobs each year, his campaign has calculated based on data from the BlueGreen Alliance. To raise the money, he suggested issuing $600 million in bonds and passing a ballot proposal to expand the state’s Drinking Water Revolving Fund, which offers low-interest loans for up to 30 years to water suppliers. The ballot proposal would increase the fund’s available money from $36 million to $50 million by reallocating $14 million from the Department of Corrections budget. He also vowed to push the federal government for more funding.

El-Sayed distinguished himself on the issue of lead toxicity during his 2015-2017 tenure as Detroit’s Health Department chief, during which he tested all schools and child care facilities for lead contamination. His gubernatorial housing policy would expand on that, by using lead-abatement funds to help renters pay their legal defense in related landlord disputes and to perform full inspections and mitigation on all housing stock, and by fining building owners who don’t comply, as The Nation reported in January.

“He doesn’t talk like consultants say to talk.” - policy analyst Sean McElwee

But it’s his plans for dealing with lead in drinking water supplies that have drawn the most local attention. El-Sayed has vowed to set stricter water quality standards by reducing the “action level” for lead, the threshold for government intervention, from 15 parts per billion to 5 parts per billion and pushing for legislation that bars public projects to replace pipes from only partially replacing lead pipes. Outside of urban areas, where wells for drinking water are more common, he has promised to crack down on agricultural pollution. The Detroit Metro Times called his proposal “the most comprehensive water plan of the gubernatorial race.”

Another key part of that plan is to protect universal access to water. In Detroit last year, the city began the controversial practice of shutting off water to nearly 18,000 residents who hadn’t paid their bills. El-Sayed has suggested a new tiered pricing system, which would force households that use more water to pay higher rates but would ensure that everyone in the state has basic access to clean water.

“Freshwater is going to become, and it’s quickly becoming, the most important resource in the world,” El-Sayed told HuffPost. “The fact that, as a state that’s surrounded by more freshwater than any place in the country, we can’t figure out how to allocate freshwater to folks in places like Flint and Detroit and protect that freshwater from being poisoned ― that’s a political failure.”

El-Sayed’s other major plan to protect water rests on decommissioning Line 5, a nearly 65-year-old pipeline that carries 23 million gallons of oil per day through the Straits of Mackinac, where lakes Huron and Michigan connect. The pipeline is operated by Enbridge, the Canadian company responsible for the second-largest inland oil spill in U.S. history, in the Kalamazoo River in 2010. A 2014 University of Michigan study concluded that the Straits of Mackinac are the “worst possible place for an oil spill in the Great Lakes.” A single spill there could pollute more than 700 miles of shoreline, according to a 2016 University of Michigan study.

Environmentalists have campaigned for years to shut down Line 5, but Enbridge has cultivated key allies in Snyder and Heidi Grether, director of the Department of Environmental Quality ― who is herself a former oil industry lobbyist. In November, the governor struck an agreement with Enbridge to replace one section of the pipeline. In January, Snyder rejected a recommendation from Michigan’s Pipeline Safety Advisory Board to close the pipeline immediately. Enbridge spent nearly $2.4 million on U.S. congressional lobbying in 2017, more than double its 2016 total. That included lobbying on a federal bill affecting Line 5.

Because he swore off all donations from fossil fuel companies, El-Sayed’s supporters argue that as governor, he would be insulated from the influence of Enbridge and its industry advocates. El-Sayed is one of the first major Democratic candidates to take the pledge against accepting fossil fuel money that’s being pushed by Sanders and progressive groups such as 350.org.

The pledge is “not as material as the other proposals we’re talking about on the table, but ... it’s a very clear way to show where he stands,” said Lawrence, the Sunrise organizer. “He’ll actually follow through on his proposals on Election Day.”Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from her husband, Donald Trump Jr., on Thursday afternoon, according to multiple reports.

Vanessa filed for an uncontested proceeding with the Manhattan Supreme Court, Page Six reported. The outlet initially reported on the pair’s marital problems on Wednesday, citing multiple unnamed sources who claimed the couple “have been living separate lives.”

The couple released a joint statement later on Thursday, confirming their separation.

“After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways,” the statement said, according to CNN. “We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.”

Sources told the New York tabloid that friends were increasingly concerned over Trump Jr.’s online behavior, including liking tweets by conspiracy theorists criticizing a teenage survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting.

President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law was hospitalized in February after a Massachusetts man sent an envelope of white powder to the couple’s Trump Tower residence in New York City. Upon examination, the powder was discovered to be non-hazardous.

Shortly after his wife’s hospitalization, Trump Jr. left for India on a Trump Organization trip.

Although the businessman has not taken an explicit role in his father’s White House, Trump Jr. has made a number of appearances on behalf of the first family. He met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a closed-door meeting in February and made several stops in Pennsylvania this month to campaign on behalf of Republican congressional candidate Rick Sacconne.

The couple’s marital issues seem to have been exacerbated by the powder incident and Trump Jr.’s travels, which have left Vanessa “increasingly lonely,” based on Page Six reports.

Vanessa Trump, 40, and Donald Trump Jr., 40, have five children and have been married since 2005. An “uncontested” filing means the pair anticipate an amiable separation, without a legal battle over child custody or assets.

The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Robert de Niro has launched another blistering verbal attack on President Donald Trump.

On Tuesday night, the Hollywood actor used his speech at the Fulfillment Fund charity dinner in Los Angeles to claim that Trump was “still an idiot” despite receiving a quality education from the University of Pennsylvania.

The “Taxi Driver” star also slammed the president for lacking “any sense of humanity or compassion,” per Variety.

“Now I’m not trying to turn this non-political event into a political one,” said De Niro, 74, who reportedly used the first part of his address to praise the fund, which works to empower young people through education.

Education without humanity is ignorance. Look at our President. -- Robert De Niro pic.twitter.com/1EcdQeSUbA — Tara Bitran (@tarabitran) March 14, 2018

“But as long as our country’s leadership is so appalling and so corrupt, I’ll be speaking out at every venue,” said de Niro. “To be silent in the face of such villainy is to be complicit, and it’s especially appropriate tonight because Trump treats education as a con, a way to make a profit at the expense of the suckers.”

De Niro called Trump a “fucking idiot” and a “fucking fool” at the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala in January. In August 2017, the two-time Oscar winner told Deadline that Trump was “a flat-out blatant racist” who would be “even more dangerous” if he was smart.

And in October 2016, de Niro used a plethora of insults to describe Trump for a celebrity “Get Out The Vote” commercial. His words, however, didn’t make the final cut.With a number of regions getting slammed by a series of late-winter snowstorms, the roads are full of lazy drivers who brush off just enough snow to see out the windows.

This is causing a serious problem for other drivers.

On Wednesday, an ambulance returning from an emergency call near Boston was hit by a sheet of ice that blew off the top of a truck.

“I was in the passenger’s seat,” driver Nick Lecolst told NBC Boston. “I ducked to the center not knowing what it was.”

The ice shattered the windshield, forcing the ambulance to pull over.

Last week in Connecticut, ice from a truck shattered the windshield of another car, spraying the driver with shards of glass, The Associated Press reported.

No one was injured in either case, but the incidents are becoming increasingly common as cars, SUVs, trucks and more take to the roads covered in snow and ice.

“It’s a big issue because you’re not only putting yourself, the driver, in danger, but you’re putting other drivers in danger,” trooper Dustin Fitch of the Massachusetts State Police told the Boston Globe. “Whether it’s the snow blinding you or blowing off and causing a whiteout to drivers behind you — it can be blinding.”

Fitch even made a video showing how to use a snow brush to quickly remove snow without scratching the car.“Do not approach the 12 or 1300 building. Stay at least 500 feet away at this point,” he said on the police radio minutes after the shooting had stopped and students and staff lay dying.

The sheriff’s office said it welcomed the court-ordered release of the video.

“It speaks for itself,” the department said in a statement.Mae Jemison is backing a new initiative that encourages kids to pursue agricultural science. Maarten de Boer via Getty Images

Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space, knows firsthand the importance of exposing kids to STEM topics early. She also knows the significance of having kids see themselves in movies, on TV, and in certain careers.

“It means making sure that people get those images that show they have those things available to them,” Jemison told HuffPost.

Jemison is collaborating on “Science Matters,” an initiative to encourage kids of all ages and backgrounds to pursue agricultural science from pharmaceutical and life science company Bayer and youth development organization National 4-H Council. Jemison, a physician and chemical engineer, knows the field of agricultural science can sound intimidating, but she and Jennifer Sirangelo, CEO and president of the National 4-H Council, have set out to change that.

Digging into agricultural science can be as simple as asking, “Where does my food come from?” An increasingly popular way to kick-start this sort of interest is through urban gardens, Jemison explained.

“There’s nothing more exciting to see something growing ― and you can eat it!” Jemison said. “That’s something parents can do with their kids as well.”

Sirangelo agreed, noting that agricultural science is more than horticulture and animal science and has huge applications for our future.

“The need to produce more food with fewer resources over the coming decades is going to push our science even further,” she told HuffPost.

As Jemison put it, we need to prepare our kids “to not just survive, but thrive.”

In 1992, Jemison became the first African-American woman in space. Getty Images

Bringing more children into STEM topics like agricultural science isn’t enough, though. Diversity is imperative, especially for women and people of color, groups underrepresented in these fields, Jemison said.

“We’re losing talent and we’re losing capability by not including them,” she told HuffPost. “When people think about why it is important to have a diversity of talent in a field, they think of it as a nicety. No, it’s a necessity. We get better solutions.”

“It’s not about just making girls continuously jump over these hurdles that we put in place in front of them. It’s about us taking those hurdles down,” Jemison said of guaranteeing diversity in STEM ― science, technology, engineering and math.

Jemison advocates for agricultural science in the classroom, and teachers seem to agree that it’s a valuable goal. According to Bayer and the National 4-H Council’s survey of 1,640 high school science teachers in honor of National Ag Day on March 20, more than 80 percent said they think it’s important to include agricultural science in their lesson plans. Only about half of teachers feel qualified to teach the subject, however.

“When people think about why it is important to have a diversity of talent in a field, they think of it as a nicety. No, it’s a necessity. We get better solutions.” - Mae Jemison

In a 2015 paper from AGree, a group that focuses on food and agriculture policy, Stephanie Mercier, former chief economist of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, wrote that there are “relatively few in-school food and agricultural education programs” for elementary school students, as teachers at public schools “tend to focus on subject areas covered in state standards and testing.” Mercier also pointed out that most of these programs take place in rural areas, not urban and suburban settings.

The good news is that out of 1,004 parents surveyed by Bayer and 4-H, more than 75 percent want their kids (ages 13 to 17) to see agricultural science as exciting and interesting. So how do we make this happen?

Sirangelo encouraged parents to consider devoting as much time to their kids’ science activities as they do for their sports, while Jemison noted the importance of making sure teachers feel comfortable teaching these ideas in the classroom. The chemical engineer and trailblazer also reminded parents to teach their girls that it’s OK to pursue their interests, even if they’re typically not marketed to women.“Love, Simon,” the first film about a high schooler’s coming out story to be backed by a major studio, is already having a big impact on its young stars.

Actor Nick Robinson, who plays the film’s titular character, recently revealed that his real-life brother came out to him when the movie, based on the popular young adult novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, began production.

“He came out around the same time we started filming, yeah. I think that he had been dealing with this for a long time and the timing was coincidental, but one of the best things that came out of this movie was being able to talk to him,” Robinson, who is straight, told Ellen DeGeneres recently on her talk show.

The film follows high schooler Simon Spier (Robinson) as he struggles to tell his friends and family that he’s gay. Things are made even more difficult when a classmate threatens to expose his secret online romance with another boy in school.

“I think that’s the strength of a film like this is that it starts conversations, and I hope it can do that for more people and start a conversation that might not have been there,” Robinson added.

The film also struck a chord with actors Keiynan Lonsdale and Joey Pollari, who both play potential love interests for Simon. Lonsdale recently revealed that working on the film helped him come out publicly.

The “Flash” actor posted a heartfelt note on Instagram in May, while shooting “Love, Simon,” in which he declared he was done “apologising for falling in love with people no matter their gender.”

A post shared by 🌊❤️💫🌸 Keiynan Lonsdale 🔑🎶🍭🌱 (@keiynanlonsdale) on May 12, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT

“I wasn’t actually out to my cast the whole of filming, until the wrap party,” Lonsdale told “Entertainment Tonight.” “I’d been out to friends and I was out to the cast of ‘Flash’ and everything, but I just, I always had this thing wherever I met new people. I was like, suddenly went back into the closet.”

Pollari came out as gay in an interview with The Advocate this week, revealing that he saw his own struggles reflected in Simon’s journey in the film.

“[Simon’s] experience was similar to mine,” Pollari said. “The only part that was difficult was me coming out to myself. And I think that is the most difficult coming-out.”

Morgan Roof, an 18-year-old student of A.C. Flora High School in Columbia, South Carolina, was charged with possession of marijuana and two counts of carrying weapons on school grounds, according to The State newspaper.

An administrator at the school alerted a school resource officer that a student on campus had made a threatening and racist Snapchat post and brought pepper spray and a knife to school. The Richland County Sheriff’s Department later confirmed that the student was Morgan Roof.

Roof’s Snapchat post criticized her schoolmates at Flora High for participating in the nationwide student walkouts in protest of gun violence on Wednesday. The protests were being held on the one-month anniversary of a horrific mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“I hope it’s a trap and y’all get shot,” Roof wrote of the protest at her school, according to a screenshot of her Snapchat post.

“We know it’s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway.

This is Morgan Roof, Dylann Roofs little sister, her snapchats there and all do your thang twitter pic.twitter.com/MttSF875is — tatianna (@theonlytyy) March 14, 2018

Roof’s racist post was especially disturbing considering the heinous crimes of her brother, who is an avowed white supremacist.

In June 2015, Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and opened fire on a Bible study group. He killed nine people. The 22-year-old shooter was found guilty on 33 federal charges and sentenced to death.

One of Dylann Roof’s friends told investigators that he hoped the massacre would start a race war.

In a letter to students, parents and faculty, Principal Susan Childs said that a student’s social media post caused “quite a disruption” on campus. Childs’ letter did not identify Morgan Roof but described her post as a “hateful message” that was “extremely inappropriate.”

Chris Slick, a neighbor of the Roofs, told The Post and Courier that Morgan Roof wasn’t hateful.

“Tragedy has struck this family again,” Slick told the newspaper.

“This is not the Morgan I knew. She didn’t hate people. She didn’t have prejudices like this — in fact, I witnessed the opposite,” he added. “I hope that one day, one day she finds peace and seeks forgiveness for what she did today. I cannot say I wish the same for her brother.”

In a series of tweets, Gov. Henry McMaster said that “potential tragedy was avoided” at Flora High on Wednesday. He also called on the state General Assembly to pass legislation requiring police officers to be present at every school.One of videos posted by Gonzales has since been taken down but was reposted on a number of other accounts, including a Facebook page under the name Naui Ocelot that has accumulated over 10,000 views. The other two videos are still on Gonzales’ personal Facebook page. HuffPost has also obtained copies of the videos. Dauenhauer has since removed her Facebook account.

The videos shocked the Muslim community in Tempe when the community members reviewed the brazen footage. Civil rights organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned the incident. The ADL called it “extremely disturbing and ugly on so many levels” in a statement to HuffPost.

“We’re pleased with the decision to arrest these two individuals,” Imraan Siddiqi, the executive director of the Arizona chapter of CAIR, told HuffPost. “As we saw on the video, the actions that they took and the hateful epithets that they were spewing were egregious and harmful not only to Muslims but to any house of worship. These types of things have to be taken seriously by law enforcement, so we do thank the Tempe Police Department as well the Islamic Community Center of Tempe for taking swift and quick actions against this and not taking this light and really prosecuting it quickly.”

CAIR added that HuffPost’s report Wednesday “helped propelled this to a higher priority case.”

After the Facebook videos were posted on March 4, the Islamic Community Center delivered evidence to the Tempe Police Department two days later. It wasn’t until a week later, and less than 24 hours after HuffPost’s initial report, that police made the arrest.UPDATE: March 15 ― Tahnee Gonzales and Elizabeth Dauenhauer were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of felony third-degree burglary. A hate crime will also be considered during sentencing, Det. Liliana Duran of the Tempe Police Department told HuffPost.

PREVIOUSLY:

A disturbing Facebook live video has recently surfaced of a troubling excursion in which two women take a group of children to vandalize and steal materials at a mosque in Tempe, Arizona, in an attempt to “expose the evil that is happening in our backyards.”

In three bizarre videos published March 4 by Facebook user Tahnee Gonzales, she and another woman take three unidentified children on a trip to the mosque in order to “collect as much information” and “expose mosques” in order to teach the children how to be “American patriots.”

In one outlandish scene, Gonzales and the second woman, identified as Elizabeth “Liz” Dauenhauer, lead the children to trespass onto the mosque’s private property after Gonzales delivers a hateful lecture on Muslims during the car trip there.

“They smell like goat,” exclaims a girl in the background once the group enters through the gated fence and walk around a play area at the Islamic Community Center of Tempe. Both women immediately laugh. Gonzales then tells the group and the viewers on camera that Muslims are destroying America and are “devil Satan worshippers.”

Once back in the parking lot, after having stolen flyers and other items from the mosque, the women praise the girl and two boys for their racist comments and for participating in the burglary.

The women then circle the property and take photos of the kids standing in front of the mosque. The little girl instructs one of the boys to put his “thumbs down” and pouts as the group poses for a photo.

“Be careful, because Muslims are waiting to rape you,” the young girl is heard telling the boy.

The children are then seen climbing upon the mosque’s funeral van while one of the women warns one of the boys about the “dead Muslims” and “sex goats” that she says were once stored in the truck.

One of videos posted by Gonzales has since been taken down but was reposted on a number of other accounts, including a Facebook page under the name Naui Ocelot that has accumulated over 10,000 views. The other two videos are still on Gonzales’ personal Facebook page. HuffPost has also obtained copies of the videos.

The Tempe Police Department confirmed to HuffPost the identities of Tahnee Gonzales and Elizabeth Dauenhauer. HuffPost also matched the women in the video to their individual Facebook pages based on their appearances. In addition, the Facebook page Naui Ocelot, which reposted the now deleted video, included links to both Gonzales’ personal Facebook page and to Dauenhauer’s Facebook page.

Local news reports said Wednesday morning that the women were part of the Patriot Movement AZ, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed a “fringe group being energized and influenced by the president’s over-the-top rhetoric on immigrants and Muslims.”

The video begins with the two women in the front of a car with the three children in the back. The women have brought flags for the children and call them “little infidels.”

Gonzales rallies her viewers to “get off their butts” to fight Islamic religious law. She then calls Deedra Abboud, a Muslim woman running as a Democratic candidate in Arizona for the U.S. Senate, a threat to America.

Abboud posted on Facebook her condemnation of the pair’s actions, saying they are “not ‘standing up for America’ or representing American values in any way.” Abboud told HuffPost that Patriot Movement AZ told her it removed Gonzales from the group before the incident. The group, however, denied to HuffPost that Gonazles was ever a member.

HuffPost spoke to the imam of the Islamic Community Center of Tempe, where the incident occurred. Ahmad Al-Akoum reviewed the footage and delivered evidence to the Tempe Police Department the same week. The Islamic Community Center is working with the Tempe police to investigate charges against Gonzales and Dauenhauer.

This isn’t the first time the mosque has been on the receiving end of a hate crime, but it was shocking for the community to see young children participating in the vile attacks, Al-Akoum said.

“What really affected me the most is seeing those young children getting real-life lessons in hate, that was the thing that made me really, really upset with those people. Those innocent 5-, 6-year-old children are now really learning hate from their parents. It’s really disheartening,” Al-Akoum, the operations director and acting imam of the center, told HuffPost.

The Tempe Police Department says it is investigating trespass reports against Dauenhauer and Gonzales on behalf of the Islamic center, the police department’s media relations officer, Det. Liliana Duran, told HuffPost. More charges are likely to be filed, she said. The two women are not now charged or in custody, however.

HuffPost reached out to to Gonzales but did not hear back. HuffPost was unable to contact Dauenhauer, and she has since deleted her Facebook page.

HuffPost reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inquire about both women’s employment status after Dauenhauer claimed on Facebook that she worked for the agency. CBP confirmed to HuffPost that neither women is employed by the agency.

In one of the videos posted on the same day after the trip, Gonzales asks her daughter for her thoughts about sharia, or Islamic law, and the child responds, “F it.” When her mom asks to explain more, the young girl says sharia allows “old men ... to marry young kids at my age.”

The litany of disinformation repeated by the young children in the video has alarmed the Muslim community in Arizona.

“The most jarring thing about the video is clearly the fact there are children involved, indoctrinated to hate people based off their belief system or what they look like or the color they are. You can see that unfolding in real time,” said Imraan Siddiqi, the executive director of the Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

“Ironically about all of this is that the trope exists among these people that Muslims teach their children to hate. Yet they are right there on camera, telling the children just extremely inflammatory false information about this group of people that is definitely going to shape their perspectives about Muslims as they grow older. My hope for these children is that they are able to overcome the hate that is being taught to them by their parents.

The series of videos, thought to all have been taken on the same day, is filled with dangerous Islamophobic rhetoric about the Muslim community, stating that Muslims “use our Constitution against us” and “get everything for free,” such as food, assistance and housing.

In reality, Muslims have consistently contributed to American society since the birth of this nation. Muslims comprise 10 percent of American physicians, are leaders in politics and activism, and give more to charity than any other religious group.

The statements made by Gonzales and Dauenhauer are a common ploy by far-right activists to vilify the Muslim-American community.

During the longest video of the three, viewers can follow the family trip from the car ride to the mosque. The group’s first stop is a strip mall that includes a store and Muslim-owned restaurants that offer halal food ― food prepared according to Islamic customs ― that is next to the Islamic Community Center of Tempe. There, Gonzales discusses the “illegal invasion of Muslims” while showing the children the storefronts, speculating that the restaurants were closed because Muslims were busy “worshipping the anti-Christ.” The children follow Gonzales closely everywhere she goes, listening to every word.

Once at the mosque, the two women and the three children let themselves into the mosque’s gated outdoor play area. Gonzales notices the “No firearms” sign at the gate and at first hesitates to enter, acknowledging in the video that she is carrying a weapon. “I have to take my gun out of my bag back.”

“Go take it back,” she instructs the young boy who is out of the camera frame. She then proceeds to enter the gated area that has a “No trespassing” sign. “I had Betty on me. So I had to put Betty away,” she tells Dauenhauer, laughing. It’s unclear whether Dauenhauer enters the premise with the gun or whether it was given to the boy to place somewhere else.

Once inside, the women, led by Dauenhauer, begin tearing pamphlets off a bulletin board as the children watch. The women then instruct the kids to grab as many of the flyers as they can.

The family then continues the hateful and bizarre tour toward the mosque and try to enter the prayer space. Instead, they bump into a worshipper who is exiting at the same time. The man is seen attempting to engage the family in a dialogue, clearly shocked, but the group instead accuses him of wanting to eat their dog and engage in pedophilia.

“We’re coming after you. We, the people. We’re exposing you. You guys stand for evil and nothing but evil,” Gonzales is heard yelling at the stunned worshipper.

“We’re trying to be peaceful,” the man is heard responding. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”

In a separate video, posted by Gonzales on the same day, the group is gathered back in the car, singing along to a song known as the Donald Trump song.

“Build a wall. Ten feet, 20 feet, 100 feet tall,” they all sing.

“Look at these patriots!” Gonzales says as she points to her children. “Raise your kids to love your country. Get involved with your children. You only have a certain amount of time before they leave you and become adults. You raise great patriots and you get great Americans. Raise your kid right to love your country, and we’re going to have a great country in the end, working with our president, Donald J. Trump. We’re winning 2020 again. What’s up. 2020 President Trump.”

This incident, although alarming, does not come as a shock to the Muslim community. Islamophobia is at an all-time high in the United States.

“This is not happening in a vacuum. It’s a troubling trend. We live here in the intersection of gun culture and Islamophobia in Arizona, where you have very lax open-carry laws,” said Siddiqi. “It’s not acceptable for people to encroach on a house of worship like this, to harass worshippers and to take materials from the mosque. There needs to be perimeters that are there and clearly laid out, and these types of things need to be prosecuted.”

Al-Akoum and his congregants are optimistic that justice will be served. They have received a letter of support from a member of the Humanist Society of Greater Phoenix condemning the hateful attack on the mosque and offering solidarity.

“While we may disagree on matters of religion, you deserve nothing less than respect and recognition of your basic human dignity. You are welcome here,” the letter said.

Al-Akoum, touched by the gesture, also has hope for the children brought along by Gonzales and Dauenhauer.

“My hope is that those kids will grow up and be more engaged in the community and meet some Muslims and see what they did learn is not true about Muslims.”



This story has been updated to include further comments from Abboud, as well as comments from Patriot Movement AZ.A national coalition of more than 80 pro-LGBTQ organizations is aiming to show people how a Supreme Court ruling about a Colorado bakery could threaten a historic 1968 court decision.

The groups have been drawing attention to the potential implications of the upcoming court decision on Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission over the past few months and did so again Thursday with the release of a new ad.

In the clip, which can be viewed above, the Open to All alliance draws comparisons between the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, in which a baker cited his religious beliefs in refusing to prepare a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, and 1968′s Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises ruling.

Exactly 50 years ago this week, the Supreme Court ruled that Maurice Bessinger, who founded the Piggie Park barbecue chain in South Carolina, had discriminated against a black customer, John W. Mungin. A Baptist minister, Mungin was told to leave a Piggie Park franchise at gunpoint because Bessinger believed races should be kept segregated.

Produced in conjunction with the Movement Advancement Project and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the ad shows that “the free exercise of religion does not provide a license to discriminate,” according to its creators.

“Businesses and their owners have a right to their religious beliefs,” Movement Advancement Project Executive Director Ineke Mushovic told HuffPost in an email. “But that freedom shouldn’t give businesses a license to discriminate.”

To mark the 50th anniversary of Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, the coalition has dubbed March 12-18 “Open to All Week.” Mushovic said she hopes the weeklong commemoration urges Supreme Court justices not to turn the clock back half a century.QUEENS, N.Y. ― Every time there’s a lockdown drill at Townsend Harris High School, the large, busy Flushing school where Jessica Stillman teaches English, she replays the preparations she’d need to take to keep her students safe.

Then, in February, her deepest fear came true. Her school experienced a shooting. Only it wasn’t the school where she currently works.

Stillman attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as a teenager, living less than a mile away. Like so many of the survivors who have emerged as leaders of the Never Again movement, Stillman was a theater kid at the school.

On Wednesday morning, she got to watch as students at her school carried the torch of the Parkland leaders. She chaperoned while some 800 of the school’s 1,100 students participated in the National School Walkout, spending 30 minutes in silence in a nearby field.

Around the country, at least 3,000 other schools and communities participated in the event, an effort to honor the 17 lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and agitate for stricter gun control.

The hundreds of teens were hushed as a small group of students and teachers alternated reading the names of the victims of the Parkland shooting over a megaphone. Each victim was given a minute of silence. Stillman tearfully looked on as teens held signs displaying the students’ names and messages of protest against the National Rifle Association.

Kathy Ling, a senior at Townsend Harris, helped plan the student-led event as president of the student union. The walkout is one of several events the students have planned to help honor Parkland and its victims over the next few months. The school’s administration, she said, has been supportive and helpful.

Ling was proud of the respect her fellow students showed during the event, which was meant to act more as a memorial than a protest, she said.

Watching members of the MSD theater community gain national prominence as spokespeople for a gun control movement has been heartwarming, but not surprising, Stillman says, given the public speaking skills necessary for drama. The eloquence and composure the Parkland students have exhibited remind Stillman of her own students at Townsend Harris, whom she describes as “politically aware” and “articulate.”

Stillman sported a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School sweatshirt at the walkout. On Wednesday evening, she plans to participate in an “Evening of Action” with fellow MSD alumni and high school students around New York.

“I never in a million years anything like this would happen in that town,” Stillman said earlier this week of Parkland. “Hopefully it doesn’t happen anywhere, but to have it happen in a place you know so well, so intimately ― it was like losing somebody in your own family.”LONDON ― British Prime Minister Theresa May announced Wednesday that the United Kingdom would expel 23 Russian diplomats after the Kremlin failed to take responsibility for the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.

May categorized those being forced to leave as “undeclared intelligence officers” and gave them a week to depart, she said during a speech in Parliament on Wednesday. The ousters trim the approximately 60-member Russian diplomatic corps in the U.K. by more than one third.

In addition, the U.K. is suspending all high-level contact with Russia and plans to “detain those suspected of hostile state activity at the U.K. border,” she said. Further, neither U.K. ministers nor members of the royal family will travel to Russia this summer to attend the World Cup.

May added that she spoke to several allies, including President Donald Trump, who agreed to “cooperate closely to respond to this barbaric act, to stand up for the rules-based international order which Russia seeks to undermine.”

May said Monday that it was “highly likely” Russia was behind the incident, given that the nerve agent used in the attack, novichok, was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. She gave the Kremlin until the end of the day on Tuesday to produce an explanation for what happened.

May said Russia responded to her demand for an explanation with “sarcasm, contempt and defiance.”

The Russian embassy in the U.K. slammed the expulsions as “hostile,” “unjustified” and “shortsighted,” blaming British leadership for the deterioration of the U.K.-Russian relationship.

Putin’s government had rejected May’s deadline, denied all responsibility and accused the U.K. of pointing fingers for political purposes. It also requested access to the British investigation because Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, is a Russian citizen.

“It is absolutely unacceptable and we consider this a provocation,” Russian ambassador to the U.K. Alexander Yakovenko told Sky News on Wednesday.

Skripal and his daughter, who were found poisoned on a bench in England earlier this month, remain hospitalized in critical but stable condition.

Trump was silent on the incident until Tuesday, when he said he would condemn Russia if it ended up being found responsible for the attack.

“It sounds to me like [officials in the U.K.] believe it was Russia, and I would certainly take that finding as fact,” he said.

He reaffirmed U.S. solidarity with Britain in a phone call with May later on Tuesday, agreeing that Russia “must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon, developed in Russia, came to be used in the United Kingdom,” according to the White House.

European Council President Donald Tusk said he would raise the topic of retaliatory steps next week at a European Union summit, urging “transatlantic unity.” The U.K.’s Foreign Office has also requested an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting to continue the conversation.

Britain responded similarly ― by expelling four diplomats, issuing visa restrictions and freezing assets ― after the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB officer who had been living in the U.K. Critics slammed the measures as weak and insufficient at the time.
