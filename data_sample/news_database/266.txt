NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vanessa Trump, the wife of Donald Trump Jr., and two other people were taken to a New York hospital on Monday after she opened a piece of mail containing an unidentified white powder that was later determined to be non-hazardous, officials said.

“The substance had arrived by mail and it was addressed to Donald Trump Jr.,” said New York Police Department spokesman Carlos Nieves.

Vanessa Trump, the daughter-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, was hospitalized after she complained of nausea following her exposure, New York officials said.

Three patients from the household were transported to the NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center for further evaluation, said Fire Department spokeswoman Sophia Kim.

The three also included Vanessa Trump’s mother, though she had not complained of symptoms, the police spokesman said.

U.S. authorities have been on alert for mail with white powder in it since 2001, when envelopes laced with anthrax were sent to media outlets and U.S. lawmakers, killing five people.

The U.S. Secret Service, which is charged with protecting members of the president’s family, has joined the investigation said spokesman Jeffrey Adams. White House officials had no immediate comment.

The apartment building where the incident occurred is in Manhattan’s expensive Sutton Place neighborhood close to the East River. The apartment may be the home of Vanessa Trump’s mother, local news outlets reported.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, has been in the public eye for his role in 2016 meetings with a Russian attorney and others where the Trump campaign was offered potentially damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

Congress has held probes into those meetings and whether they were part of a Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Russia denies trying to influence the election. Trump dismisses any talk of collusion.

In 2016, white powder, which also proved harmless, was sent to the home of Eric Trump, Trump Jr.’s brother.A German shepherd who recovered from a shattered leg to become one of the favorites at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show had his comeback cut short on the first day of competition Monday.

The ownership team of Fanucci, a 5-year-old who lives in Farmingville, New York, pulled him out of the event because a hematoma on his left ear caused pain and made it flop, co-owner Stephanie Schrock told HuffPost.

“It was in the best interest of the dog to not compete,” she said. “We are very disappointed but the dog’s well-being comes first.”

In 2014, Fanucci jumped out of a towed van going at high speed on a highway, breaking his right rear leg in several places and nearly dying. Vets put together his limb with rods, pins and screws, and a regimen of acupuncture and therapy helped him to rehabilitate, according to Good Morning Tampa Bay in the segment above.

Fanucci was considered a legitimate contender to follow in the paw steps of another German shepherd, Rumor, who won best in show last year.

“We are truly disappointed,” Fanucci’s handler, Sue Condreras, told HuffPost.

“Unfortunately with competitions as tough as they are at Westminster, any little disadvantage can cost you the breed,” she added.

After skating a flawless routine lauded as one of the best of his career by commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, judges ranked Rippon second behind Mikhail Kolyada for Olympic Athletes of Russia. After Patrick Chan of Canada performed and nabbed the top spot, Rippon was bumped down to third.

While both Kolyada and Chan fell during their performances, their routines had higher degrees of difficulty than Rippon’s, which led to higher scores (even with the missteps).

Folks on Twitter were quick to express their outrage at the judges and scoring system that Rippon was first rated second, then third, in the men’s free skate, especially considering he didn’t fall once and seemed to slay his routine.

According to USA Today, the scoring system used to evaluate men’s figure skating performances grants points to skaters who try new, different and challenging moves ― like the famous quadruple jump.

So even though skaters are penalized one point for falling, they still may earn more points overall for attempting those elements and executing parts of the move well.

Rippon ended the competition in third place, but his strong performance contributed to Team USA nabbing third place in the overall standing of the team event, as of this article.

Still, Twitter was pissed. Check out some of the responses below.

Porter has denied both allegations.

Trump tweeted on Saturday that “peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.” He added: “There is no recovery for someone falsely accused ― life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as due process?”

“There it is again. The words ‘mere allegation’ and ‘falsely accused’ meant to imply that I am a liar. That Colbie Holderness is a liar,” Willoughby wrote. “That the work Rob was doing in the White House was of higher value than our mental, emotional or physical well-being. That his professional contributions are worth more than the truth. That abuse is something to be questioned and doubted.”

Willoughby wrote that her “strength and worth are not dependent on outside belief,” and that “the truth exists whether the president accepts it or not.”

She pointed out just how dangerous it is that our culture is so ready to question victims of abuse rather than simply believe them.

“Society as a whole doesn’t acknowledge the reality of abuse,” she wrote. “Ultimately, this is not a political issue. This is a societal issue, and the tone has just been reset by the White House. If the most powerful people in the nation do not believe my story of abuse in the face of overwhelming evidence, then what hope do others have of being heard?”

Willoughby ended her essay with a strong message: “For any men, women, or children currently in situations of abuse, please know: It is real. You are not crazy. You are not alone. I believe you.”

The team’s Pyeongchang Games gear features colorful calaveras, or skulls, decorated with bright reds and blues. Olympians Rodolfo Roberto Dickson Sommers, Sarah Schleper and Hubertus Von Hohenlohe first modeled the gear in photos posted to Facebook on Thursday.

While Von Hohenlohe never took home a medal, he certainly left his mark over the years. He became the second oldest Winter Olympian to ever compete at the 2014 Games in Sochi, where he also turned plenty of heads when he wore a mariachi-themed race suit.

At the time, he told NBC News he hoped to win the title “best dressed” at the Winter Olympics. “[It’s] a medal I need so urgently,” he said.

Even if they don’t win a medal for “best dressed,” these Olympians are sure winning over hearts on Twitter:

Amy Schumer has done just that with new boyfriend and celebrated chef Chris Fischer, whose Martha’s Vineyard restaurant is a favorite of the former first family. The comedian made their relationship Instagram official on Sunday, sharing a black-and-white photo of herself bringing in Fischer for a big smooch at Ellen DeGeneres’ 60th birthday party.

“Happy Birthday @theellenshow thank you for having us,” she captioned the post.

A post shared by @amyschumer on Feb 11, 2018 at 10:48am PST

Schumer and Fischer were rumored to be dating as far back as early November 2017 when they were photographed having an intimate dinner together in New York City.

The two were spotted attending a live taping of “Saturday Night Live” months later, confirming that something was going down, however Schumer’s reps refused to comment on the relationship at the time.

Based on Beetlebung Farm in Martha’s Vineyard, Fischer was raised in New England and runs the restaurant at the Beach Plum Inn, which is rumored to be the Obamas’ favorite date night spot on the island, according to Esquire in 2013.

He also wrote the James Beard Award-winning Beetlebung Farm Cookbook and previously worked in the kitchens of Mario Batali, whom he reportedly met through his famous friend, Jake Gyllenhaal.

Before finding romance with Fischer, Schumer dated furniture designer Ben Hanisch for over a year after meeting him on a dating app. The two split in May 2017, but there’s seemingly no bad blood there, with the comedian thanking Hanisch for some new furniture on social media in September.

“Amy and Ben have ended their relationship after thoughtful consideration,” her rep told HuffPost at the time, adding that the two “remain friends.”

Fischer previously dated a woman named Emma for “a couple of years,” according to Esquire, who helped grow food and create menus at his farm.

DeGeneres’ star-studded birthday bash brought out a host of famous faces including Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Jennifer Anniston and James Corden, where, of course, it all went down in the photo booth.

Stone has long denied any involvement with the trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails that WikiLeaks published during the 2016 campaign. He also testified before the House Intelligence Committee last year that he only “wanted confirmation” that Assange had information about Trump’s opponent.

But according to a series of emails The Wall Street Journal reviewed for its Thursday article, Stone did more than ask for confirmation. In September 2016, he apparently badgered radio personality Randy Credico to press Assange for emails related to Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal while she was secretary of state.

Credico reportedly emailed back that Stone should check the WikiLeaks website for the information he wanted, since WikiLeaks had already posted the hacked DNC emails that July. According to the Journal, Stone responded: “Why do we assume WikiLeaks has released everything they have???”

Credico reportedly wrote to Stone that the Libya information would likely be in a “batch probably coming out in the next drop,” presumably meaning in the next set of hacked emails WikiLeaks published.

“I can’t ask them favors every other day,” Credico complained, according to the Journal. “I asked one of his lawyers ... they have major legal headaches ... relax.”

Stone became so insistent that Credico told the Journal that he “got tired” of Stone “bothering” him. Credico said he didn’t even pass along Stone’s message to Assange, whom he had interviewed for his radio program, but still told Stone that he had.

Stone tweeted during the election that he had a “back channel” to Assange, which could have meant Credico. He soon deleted the tweet.

In response to the Journal’s story, Stone sent a text message claiming that Credico and WikiLeaks had “provided nothing” to him and that his testimony before the House intelligence committee was “complete and accurate.”

Investigators have scrutinized Stone for his claims that he communicated with both Assange and Guccifer 2.0, the Kremlin operative identified by U.S. officials as responsible for the DNC hack.

Stone also appeared to know about WikiLeaks’ actions in advance. The day before WikiLeaks published hacked emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Stone said Assange was going to deliver “a devastating expose of Hillary.” The emails were published the day the “Access Hollywood” tape was released of Trump boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.

Stone said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press” that he was prepared for an indictment as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with the Russian government. The Mueller team may “conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business,” Stone said. But he insisted he would not be charged with Russian collusion.A former FBI agent who says Islam is “barbaric and evil,” has been training Texas police.

John Guandolo, who tweeted that February’s Parkland, Florida, school shooting was the work of a “jihadi” and says former CIA head John Brennan secretly converted to Islam, conducted a daylong teaching session this month for Texas law enforcers called “Understanding the Jihadi Threat to America,” according to The Texas Tribune.

The class, held in San Angelo, was officially approved by the state commission for Texas law enforcement officers who are expected to take 40 credits of continuing education and training every two years.

Muslim advocacy groups and the Southern Poverty Law Center (which has bashed Guandolo’s “looney pronouncements”) said in a letter Monday to the state Commission on Law Enforcement that Guandolo’s teachings are not based on expertise, but on his “unrelenting anti-Muslim bias.” The groups demanded that the commission rescind approval of Guandolo’s law enforcement seminars.

Because of the controversy, a representative of the Texas commission observed Guandolo’s class and found “no concerning material that would cause reason to deny continuing education hours for law enforcement attendees,” Gretchen Grigsby, the organization’s director of government relations, told The Texas Tribune.

Guandolo could not be reached for comment.

Guandolo has made statements in the past that Muslims are plotting the overthrow of America to enact religious Sharia in a “civilization jihad.”

His Twitter postings include photos of random U.S. airport security officers with beards (which he calls “sharia adherent beards”), labeled as “jihadis” and “terrorists.”

He once claimed a Delaware imam was signaling “civilization jihad” when he touched his nose during the Pledge of Allegiance.

Guandolo resigned from the FBI in 2008 following accusations about a sexual relationship with an informant in a corruption case, and his alleged attempt to solicit money from her, according to a government court filing.

He founded his training company, Understanding The Threat, in 2010 based on time working in the FBI’s counterterrorism division.

After Adam Rippon of the United States excelled during his Winter Olympics debut in the men’s free skate for the team event Monday, he and NBC Sports’ Mike Tirico talked about overcoming butterflies.

Tirico asked the 28-year-old Rippon what was going through his mind when he took the ice.

“I want to throw up,” the athlete said. “I want to go over to the judges and say, ‘Can I just have a Xanax and a quick drink. I’ll be fine.’ But I kept it together. I just took it one element at a time.”

Adam Rippon why would you say this to everyone watching around the world? Give me a Xanax and a drink 😮 What does everyone think about this rant? Rt answers if its ok or not ok.

On Saturday, Rippon took to Instagram to say he was “disappointed” that the condoms being distributed at the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were so bland. He griped that they could have been available in different colors or bear the Olympics logo.

“Life isn’t always what it seems and sometimes the condoms are just generic,” he said.Gigi Hadid slammed critics of her weight on social media on Sunday night, explaining her journey with Hashimoto’s disease and imploring others to have more empathy.

“For those of you so determined to come up w why my body has changed over the years, you may not know that when I started @ 17 I was not yet diagnosed w/Hashimoto’s disease; those of u who called me ‘too big for the industry’ were seeing inflammation & water retention due to that,” the model wrote.

The 22-year-old’s tweet thread went into detail about how she dealt with her Hashimoto’s diagnosis and the effect it has had on her shape.

Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune condition that targets your thyroid. As your thyroid gland is responsible for producing hormones that coordinate many of your body’s functions, it can lead to numerous health problems.

Hadid’s message to fans and critics goes on to say that her body type doesn’t have to suit any specific “beauty” expectation and that people need to stop accusing her of drug use.

“Use your energy to lift those that you admire rather than be cruel to those u don’t,” she wrote.

I will not further explain the way my body looks, just as anyone, with a body type that doesnt suit ur “beauty” expectation, shouldnt have to. Not to judge others, but drugs are not my thing, stop putting me in that box just because u dont understand the way my body has matured. — Gigi Hadid (@GiGiHadid) February 11, 2018

alternate tweet: “fuck off” ❤️ — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 12, 2018Reese Witherspoon and Adam Rippon’s budding Twitter friendship will make your heart do a triple axel.

After the Olympic U.S. figure skater’s Sunday night free skate — in which he helped Team USA win bronze in the team event thanks to his stunning performance — Rippon gave NBC a little taste of what runs through his mind when he’s about to compete.

“There are so many emotions when I step on the ice. I want to represent my country to the best of my abilities,” Rippon said, adding cheekily, “I want to make Reese Witherspoon proud.”

And proud the Oscar-winning actress was. Witherspoon posted her approval of the 28-year-old Olympian’s dazzling debut on Twitter.

Yet, this is not the first time the two have corresponded with each other on the social media platform.

Their Twitteromance began when the “Big Little Lies” actress tweeted last week that Rippon was her No. 1 reason for tuning into the games.

And Rippon responded to her admiration in the cutest way.

Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete at the games, is developing a reputation for his playful and often bold commentary.

On Saturday, Rippon posted an Instagram story in which he spoke candidly about being “disappointed” that the condoms distributed at the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were “just generic.”

“Like, I’m not entirely sure what I was expecting,” he said. “I thought maybe they’d have like Olympic rings on them or they’d be all different colors, but, no. It’s all a myth.”Make no mistake, Michelle Kwan’s still got it.

The 37-year-old former Olympian posted a video on social media of herself skating to Keala Settle’s “This Is Me.”

Though it’s been more than a decade since she’s skated competitively, Kwan still slays on the ice.

In the video, Kwan glides across the rink, looking as graceful and elegant as ever. The skater wrote in her post that Settle’s song reminds her of “an Olympian’s journey to the Games” ― something she knows all too well as she’s competed in the Winter Olympics twice, earning silver and bronze medals.

According to a video from October, the former Olympian also can still nail double axels ― after not practicing jumps for seven years.

A post shared by Michelle Kwan (@michellewkwan) on Oct 4, 2017 at 5:57pm PDT

While Kwan can still skate like a star, she’s actually been busy being a boss in a completely different field. After her competitive skating career, she got a master’s degree from Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. She worked as a senior adviser to the State Department under the Obama administration and then as an outreach coordinator on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, W Magazine reports.

AdvertisementIn late 2007, “How I Met Your Mother” co-creator Craig Thomas faced an unusual situation. After penning the script for Episode 11 of the CBS comedy’s third season alongside fellow creator Carter Bays, he found himself handing off the pages they’d written. The scenes were to be filmed without his presence on set — or any of his writing staff, for that matter.

“We tried to get the script as tight and manageable as possible with the knowledge that there would be no writers on set to punch up any of the jokes or fix any of the words,” he explained. “At a certain time of the night, we just had to hit send and the script went to our producer and director and we said, ‘Have a great shoot week. We’ll be picketing outside of the lot.’”

Thomas and Bays were two of roughly 12,000 TV and film and television writers who were striking on behalf of the East and West unions of the Writers Guild of America, a walkout caused by stalled negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers that all but ground scripted television like “HIMYM” to a halt in late 2007 and 2008. (Members of HuffPost’s union are represented by WGA East.)

The organizations were in the midst of negotiating a new three-year contract. But after the AMPTP, the trade association affiliated with corporations like CBS and NBCUniversal, failed to meet the demands of the guilds, writers embarked on a 100-day stalemate.

During that time, guild writers no longer took work. In terms of television, that meant there were no new scripted episodes available for the networks to air besides those commissioned before the strike. More than 60 TV shows shut down as a result, and ratings and ad sales plummeted. By December 2007, most scripted series were off the air and not set to return for months. The CW’s “Gossip Girl” and “One Tree Hill” faced shortened seasons; NBC’s “Heroes” only completed 11 episodes of the 24 expected for Season 2, and was off the air for nine months; the third season of Fox’s “Bones” was cut short as the show went on a four-month hiatus. Late-night programming all but disappeared (until hosts like Conan O’Brien, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert fought to return without writers citing the financial struggles of their non-writing staff), and award shows like the Golden Globes were canceled.

In total, the strike cost the state of California over $2 billion and 37,700 jobs, according to nonprofit economic think tank the Milken Institute.

For a show like “HIMYM,” the prospect of a lengthy pause was daunting.

“Everyone had to stop [working] and that was scary, as the show was just gaining some momentum,” Thomas said.

But there were larger interests at stake.

Audiences used to watching movies in theaters and TV at designated times in their homes were getting acquainted with a new kind of viewing experience: streaming video. Industry experts at the time predicted that so-called “new media” content ― shows and movies distributed online or viewed on computers, cell phones and other devices ― would eventually supplant DVDs in terms of profits. (Spoiler alert: They did.)

Initially, the big studios ― MGM, Sony, Warner Bros. and Disney, among others ― took home most, if not all, of the profits of this “new media” content; the WGA had no formal agreement with the companies on how to compensate writers for this kind of online or on-demand distribution. So when it came time to renegotiate a contract in November 2007, this issue was key.

According to the WGA, the AMPTP began negotiations by offering paltry residuals for new media and expressed a desire to deny the guilds future jurisdiction over scripts written for the internet. And the group felt as though it had no choice but to strike.

“It was one of the most important strikes of the new century to date,” Lowell Peterson, executive director of the WGA East, told HuffPost. Although Peterson was not a part of the WGA East until after the strike ended, he was interviewing for the role of director during the walkout and was in communication with leadership throughout the entire process. He witnessed the picketing firsthand and considers the strike to be “the first major labor action of the digital age.”

“This was a bunch of employees confronting the impact of information technology and digital technology on their way of living, and that was something that resonated very deeply across the labor force and the labor movement,” he said.

The strike officially ended on Feb. 12, 2008. The guilds won a piece of digital revenues and established a percentage payment on the distributor’s gross, and shows like “HIMYM” resumed with their writing staff in tact.

“Our perception was that it was very successful,” Peterson explained. “That as a result of the strike, the guilds were able to win jurisdiction and residual payment terms that otherwise simply wouldn’t exist. It looked like a great victory.”

But, it wasn’t an easy road. Not only had writers been out of work, they’d returned to an industry indelibly changed by their fight.

The Rising Tide Of Reality TV

While scripted television series were forced to take a hiatus during the strike, this was not the case for reality TV shows.

Once pre-strike commissioned episodes ran out and fictional series were on lockdown, broadcast and cable networks clamored for any original content they could find to fill their schedules. As a result, some industry watchdogs connect the writers strike with the boom of reality television, considering more than 100 unscripted shows ― from competition shows to dating shows to life improvement series ― either debuted or returned during that 2007-2008 season.

However, Eli Holzman, the current CEO of The Intellectual Property Corporation and the creator/developer behind series like “Project Greenlight,” “Undercover Boss” and “Project Runway,” has a slightly different take on the strike’s impact on reality TV. He believes the explosion of unscripted television in 2008 was a long time in the making.

“Nonscripted TV was on the march really from the early 2000s, with the advent of ‘Survivor,’ ‘Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?’ and ‘Big Brother,’” Holzman explained. “The genre came into its own and it mirrored the trajectory and growth of cable, and commissioning increased each year. Yes, the strike was one important factor in that. But to me, slightly less important than the growth of cable and the audience’s embrace of the genre.”

As Holzman described it, scripted television was in the doldrums beginning in the mid-aughts. Viewers, he said, were bored with the slog of too-similar sitcoms, cop dramas and medical shows. From 2005 to 2007, for example, “American Idol” reigned supreme while the high-rated “Grey’s Anatomy,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” and “House” eventually slipped below “Dancing with the Stars.” According to Holzman, audiences craved a fresh start. Cue the rise in reality television projects, which hit their stride in the 2000s. They peaked in 2015, when 750 nonfiction programs (350 of them brand new) aired on cable.

“Suddenly, this genre — Oh my god, all these people are going to get left on an island with nothing and they have to vote each other off, and someone is going to win a million dollars? ― was new and different and we wanted new and different versus a copy of a copy of a copy,” Holzman said. “The strike is an easy moment to look at when suddenly we all became aware of a change that was going on that maybe we hadn’t noticed before. But that change was happening on its own.”

WGA East’s Peterson agrees with him.

“I would not say that reality TV was created by the writers strike. I would say that more people watched it because there was nothing else on,” he added, noting that reality TV was simply “the only alternative, other than reruns,” for networks to air in lieu of their regularly scheduled programming.

Still, Holzman admits the strike did help to advance certain reality programs. “Project Runway,” for instance, aired its fourth season from November 2007 to March 2008 and earned pretty solid ratings for Bravo. The finale roped in 6.1 million viewers in the 18-49 demo when Christian Siriano won. Later in 2008, Lifetime took over the series and ratings increased by nearly 30 percent. Episodes of NBC’s “Biggest Loser” moved from a one-hour slot to two in order to fill primetime space. CBS aired its first, and last, “Big Brother” winter season. “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” began its reign on E! “American Idol” capped off a historic season in May 2008 with 31.7 million finale viewers, helping Fox become America’s most-watched network for the first time ever.

“As the strike wore on, the [reality] business was robust,” Holzman reiterated. “As a typical Hollywood producer, I thought I was just really talented [Laughs]. I didn’t realize I was potentially riding a wave. I thought, ‘I’m so good at this! This is so easy!’ That was genuinely my impression, and I didn’t realize we were in the midst of what was going to be a boom.”o

Indeed, when guild writers returned to work, reality TV was no longer just a cloying trend. Thomas admitted that, as a scripted TV showrunner, it wasn’t easy to watch reality programs top the ratings week after week from there on out.

“I remember being really stressed out in the first couple of years of ‘How I Met Your Mother’ because we were losing to a reality show all the sudden,” Thomas recalled. “That show ‘Deal or No Deal’ was this huge sensation and we were like, ‘Oh man, we’re losing to suitcases of money being opened up!’”

The ‘Death’ Of The Baby Writer

There were other long-term effects of the strike, though, not just for veteran writers, but aspiring ones, too.

About 20 years ago ― a decade before the writers strike ― a handful of these promising writers’ assistants, or “baby writers” as they were sometimes called, were working with Holzman at Miramax Television on a Kevin Williamson project called “Wasteland.” The show, about a group of post-college pals, aired only three episodes in 1999 before ABC canceled it. But out of that particular wasteland came a crucial opportunity. Since the studio heads were still required to fulfill the 13-episode order for foreign buyers but no longer felt pressure to deliver top-level content, aspiring young writers were given the chance to pen the remaining scripts for the series.

“We were in a blowout game where you take the kids off the bench and you put them in because it doesn’t matter,” Holzman told HuffPost. “One of those writers’ assistants was Damon Lindelof, who would go on to create ‘Lost’ and has obviously had an extraordinary career. Here’s a voice that, because of that flourishing ecosystem, was able to be identified, nurtured and grown, and his writing was then brought to all of us: the audience.”

Unfortunately, the months of foot-dragging from AMPTP negotiators in 2007-2008 messed with that flourishing ecosystem, Holzman says, dismantling a once healthy community that fostered creators of all ranks.

“As the strike and the decline in commissioning wore on, the people who maybe had previously been a rung or two up the ladder were willing to take a job and come back at a lower level, a lower rate. If you’re running a show and have to staff it, you have the ability to hire a kid who’s promising but never done it before or someone who’s really competent and is going to take a pay cut to work at that level. You’re almost crazy not to hire that more seasoned person. So, that baby writer pathway into the business went away,” he said, “and that was tragic.”

Then-“baby writer” Nick Bernardone, however, was one of the lucky ones. “I got my first job as an office production assistant on ’30 Rock’ [in 2008] by literally walking into the office at the exact right time and asking if they needed someone. It was one in a million timing,” he told HuffPost. “The answer was something like, ‘Usually, this would be insane ... but can you start tomorrow?’”

After working alongside the likes of Tina Fey, Bernardone went on to become a member of the writers’ room on her Netflix series, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” He insists he wouldn’t have gotten the gig had he not worked similar jobs on shows like AMC’s “The Walking Dead” and Netflix’s “Bloodline” in the interim.

Thomas and Bays also entered the business relatively easily. They were hired as writers for David Letterman just a few months after graduating from Wesleyan University in 1997, well before the strike. And they opted to pay it forward.

“Through the run of ‘How I Met Your Mother,’ we promoted several of our writers’ assistants, mostly post-strike,” he said. “One of them was Matt Kuhn, who ended up being a writer on the show for the entire rest of the run after a couple of seasons as a writers’ assistant. We did the same thing with Craig Gerard and our personal assistant, Matt Zinman ― we promoted them to be full writers on the show for many years. And in the last couple seasons we promoted George Sloan.”

These days, Bernardone, who’s been nominated for four Emmy awards, believes breaking into the business is all about who’s willing to give you a slice of the pie.

“If someone likes an aspiring writer’s stuff, they’ll do their best to get them hired,” he said.

As unreliable as it might be, it’s a practice Holzman believes is necessary.

“It’s really important to nurture a new crop, a new generation of storytellers every year, because it takes a long time to get there and it takes a long time to learn your craft,” he said. “It’s like a bad year for grapes — in 10 years, we won’t have that vintage.”

The Streaming Pathway To Prestige TV

Beyond the birth of the reality television boom and the increase in obstacles for up-and-coming writers, the strike ushered in an era that the guilds and industry insiders always expected: the era of streaming TV.

In 2007, Netflix was on an upswing. The company had launched in 1998 as a mail-order competitor to the then-popular but ultimately terminal Blockbuster, which rented out VHS tapes, DVDs and video games to the masses largely via brick-and-mortar stores. By 2005, 35,000 different films were available through Netflix’s subscription service; they reportedly shipped out 1 million DVDs every day. But soon enough, Netflix went the way of the internet, allowing its subscribers to browse through and watch films and shows by streaming them straight to their devices. By 2008, it had already identified its video-on-demand platform as the future. By 2013, Netflix had 27.1 streaming customers in the U.S.

In Thomas’ eyes, the writers strike was a pivotal turning point for the digital revolution helmed by Netflix, Hulu and other platforms. When the WGA refused to negotiate a contract without new media residuals, it signaled to the AMPTP and the entertainment industry at large exactly how powerful streaming services could be.

“We had front-row seats to this huge change, and I credit ’How I Met Your Mother’s success a lot to the influence of Netflix,” Thomas said. “The popularity of Netflix started to get so much bigger and in those next couple of seasons, ‘How I Met Your Mother’ got onto Netflix and was very, very popular on there. [It] enabled all these new fans to binge the first few seasons and catch up and we saw ratings on live TV, on CBS, bump up because of this streaming service.

“That was part of what the strike was about: making sure writers were fairly compensated for work that wasn’t created for Netflix but got on Netflix,” Thomas continued. “Right away, we saw how important that side of things would become ― even with helping shows do better on network TV.”

And as platforms like Netflix grew and enhanced, so did original content, leading to, as Thomas put it, the rise of prestige TV. Sure, standout shows like “The Sopranos” and “The Wire” predated the walkout, but he believes writers had “firmer ground” to work on following the strike and were able to experiment with a plethora of innovative scripted series in ways they weren’t able to before ― knowing that they have the option of pitching their shows to multiple networks, premium channels and streaming sites.

“It’s certainly true that for a while people were more worried that what we did was hand the industry over to reality TV, and that definitely has not happened,” Peterson added. “What we’ve seen since the strike is an enormous explosion of high-budget scripted television. Reality definitely supplanted scripted for a while but in the 10 years since the strike, scripted has just expanded beyond anyone’s dreams.”

Were writers brainstorming the next decade of prestige TV while on the picket line years ago? Although Holzman doesn’t know how many successful TV scripts were created during on-strike downtime, he believes there were ideas brewing.

“It’s not likely they were stockpiling scripts for things that weren’t commissioned, but were they writing for themselves and creating things? I’m sure. Just because Picasso goes out of fashion, I don’t think he stops painting. Similarly, if there isn’t a market for writers work, I don’t think that means that they cease to write. I wouldn’t be surprised if some great stuff originated during that time period.”

Thomas can vouch for that.

“Everyone had in the back of their head, ‘What if this goes on a really long time? What if our show goes away after this?’ You never relax. You have to prove yourself and fight for it, so you take nothing for granted,” Thomas said. “So I think everybody had a little panicked thought about what to do next. ‘Should I be thinking about possible alternative shows or features for after the strike?’ It was definitely a moment.”

Today, the effects of on-demand viewing are still a major concern for the WGA East and West.

“On-demand viewing seems to be supplanting virtually everything else, and that has changed the way our members do their work,” Peterson said. “It’s changed the nature of the shows. No one is constrained to, ‘It’s 8 o’clock on Wednesday, I’m going to watch CBS now.’ People watch what they want, when they want, and that’s given our members enormous opportunities.”

In the spring of 2017, WGA and AMPTP negotiations once again hit a snag over issues of compensation related to new media.

According to Peterson, there were a few things that drove it, including the fact that average TV earnings were increasing, due in part to things like decreased costs as the average television season became shorter. Tens of billions of profits were not being shared with writers.

“We had this enormous ‘yes’ vote authorizing the committee to call a strike,” Person said of the 2017 negotiations. “I think it was 96.3 percent yes, which is really an affirmation that members were ready to take action.”

After threatening a walkout, the AMPTP agreed to some of the guilds’ demands, likely with knowledge of what another writers strike would do to its industry. The guilds made gains across the board, added funding to their health plan and increases in subscription TV residuals, high-budget SVOD residuals, and, for the first time ever, residuals for comedy-variety writers in Pay TV. Now, writers for late-night and shows like “SNL” could see payment for content that’s re-aired on subscription sites or the internet. The unions also pushed to restructure compensation terms for writers of shorter seasons, making sure creators saw a piece of the studios’ profits.

“The Writers Guilds East and West are committed to the possibility of striking if that’s what it takes to win gains for our members, and we make sure that’s clear to the AMPTP when we sit down with them,” Peterson said. “The studios and networks know that we mean it and will do it if necessary, and that’s a lesson from the 2007-2008 strike.”

Holzman, for one, is glad another strike didn’t happen.

“The macro feeling across the industry was a strike will be bad because if we’re looking at leisure activity and how people are spending their leisure time. Television has competitors in a way it never had before in the form of the internet and mobile,” Holzman said.

“We’ve seen, and continue to see, an enormous migration of advertising dollars out of proper television — cable, broadcast and otherwise — and onto the web,” he added. “There was a sense that a prolonged strike may result in the audience declining, which it has been anyway. Maybe if there wasn’t great TV being produced, maybe the audience wouldn’t come back. I think that was a collective fear shared by both the producers and the writers, which encouraged them to find common ground to avoid another strike.”

“It could’ve been quite bad,” he added.Fans of actress Lupita Nyong’o cannot stop raving over her latest photo shoot with Allure and it’s no surprise why.

For “The Culture of Hair” issue, Allure called on Nyong’o’s hairstylist, Vernon Francois, to give Lupita some stunning looks:

“Lupita and I wanted to show that coil-y or kinky hair has many strengths and can be worn in lots of different ways, celebrating its beauty and versatil-ity,” said @vernonfrancois. “Loving your true texture is important.” pic.twitter.com/DDq4H9wRUK — Allure (@Allure_magazine) February 12, 2018

“We wanted to make them traditional, forward-thinking, and honest, which is exactly what we did,” said @vernonfrancois. “Lupita and I have wanted to create a braid look like this for some time, and having the chance to do it for Allure was a dream come true.” pic.twitter.com/9esLSmjyF7 — Allure (@Allure_magazine) February 12, 2018

Editor in chief Michelle Lee talked to the Oscar winner about her hair, her relationship with it and more in a delightful interview.

Nyong’o says she “didn’t love” her hair when she was a child because “it was lighter than my skin, which made me not love it so much.”

“I was really kind of envious of girls with thicker, longer, more lush hair. In my tween years, I started begging my mother to have my hair relaxed,” she said.

“She wouldn’t allow it, though her hair was relaxed. She felt that that was a decision I could come to when I was maybe 18,” she continued. “Around 13 or 14, I had such a rough time with being teased and feeling really unpretty. My dad intervened and spoke to my mom about my hair, and she finally agreed. She took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable.”

The “Black Panther” star also talked about the time she shaved her head (“I didn’t tell anybody except for my hairdresser. When I got home, my mother was horrified. She was just like, ‘What have you done to my hair?’”) and how she’s fallen in love with her locks as she’s grown older.

“I love my hair. I love it because I’ve also been able to really embrace the stuff it can do. It’s like clay in the right hands. Clay can be dirt in the wrong hands, but clay can be art in the right hands,” she said.

Twitter has been celebrating the interview and photos since they dropped on Monday:

Each of the Obamas spoke during Monday’s event. The former first lady spoke of her late father, who she says “sacrificed everything to give me and my brother the opportunities he never dreamed for himself.”

She also said she was “thinking about all of the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and they will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall.”

Both Obamas chose black artists who’ve been praised by Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery.

“Both have achieved enormous success as artists, but even more, they make art that reflects the power and potential of portraiture in the 21st century,” Sajet said.

Some people say the only way to stop online harassment is to stop going online. Well, we aren’t going anywhere. Reclaim Your Domain is Refinery29′s campaign to make the internet (and the world outside of it) a safer space for everyone — especially women.

Which is worse: having nude or intimate photos of yourself hacked and shared online, or having your face digitally placed on a porn star’s body so it looks as if you’re performing X-rated acts? That’s a rhetorical question, because in both cases, if you haven’t consented, it’s a lose-lose situation. Right now, both of these unsavory scenarios are affecting women in Hollywood, showing a dark side of the web and the nightmarish ways people are using new technologies for harmful means. In early December, Vice’s Motherboard first reported on a specific kind of porn video, which was distributed on Reddit by a user who went by the name “deepfakes.” Using open source machine learning algorithms — ones that are free and available to the public — deepfakes created realistic-looking fake porn that placed celebrities’ faces on porn stars’ bodies. Gal Gadot, Daisy Ridley and Margot Robbie were among the most high-profile actresses whose images were used in the films, which continued to proliferate under a subreddit named after the original creator.

The nonconsensual spread of deepfake videos has been compared to 2014′s “The Fappening,” the major hacking and release of celebrities’ nude photos. Besides the medium, there’s one obvious difference: Deepfake videos are not actually real (though it can be disturbingly hard to tell) and by splicing together two forms of media — footage from celebrities and footage from real porn videos — their harm extends beyond Hollywood, and has the potential to affect any woman with a large number of high-quality photos publicly available online.

“Despite the increased accessibility of porn, both due to the internet and illegal file sharing, it remains highly stigmatized.”

It isn’t just Hollywood A-listers who are currently suffering the repercussions of deepfakes, Anna Arrowsmith, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and former porn director, told Refinery29:

“Everyone is upset about the actress or whoever the famous woman is, but the person who is behind that face, the real porn star, is going to be pretty pissed off because everyone is just going ‘Oh yeah, what a performance, what a body, and I’m not getting any credit because people can’t recognize me.’ There will be ramifications of income. This could have been the break for that woman but it’s not going to happen because she’s not going to be recognizable.”

The demand for porn remains extremely high: In 2017, people uploaded 595,482 hours of video to Pornhub and 50,000 searches for individual videos took place on the site every minute. And that’s just one porn platform — there are many others. Before deepfakes surfaced online, the porn industry already had a problem with copyright theft. According to an analysis from Bloomberg’s Bureau of National Affairs, up to 40% of all copyright claims in federal court come from a single adult film studio.

Despite the increased accessibility of porn, both due to the internet and illegal file sharing, it remains highly stigmatized. It’s something people watch and take pleasure from, yet seek to distance from their own lives. That separation is something that accounts for “the misogyny that’s inherent in a lot of porn,” Arrowsmith says.

DESIGNED BY EMILY KOWZAN.

Deepfakes takes this dynamic to another level: Most of the deepfakes that have created a stir online have featured a female celebrity. The only male celebrities whose faces were used in broadly shared, AI-assisted videos were Nicolas Cage, who appeared as the face of James Bond and Indiana Jones, and Donald Trump, who appeared as “The Office”’s Michael Scott. Both of those videos were parodies, not pornos.

It’s not hard to see why female celebrities have been the main target: The movie industry has a long history of objectifying and sexualizing women. In a 2013 USC Annenberg study observing gender roles in popular films, researchers found that women were onscreen far less often than men. Of the over 4,000 speaking characters in the films studied, only 28.4 percent were women, meaning that not only were women appearing less, they were also talking less. They were, however, far more likely than men to appear partially naked or in sexy clothing on screen.

Deepfake videos escalate Hollywood’s sexualization of women to disturbing extremes. The intense interest in deepfakes could be a desire to fulfill a fantasy, and see female celebrities who are admired but don’t do porn, but it could also be “a kind of putting down on someone,” Arrowsmith says. “[A way to say] ‘haha, they’ve been denigrated to porn.’”

That’s not to say there’s anything shameful about doing porn. But because porn is usually cast in a negative light, portraying someone in a sexually explicit image or video without their consent is a way to shame them in today’s world. The fact that this is simpler than ever has human rights activists concerned. While AI-assisted fake porn has been limited to celebrities so far, the technology is easy for anyone to access and use, suggesting that it could be used as a form of revenge porn.

There’s some evidence this may already be happening: According to Forbes, some Reddit users have inquired about making deepfakes using their ex-girlfriends’ photos. What is especially troubling is that it is becoming especially hard to separate what is real from what is fake.

“Improvements in the tech will make it even more difficult to convince others of its inauthenticity,” Carrie Goldberg, the founder of law firm C.A. Goldberg, PLLC, and a board member at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, told Refinery29. “10 years from now we could all have prolific porn careers without our consent.”

The worst part may be that there are few laws in place to protect women against deepfakes — the legal system and many platforms haven’t kept up with the rapid spread of this new genre. Pornhub and Gfycat only just announced they were banning deepfakes, and Twitter announced a ban last night after an account publishing deepfakes was discussed on Reddit. Today, almost two months after the initial reports of the videos, Reddit finally banned them.

Questions of accountability have led to pointed fingers all around: Is it the creators of open source AI who are to blame? Or the social networks who aren’t policing the content fast enough?

These are the issues tech, and all other industries, will need to grapple with. “This is a stark example of how the rapid development of AI technology — and its increasingly widespread use — is raising big questions for human rights and society,” Azmina Dhrodia, a technology and human rights researcher at Amnesty International, said. “Governments, industry, and civil society are already playing catch up.”

In the fight against other forms of revenge porn, legislation has been slow, but strides have been made. This past November, senators introduced the bipartisan ENOUGH Act that, if passed, will hold perpetrators of nonconsensual photo sharing accountable. Deepfakes, by virtue of the fact that they are fake, present a whole new set of challenges for lawmakers, but they are ones that need to be addressed, and fast.

“In the case of true images, the underlying harm is a violation of privacy — the disclosure of true, private information to the public without authorization,” Mary Anne Franks, the Legislative and Tech Policy Director at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, told Refinery29. “This is not the underlying harm of manipulated images — the harm of such images is not their truth, but their falsity.”

Nevertheless, Franks says that this messy issue is one that deserves our full attention: “The problem of ‘face-swapped’ porn helps highlight the harm of sexual objectification without consent, a harm that everyone should care about.”The moderate Republican woman was speaking last week at the Texas Disposal Systems Exotic Game Ranch, just south of Austin. The first order of business was to confront that one “nasty little rumor going around” about herself.

This was Jenifer Sarver, a 40-year-old former staffer for Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), and she was facing off in a forum with 12 other GOP candidates vying for U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith’s (R-Texas) seat in Congress.

Sarver was here to talk about policy and pragmatism. Surrounded by Trump supporters and taxidermied animals, she was not in her element, and she leaned into it with her confession. “It’s true,” she admitted. She voted for Hillary Clinton.

“I couldn’t support candidate Trump,” she said. “As a woman, I couldn’t do it.”

“Just then,” wrote one Austin-American Statesman columnist who was in the room, “some of the dead animal heads on the walls turned toward Sarver with looks of shocked disbelief.“

Sarver didn’t stop there. She took aim at the “aging, white” GOP and said Republicans need to learn how to work with the other side.

“We have a tone that is shutting people out,” she said. “Young people are not interested in joining our party. Women are leaving our party in droves. And if you look out over this audience, it’s a very white crowd here tonight. And it’s a pretty white group of people that are running as well.”

The room fell silent ― and then right-wing candidate Matt McCall chimed in. “We shouldn’t be getting along with the side that wants to kill babies,” he said. “Married women vote Republican.”

As Democratic women storm the 2018 midterm elections, running in higher numbers than ever before and inching closer toward equal representation in government, Republican women are becoming something of an endangered species in Congress. More than a quarter of GOP women in the House aren’t seeking re-election this year, leaving a gaping void in a caucus in which women already make up less than 10 percent of elected members.

Republican women are struggling to find a foothold in a party that rejects “identity politics” and therefore puts little effort into recruiting, training and financially supporting female candidates. Moderate GOP women, in particular, are increasingly marginalized in the bellowing, hypermasculine Republican Party of Donald Trump, President Grab ’Em By The Pussy. Look no further than the wagon-circling around Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who resigned last week over allegations of spousal abuse. Trump’s first instinct was to praise Porter and his second was to muse on Twitter about false accusations.

“Maxine Waters has coined the term ‘reclaiming our time.’ We want to reclaim our party,” said Meghan Milloy, co-founder of the nascent nonprofit group Republican Women for Progress, which aims to train moderate GOP women to run for office. “Many of us are for limited government and free markets, but we’re not these cuckoo ‘Let’s put the gays in a camp’ Republicans.”

Milloy and her co-founder, Jennifer Pierotti Lim, who spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton, would love to fill Congress with more women like the broadly popular Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who are moderate at least in their rhetoric if not always their votes. The “chupacabras,” Milloy and Lim call them.

But Republicans aren’t seeing the same surge in female candidates as Democrats are this year in response to Donald Trump’s presidency. The number of Democratic female House candidates has risen by 146 percent since the 2016 election, while the number of Republican women candidates has increased by 35 percent, according to an analysis by the Center for American Women in Politics (CAWP). In total, 99 GOP women are looking to run for Congress this year, compared with 351 Democratic women.

Center for American Women and Politics

There’s no great mystery here. Many Republican women did vote for Trump and therefore aren’t motivated and inspired to run against his agenda. But there’s a structural deficit as well: The GOP also lacks its own equivalent to EMILY’s List, the massively influential PAC that recruits, trains and fundraises for female Democratic candidates.

“Most PACs are just waiting for Republican women to surface. I don’t know any doing recruitment on the ground,” said Milloy. “I wouldn’t say diversity is really a priority for Republicans at this point.”

“The Republican Party has made repeated statements that they’re not the party of identity politics, they’re just looking for the best candidate, and it’s hard to reconcile direct recruitment and targeting of women with that position,” said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at CAWP. “That’s part of why you see less of that targeted work, which we know is essential.”

Republican PACs may also be low on energy this year, Milloy said, because the party of the president historically loses seats during a midterm election. “They may be thinking, ‘Why would we go recruit all these great women, only for them to lose?’”

Jesse Hunt, national press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, counted “nearly 50 female candidates” who’d been recruited by the NRCC — “a tremendous job,” he called it.

Milloy and Lim, both attorneys who have been active in politics since the George W. Bush administration, are also hoping to fill the void and eventually become the Republican version of EMILY’s List. They’re holding a public candidate training for Republican women in Washington, D.C., next week, and they’ve identified about 10 center-right female candidates so far that they’d like to help train and support in the 2018 elections.

Sarver is one of them. She won’t have an easy time running as a moderate Republican woman in Texas, where Trump dominated the 2016 election, and which hasn’t elected a freshman woman to the House since 1996. But her pragmatic approach to policymaking may be refreshing to some who are frustrated by the direction of the GOP and the rightward polarization of politics in general.

“I’m pro-life, but I know standing and screaming at each other about abortion is not getting anything done,” she told HuffPost. “I wanna say, ’Let’s set aside the issue of abortion and come together on ways we can reduce unintended pregnancies,′ like talking about access to contraception, which ultimately reduces abortion.”

Sarver said her message seems to be resonating, at least in Austin ― a blue dot in a red state. “People keep coming up to me and saying, ‘Wow, you sound really rational.’ And I think, man, the bar’s really low. I don’t wanna be in a party that people think is extreme and isn’t sane.”

Sarver’s fundraising numbers are not ideal ― she’s raised only $150,000 so far. Her primary race is very crowded, which in part explains the low number, but she needs more money to be competitive. A candidate backed by a group like EMILY’s List would have raised much more by now. Chrissy Houlahan, a first-time Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania, had raised $660K by October thanks to EMILY’s List’s early help.

Republicans need to invest in female candidates, Dittmar said, to bring an essential fresh perspective to what is increasingly a party of old white men. The GOP strategy of choosing the “best candidate,” without regard for gender, only perpetuates a system that excludes more than half the population from the table.
