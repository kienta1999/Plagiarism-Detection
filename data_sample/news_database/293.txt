A social studies teacher in the Bronx borough of New York City has been transferred from a school pending an investigation of reports that she ordered black students to lie on the floor and stepped on the back of one during a lesson on slavery.

“While the investigation has not been completed, these are deeply disturbing allegations, and the alleged behavior has no place in our schools or in society,” city Department of Education spokeswoman Toya Holness said in a statement Friday.

The New York Daily News reported Thursday that students complained teacher Patricia Cummings, who is white, ordered black seventh-graders to lie on the floor face down in her classes at Bronx Middle School 118 during a lesson on slave ships and the slave trade two weeks ago.

“She had students lie on the floor,” one told the Daily News. “She was measuring the length and width to show how little space slaves had in the ship. It was strange.”

Another said that Cummings “picked three of the black kids” and told them to lie on the floor in front of the class. “She said, ‘You see how it was to be a slave?’ She said, ‘How does it feel?’”

After a girl on the floor joked about feeling fine, Cummings allegedly put her foot on her back and said again, “See how it feels to be a slave?” the student said.

Several students and teachers expressed shock. The school is 3 percent white, 16 percent Asian, 21 percent black and 60 percent Latino, according to NBC-4 New York. But Cummings is also known as a popular teacher.

Parent Andrew Sims told CBS-2 New York, “To take your feet, step on the kid’s back, that’s a sign of disrespect, racism and everything else.”

Another parent, Benjamin Caceres, told CBS, “I’m all for students learning, but there should be boundaries, and there’s certain things that just shouldn’t be done.”

Cummings has posted on her personal page for the school: “I envision a world where people learn to respect, accept, and embrace the differences between us.” She could not be reached for comment.

Cummings has been a teacher at the middle school since since 2016 and has no prior disciplinary issues, according to the city Board of Education, NBC reported.Orangutan Love Doll

Deal breaker!An experienced hunter in Maryland wound up in a hospital on Thursday after a recently shot Canada goose fell out of the sky and landed on his head, local media reported.

The falling bird knocked Robert Meilhammer, 51, unconscious, CBS Baltimore reported. He had been out hunting geese with three friends near the Miles River in Easton, Maryland, at around 5 p.m., when someone in the group shot and killed the bird.

Meilhammer was seriously injured in the incident. Officials reported he was in stable condition and recovering in a shock trauma unit in Baltimore as of Friday night.

“These birds weigh anywhere from 10 to probably 14 pounds,” Candy Thomson, spokeswoman for Maryland Natural Resources Police, told the news outlet. That means that getting struck by one falling from the sky can mean “severe damage,” she said.

The deceased goose also knocked out two of Meilhammer’s teeth, The Washington Post reported.According to the criminal complaint, Haig met with Paddock on more than one occasion. Paddock met Haig at his home in September of 2017 to purchase ammunition. Haig previously operated “Specialized Military Ammunition,” an Internet business selling high explosive armor piercing incendiary ammunition, armor piercing incendiary ammunition, and armor piercing ammunition. Business records reveal that Haig sold armor piercing ammunition throughout the U.S., including Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Wyoming, and South Carolina. Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor piercing ammunition.

During an interview, Haig told investigators that he reloads ammunition, but does not offer reloaded cartridges for sale to his customers and none of the ammunition recovered in Las Vegas crime scenes would have tool marks on them consistent with his reloading equipment. Reloaded ammunition refers to ammunition that is manufactured from component parts, including previously fired cartridge cases. Based on a forensic examination of rounds recovered in the shooter’s hotel rooms, Haig’s fingerprints were found on reloaded, unfired .308 caliber cartridges. Forensic examination also revealed that armor piercing ammunition recovered inside of the shooter’s rooms had tool marks consistent with Haig’s reloading equipment.Demonstrators pack the Earth Day March for Science Rally on the National Mall on April 22, 2017.

More than 60 researchers and technologists are running for federal office in 2018 as part of a historic wave of candidates with science backgrounds launching campaigns.

At least 200 candidates with previous careers in science, technology, engineering and math announced bids for some of the nation’s roughly 7,000 state legislature seats as of Jan. 31, according to data that 314 Action, a political action committee, shared exclusively with HuffPost.

The group, which launched in 2014 to help scientists run for office, said it is talking with 500 more people and is pressing about half of them to run. An additional 200 such candidates are running for school boards.

“The sheer number is really astonishing,” 314 Action founder Shaughnessy Naughton told HuffPost. “We’ve never seen anything like this.”

This is the largest number of scientists to run for public office in modern history. If any of them win, it could dramatically multiply the number of scientists in Congress beyond Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), the lone Ph.D. scientist, a physicist.

The surge in congressional bids comes as scientists are experiencing a fierce political backlash. A year into his first term, President Donald Trump has yet to name a science adviser and has proposed dramatically slashing research budgets across federal agencies. He openly mocks the widely accepted science behind global warming and has nominated ardent climate deniers to key environmental positions. Under Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, the White House has reversed regulations to reduce greenhouse gases and put new rules in place to give control of the agency’s science advisory boards to researchers paid by industries.

The so-called war on science is being waged in Congress, too. Under the leadership of Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a virulent climate change denier and fossil fuel ally, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology has mounted repeated “witch hunts” to tarnish the credibility of scientists, leading some to call it the “House (anti)science panel.”

“The attacks on science, of course, didn’t start with the Trump administration, but it has been a catalyst to getting scientists out of the lab and into running for federal office,” Naughton said. “That is one bright spot.”

This weekend, 314 Action plans to announce its support for two new candidates running for the House of Representatives, bringing its total endorsements to 16.

The group is backing Brian Forde, a former senior technology adviser in the Obama administration, in his bid to unseat Rep. Mimi Walters. The Orange County Republican, who has served two terms from California’s 45th Congressional District, so routinely votes against climate change legislation that she has a paltry 4 percent lifetime score on the League of Conservation Voters’ ranking.

“She’s voting for herself to rise up in leadership, she’s not voting for her constituents,” Forde, who led a climate data initiative under President Barack Obama, told HuffPost by phone Friday.

“These are people that are genuinely outraged and concerned by the direction the country is going in, especially in this administration and this Congress.” - Shaughnessy Naughton, 314 Action founder

“I grew up in this district. This is where I won the local science fair in fifth grade. This is where I learned how to code and build a computer,” he added. “This is one of the most highly educated districts in the country.”

314 Action is also endorsing Suneel Gupta, a systems architect and former executive at Mozilla and Groupon, who is running for Michigan’s 11th District seat. His campaign bills him as the “first tech candidate in the industrial Midwest.”

He’s running to replace Rep. David Trott, a Republican attorney nicknamed the “foreclosure king” because he used to own one of the state’s largest “foreclosure mill” law firms. Trott, who said he would not run for reelection this year, has a 4 percent lifetime League of Conservation Voters score, and the crop of Republicans running to succeed him don’t seem poised to improve on that. At a Republican debate held last month, all six candidates answered no when asked 59 minutes in if they believed “in manmade climate change.”

“This is what we’re up against,” Gupta told HuffPost, adding that he wants to bring “evidence-based policy solutions into Congress.” “We don’t have enough of that now, and we need it now more than ever.”

314 Action is working with roughly 20 other federal campaigns and plans to endorse up to 10 more candidates before the election cycle is over. The group raised $207,157 and spent $223,159 in 2016, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive Politics. But the group said it raised $2 million in 2017, and is on track to bring in $5 million to $7 million throughout this election cycle.

“These are not people that envision themselves as politicians and build a résumé around that,” Naughton said. “These are people that are genuinely outraged and concerned by the direction the country is going in, especially in this administration and this Congress.”

“It seems that time has really come,” she added. “I find that really encouraging.”Sunday’s Puppy Bowl XIV will include two extra special canine athletes.

Every year, the event, which involves a bunch of adorable puppies frolicking around, serves as Animal Planet’s counter-programming to the Super Bowl. All of the participating dogs come from animal shelters or rescue groups, and this year, two of the puppies are animals rescued from Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

Kaleb Jr. and Archer, both mixed-breeds, were transported to the U.S. mainland by The Sato Project, a nonprofit focused on helping Puerto Rico’s stray dogs, ABC News reports.

The Sato Project has sent puppies to the Puppy Bowl for the past seven years, according to Bustle, but this year its participation takes on a new significance as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the hurricane. As of Wednesday, nearly 30 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority customers still had no power.

“We’re hoping these little dogs on Sunday are going to fly the flag high and proud and people will once again start to realize that the crisis isn’t over there and we are a part of the USA,” Sato Project founder Chrissy Beckles told ABC 7.

Kaleb Jr. and Archer have already been adopted by families in New York state, and both have been given new names — Murphy and Maddox, respectively, AM New York reports. They’re still called Kaleb Jr. and Archer in Puppy Bowl XIV promotional materials, though, so those are likely the names that will be used when the program airs.

Both pups now appear to have great lives and loving homes, according to what their families told AM New York. Maddox, aka Archer, is a “super loving” puppy who enjoys belly rubs. And Murphy, aka Kaleb Jr., is a friendly, sociable dog whose hobbies include trying to sneak bites of steak and chasing a cat named Milton.Michael Stuhlbarg in "Call Me by Your Name." Sony Pictures Classics

If you’ve heard rumblings about any particular “Call Me by Your Name” scene, it’s either Timothée Chalamet fucking a peach or The Monologue.

Those familiar with the movie, or the celebrated André Aciman book on which it’s based, will understand these references. 2017 was, after all, the year fruit sex went mainstream. As much as I’d love to spend the next 1,200 words dishing about that juicy peach, we’re going to talk about The Monologue. Oh, that sweet, picture-perfect monologue.

It’s the moment that clinches the film, delivered by Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg), the father of 17-year-old Elio (Chalamet), who falls for a graduate student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) during one blissful, bittersweet summer at his family’s Italian villa. Elio has just bid Oliver adieu, and Perlman consoles him with delicately chosen words that are the envy of every queer kid who ever longed to hear a parent say, “It gets better.”

Michael Stuhlbarg, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer in "Call Me by Your Name." Sony Pictures Classics

Director Luca Guadagnino and screenwriter James Ivory lifted the monologue almost word for word from Aciman’s text, excising only a few sentences. Even some of Aciman’s scene-setting prose finds its way into the script’s parenthetical directions, guiding the conversation as it unfolds on a couch in Perlman’s dim study. “His tone says: We don’t have to speak about it, but let’s not pretend we don’t know what I’m saying,” for example, appears in the novel and the screenplay, ensuring they mirror each other’s dulcet timbre.

Stuhlbarg’s speech is best underscored by these words (punctuation and capitalization are the script’s):

When you least expect it, Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot. Just remember: I am here. Right now you may not want to feel anything. Perhaps you never wished to feel anything. And perhaps it’s not to me that you’ll want to speak about these things. But feel something you obviously did. You had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, to pray that their sons land on their feet. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it. And if there is a flame, don’t snuff it out. Don’t be brutal with it. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything ― what a waste!

Two sentences nixed from Aciman’s rendering: “Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we’d want to be forgotten is no better,” and “Most of us can’t help but live as though we’ve got two lives to live, one is the mockup, the other the finished version, and then there are all those versions in between.”

During an interview ahead of the movie’s limited release in November ― it opened in wide release on Jan. 19, a few days before netting four Oscar nominations, including for best picture ― Stuhlbarg told me he delivered the monologue two different ways. His first take was more emotional, more impassioned; the second version, which Guadagnino “rightly” opted to use, was “a little more direct.”

On paper, the speech sounds very literary ― appropriate for an academic like Perlman who studies Greek antiquities, but still difficult for any actor to deliver with an organic cadence.

“You never know how a piece of text is going to live in you when you try to absorb it for all of its weight,” Stuhlbarg said. “I don’t think there was a conscious choice on my part for it to be any more or less professorial. I think the text does a lot of that for me, so maybe I was just concerned with it coming from a true place, and that he was choosing his words carefully. In another actor’s mouth, it would be different. ... I think the language speaks for itself. I tried to let it live in me over the course of the five or so weeks that we had, because we shot the movie in chronological order. [I wanted] to let it resonate with me that way I thought it could be said.”

Throughout the scene, the camera remains mostly trained on Stuhlbarg. He taps a cigarette on an ashtray perched on his lap and picks up a tumbler of whiskey to cut the silence between sentences. Sometimes he peers down, as if to reflect on his own youthful memories, but he largely holds Elio’s teary-eyed gaze. “Elio is dumbstruck as he tries to take all this in,” the screenplay notes, much like the novel’s first-person narration of the same sentiment: “I couldn’t begin to take all this in. I was dumbstruck,” Elio says.

“How you live your life is your business,” Perlman continues as the film’s gentle piano score kicks in. “Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there’s sorrow. Pain. Don’t kill it and with it the joy you’ve felt.”

A pause, Elio nodding as he absorbs the advice.

“We may never speak about this again,” his old man concludes. “But I hope you’ll never hold it against me that we did. I will have been a terrible father if, one day, you’d want to speak to me and felt that the door was shut, or not sufficiently open.”

In Stuhlbarg’s mouth, Perlman’s words are poetry ― vestiges of a weathered existence and guidance for a life not yet touched by the wisdom of adulthood.

The scene reflects Guadagnino’s intentions for the film. Before the shoot began, “we all sat around his dining room table and read the screenplay together,” Stuhlbarg said. “That was all the rehearsal that some of us had. [Guadagnino] said, ‘I want this to be a story of love and light and buoyancy and fun, to be reminiscent of those idyllic summers that, if we’re lucky, we have when we’re young. Our eyes are opened, and perhaps we fall in love for the first time in a deeper way.’ That idea infected the way we told the story, and it made it such a joyous experience in a way that I never would have expected it to be.”

Stuhlbarg, who appears in two other best picture contenders (“The Shape of Water” and “The Post”), didn’t receive the Oscar nomination he deserves, and “Call Me by Your Name” produced middling box-office returns in wide release despite the fawning praise it received.

Regardless, his closing scene is a master class in acting and writing. It’s what sets this apart from most gay stories, where characters are judged or punished (by parents, peers, spouses, mentors, bullies) for their sexuality. Indeed, every graceful pause in The Monologue is calibrated to capture the movie’s optimism. It’s both heartbreaking and uplifting.UPDATE May 14:

Rita Ora responded to the controversy with a lengthy statement on Twitter. “Girls,” she said, is “an accurate account of a very real and honest experience.”

“I have had romantic relationships with women and men throughout my life and this is my personal journey,” she said, and offered an apology.

Previously:

Rita Ora says her new single, “Girls,” is a “real gender-fluid freedom record,” but the song is getting a chilly reception from a number of queer pop artists.

On “Girls,” released last Friday, Ora teams up with Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX, no doubt in hopes of nabbing that ever-coveted “song of the summer” status.

“Sometimes I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls ... Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls girls,” Ora sings on the track, which can be viewed below. “I am excited, I’m open-minded, I’m 50/50, and I’m never gonna hide it, you should know.”

Music critics have interpreted the lyrics as Ora’s acknowledgement of her own bisexuality. The star herself, however, played it somewhat coy.

“If people look at it like that, it’s very narrow-minded, and I don’t think that’s what this record is,” she told People, when asked if she considers herself bisexual or fluid. “I don’t think that that even matters.”

Ora also said “Girls” was inspired in part by Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl.”

“It was just such a statement; it was so fun,” she said of Perry’s 2008 hit. “I wanted to do something that was in that lane.”

But at a time when openly LGBTQ stars are proudly making declarations about their sexuality in their music and videos, “Girls” seems out-of-step. (Even Perry recently admitted she’d “make an edit” to “I Kissed a Girl” because she now believes her song perpetuates “stereotypes.”)

Singer Hayley Kiyoko didn’t identify “Girls” or Ora by name, but posted a lengthy criticism of a “new song ... featuring a handful of well-known pop artists” on her Instagram Saturday.

Beloved by fans as a “lesbian Jesus,” Kiyoko said the song’s messaging is “just downright tone-deaf” and “does more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community.”

A post shared by H A Y L E Y K I Y O K O (@hayleykiyoko) on May 11, 2018 at 12:42pm PDT

Singer Kehlani, who identifies as queer, also didn’t call out Ora or “Girls” specifically, but appeared critical of the new song on Twitter.

every artist on the song is fantastic, and very much loved and supported by me... by all of us. but this isn’t about talent. it’s about choice. — Kehlani (@Kehlani) May 11, 2018

hate to be THAT guy but there were many awkward slurs, quotes, and moments that were like “word? word” — Kehlani (@Kehlani) May 11, 2018

and don’t make this personal.



i have an incredible song out with one of the artists, and would love to work with the other three as well. & have met them all and respect them.



there. were. harmful. lyrics.

period. love y’all. 🤗 — Kehlani (@Kehlani) May 11, 2018

Lesbian singer-songwriter Shura needed just a single emoji to sum up her view on the song.

Getty Images/Facebook/Minnesota House Of Representatives

Two Minnesota Republican state lawmakers and a local GOP official are facing scrutiny after they reportedly shared a Facebook post accusing Muslims of preparing to “infiltrate” the party’s caucuses this month.

State Reps. Kathy Lohmer and Cindy Pugh, shared the post created by Dave Sina, chairman of the Fourth Congressional District GOP, this week, according to the Star Tribune. Sina has since taken it down, but not before the Star Tribune captured a screenshot.

In the post, Sina said a friend of his had attended a caucus training session held at a mosque by the Muslim American Society. MAS is a nonpartisan organization that promotes civic engagement among American Muslims with local chapters across the U.S.

Sina claimed that Muslims are trying to “infiltrate our republican caucuses on Feb. 6” and that “they didn’t talk about the general election but I am sure they are ahead of us in that as well.”

The local party chair played to a sense of hysteria that American Muslims are, and will always be, foreigners who want political influence only to harm the country.

In reality, the workshop was led by Laura Johnson, the lead organizer at Isaiah, a Christian faith-based coalition in Minnesota that brings together Muslim and Christian congregants to educate their religious communities on civic engagement. HuffPost watched the hour-and-a-half long Facebook Live video of the meeting, which amounted to a tutorial on participating in the political system.

Johnson focused on the nuts and bolts of caucusing and how to get chosen to be a delegate at the parties’ state conventions in June. She broke down how caucuses work and why it’s important the Muslim community get involved ― so that Minnesota politicians can hear and understand the community’s concerns.

The meeting was nothing like what Sina described in his post.

Lohmer and Pugh did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Sina, when reached for comment, said he may have been referring to a different video, but declined to identify it.

Dave Sina's Facebook post on Scribd

His post has traveled widely across Facebook, including being shared by the Houston chapter of ACT for America, which has been identified as an anti-Muslim hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The comments section offers a litany of Islamophobic responses.

“Please share this! If you do not want your grand children wearing a burka in 20 years you need to show up,” wrote one internet user who included the Facebook Live link.

“NO MUSLIMS SHOULD EVER HOLD ANY CITY/STATE GOVERNMENT SEAT...PERIOD! Their Islamic ideology does not mesh with our American constitution & goes against American laws & western culture,” commented another.

A leading Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Jeff Johnson, defended the GOP lawmakers in a conservative podcast published Wednesday. “There are some here who are trying to change what America is. And we can’t allow that,” he claimed.

“The idea that American Muslims are a danger to America and are disingenuous about their role or their existence in the United States ― this is feeding off this anti-Muslim, white supremacist type of narrative,” Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told HuffPost.

CAIR-Minnesota called Sina’s Facebook post “a bigoted, conspiratorial and un-American reaction” and urged the local GOP to remove him as one of its officials.

Pugh has since told the Star Tribune that she doesn’t support what was in the Facebook post she shared. “I hoped to inspire Minnesotans to participate in the caucus process, in no way did I endorse what was written,” she told the paper.

And Jennifer Carnahan, the chairwoman of the Minnesota GOP, has declared that Muslims are welcome to participate in the Republican caucuses.

The training session that looked so fearful to Sina was nothing new. An Isaiah spokeswoman noted that her organization did over 50 trainings last month in churches and mosques. JaNaé Bates said that caucusing can be confusing and that her group tries to break the process down so that more people will feel empowered to participate.

In collaboration with Isaiah, the MAS Minnesota chapter has been hosting these kinds of sessions for over 14 years. Despite being held in a mosque, the workshop at issue was open to everyone.

“We want to help all citizens engage with the political process. To make a democracy vibrant, people need to engage,” Asad Zaman, an imam and executive director of MAS-Minnesota, told HuffPost.

The organization said it has trained over 300 Muslim leaders to be part of the political process.

“And we intend to do more,” Zaman said. “There is a particular base of Islamophobes that are particularly agitated by the idea that Muslims might acquire political influence. It is obvious from their statements that many of them would prefer [Muslims] not to have any level of political engagement in the American political process.”

There are approximately 150,000 Muslims in Minnesota, including many in the Twin Cities metro area. The community’s history in the state goes back at least to the early 1900s. This year alone, a record number of Muslim Americans are running for office nationwide, from school boards to Congress.

Reprimanding Sina is not enough, according to Zaman.

“I want all political parties, Democrats and Republicans, to come out clearly and unequivocally, to condemn this action,” he said. “Also, I would like both political parties to institute Islamophobia training to make sure that their caucus members do not behave in this nasty way.”EMILY’s List, the fundraising group that backs pro-abortion rights Democratic women, on Friday endorsed Illinois progressive Marie Newman’s campaign against Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress.

Support from EMILY’s List, a fundraising powerhouse closely aligned with Democratic Party leadership, gives Newman a major boost in her effort to unseat Lipinski in the March 20 primary.

“Throughout her career, Marie has worked to improve her community and advocate on behalf of children and families. Her record is unimpeachable,” Stephanie Schriock, EMILY’s List president, said in a statement that also criticized Lipinski.

“He has put women’s reproductive health care in jeopardy and sought to end protections against discrimination,” Schriock said. “This is not an acceptable way to govern ― and it’s certainly not what the people of Illinois’ 3rd District deserve.”

Primary challenges to incumbent Democratic members of Congress are exceedingly rare. Perhaps rarer, however, is a Democratic congressman with a history of voting for abortion restrictions. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) is likely the only other Democratic member of Congress who flat-out opposes abortion rights.

Newman already had the backing of NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Human Rights Campaign, a host of progressive groups, and Illinois Reps. Luis Gutiérrez and Jan Schakowsky (D).

But EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood Action Fund had yet to jump in the race. Planned Parenthood Action Fund told HuffPost on Friday that the group hasn’t yet announced its 2018 endorsements.

In addition to his abortion opposition, Lipinski has voted against a law banning discrimination against LGBT Americans in the workplace, and taken several conservative stances on immigration, including by voting against a 2010 version of the Dream Act. (Last summer, Lipinski co-sponsored a bill extending legal protection for undocumented immigrants who benefitted from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.)

Illinois’ 3rd District remains favorable territory for Lipinski. It encompasses southwestern suburbs of Chicago that skew more conservative than other parts of the metropolitan area.

A key advantage for Lipinski thus far has been support he retains from the district’s influential labor unions. AFSCME Council 31, which represents Illinois public employees, endorses Lipinski, with spokesman Anders Lindall noting the incumbent’s 100-percent rating on the union’s 2017 congressional scorecard and 95-percent lifetime rating.

But Lipinski’s union support may be weakening. The Intercept reported on Friday that SEIU plans to endorse Newman.All of your ’90s dreams have come true, friends: The Spice Girls have reunited (At least, for an afternoon).

After much speculation, everyone’s favorite pop band got back together for the first time in years, and the photos are adorable.

A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Feb 2, 2018 at 8:27am PST

Images that surfaced early Friday suggested that Melanie Brown aka Scary Spice, Melanie Chisholm aka Sporty Spice, Emma Bunton aka Baby Spice, and Victoria Beckham aka Posh Spice had made their way over to the London home of Geri Horner (formerly Halliwell) aka Ginger Spice. The Spice Girls’ former band manager Simon Fuller was also spotted en route to the home.

In addition to Victoria Beckham’s snap, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton shared a picture of the reunion on Twitter. Horner said it was “Lovely seeing the girls # girlpower is alive and well,” while Bunton, hinting of more to come, wrote, “Love my girls! Exciting!”

We CANNOT wait to see what comes from this reunion.

AdvertisementA van ran into a crowd of pedestrians in Shanghai on Friday morning, injuring more than a dozen people, according to local media reports.

The accident was caused by the van’s driver, who unintentionally set the inside of the vehicle on fire while smoking, according to the state-run People’s Daily. The news site noted that the driver was suspected of illegally moving hazardous goods.

17 pedestrians were hospitalized after the incident, which occurred in the city’s Huangpu District, according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN.

Reports say the van was driving toward a Starbucks on Nanjing Road West about 9 a.m. before it came to a stop at the coffee chain’s entrance after hitting several people. The storefront is near the People’s Park, which is in the center of the city, according to The New York Times.

A Starbucks spokeswoman told HuffPost that no one inside the coffee shop was injured and the location was not damaged by the vehicle. The store will remain closed while authorities investigate.

“We were saddened to hear about the accident that took place outside of our Store on Nanjing Road,” the spokeswoman said in an email. “Our heartfelt thoughts go out to those who were injured as a result of this incident. We are grateful no partners (employees) or store customers were injured and are focused on supporting them during this time.”

A local media outlet called The Paper initially reported that several people were inside the van and that it held several canisters of gas. But the article was removed and later replaced by a statement from the Shanghai government, possibly a signal that China’s media censors ordered it taken down, Reuters reported.

Graphic video of the scene was shared on social media, showing several people lying on the ground and the vehicle in flames as firefighters worked to quell the blaze.Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, son of Cuba's President Fidel Castro, talks to Argentine human right activist and member of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo group Hebe de Bonafini during the inauguration of the International Book Fair in Havana February 8, 2007.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The eldest son of late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, committed suicide on Thursday aged 68 after being treated for months for depression, Cuban state-run media reported.

The nuclear scientist, also known as “Fidelito”, or Little Fidel, because of how much he looked like his father, had initially been hospitalized and then continued treatment as an outpatient.

“Castro Diaz-Balart, who had been attended by a group of doctors for several months due to a state of profound depression, committed suicide this morning,” Cubadebate website said.

Fidelito, who had the highest public profile of all Castro’s children, was born in 1949 out of his brief marriage to Mirta Diaz-Balart before he went on to topple a U.S.-backed dictator and build a communist-run state on the doorstep of the United States during the Cold War.

Through his mother, Castro Diaz-Balart was the cousin of some of Castro’s most bitter enemies in the Cuban American exile community, U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and former U.S. congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart.

He was also the subject of a dramatic custody dispute between the two families as a child.

Cuba scholars say his mother took him with her to the United States when he was aged five after announcing she wanted a divorce from Castro, while he was imprisoned for an attack on the Moncada military barracks in Santiago.

Castro was able to bring Fidelito back to Cuba after the 1959 revolution.

A multilingual nuclear physicist who studied in the former Soviet Union, Castro Diaz-Balart was head of Cuba’s national nuclear program from 1980 to 1992, and spearheaded the development of a nuclear plant on the Caribbean’s largest island until his father fired him.

Cuba halted its plant plans that same year because of a lack of funding after the collapse of Cuba’s trade and aid ties with the ex-Soviet bloc and he largely disappeared from public view appearing at the occasional scientific conference or diplomatic event.

Fidelito had been working for his uncle President Raul Castro as a scientific counselor to the Cuban Council of State and Vice-president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences at the time of his death.

A former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said Castro Diaz-Balart had seemed “thoughtful, rather curious about the world beyond Cuba” at a dinner in Boston two years ago.

“But he seemed a bit weary about having to be a Castro, rather than himself,” Hare said.

Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a Cuba expert at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said Fidelito had provided him with invaluable help in the 1990s while he was writing a book on Cuba’s nuclear program.

In 2000 they met again at a conference in Moscow and Fidelito worked “the room full of international nonproliferation experts, diplomats and journalists with aplomb, speaking no less than four languages -Spanish, English, Russian and French.”

Benjamin-Alvarado said he suspected Fidelito’s title as scientific advisor was largely ceremonial as his views on energy development were not incorporated into national policies.

“He had written extensively on Cuba’s need for developing renewable energy resources,” Benjamin-Alvarado said. “And yet almost all efforts by the Cuban government were geared to maintaining the status quo of oil dependency.”

“I imagine that was disappointing for him.”

Fidelito’s death came just over a year after that of his father on Nov. 25, 2016, aged 90.Video footage posted to social media on Thursday night showed the wallaby swimming strongly in the water far offshore.

Survivors told aid workers that most of the migrants on board were Pakistanis, who form a growing group heading to Italy from North Africa, IOM spokeswoman Olivia Headon said.

“They have given an estimate of 90 people who drowned during the capsize, but we still need to verify the exact number of people who lost their lives during the tragedy,” Headon, speaking from Tunis, told a Geneva news briefing.

“What has been reported to us is that it’s mostly Pakistanis who were on board the boat, but we still need to verify the nationalities and how many from what country,” she said.

Ten bodies have washed up on Libyan shores, two of them known to be Libyans and eight Pakistanis, she said.

“I believe the Libyan coastguard is looking for other survivors off the coast,” Headon added.

Another IOM spokesman, Leonard Doyle, told Reuters Television that the boat was believed to have left shore on Thursday before capsizing early on Friday morning.

LIBYA CLAMPS DOWN

Earlier security officials in the western Libyan town of Zuwara said two Libyans and one Pakistani had been rescued from the boat. They said 10 bodies had been recovered, mostly Pakistani, but gave no further information.

Zuwara, located near Libya’s border with Tunisia, was a favored site for migrant boat departures over the past two years but of late has seen only occasional departures. A statement from the Zuwara coastguard said their initial information suggested there were some 90 people on board.

Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities - under pressure from Italy and the European Union - have begun to block departures.

More than 600,000 people are believed to have made the journey from Libya to Italy over the past four years.

Prior to Friday’s incident, some 6,624 migrants are believed to have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year and a further 246 have died, according to IOM figures.

The Libyan coastguard, which receives EU funding and training, has become more assertive in recent months in intercepting migrants and bringing them back to Libya.

Activists have criticized the policy, saying migrants often face extreme hardship and abuse in Libya, including forced labor, according to Human Rights Watch and other rights groups.

Migrants who are caught trying to cross to Italy are put in severely overcrowded detention centers authorized by the interior ministry.Darren Osborne, who has been convicted of murder and attempted murder after he carried out an attack outside Finsbury Park Mosque in London, is seen in an undated photo supplied by Metropolitan Police on February 1.

A British man found guilty of murder after he drove a van into Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque last June, leaving one dead and injuring many more, was jailed for life on Friday and told he would serve at least 43 years behind bars.

Darren Osborne became obsessed with Muslims after watching a BBC TV drama about a child sex abuse scandal involving British Pakistani men and just weeks later carried out the attack in Finsbury Park, north London.

The 48-year-old killed Makram Ali, 51, and injured 12 others, two seriously. He was found guilty on Thursday of murder and attempted murder after the jury took less than an hour to reach their verdict.

“This was a terrorist attack - over the space of a month or so your mind-set became one of malevolent hatred,” said judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, sentencing him at London’s Woolwich Crown Court. She said he would pose a risk to the public “perhaps for the rest of your life”.

On June 18 last year, Osborne drove up from the Welsh capital Cardiff to central London in a hired van with the intent of attacking a pro-Palestinian march. He told the jury he had wanted to kill socialist opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London’s Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan.

Thwarted by road closures, he sought out other targets, eventually arriving hours later in FinsburyPark where he came across a group of Muslims tending to Ali who had collapsed in the street near his home after attending Ramadan prayers.

Shortly after midnight, he drove at them, killing Ali. He later told the court he had tried to kill as many as possible.

“Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful and we cannot imagine the trauma he felt in the last few minutes,” said Ruzina Akhtar, one of Bangladeshi-born Ali’s six children.

Authorities said it was the fourth deadly terrorism incident in Britain last year, following three Islamist attacks which killed 35 people.

Those attacks had helped fuel the anger of Osborne, an unemployed father-of-four who had 102 criminal convictions and a history of violence, depression, drug and alcohol abuse. He had no fixed home and spent the night before the attack in a tent in his ex-partner’s back garden.Poland is poised to enact a bill that would impose up to three years of jail time on anyone who uses phrases such as “Polish death camps” to refer to the Nazi concentration camps located in the country during the Holocaust.

The bill was approved by the Polish Senate on Thursday. President Andrzej Duda has 21 days to decide whether it should be signed into law.

The move seeks to punish those who suggest that Poland was complicit in the atrocities that Nazis wreaked on its soil during World War II. It has the backing of Poland’s ruling right-wing and nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), according to Reuters.

ADL’s National Director Jonathan Greenblatt said that “there’s no doubt Poland was a victim of the Nazis and their brutal occupation.” However, Greenblatt feared that silencing free speech about Poles’ involvement with the Holocaust would hurt survivors and their families.

“We understand and sympathize with Poland’s frustration at the use of the term ‘Polish Death Camps,’ but this law goes well beyond that issue,” Greenblatt said in a statement. “It raises the possibility that anyone offering Holocaust survivor testimony about actions by individual Poles could be charged with a crime. This is unacceptable and could silence the voices of survivors and their families.”

Duda on Monday pushed back against international criticisms of the law. “We, [Poland] as a state, as a nation, have a right to defend ourselves from an evident slander, an evident falsification of historical truth, which, in this case, for us is a slap in the face,” he said according to The New York Times.

Both the Israeli and U.S. governments have expressed concerns over the bill. Emmanuel Nahshon, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said on Twitter that Israel views with “utmost gravity any attempt to challenge historical truth” about the Holocaust.

Israel opposes categorically the Polish Senate decision. Israel views with utmost gravity any attempt to challenge historical truth. No law will change the facts . — Emmanuel Nahshon (@EmmanuelNahshon) February 1, 2018

Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust remembrance center, said in a statement on Thursday that the term “Polish death camps” is erroneous, since the extermination camps were built and operated by Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland. But leaders at Yad Vashem believe Poland’s bill is “liable to blur historical truths.”

“The correct way to combat these historical misrepresentations is not by criminalizing these statements but by reinforcing educational activities,” the organization said. The Polish bill, it continued, “jeopardizes the free and open discussion of the part of the Polish people in the persecution of the Jews at the time.”

Before Germany invaded Poland during the war, the country was home to Europe’s largest Jewish population. As part of Adolf Hitler’s plan to exterminate the Jewish people, Nazis built and operated several concentration camps in Poland, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.

More than three million Polish Jews ― about 90 percent of the country’s Jewish population ― were murdered during the Holocaust. According to The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), Nazi forces called upon Polish police and railroad personnel to help guard Jewish ghettos and deport people to death camps. Individual Poles also reportedly helped identify and hunt down Jewish families who were in hiding, or plundered Jewish property.

But thousands of Poles also chose to help Jewish families. Yad Vashem has recognized over 6,600 non-Jewish Poles with the distinction “Righteous Among the Nations” for risking their lives to save Jewish neighbors.

The Nazis’ ideology also deemed Poles as racially inferior, according to the USHMM. Nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians, including politicians, intellectuals, and Catholic priests, were killed by the Nazis, while millions of others were imprisoned or deported as forced laborers.

The USHMM expressed concern over Polish lawmakers’ plans to make it illegal to refer to the complicity of some Poles during the Nazi occupation.Muslim protesters hold an anti-LGBTQ rally outside a mosque in Indonesia's Aceh province. Antara Foto Agency / Reuters

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia’s national police chief has ordered an investigation into the detention of 12 transgender women in the province of Aceh, officials said on Friday, after reports that they were stripped, beaten and forced to cut their hair before being released without charge.

Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.

Religious police and vigilantes in the ultra-conservative province often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.

Police in North Aceh raided hair salons - where transgender people often work - last weekend and briefly detained 12 individuals. Rights activists and media reports said they were forced to cut their hair and were stripped and beaten.

“There were photos circulated that led us to suspect that there had been physical action taken against the suspects,” Misbahul Munauwar, a spokesman for Aceh police, said. “The national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.”

A national police spokesman confirmed that police chief Tito Karnavian had ordered the investigation.

Human Rights Watch and other rights groups welcomed the move, which comes amid a rising tide of hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.

Police in Aceh and elsewhere have stepped up raids on what they call “gay spas” and “gay sex parties” in recent months, detaining people on charges of violating strict anti-pornography laws.

Dozens of protesters on Friday staged an anti-LGBT rally outside a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.

“We don’t hate gay, bisexual or transgender people. What we hate is their actions, and if we can prove their actions, they will be punished,” Aceh governor Irwandi Yusuf told the small crowd.

Last year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in Aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.

Indonesia’s parliament is also drafting revisions to the national criminal code that could ban all consensual sex outside marriage.

The parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by Reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated.One of President Donald Trump’s top foreign policy priorities became a reality on Monday as the U.S. embassy in Israel officially relocated to Jerusalem, while only a few miles away in Gaza, Israeli forces killed dozens of Palestinian protesters and wounded hundreds more.

The embassy move marks one of Trump’s most controversial and momentous foreign policy decisions to date ― both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem, but Israel has controlled the city since 1967. Although past presidents contemplated moving the American embassy out of Tel Aviv, Trump has been the first to act on it, declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel in December.

A 250-person U.S. delegation, consisting of presidential advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, and some evangelical pastors and Republican politicians, traveled to Israel to commemorate the opening.

“Our greatest hope is for peace,” said Trump, addressing the audience via a video recording from the White House. “The United States remains fully committed to a lasting peace agreement and we continue to support the status quo at Jerusalem’s holy sites.”

He extended a “hand in friendship” to the Israelis, the Palestinians and all of their neighbors.

The president also tweeted about the event Monday morning.

Big day for Israel. Congratulations! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018

Kushner, whom Trump tapped to lead Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, hailed the embassy move as an opportunity for all sides to coexist peacefully.

“We believe, it is possible for both sides to gain more than they give ― so that all people can live in peace ― safe from danger, free from fear, and able to pursue their dreams,” he said in a speech.

While attendees toasted the historic opening, thousands of protesters clashed with Israeli forces in Gaza. At least 40 Palestinian protesters were killed and hundreds more were injured, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Groups of protesters also marched from the West Bank into Jerusalem in the hours preceding the ceremony.

The protests represent the culmination of six weeks of deadly demonstrations along the Gaza border as Palestinians demand a right of return to their land.

Kushner referred to those “provoking violence” as being “part of the problem and not part of the solution.”

White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters at a Monday press briefing that the blame for the deadly protests lies with Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.

“The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas,” Shah said. “Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response and, as the secretary of state said, Israel has a right to defend itself.”

Widespread international condemnation is expected following the embassy opening. Most United Nations members don’t recognize Israel’s sovereignty over East Jerusalem, arguing instead that the city should possess international status. For decades, U.S. policy has stated that Israelis and Palestinians should negotiate the city’s status among themselves, and the status of the city is key in peace negotiations.TOP STORIES

As a member of the New York State Senate wrestles with sexual misconduct allegations, new policy guidelines for reporting sexual harassment have some senators worried that they will discourage victims from coming forward.

A four-page policy letter was given to members of the Senate staff Monday by the Republican-controlled chamber, outlining updates to its 2007 sexual harassment policy. The letter lists types of inappropriate behavior to report and promises no retaliation for those who come forward. But it also comes with a warning: Those who report a false statement against the accused will face punishment.

If “the investigator determines that any employee has knowingly made false accusations or provided false statements during the investigation, he or she may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination,” the policy reads.

It’s unclear how the investigator would determine if an alleged victim was lying.

Senate Democratic Conference leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is the only female leader in either chamber of the Legislature. She said she was never consulted about the updated policy.

“To emphasize the punishment for filing a false report while not emphasizing the seriousness of sexual harassment is exactly the type of intimidation that has silenced so many through the years and encourages perpetrators to attack accusers,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “I am disappointed I was not included in the development of this policy, which is proof the Senate Leadership is not serious about combating sexual harassment.”

What’s more, the new policy never states that an investigation will be handled independently. Instead, it is the Senate personnel officer who will ultimately determine the outcome. Democratic Sen. Liz Krueger said the investigations must be conducted outside the influence of the majority counsel.

“How can a victim be confident that he or she received a fair investigation when the result is decided by political appointees who are inherently biased, and have already demonstrated their inability to address these issues?” Krueger said in a statement provided to HuffPost.

The new policy comes just weeks after Erica Vladimer, a former staffer, accused Independent Democratic Conference leader Sen. Jeff Klein of forcibly kissing her outside a bar in 2015.

During the incident, Vladimer said Klein put “a hand on the back of my head and he shoved his tongue down my throat.” Klein has denied the allegation, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo has requested an investigation into the senator’s alleged misconduct following HuffPost’s report. Klein has also requested an independent investigation take place.

Vladimer said the updated sexual harassment policy doesn’t do enough to support victims.

“There is no process that’s laid out,” Vladimer told HuffPost. “And the little process that is laid out is internal. There is no independent investigator, and the only power they give the investigator is to decide if the victim is lying. If you want to talk about scaring men and women who have experienced sexual harassment and assault into staying quiet, that’s how it’s going to happen.”

One thing that is clear to me after reading the Senate’s “new” policy, which still contains so many of the tired old tropes of victim shaming and intimidation, is that power and its retention remain the main prerogative of those empowered to fundamentally change the system. — Erica Vladimer (@EricaArden) January 31, 2018

The new policy gives the alleged victim and the accused just 15 days to appeal to Senate lawyers after a conclusion has been made, a time frame Vladimer said is “arbitrary.” By comparison, the State Assembly’s policy on sexual harassment allows appeals to be made for up to 30 days following the completion of an investigation.

It’s unclear what specific Senate members drafted the new policy within the Republican majority counsel. Also unclear is why the new policy lists a date of Jan. 2 at the bottom of every page even though the policy was not officially released to Senate members until Jan. 29, 20 days after HuffPost published its article on Klein.

Calls to Personnel Officer Dawn Harrington and Secretary of the Senate Frank Patience ― who are named as being involved in the policy construction ― went unreturned. But Senate Republican Leader John Flanagan’s office told NBC New York that he ordered a review of the policy months ago and sought input from female Republican lawmakers.Humane Society CEO Wayne Pacelle at home with his cat Zoe in Chevy Chase, Maryland, on August 31, 2016.

Seven Humane Society of the U.S. board members resigned to protest a decision to keep CEO Wayne Pacelle despite an internal investigation into sexual harassment complaints and settlements to cover them up, The Washington Post reported.

The resignations followed a vote by the nonprofit’s 31-member board on Thursday to keep Pacelle in his job, according to the Post.

Pacelle was the focus of a damning report compiled last month by a law firm hired by the Humane Society detailing three women’s complaints that the CEO sexually harassed them, including a former employee who said Pacelle asked to masturbate in front of her in 2006.

The charity offered settlements to three additional women who were “demoted or dismissed” after speaking up about Pacelle’s behavior, the Post reported, citing a summary of the law firm’s findings. Senior women in the organization reportedly warned Pacelle that sexual relationships with subordinates, as well as with donors and volunteers, jeopardized the charity.

Pacelle denied the allegations, telling the Post they were a “coordinated attempt to attack me and the organization.”

No board members commented on the meeting’s outcome, according to the newspaper. One of the women whose complaint was part of the investigation expressed disappointment.

“To have at our helm an individual that has abused his power is a tragedy,” said Reasa Haggard Currier. “I don’t care if I get fired for saying that.”

Several donors had called for Pacelle’s ouster, and one, Greenbaum Foundation’s Jim Greenbaum, said he wouldn’t be renewing his Humane Society donation.

Pacelle, meanwhile, said no donors told him they would withdraw their funding.
