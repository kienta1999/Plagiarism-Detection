The office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) confirmed to The Hill on Sunday that the congressman plans to donate funds he received in 2016 from a group linked to casino mogul Steve Wynn.

Wynn, who resigned Saturday as the Republican National Committee’s finance chair, was accused of sexual harassment and misconduct spanning several decades in a bombshell Wall Street Journal report published Friday. Wynn vehemently denies the allegations.

Since the claims were made public, Democrats have called for the RNC and members of the GOP to give back money donated and raised by the Las Vegas casino owner. Republicans reacted similarly when film producer and major Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein was accused last year of rape, sexual misconduct and harassment.

Ryan’s office confirmed that the speaker received a $1,000 donation in 2016 from Wynn Resorts Limited Initiative for Public Policy. Ryan will give the funds to a local charity, according to The Hill.

Earlier over the weekend, Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.), who won a special election in June, said she’d donated the $2,700 in campaign funds she received from Wynn. According to Time, a spokesperson for Handel said the funds went to a nonprofit organization focused on helping survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse.

The RNC has not commented on whether the organization will return the funds donated by Wynn, but Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that the group should do so if the accusations “have merit.”

“If it’s ― you know, the allegations have merit, then we should return the money like we asked of the Democrats,” Graham said on ABC’s “This Week.”Logic sent a powerful message of solidarity to women at the Grammy Awards on Sunday.

At the end of the performance, Logic spoke to the audience and touched upon the themes of the “Time’s Up” anti-harassment initiative.

“Black is beautiful, hate is ugly,” he said. “Women are as precious as they are stronger than any man I have ever met. And unto them, I say stand tall and crush all predators under the weight of your heart that is full of the love they will never take away from you. Be not scared to use your voice, especially in instances like these when you have the opportunity.”

The performance of “1-800-273-8255” came after the Grammy’s in memoriam segment ended with a photo of Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington, who died by suicide in July. People who had either lost loves ones to suicide or had attempted suicide themselves joined the three artists on stage, and wore shirts featuring the phrase “You are not alone” and the phone number of the suicide prevention lifeline.

Logic, who was born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, told music site Genius in April that conversations with fans had inspired him to write a song about suicide prevention.

“[Fans had] said things like, ‘Yo, your music has saved my life. You’ve saved my life,’” the artist said. “And I was always like, ‘Aw, so nice of you. Thanks.’ And I’d give them a hug and shit but in my mind, I’m like, ‘What the fuck?’ And they’re really serious. ... I was like, ‘Man, I wasn’t even trying to save nobody’s life.’”

“And then it hit me, the power that I have as an artist with a voice,” he added. “I wasn’t even trying to save your life. Now what can happen if I actually did?”

The rapper also said the song’s first hook and verse is sung from the perspective of someone calling the suicide prevention hotline.

It appears the lyrics have motivated some people seek help.

The day the song was released in April, the lifeline received what was then its second-highest number of calls ― over 4,573. The day after Logic performed the song at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, the lifeline received 5,041 calls. That performance also featured people wearing T-shirts with the hotline number on them.

The song’s Grammy-nominated music video, which tells the story of a black teen coming to terms with his sexuality while being rejected by his family and peers, also made a significant impact. Calls to the lifeline went up between 30 percent and 50 percent after the video went viral in August, according to the suicide prevention line’s director, John Draper.

“That’s thousands of callers who otherwise wouldn’t have called,” Draper told the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. “Messages like Logic’s, where he says, ‘I’m thinking about suicide, but I want to get help’ ... are a very positive model.”

In November, Logic tweeted statistics from the lifeline on the song’s impact.

Logic performed “1-800-273-8255” at the Latin Grammys in November with Cara and Colombian singer Juanes. The three artists sang a bilingual rendition of the single and promoted the lifeline’s Spanish-language hotline: 1-888-628-9454.

The 25-year-old actor and daughter of the late Carrie Fisher posted a photo of her hugging her mom with the caption, “This one goes out to anyone having a less than perfect Mother’s Day today. We are not alone. Sending all my love and strength to anyone who needs it.”

A post shared by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on May 13, 2018 at 12:11pm PDT

Fisher died in December 2016 at age 60. She suffered a cardiac medical emergency on a flight from London to Los Angeles. She was immediately hospitalized and died less than a week later. Her mother, Debbie Reynolds, had a stroke one day later and died.

Lourd has posted tributes to her mom and grandmother since their deaths. Nearly one year after Fisher died, Lourd traveled to Norway to see the Northern Lights, a trip she always wanted to make with her mom.

PREVIOUSLY:

MGM has acquired rights to develop an Aretha Franklin biopic and signed Jennifer Hudson to portray Franklin in the untitled project.

Scott Bernstein (“Straight Outta Compton”) and music producer Harvey Mason are attached as producers. Mason was a producer on the “Sing” and “Pitch Perfect 2” soundtracks.

The casting of Hudson — who won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress in “Dreamgirls” — was unveiled by Clive Davis at his Saturday night pre-Grammy party. He said that Franklin had personally selected Hudson for the role in the biopic.

The event included performances by Barry Manilow, Luis Fonsi, Ben Platt, Alicia Keys, Khalid and Logic. Hudson concluded the performance by delivering a medley of Franklin’s hits including “Think,” “Rock Steady,” and “(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman.”

Franklin has won 17 Grammy Awards, starting with “Respect” in 1968 and “Chain of Fools” in 1969. She was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama, who said of Franklin, “Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R&B, rock and roll — the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope”.

Hudson’s credits include “Sex and the City” “The Secret Life of Bees” and Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq.” She can next be seen in “Monster” alongside Jeffrey Wright, Jennifer Ehle and Timothy Blake Nelson. She also served as a season 13 coach on NBC’s “The Voice.” News about MGM coming on board was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.

“Tonight, in this room full of dreamers, we remember that this country was built by dreamers, for dreamers, chasing the American dream,” Cabello told the audience.

At least eight members of Congress plan to bring sexual assault survivors or activists to the State of the Union address Tuesday night.

Many of these lawmakers said the Me Too movement, which has shed light on sexual harassment and other gender-based misconduct across various industries, had inspired them to invite their guests.

“I have never seen such an extraordinary opportunity to change the culture of society in my lifetime,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. “I will use every opportunity to underscore how important it is for us to stay on this issue and clean up the mess that has been impacting women in the workforce for decades.”

Others said they hoped to remind viewers that at least 21 women have accused President Donald Trump of sexual harassment or assault.

In addition to Speier, Reps. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Susan Davis (D-Calif.) and Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) have invited activists or survivors to join them at the State of the Union. Several female Democratic lawmakers also plan to wear black Tuesday night to show support for movements protesting sexual harassment and assault.

Speier said she’s bringing Travis Moore, who advocates to Congress on behalf of survivors of sexual harassment and violence.

“I hope [Travis’ presence] sends a strong message to survivors that we believe them, we respect them and we are going to take action against persons who engage in sexual harassment in the workplace and hold them accountable for their conduct,” Speier said.

Coleman is to be accompanied by Rose Gunter, niece of the late Recy Taylor. Taylor was a black woman who reported six white men for gang-raping her in 1944.

I am excited to announce that I have the honor of bringing Rose Gunter, niece of Recy Taylor, as my guest to #SOTU. Her aunt's legacy lives on through the many women and allies who are advancing the transformative #MeToo and #TimesUp movements in this country. — Bonnie WatsonColeman (@RepBonnie) January 26, 2018

Recy Taylor represents the voice of many marginalized women who have spoken up, spoken out and have long been ignored. The transformative movement that’s happening in this country must include amplifying the voices of victims that we, in some cases, chose not to hear. — Bonnie WatsonColeman (@RepBonnie) January 26, 2018

Lawrence plans to bring Danielle McGuire, whose 2011 book, At The Dark End Of The Street: Black Women, Rape, And Resistance, told the story of Taylor’s life and legacy. Coleman, Lawrence and some of their colleagues have said they will wear red “Recy” pins during the address.

Frankel has invited Laura Germino, an anti-trafficking activist and co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a human rights organization that promotes safe and fair conditions for farmworkers.

“Our path may be long and sometimes challenging, but with commitment and collaboration, we can convert the #MeToo moment into a movement.” - Laura Germino, activist accompanying Rep. Frankel to the State of the Union

Germino said she will wear black to the State of the Union.

“I represent not myself, but what we can all achieve when we work together. I carry the message that it’s real, it can be done,” Germino said. “Because one more victim is too much, when there’s a proven way to put a stop to harassment. Our path may be long and sometimes challenging, but with commitment and collaboration, we can convert the #MeToo moment into a movement.”

The seasoned activist said it’s time to focus on ending workplace harassment.

“It’s all the more outrageous that women ― and men ― continue to suffer sexual abuse in the workplace when it’s proven highly preventable,” Germino said. “The solution is here, and now: It’s past time for corporations and industries to ensure that all employees — women and men ― are protected. We’ve had inquiries from dairy, janitorial and construction workers, Olympic Committee members, the entertainment and fashion sectors ― the model is only confined now by the will to implement it. What we are truly talking about is #MeTooNoMore.”

Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victims Advocates, will join Quigley on Tuesday; Kuster has invited Chessy Prout, a high school sexual assault survivor.

“I’ve been inspired by the incredible strength and courage of Chessy as she has grown into a strong advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual assault and harassment,” Kuster said in a press release. “The conversation about sexual harassment and assault in our nation is long overdue, but through the efforts of Chessy and the #MeToo movement it is finally gaining steam.”

Speier said she wasn’t very hopeful about how Trump would respond to seeing these guests at the State of the Union.

“I don’t know that we can send any message to President Trump. I think that he will recognize how serious all of us are to changing the culture in Congress and in the private sector,” she said. “We know there are issues that occur in the executive branch, but the degree to which they are handled appropriately is not something that we have been as successful in dealing with. But I intend to make that a high priority moving forward.”

Other activists, including #MeToo creator Tarana Burke and National Domestic Workers Alliance Executive Director Ai-jen Poo, are hosting an “alternative event” on Tuesday called “State of Our Union.”

“It’s now time for action and solutions ― on everything from sexual assault and harassment to low wages and pay equity, from elder care and childcare to paid family leave,” Poo said in a press release. “There is nothing more powerful than women coming together and demanding change, and that is exactly what we plan to do.”Mike Ehrmann via Getty Images

Note to Pink: When you perform the national anthem at the Super Bowl next Sunday, be prepared for rough criticism.

Viewers checked Brett Young hard against the boards after his rendition at the NHL All-Star Game in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday. We didn’t think his performance was that bad. But people on Twitter sure did.

Now you judge.

The complaints about pace appear to be especially harsh. Yahoo pointed out that the rendition clocked in at about 1 minute, 50 seconds (we got 1:40-ish), well short of Alicia Keys’ 2:36 performance at the 2013 Super Bowl.

As for quality, Roseanne Barr made sure the bar will remain forever low with her 1990 version at a baseball game.

Chin up, Brett Young.

It’s a really moving performance.”Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen's retirement could set off a race for the top spot on the Appropriations Committee. Bill Clark via Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a 12-term Republican from New Jersey and chairman of the most sought-after committee in Congress ― the Appropriations Committee ― announced Monday that he would not run for re-election.

Frelinghuysen’s announcement was a bit of surprise, considering he could still serve as the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee for another four years under House GOP rules. But faced with the prospect of a tough race ― Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in that district by only 1 point in 2016 ― as well as internal discussions about removing Frelinghuysen as chairman after he voted against the party’s tax bill, the 71-year-old GOP moderate decided to call it quits.

“I have worked in a bipartisan manner, not just in times of crisis but always, because I believe it best serves my constituents, my state and our country,” Frelinghuysen said in a long statement that called on others to take up public service. “My father reminded me often that we are temporary stewards of the public trust. I have sincerely endeavored to earn that trust every day and I thank my constituents and my home state of New Jersey for the honor to serve and I will continue to do so to the best of my abilities through the end of my term.”

Frelinghuysen is political royalty in New Jersey, as his father also represented the state in Congress for more than 20 years. The two are also descendants of Frederick Frelinghuysen, who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

But as well-known as he was in New Jersey, Rodney Frelinghuysen would have been battling a difficult political climate. Frelinghuysen was a key vote for the GOP Obamacare repeal in the House, though he initially helped sink the first repeal attempt when he came out against it, and he was unable to significantly change the GOP tax bill, which would raise taxes on a number of his constituents by scaling back deductions on state and local taxes.

Frelinghuysen’s decision is yet another bad electoral sign for Republicans, as there are now twice as many open seats currently held by Republicans as there are by Democrats. The announcement already prompted the Cook Political Report to change its rating of the district on Monday from “Lean Republican” to “Toss Up.”“There are much easier ways to get surgery covered than enlisting in the military, [facing] the possibility of deployment, and dealing with the stigma of being a transgender service member,” she said.

“Every one of us who raises our right hand is prepared to give everything in the defense of our country.”President Donald Trump has said that, yes, he sometimes opens his phone and tweets while in bed.

“Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever, but generally speaking during the early morning, or during the evening I can do whatever,” Trump said during an interview with Piers Morgan on ITV, the British television channel, before continuing: “But I am very busy during the day, very long hours. I am busy.”

The president made the revelation in a sweeping discussion with Morgan that aired on Sunday. Regarding social media, Trump did note that he “will sometimes just dictate out something really quickly and give it to one of my people to put it on” social media but said he often writes the messages himself.

He also said he viewed Twitter as a means to “defend himself.”

“I get a lot of fake news, a lot of news that is very false or made up,” Trump told Morgan.

The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman noted that when the outlet first reported that Trump often took to the Twitterverse “propped on his pillow” late last year, the president was furious, “almost as angry as the fact-check about his 4-8 hours of TV a day,” she said.

Trump has routinely defended his use of Twitter as a means to reach his supporters directly, saying the venue is “unfiltered” by the media.

Twitter has long faced a backlash from users who have accused the president of using the outlet to undermine national security, including a moment earlier this year when Trump boasted that he had a “nuclear button” that was “bigger” and “more powerful” than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The company said it wouldn’t block world leaders like Trump, saying such individuals “play a critical role” in the global conversation “because of their outsized impacts on our society.”Victoria Anthony campaigned on social media in the weeks leading up to a May 12 Pink concert using the hashtag #VicAndPink. The 12-year-old aspiring singer hoped to join Pink on stage for a song.

The campaign gained steam after being picked up by Canadian news outlets. Even singer Sarah McLachlan made a plea to Pink.

She didn’t get on stage during the concert, but Pink picked her out of the crowd at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, apparently recognizing Anthony from all the attention the social media campaign had received.

“Are you who I read about on the news?” Pink asked Anthony. “Do you want to come sing something?”

Anthony belted out Pink’s “Perfect” in front of a stadium of thousands, and the artist was clearly taken back by the girl’s passion.Whoever printed out the tickets for Donald Trump’s first State of the Union speech must be feeling very “covfefe” right now.

The decision has the support of the MLB, which has urged the team to decrease its use of the logo in recent years. Notably, the logo won’t be going away entirely. The ban extends only to on-field displays, meaning Chief Wahoo will still be a fixture on merchandise that’s available throughout northern Ohio.

“Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game,” MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said in a statement Monday.

“Over the past year, we encouraged dialogue with the Indian’s organization about the Club’s use of the Chief Wahoo logo. During our constructive conversations, [team owner] Paul Dolan made clear that there are fans who have a longstanding attachment to the logo and its place in the history of the team,” Manfred continued. “Nonetheless, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use … and I appreciate Mr. Dona’s acknowledgement that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course.”

Manfred acknowledged the logo’s deeply problematic nature in April 2017, when the league awarded the 2019 All-Star Game to the Indians, and in related meetings pressured the team to “transition away from the Chief Wahoo logo,” MLB spokesman Pat Courtney said.

At the time, Bob DiBiasio, the Indians’ senior vice president of public affairs, indicated the team would be receptive to a future change.

“We certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo ― those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a long-standing attachment to its place in the history of the team,” he said in a statement.

“We fully expect to work with the Commissioner throughout the remainder of this season on finding a solution that is good for the game and our organization.”

The long-simmering issue escalated in the fall of 2016 during the American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Indians, when an indigenous Canadian filed suit, seeking to prevent the logo from being used during games in Ontario.

“Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots.” - Change the Mascot campaign

The Change the Mascot campaign, a group that has long opposed the offensive logo, welcomed the Indians’ decision as a recognition “that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots.”

The group used the news to once again revive calls for the Washington football team to take similar action.

“For too long, people of color have been stereotyped with these kinds of hurtful symbols ― and no symbol is more hurtful than the football team in the nation’s capital using a dictionary-defined racial slur as its team name,” Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, the group’s leader, said in an emailed statement.

“Cleveland’s decision should finally compel the Washington football team to make the same honorable decision,” Halbritter continued. “Washington Owner Dan Snyder needs to look at Cleveland’s move and then look in the mirror and ask whether he wants to be forever known as the most famous purveyor of bigotry in modern sports, or if he wants to finally stand on the right side of history and change his team’s name.

“We hope he chooses the latter.”

The NFL team didn’t respond to a request for comment.By Kevin O’Keeffe

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a cliché for a reason: It’s true. Too often, TV creators are eager to tinker with success and lose the plot in the process. In season two of “Scandal,” Shonda Rhimes’ love of “Alias” and her audience’s frenzied reaction to the Defiance arc led her to add the overly complicated B613 story. Ryan Murphy never met a monkey wrench he didn’t love to throw into Glee’s storylines. Sometimes, it works; often, it screws up what was working before.

So there’s something to be said for “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars”’ season three premiere sticking to the status quo. “All Stars” season two was an enormous success for Logo and VH1, so it makes sense that the latter network, which now airs “All Stars” exclusively, would want to keep things the same. And yet it’s somewhat disarming to watch the 10 queens of “All Stars” season three follow the path set for them by their predecessors so exactly. They enter the workroom, participate in the Reading Is Fundamental challenge (which season six standout BenDeLaCreme wins, somewhat suspiciously), compete in a talent show main challenge, and then the top two lip sync for their legacy. It’s almost like a reenactment of “All Stars” season two, it’s so exact in its sameness.

Again, “All Stars” wasn’t broke, so it didn’t need fixing. But a spruce would be nice.

This feeling that we’ve been here before is my only quibble with “All Stars”’ killer premiere, which reintroduces us to nine of the finest, scrappiest queens to compete from seasons two through nine. Morgan McMichaels and Shangela represent the show’s early seasons, while Milk joins Ben from season six. Throw in Trixie Mattel and Kennedy Davenport from season seven, Chi Chi DeVayne and Thorgy Thor from season eight, and Aja from season nine, and you’ve got a crew of cutthroat, hilarious queens.

But of course, I said 10 queens, and therein lies our spruce: The 10th queen is former winner Bebe Zahara Benet. Because she won the first season, which was of a very different quality level (Ru pokes fun at the Vaseline filter and the “measly” $20,000 grand prize), she’s getting another chance at the crown. To her credit, she does not seem to be resting on her laurels; she acknowledges the other queens can teach her a lot, and she’s ready to compete.

Bebe is the big twist of the premiere, and she’s an effective one. The season one champion is mostly unknown to “Drag Race”’s audience because her season remains frustratingly unavailable to find online. (Even on iTunes and Amazon, where you can purchase every other season, it’s unavailable.) Logo occasionally re-airs it in full as “The Lost Season,” but those marathons are few and far between.

So here we have, in the middle of an “All Stars” season, a queen who has something all the others do not — the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar — and yet is easily the most unknown of the 10. She’s a wild card. As a huge Bebe fan, I’m stoked to see how she performs this season, but am mostly fascinated to see how the fanbase reacts to her.

Bebe doesn’t win the reading challenge, but she easily wins the unofficial battle of who has the best entrance look. Her gown-and-cape combo gives her an elegance that far outclasses her competitors, who are mostly pageant and comedy queens. Special mention among the others goes to Kennedy for her crystallized glamazon look, Chi Chi for her ’20s-inspired trash bag creation, and Milk for an updated take on her Pinocchio entrance look from season six.

All of them mostly fade into the background this episode, though, as BenDeLaCreme owns the proceedings. She completes a clean sweep this episode, winning the mini-challenge, main challenge, and the Lip Sync for Your Legacy. Condragulations to her! That said: These decisions are ultimately all kinda sketchy.

Her reads are fine, but Trixie or Morgan probably deserve the crown (Trixie’s “Aja: You’re beautiful, you’re gorgeous, you look like Seal” killed me). During the main variety show challenge, Ben does a burlesque number that feels almost like a parody of Roxxxy Andrews’ winning routine last “All Stars” season. I’d rank her a solid third or fourth, but definitely not above Kennedy’s gag-worthy dance routine (which bizarrely only gets called safe). In the lip sync against Aja, she performs a comedy version of Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” that is a comedy delight, but the editing seems to heavily favor her. We barely see Aja.

I’ll admit I’m not a huge fan of Ben; I think a lot of what she does is too broad and hearkens back to a more classic kind of drag that feels outdated when compared to more contemporary queens. But Ru is clearly as entranced by Ben as she was back in season six. I’d be stunned if she doesn’t go far.

I’m also expecting fellow top scorer Shangela to go the distance. She comes off as the most poised and confident this episode — maybe a little too ready with a catchphrase (“Haleloo” is deployed repeatedly), but hyper-aware of how she needs to sell herself to make the most of her All Stars run. Shangela may not win this week, but she charms the most; her reply to head judge Michelle Visage’s critique of her outfit, to “consider it burnt,” gets big laughs.

Aja wins alongside Ben, and here we have some more repetition: The young, underrated queen and the queen who performed a burlesque number win the first challenge. Tatianna and Roxxxy would be justified in feeling some dejá vu. But I really like Aja’s arc in this premiere. She’s made really smart, small refinements to her drag that quickly launch her ahead of where she was in season nine. Her dance routine involves vogueing, reveals, and a death drop off of a box. She dazzles, and I would’ve placed her in my top two as well (alongside Kennedy).

Thorgy joins them in the top, and she’s indeed very skilled with her violin. But I’m perplexed. Something seems off about Thorgy, like she’s not really there to win. In a group of girls this hungry for the crown, I worry she’ll get lost.

In fact, that hunger is the greatest advantage All Stars season three has over season two. This cast is ready to use the more Survivor-esque elimination format to their advantage: The winner of the lip sync once again gets to send one of the bottom scorers home (now just the bottom two instead of the bottom three). Morgan admits readily she’ll send the strongest girls home if she has the chance. In making her own decision, Ben wonders if it’s best to send Morgan home for that very reason, despite that Morgan’s performance in the variety show was ultimately better than fellow bottom-dweller Chi Chi’s. I think we’re going to get a lot more strategic eliminations this season, making for a much more dynamic show.

Speaking of our bottom queens: Morgan seems incredibly out of her element lip-syncing to her own track in the variety show, something she’s never done before. I’ve seen Morgan plenty at Showgirls, the Monday drag show at Micky’s in West Hollywood, and she can perform with the best of them. Unfortunately, her main talent is lip-syncing to other people’s songs, which requires rights clearance that Drag Race likely wasn’t willing to get. (There were rumors this is why Coco Montrese did an odd Old Hollywood dance in All Stars season two instead of her signature Janet Jackson routine.)

Morgan’s routine is nowhere near as misguided as Chi Chi’s is, though. I adore Chi Chi, and I know she can turn a show like no other queen in this crop. Which is why her choice to perform an odd baton routine in a flat jazz shoe and bad hair is so baffling. What was she thinking? I was rooting for her, we were all rooting for her! Before the premiere, I wanted her to make it to the end; during the winners’ deliberations, I found myself admitting she needed to go home first.

But Ben actually sends Morgan home, likely to cut off a vocal, dangerous threat before she gets too far. There’s still likely a return twist in store for this season, and maybe Morgan will fight her way back into the competition. It’d likely be for the best of the season if she did. A show like this is better when unpredictable elements are present, and Morgan is maybe the most unpredictable of all.

Final thoughts:

While the replication of the format confused me, I did enjoy the casualness with which Ru introduced the rules. “‘All Star’ rules are in full effect” is just blasé enough to fit the tone of the spinoff, which usually expects the audience to get references versus explaining them (see: Kennedy’s entrance look referencing her “Untucked” monologue). “All Stars” is expert-level Drag Race.

I honestly don’t know how Shangela death-drops so fast. I hope she has a great chiropractor.

Quick rundown of the other queens’ talent show performances: Trixie’s song is lovely but too slow to win. Bebe’s lip sync is ferocious, if a little light compared to some of the more acrobatic routines. Milk’s paper dress routine is honestly just not much of anything (I deeply identify with Kennedy and Chi Chi’s eye-rolls), but she sticks around.

Kind of odd that Ben specifically said she thought Valentina would be there, right? No other queen gets name-checked so specifically. The telenovela queen’s shadow looms large.

If I had to pick a favorite part of Ben’s performance this week, it’d be her lip sync. It’s hilarious! I just wish we’d gotten a more fair and even edit between her and Aja.

Bebe reacting to Trixie’s sense of humor with “Bitch, you got jokes” is a subtle but perfect way to remind them all that she’s elevated above them. She’s not just laughing at Trixie’s joke, she’s bestowing her praise upon her.

Bless her, but the less said about Vanessa Hudgens’ guest judging, the better. Thrilled Ross Matthews is back full-time, though.

That Handmaid’s Tale opening sequence was weird as hell, right?Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade is spreading misinformation about vaccines as this year’s particularly deadly flu epidemic spreads across the United States.

Dr. Marc Siegel, a practicing internist and Fox News contributor, joined Monday’s show to explain why this flu season is especially dangerous, and to encourage viewers to get flu shots.

“The flu shot, which I still say everybody out there should get, is about 30-percent effective, but it actually decreases spread around the household, it decreases severity, and it’s very smart to get it,” Siegel said during the show. “Of the children that have died, 80 percent of them in the past hadn’t gotten a flu shot.”

But Kilmeade dismissed the medical professional’s advice, instead echoing a debunked talking point of conspiracy theorists known as anti-vaxxers.

Here’s how it went down: As the segment wrapped up, Siegel asked the show’s hosts if they’ve had their annual flu shots. Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt confirmed they did. But their colleague, on the other hand ...

Kilmeade: No, I have not gotten one. Earhardt: He doesn’t get them. Siegel: I’m going to try to give Brian one off the air. Earhardt: He won’t do it. Kilmeade: Only 30 percent, people are saying ― Siegel: You have to protect your girls. Kilmeade: Right. Alright, but they’ve got to build up their immunity, too.

Kilmeade essentially told the show’s viewers ― of which there are an average 1.6 million, according to Nielsen ― that opting not to get a flu shot is a better way for people to “build up their immunity.” That’s just false, and spreading that type of misinformation to an audience that large is irresponsible and dangerous.

Vaccines boost your immune system ― not weaken it. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, vaccines help your immune system fight infections “faster and more effectively.” They also often provide “long-lasting immunity to serious diseases without the risk of serious illness,” the HHS website reports. So it’s important to get a flu shot every year.

By one Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculation, flu kills an average of 6,309 to 23,607 people each year. This can vary substantially. For example, from the 2010 to 2014 seasons, the yearly flu death count varied from 12,000 one year to 56,000 the next. This year’s flu season started earlier and peaked earlier than usual, and the most prevalent form of the virus is particularly nasty.

According to the CDC, it’s safer to get vaccinated than to risk illness in an effort to “obtain immune protection” by getting the flu.

“Flu can be a serious disease, particularly among young children, older adults, and people with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes,” the CDC says on its website. “Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults.”

It’s especially problematic for Kilmeade to imply that his teenage daughters aren’t getting vaccinations so they can “boost their immunity.” Children are one of the most vulnerable populations when it comes to the flu. The CDC reports 37 children have died from flu-related illness this season, compared with eight from the same time period last year.

Kilmeade also seemed to point out that this year’s vaccine is only 30-percent effective against H3N2 ― this year’s most prevalent flu strain. But it’s still important to get the vaccine because it can reduce some of the most severe outcomes of the illness, according to a 2017 report from the CDC.

“Studies have shown that vaccines prevent against serious illness and death,” Dr. Deborah Lehman, an infectious diseases specialist and a professor of clinical pediatrics in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told Medical Express. “Even if it doesn’t provide full protection, the vaccine may provide some partial protection.”

A representative for Fox News did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Kesha stole the show during Sunday night’s Grammy Awards.

The singer-songwriter performed her emotional ballad “Praying” alongside fellow artists Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Bebe Rexha, Julia Michaels, Andra Day and others. The performance began with the lights dimmed and about two dozen women wearing white onstage and harmonizing: “Sometimes, I pray for you at night. Someday, maybe you’ll see the light.”

The performance was emotional, powerful and cathartic, especially in light of the night’s Time’s Up theme that led many stars to wear white roses to support the anti-sexual harassment initiative. Kesha wrote “Praying” after a tumultuous legal battle with her former producer Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald, whom she accused of sexual assault and battery.

When the song finally ended, Kesha teared up and all of the women onstage embraced in an emotional hug.

A few minutes after performing, Kesha thanked the women who performed with her in a tweet.

“after everything you've done I can thank you for how strong I have become”

thank you to the @RecordingAcad, the women on stage with me tonight, and everyone who has supported me through this whole journey. pic.twitter.com/43gOsofL0S — kesha (@KeshaRose) January 29, 2018

Actress Janelle Monae introduced Kesha with a powerful statement.

“Tonight I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry,” Monae told the crowd. “Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers, women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time’s up.”

Kesha explained in a tweet posted on Saturday just how much it meant to her that she was performing “Praying” at Sunday’s Grammys.

“When I wrote praying, with Ben Abraham and Ryan Lewis, I just felt as if I had gotten a huge weight off of my shoulders,” she tweeted. “It felt like an emotional raw victory for myself, one step closer to healing. I never could have known what would’ve happened these past few years.”

In a July 2017 essay for Lenny Letter, Kesha explained what the emotional and personal song was about.

“This song is about coming to feel empathy for someone else even if they hurt you or scare you. It’s a song about learning to be proud of the person you are even during low moments when you feel alone,” she wrote. “It’s also about hoping everyone, even someone who hurt you, can heal.”

The riveting performance was not lost on viewers. Many people tweeted how moved they were by the song and the beautiful performance.

Lorde was asked to sing in a tribute to the late Tom Petty but was not asked to perform solo, according to “Entertainment Tonight.” Lorde’s mother sent out a cryptic tweet a few days before the ceremony, highlighting a portion of a New York Times article about gender equality in the music industry.

“This says it all,” she wrote.

Viewers tweeted their outrage on Sunday as they watched other artists and host James Corden soak up airtime.

Sting, in particular, appeared on air in two separate segments: first during a widely panned sketch with Corden, and then to perform his 1987 hit “Englishman in New York” onstage with Shaggy.

Following the show, Recording Academy President Neil Portnow responded to a question from the press about Lorde’s absence from the roster of performances.

“We can’t have a performance from every nominee,” Portnow said without addressing any artist by name or indicating whether Lorde was invited to perform. “We have to create [a show] that has balance... and what you saw was our best judgment on how to do that.”

An Australian student used the service to reveal the locations and activities of soldiers at U.S. military bases.

Twenty-year-old university student Nathan Ruser stumbled across the map on a blog and was inspired to look more closely after his dad reportedly observed that the map gave a snapshot of “where rich white people are” in the world.

So Ruser got to thinking.

“I wondered, does it show U.S. soldiers,” Ruser told The Washington Post.

“It sort of lit up like a Christmas tree,” he said after zooming in in Syria, where the scant jogging activity beams out from an all-black background.

Strava has since urged its users to check their privacy settings.

While the locations of military bases are generally known, there are concerns about the level of activity it reveals about personnel inside and around the bases.

The revelations have piqued concerns among observers and security experts around the world.

According to The Washington Post, the U.S. military is looking into the situation.

Arms Control Wonk blog publisher Jeffrey Lewis wrote in The Daily Beast that it was “incredible” to see people taking smartphones or other devices past checkpoints into places they really shouldn’t be.

“As bad as the publicly available heat map is, the underlying data that Strava is collecting is a security nightmare for governments around the world,” Lewis said.

“The data being collected could allow anyone with access to it the ability to make a pattern-of-life map for individual users, some of whom may be very interesting.”

This is an extraordinary security oversight Tobias has found. Strava is a popular exercise app - soldiers love it, and are uploading their activity all over the world. https://t.co/lXcQVlbBYX — Dan Murphy (@bungdan) January 27, 2018

Ruser, who is reportedly studying international security at the Australian National University, told Australia’s national broadcaster he has been following the situation in Syria since 2014.

For his part, he doesn’t think it’s Strava’s fault.

“They probably should have had the foresight to look at the map before they released it, but the app has a policy where you can opt out of data sharing, and that hasn’t been done by the soldiers,” Ruser said.GENEVA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - More than 100,000 Rohingya refugees huddled in squalid, muddy camps in Bangladesh will be in grave danger from landslides when the mid-year monsoon season begins, a U.N. humanitarian report said.

There are now more than 900,000 Rohingyas in the Cox’s Bazar area of Bangladesh, after 688,000 fled violence in Myanmar that flared up in late August. Aid workers say the camps sheltering the new arrivals are completely inadequate.

“Landslide and flood risk hazard mapping reveal that at least 100,000 people are in grave danger from these risks and require relocation to new areas or within the neighborhoods that they live in,” the U.N. report said.

“The lack of space remains the main challenge for the sector as sites are highly congested leading to extremely hard living conditions with no space for service provisions and facilities. In addition, congestion brings increased protections risks and favors disease outbreak such as the diphtheria outbreak currently escalating in most of the sites.”

Although a rapid vaccination program appears to have staved off the risk of cholera, 4,865 have confirmed, probable or suspected diphtheria, and 35 have died.

The World Health Organization has vaccinated over 500,000 Rohingyas against diphtheria and on Saturday health workers began giving 350,000 children a second dose. The WHO also has 2,500 doses of anti-toxin, which is in short supply globally, to treat the deadly effects of the disease.

But a new health concern has arisen - mumps. The U.N. report said there had been an increase in cases in the past few weeks, and Rohingya refugees and host communities had never been vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which is rarely fatal but can cause complications such as meningitis.

Most of the Rohingya refugees - almost 585,000 - are in an overcrowded area called Kutupalong-Balukhali.

“A high percentage of the land is unsuitable for human settlement as risks of flooding and landslides are high and are further aggravated by the congestion and extensive terracing of the hills,” the U.N. report said.

“The anticipated flooding and landslides in the upcoming monsoon season will make a bad situation much worse.”

But his plan has been criticised at home. SAEED KHAN via Getty Images

Australia has unveiled an ambitious plan to become one of the world’s largest arms exporters within a decade, under a controversial strategy announced by the nation’s prime minister.

Malcolm Turnbull on Monday unveiled his government’s $US3.1 billion “defence export strategy” which outlines the policy and strategy to make Australia one of the world’s top 10 weapons exporters by 2028.

The government says Australia currently only sells about $1.5bn to $2.5bn in defence exports a year.

“The Government believes that, over time, Australia can become a major defence exporter,” the export strategy says.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the plan was ambitious and positive. FRANCK ROBICHON via Getty Images

Prime Minister Turnbull described the plan as an “ambitious, positive plan” to boost Australian industry, increase investment, and create more jobs.

“A strong, exporting defence industry in Australia will provide greater certainty of investment, support high-end manufacturing jobs and support the capability of the Australian Defence Force,” he said, according to The Guardian.

The government will set aside $US16.2m a year to implement the strategy, including $5.145m to implement strategic multi-year export campaigns.

The strategy identified key markets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand; the Indo-Pacific region, the Middle East region and in Europe.

Such a plan marks a significant ramp up in Australia’s arms exports. Australia is ranked the 20th largest arms exporter in the world.

Amnesty International Australia condemned the plan.

“When the Government talks about expanding arms exports to the Middle East, where exactly does it mean,” Amnesty International Australia’s Crisis Campaigns Coordinator Diana Sayed said in a statement.

“Syria? Saudi Arabia? And when it talks about the Indo-Pacific, is it contemplating Myanmar? The Philippines?” she continued. “We are seriously concerned about indications that the Australian government intends to become a major arms exporter to volatile regions that have appalling human rights records.”

The local opposition has also questioned the move, with infrastructure spokesman Anthony Albanese querying in The Guardian why the government was happy to back advanced defence manufacturing after it withdrew support for the car industry.

“Why is it that the government isn’t investing, for example, into tax on the renewable energy sector?” he said.
