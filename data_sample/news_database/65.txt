Jimmy Kimmel got another disturbed night’s sleep last week thanks to pop star Miley Cyrus.

The singer burst into the snoozing late-night talk show host’s bedroom to give a special performance of her 2013 hit “Wrecking Ball.” Rihanna and Britney Spears have both pulled the same prank on Kimmel in recent years.

But Cyrus kicked it up a notch, using a spoof sledgehammer to split fake rubble strewn on Kimmel’s bed and accidentally hit him in the balls as crew members wearing high-vis jackets and wrecking ball costumes looked on.For The Win provided a fuller portion of Robinson’s quote:

There I was, the black grandson of a slave, the son of a black sharecropper, part of a historic occasion, a symbolic hero to my people. The air was sparkling. The sunlight was warm. The band struck up the national anthem. The flag billowed in the wind. It should have been a glorious moment for me as the stirring words of the national anthem poured from the stands. Perhaps, it was, but then again, perhaps, the anthem could be called the theme song for a drama called The Noble Experiment. Today, as I look back on that opening game of my first world series, I must tell you that it was Mr. Rickey’s drama and that I was only a principal actor. As I write this twenty years later, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.Protesters swarmed a Starbucks in Philadelphia on Monday, days after police arrested two black men who had been waiting there to meet a friend.

Dozens of demonstrators shut down the coffee shop in Philadelphia’s central business district for over three hours Monday morning. The activists came out to protest racial profiling after the store’s manager called police Thursday to remove the men for sitting at a table without buying anything.

“A whole lot of racism, a whole lot of whack,” protesters chanted Monday. “Starbucks coffee is anti-black.”

Several speakers said Thursday’s arrests were the product of institutional racism and a historically oppressive police force.

“This is a systemic issue,” Megan Malachi, one of the protest’s organizers, told local news outlet PhillyVoice. “Everyone in the city government is complicit and so is Starbucks. ... This is outrageous, this is insulting and we are not going to stand for it.”

Later in the day, dozens of clergy members and activists staged an interfaith sit-in inside the coffee shop. The demonstration featured moments of quiet, as well as songs and chants that ranged from “Tell me what theology looks like! This is what theology looks like!” to “Shut it down!”

Video capturing the men’s arrests went viral over the weekend, sparking protests at the store and calls to boycott Starbucks.

“The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything,” author Melissa DePino, who recorded the incident, tweeted last week. “They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.”

PhillyVoice pointed to a second, longer video uploaded to YouTube that shows an officer telling the men’s friend, Andrew Yaffe, that they were being arrested for “trespassing.” In the video, Yaffe calls what the officers are doing “discrimination.”

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson apologized for the incident in a statement Saturday and again on Monday during an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“I personally apologize to the two gentlemen that visited our store,” Johnson said. “Certainly, it’s my responsibility to understand what happened and what led to that, and ensure that we fix it.”

Johnson pledged more training for store managers on company guidelines and unconscious bias. He hopes to have a face-to-face meeting with the men so he can apologize in person, the CEO said.

“What happened to those two gentlemen was wrong,” he said. “I’d like to invite them to join me in finding a constructive way to solve this issue.”

The manager who called police Thursday has since left the company, a spokeswoman for Starbucks told PhillyVoice. A sign posted to the store’s window Monday afternoon stated that the location was “temporarily closed,” according to NBC Philadelphia.Police in Washington, D.C., are investigating a possible hate crime after two men were attacked and beaten early Sunday morning.

The incident, which police have labeled aggravated assault, occurred in the 2000 block of 10th Street Northwest. Officers responded to a call that a person was unconscious. They found two adult male victims who said they were assaulted by three men who yelled homophobic slurs at them.

They were taken to an area hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. One victim said he was knocked unconscious by the attack. The other victim sustained a broken nose and a chipped tooth.

“The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating this offense as potentially being motivated by hate or bias,” the department said in a statement. “Anyone with information is asked to call 202-727-9099 or you can text your tip to 50411.”

Police have not made available descriptions of the suspected assailants.

Jamie Sycamore, who is running for D.C. Council in Ward 1, told local CBS news station WUSA that he knows both victims.

“It’s a shame that people can just be beaten up just for who they are,” he said in an interview. “It’s not good.”

For a show that forces us to accept that dead people come back to life, some pretty unbelievable shenanigans have occurred in Season 8 of “The Walking Dead.”

Sunday’s finale kept to the theme, delivering strange twist after strange twist.

First of all, Eugene (Josh McDermitt) seemingly switched sides again after spending a couple seasons helping Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and the Saviors. During this episode, he rigged the Saviors’ bullets to explode in their guns when they tried to shoot Rick (Andrew Lincoln). It was a turning point in the war, leading to the Saviors’ surrender and Eugene’s redemption.

But, uh, what?

Just a week ago in the episode “Worth,” Eugene, who has been aiding the Saviors since Season 7, was briefly kidnapped by Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Rosita (Christian Serratos). He threw up on Rosita in order to escape and get back to the Saviors. If he was planning on switching sides again, why spit up lunch? Why not just tell Daryl and Rosita, “I’m rigging all the bullets, so it’s cool.” Hmmm.

Back to the finale: After Eugene’s show of loyalty, Rick slashes Negan’s throat. But then he makes a speech to his followers and the Saviors, stating that he’s in favor of saving Negan and living together as one. A similar scene happens in the comic books, but if this is the plan, Rick, you might want to shorten your speech, because Negan is still lying on the ground bleeding out.

To top it all off, in the most inexplicable twist Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Daryl and Jesus (Tom Payne) are plotting against Rick now. Yeah. They apparently aren’t happy that Rick left Negan alive, so we get a brief scene of them scheming against their former leader.

Sure, earlier in the show there’s a scene with Jesus preaching to Morgan (Lennie James) about keeping people alive, but whatever. It’s all just a continuation of the other wild and wacky stuff that’s happened this season. Let’s look back and reminisce ...

Carl died by tripping and falling.

What was even going on this year? After surviving into Season 8 of the apocalypse and getting shot (twice), Carl (Chandler Riggs) died after tripping and subsequently receiving a bite from a zombie.

The Season 8 finale began with Siddiq (Avi Nash) trying to explain to Rick how Carl died, and it still doesn’t make a ton of sense. Why would Carl be so careless?

(Riggs has poked fun at his character’s carelessness on Twitter, too.)

Oh, and after he receives the bite, Carl shoots the zombie that bit him. I repeat: he shoots the zombie. Rick after learning Carl had a gun the whole time:

Same, dude. Same.

New rule: Zombie blood now turns you into a zombie.

Gene Page/AMC

If you haven’t been keeping up, here’s a crucial Season 8 revelation for you: Zombie blood can turn people into zombies. That’s a thing now.

Though this occurs in the comics, the TV show hadn’t established that being exposed to zombie blood in a wound could turn you. In Season 6, we see Rick cut his hand on a blade that’s gone through a zombie ― and he’s totally fine.

This year, that all changed. A bunch of people at the Hilltop were hit with weapons covered in zombie blood and eventually turned into zombies. In the apocalypse, the first thing to die off is continuity.

Wait, another new rule: Everyone turns into a zombie except for Negan.

Gene Page/AMC

OK, so you got all that about zombie blood? Good. Now forget that hogwash.

In Season 8, Negan gets in a car crash while riding with a bucket of zombie blood. The blood goes everywhere. He’s totally fine. Then he gets hit in the arm with his barbed-wire covered baseball bat after it’s been smothered in zombie blood. He’s cool after that, too.

Who knows why. Just don’t think about it too much.

Finally, introducing butthole vision.

In the “Walking Dead,” Negan talks a lot about people being assholes, so this just seems like a natural progression.

When Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) becomes sick after putting zombie blood and guts on himself early on in Season 8 (see above for new rule on zombie blood), a dose of antibiotics saves him. But he suffers some vision problems thereafter. This gave the show the opportunity to add a funky new POV camera, which the internet has lovingly deemed “butthole cam.”Netflix is adding quite a few quality movies over the next few days.

The recently Oscar-nominated “The Incredibles 2” hits the service Wednesday (you can read more about that below). “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” another recent Disney blockbuster, joins the day before.

Then on Friday, Netflix gets 18 new movies, including “Jaws,” “Personal Shopper,” “Pretty in Pink” and “The Edge of Seventeen.” The three main “American Pie” movies also become available to stream, so there’s that.

Netflix has one major Original movie coming out this week: “Velvet Buzzsaw.” This satire stars Jake Gyllenhaal, John Malkovich and Toni Collette as figures in the Los Angeles art world. As a fan of dark comedies, Gyllenhaal and stories that make fun of the ultra-rich, I am excited for this.

The Most Notable Movie Coming To Netflix This Week

“Disney-Pixar’s The Incredibles 2” | Jan. 30

Disney-Pixar "The Incredibles 2" on Netflix.

Premise: A family of superheroes tries to stick together while fighting evil. As the mom’s stardom rises, the rest of the family has to reckon with their own lack of fame, along with missing having her around.

Is it good? This movie earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature and has a credible chance at winning (although “Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse” has the best odds). It also has a 93 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 80 on Metacritic. If you have loved Pixar movies in the past, this continues in that lineage of tone and quality.

Heads Up: Disney had to issue a warning that this movie might cause those with epilepsy to have a seizure. The movie has many flashing lights and colors that even those without epilepsy may find overwhelming.

AdvertisementSteven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One” has officially made him the first director whose films have globally taken in over $10 billion, according to Box Office Mojo. And that worldwide gross total, approximately $10.01 billion, doesn’t even account for inflation.

When you look over his filmography, which includes “Jurassic Park,” “E.T.,” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” Schindler’s List,” “Jaws,” and the entire “Indiana Jones” franchise, it’s hard to be completely surprised by the achievement.

When adjusted for inflation, Spielberg’s total domestic gross alone is $10.41 billion. “E.T” and “Jaws” are the top money makers in that adjusted domestic figure, taking in $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion respectively.

After Spielberg, the next two highest grossing directors are Michael Bay and Peter Jackson, whose films have both grossed about $6.5 billion globally, also not adjusting for inflation.The 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism has been jointly awarded to The New York Times and The New Yorker for the outlets’ coverage on sexual assault in Hollywood, Pulitzer Prize Administrator Dana Canedy announced Monday.

Canedy said the outlets exposed “powerful and wealthy sexual predators ... bringing them to account for long-suppressed allegations of coercion, brutality and victim silencing, thus spurring a worldwide reckoning about sexual abuse of women.”

Roy J. Harris Jr., a Poynter contributor who has studied and speculated on Pulitzer winners in the past, predicted this year’s prize might be awarded to one of the more prominent journalists who uncovered numerous bombshell sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

The reports added significant fuel to the Me Too movement, a broad pushback against sexual harassment in all industries.

Harris speculated the real decision for the Pulitzer judges would be which of two major works was more deserving of the award, highlighting The New York Times for “Harassed” by lead reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and The New Yorker for Ronan Farrow’s numerous stories on the topic.

“Both the paper’s and the magazine’s articles, appearing within days of each other in October, unearthed movie mega-producer Harvey Weinstein’s history of sexual predation,” Harris said. “And together they helped change the discussion of workplace harassment on a national level, and beyond.”

The Washington Post won this year’s investigative reporting award for its work on the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, which was also related to the Me Too movement.

The Post uncovered allegations that candidate Roy Moore had sexually harassed teenagers when he was in his 30s. The Post produced “purposeful and relentless reporting that changed the course of a Senate race in Alabama by revealing a candidate’s alleged past sexual harassment of teenage girls and subsequent efforts to undermine the journalism that exposed it,” Canedy said.

Pulitzers are awarded annually in 14 different journalism categories, as well as seven other categories under letters, drama and music.Americans own a lot of guns. With more than 300 million of them in civilian hands, according to some estimates, the U.S. is the most heavily armed society in the world.

This proliferation hasn’t happened overnight. Firearms have been an American tradition for centuries. Many families have passed down guns for generations. But Americans have also continued to buy plenty of new guns, leading to record sales in recent years.

The U.S. loves its guns. But what happens when someone owns a firearm they don’t love, and they want to get rid of it without putting it back on the market? If that describes you, we want to talk.

Here’s why: Although reselling guns can be relatively straightforward, disposing of them isn’t. Many police departments host gun buybacks or amnesty programs, allowing the public to turn in weapons, often with the promise of modest compensation.

But after people give up those firearms, it’s hard to say what will happen to them. Some law enforcement agencies destroy surrendered guns, but many instead auction them or pawn them to licensed dealers, which then resell them. Sometimes, those weapons end up being used in shootings.

For anyone uncomfortable with that possibility, the options for getting rid of guns are limited. There are ways to destroy firearms on your own, though it can be difficult, depending on the type of weapon and your familiarity with firearms. There are also more innovative alternatives, like groups that take unwanted guns and melt them down into shovels or art.

But none of these methods are particularly simple or easy. If you find yourself in this predicament and aren’t sure what to do, please fill out the form below, send me a tweet or an email ― nickw [at] huffpost.com ― or leave a comment.Sean Hannity was livid the day that the FBI raided the office and hotel room of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer. He said it showed that special counsel Robert Mueller was “out to get the president,” and he blasted the media for giving the raid so much coverage.

“The media, while they are obsessing over Michael Cohen ― yeah, there are really important stories to bring to you,” Hannity said on his Fox News show.

But what he never revealed is why he doesn’t want the media to pay attention to the story: because he is one of Cohen’s clients.

Cohen has done legal work for just three clients since leaving his position last year as counsel for Trump’s private company. It was previously reported that the first two clients were the president and GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy.

Broidy had an affair with a former Playboy model. She became pregnant during their relationship, and Cohen helped arrange payments to her to keep her quiet.

On Monday, Cohen’s lawyer revealed that Hannity was Cohen’s third, secret client, although it’s unclear what the nature of the work was.

Cohen is under federal criminal investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations in connection with his business dealings. The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan is handling the case. Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election, referred the matter to the U.S. attorney’s office but has not been involved since.

Hannity said on his radio show Monday that he has known Cohen “a long, long time” and tried to play down his involvement in his life.

“Let me be very clear to the media: Michael never represented me in any matter. I never retained him in the traditional sense. ... I never received an invoice from Michael. I never paid legal fees to Michael,” Hannity said. “But I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions. I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were attorney-client confidential.”

“Not one of any issues I ever dealt with Michael Cohen on ever, ever involved a matter between me and a third party,” he added.

He also tweeted that his discussions with Cohen were primarily about real estate.

In response to some wild speculation, let me make clear that I did not ask Michael Cohen to bring this proceeding on my behalf, I have no personal interest in this proceeding, and, in fact, asked that my de minimis discussions with Michael Cohen, — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 16, 2018

which dealt almost exclusively about real estate, not be made a part of this proceeding. — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 16, 2018

Hannity appears to be specifically trying to put to rest any speculation that he was in a situation similar to Broidy. Federal investigators are also reportedly interested in records Cohen has regarding a payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with Trump and received money from Cohen to stay silent in the run-up to the election.

On Monday, Fox News hosts found themselves in the strange position of reporting breaking news on their own colleague.

Hannity never addressed his conflict of interest in his initial coverage of the Cohen raid. On his radio show on April 9, Hannity said the incident showed “that there’s no limit at all into the fishing expedition that Mueller is now engaged in and if he has access to everything that his personal attorney has.”Utah voters are on the verge of getting a chance this November to do what the state’s GOP leaders won’t: expand health coverage to an estimated 150,000 low-income adults.

Utah Decides Healthcare, a coalition of activist groups, health care organizations and consumer advocates, submitted enough signatures from Utahns to place an initiative on the ballot this November that would expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the organization announced in a press release Monday. State officials have to review the signatures and are expected to decide next month whether enough are valid to put the initiative on the ballot.

Utah is one of three states where voters may get an opportunity to go around their governors and legislators to expand Medicaid.

There are similar campaigns underway in Idaho and Nebraska. Mainers voted for the Medicaid expansion last year, making it the first state to enact the policy through direct voter action. Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), however, has thus far refused to implement the Medicaid expansion.

The Affordable Care Act’s authors intended a nationwide expansion of Medicaid eligibility to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 a year for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four. In 2012, however, the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the expansion.

Utah, Idaho and Nebraska are among the 18 states that have refused to participate. The federal government covers at least 90 percent of the cost of the expansion, with states responsible for the remainder.

Medicaid expansion has been a subject of debate in Utah since the Supreme Court ruling. At times, Gov. Gary Herbert (R) has expressed support for some form of expansion, but it hasn’t gained enough support in the majority-Republican legislature to move forward.

The Utah Senate approved a privatized version of the expansion two years ago, but the state House didn’t act on it. Last year, the state implemented a small Medicaid expansion targeting about 6,000 homeless people and low-income people with substance-use and mental health problems.

In March, Herbert signed a bill that would expand Medicaid eligibility to up to 100 percent of the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person and $25,000 for a family of four. The move would extend coverage to an estimated 72,000 people.

That partial expansion, however, depends on federal approval, which isn’t assured.

The Affordable Care Act is explicit that the extra federal money available to states for broadening Medicaid eligibility only applies to expansions to 133 percent of poverty. President Barack Obama’s administration wouldn’t permit these partial expansions, and President Donald Trump’s administration would be on shaky legal ground if they approved Utah’s request. The Trump administration last month declined to approve Arkansas’ request to scale back its Medicaid expansion to 100 percent of poverty.

Medicaid expansion enjoys the support of a majority of Utahns, according to a poll conducted in January by The Salt Lake Tribune and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics.

The survey found that 62 percent of the state’s residents want to see Medicaid expanded. That includes 51 percent of Republicans who were polled, along with 93 percent of Democrats, the Tribune reported in February.

Utah Decides Healthcare had to collect 113,143 signatures by Sunday to put expansion on the ballot, a figure that represents 10 percent of the number of Utahns who voted in the 2016 presidential election. In addition, the signatures had to come from across the state, with at least 10 percent of 2016 presidential voters in 26 of 29 state Senate districts.

In the end, the coalition met the geographic requirements and exceeded the overall threshold by gathering signatures from more than 165,000 people, Utah Decides Healthcare announced.

Activists in Idaho and Nebraska are hoping to duplicate these results.

Reclaim Idaho, a grassroots outfit founded last year, has until May 1 to collect 56,000 signatures. As in Utah, they must come from all over the state. The total must be at least equal to 6 percent of the state’s registered voters, and they must meet the same threshold in 18 of Idaho’s 35 state legislative districts.

In Nebraska, a coalition called Insure the Good Life ― made up of progressive groups and health care advocates, including the Nebraska Hospital Association ― is leading the campaign.

To put Medicaid expansion on the ballot, activists in Nebraska must gather 85,000 signatures, representing 7 percent of the state’s registered voters, by July 5. Nebraska also requires that the signatures be from around the whole state, so the activists must get signatures from 5 percent of registered voters in 38 of the state’s 93 counties.Vanessa Bayer spilled the beans about what it was like to work with Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live” in 2015.

On Monday’s broadcast of “The Late Show,” the “SNL” alum told host Stephen Colbert that she was worried that doing the “Porn Stars” sketch could damage the then-GOP presidential candidate’s shot at the White House. In the skit, two former porn stars, played by Bayer and Cecily Strong, shill for Trump in their own unique way (available to watch via NBC here).

“I was like, ‘Oh my God, am I sabotaging his campaign?‘” said Bayer. “I was like ‘I don’t want him to win, but is it gonna be because of this sketch I do with him showing him with porn stars?’”

“And it seems like… oh, that doesn’t matter,” Bayer added.

Bayer left “SNL” last year after seven seasons on the show. She currently stars in the upcoming Netflix movie “Ibiza.”Desiree Linden of the USA hits the tape to win the Women's Division of the 2018 Boston Marathon. USA Today Sports / Reuters

Two-time Olympian Desiree Linden became the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon in 33 years on Monday when she broke the tape at the finish line with a time of 2 hours, 39 minutes, 54 seconds.

Linden, 34, won with a time more than 14 minutes slower than her previous two races, but course conditions were not conducive to personal- or course-record performances.

Fellow American Sarah Sellers was second, 4:10 behind Linden.

“I don’t have the right words. I’m thrilled,” Linden said on the TV broadcast immediately after the race. “It’s supposed to be hard. ... I was just lucky to get it done.”

Linden finished second in 2011 with a time of 2:22:38.

In the men’s 26.2-mile race, Japanese amateur Yuki Kawauchi won in 2:15:58, his first major marathon victory. Kawauchi is known in the running community but works full time for the government in Japan and is without sponsorship. He is not regularly viewed as an “elite” marathon runner.

Kawauchi, 31, appeared stunned and emotional at the finish line. While he is a seasoned runner with more than 80 marathon finishes in his career, Monday’s time in Boston adds to his record number of 2:20-and-under marathon finishes.

The temperature Monday morning at the start line was announced at 30 degrees and rain fell throughout the race, often heavily, to make for a slower overall pace.

“For me, these are the best conditions possible,” Kawauchi said after the race.

The last Japanese man to win the Boston Marathon was Toshihiko Seko in 1987. Kawauchi is the ninth Japanese male to win Boston.

In a somber editorial, The New York Times has called on the Republican Party to protect the rule of law from Donald Trump amid indications that he may fire special counsel Robert Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to shut down the Russian collusion investigation into his presidential campaign.

The online editorial, which will reportedly take up an entire page in Monday’s print edition, begins with a quote from Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah): “This great nation can tolerate a president who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up.” Hatch was speaking about former president Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

"The President is not above the law." This special NYT editorial takes up a full page in Monday's print edition. It's online now: https://t.co/ZVeDL8epKq pic.twitter.com/NGqhzpDOgH — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) April 15, 2018

If Trump takes ”drastic action” and shuts down the Russian collusion investigation he “will be striking at the foundation of the American government, attempting to set a precedent that a president, alone among American citizens, is above the law,” the Times editorial board wrote. “What can seem now like a political sideshow will instantly become a constitutional crisis.”

The president “has been known to huff and puff ... and he may be doing no more than that now,” the Times acknowledged. But if he does strike a blow against the probe, legislators will “suddenly find themselves on the edge of an abyss, with the Constitution in their hands.”

The Times reminds Republicans how they once described Trump “back when they thought they could still protect their party from him.” They called him a “malignant clown,” “unsound, uninformed, unhinged and unfit” and a “sociopath without a conscience.”Yes, while Beyoncé was absolutely killing it during her two-hour performance ― making history as the first black woman to headline the festival and bringing out former Destiny’s Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams to perform a three-song medley ― some photos made it look like she’d gotten her nails redone.

BuzzFeed did a deeper dive and said the photographs of the silver nails were from dress rehearsal, meaning Beyoncé probably didn’t get her nail polish switched out mid-set.

Still, we wouldn’t put it past Bey. We’re crazy in love with the whole situation, and we’re not alone:Embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks to the press at a news conference at the EPA on April 2. Jason Andrew via Getty Images

Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, broke the law by spending $43,000 to install a soundproof phone booth, a government watchdog concluded in a report released Monday.

The Government Accountability Office found that the EPA violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act by spending more than $5,000 on the phone booth without notifying Congress.

The EPA defended the decision to install the phone booth, which it said the administrator required to make classified phone calls to the White House. The GAO declined to rule on the phone booth’s necessity, but said its construction qualified as a furnishing under federal statute, meaning the “EPA was required to notify the appropriations committees of its proposed obligation.”

The agency also found that the EPA violated the Antideficiency Act by spending more than the amount Congress approved.

“Because EPA did not comply with the notification requirement, the funds were not legally available at the time EPA incurred the obligation,” the report concludes.

“EPA is addressing GAO’s concern, with regard to Congressional notification about this expense, and will be sending Congress the necessary information this week,” Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, said in a statement to HuffPost.

The congressional notification requirement does not carry a penalty for the agency. The EPA could, however, face administrative penalties under the Antideficiency Act. The law allows for criminal prosecution if an agency staffer knowingly violated the statute, but that seems highly unlikely. The Department of Justice has not brought charges against under the Antideficiency Act in modern history.

“The Anti-Deficiency Act is a criminal statute, but as a practical matter, it has never been used to prosecute anyone in a situation like this,” Clark Pettig, a spokesman for the watchdog group American Oversight, told HuffPost by email.

The report comes amid slowly intensifying Republican criticism of the EPA over its growing list of spending scandals. In a statement, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called on the EPA to “give a full public accounting of this expenditure and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law.”

Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who is overseeing an investigation into Pruitt as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, skewered the administrator on Sunday over his claim that he booked first-class flights to avoid verbal attacks from fellow passengers in the coach section.

“The notion that I’ve got to fly first class because I don’t want people to be mean to me ― you need to go into another line of work if you don’t want people to be mean to you,” Gowdy said on Fox News. “Like maybe a monk.”

The phone booth first attracted criticism from Democrats and spending watchdogs after The Washington Post reported on its construction last September. In December, Pruitt told lawmakers he needed the booth.

“It’s necessary for me to be able to do my job,” he said.

In the footnotes of the GAO report, the agency said the EPA installed two soundproof phone booths, called “Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities.”

“These are operated by EPA sub-organizations and are located three floors away from the Administrator’s office,” the report states.

The findings came in response to a request from top Democrats, who are calling for Pruitt to resign over rampant spending and ethical lapses. The report arrived just three days after Democrats leading a congressional investigation into Pruitt released letters detailing accusations of “unethical and potentially illegal” moves. The explosive new allegations came from an interview with Kevin Chmielewski, a lifelong Republican and former Trump aide who served as the EPA’s deputy chief of staff until he was removed for raising alarm over Pruitt’s spending habits.

The latest controversies keep attention on Pruitt for a third consecutive week. The scandals began last month when ABC News reported that Pruitt paid just $50 a night to live in a luxury condo owned by an energy lobbyist with business before the EPA. The deal cast light on Pruitt’s roughly two dozen ethical breaches and prompted at least three Republican members of Congress to call for his resignation.“We’ll fight about guns. We’ll fight about taxes. We’ll fight about all those other things down the road. But you cannot have, as president of the United States, someone who does not reflect the values that I believe Republicans treasure and Democrats treasure and Independents treasure. That is the core of this country. That’s our foundation. And so impeachment, in a way, would short circuit that.”Conway, during an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” slammed Comey for not coming forward sooner to discuss his concerns “under oath” regarding Trump and Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.

“If he really felt like he was saving the country rather than selling books, why did he wait until an interview with you not under oath and selling a book not under oath?” Conway asked Stephanopoulos, whose highly anticipated interview with Comey aired Sunday night.

Stephanopoulos quickly pointed out that Comey had already done just that.

“Well, he actually answered a lot of those questions under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year,” Stephanopoulos told Conway.

Conway, undeterred, continued to rant against Comey and the allegations in his new book A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, And Leadership, set to be released on Tuesday.

Comey “loved being alone in the Oval Office. He wanted a piece of it,” Conway said. “This is somebody who’s not under oath in interviews and writing a book. And this is somebody who’s given a revisionist version of history. The president hardly knew the man.”

Conway also appeared to suggest Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe “swung” the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor. She later tweeted that she was just joking.

Comey “swung and miss,” Conway tweeted. “I was putting to bed that he was even capable of such a thing. Add sarcasm and stir.”

Trump raged against Comey before and after the interview, tweeting Monday that the former FBI director “committed many crimes.”

Comey, in the interview, said Trump is a liar who “talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat” and may have obstructed justice.

“I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president,” Comey told Stephanopoulos. “I think he’s morally unfit to be president.”Yuri Gripas / Reuters

Retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan leaves behind a party that’s considerably more loyal to President Donald Trump than to him, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.

A 53 percent majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they’d support Trump in a hypothetical political disagreement over Ryan, and just 15 percent that they’d be on Ryan’s side. The results are even starker among Trump voters, who say 63 percent to 12 percent that they’d side with the president over the outgoing speaker.

The current occupant of the White House, of course, is a natural figurehead for his party. Whether the president’s grip on the GOP will strengthen or erode going forward isn’t necessarily clear. Trump is as popular with his base as he’s been in some time. But the current poll finds Trump favored over Ryan by a smaller margin compared to last March, when 62 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners, and nearly three-quarters of Trump voters, said they’d side with the president. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll also found that, for the first time in surveys dating back to last autumn, fewer than half of Republican and Republican-leaning Trump voters identified themselves primarily as supporters of Trump rather than backers of the GOP.

Ryan is still in his party’s good graces ― 56 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners say they approve of the job he did as speaker of the House, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey, while just 27 percent disapprove. That leaves him with a net +29 approval rating, significantly better than the net +8 rating they give the congressional GOP as a whole. Roughly three in 10 say Ryan is doing better than Republicans in Congress as a whole, 41 percent that he’s about the same, and just a tenth that he’s doing worse.

Republicans and Republican leaners are split, however, on their reactions to Ryan’s announcement ― 26 percent say they wish he wasn’t retiring, and a nearly-equal 28 percent that they’re happy to see him go. The rest are unsure or profess not to care either way.

Overall, just 12 percent of Americans say they wish Ryan wasn’t retiring, while about a third are happy to see him leave, with the rest unsure or indifferent.

The show’s resident food and wine guru stripped to his skivvies for a photo posted to his Twitter and Instagram accounts on Thursday. His art director boyfriend, Joey Krietemeyer, is credited as the photographer.

A post shared by Antoni Porowski (@antoni) on Apr 12, 2018 at 8:01am PDT

As it turns out, the photo wasn’t posted simply as a thirst trap. Along with TV host Nev Schulman and former New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz, Porowski has teamed up with Hanes for its #VouchForThePouch campaign to launch its new Comfort Flex Fit boxer briefs.

“I think it’s really amazing, and I’m very proud and excited to be working with them,” Porowski told People. “When they first approached I thought it was going to be for the classic white brief which everyone loves, but then they showed me the Comfort Flex Fit boxer briefs, which are an updated modernized version, and I love them.”

“Teaming with Hanes, I feel a little more American in a good way,” the 34-year-old Canadian native added.

Needless to say, Porowski’s admirers responded enthusiastically.

Others were amused by Porowski’s use of the word “contrapposto,” defined by Merriam-Webster as “a position of the depicted human body in which twisting of the vertical axis results in hips, shoulders, and head turned in different directions.”

In art, it refers to an ancient Greek sculptural trend that involved posing human figures so that their weight rested on one leg. The form was later revived by Italian Renaissance artists.

As part of a morning media blitz, Conway attacked the former FBI director during on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” She also said Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton’s email probe late in the campaign likely crippled her White House bid at a time she was leading in the polls.

Since the Trump administration has been adamant that the president won the election fair and square, the implications of Conway’s suggestion attracted attention from all over social media, including some prominent Trump critics.

Exes Bella Hadid and The Weeknd have apparently rekindled their romance after they were spotted kissing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival over the weekend, according to multiple outlets.

The supermodel and the R&B singer, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, apparently packed on the PDA during rapper Travis Scott‘s set at Poppy nightclub’s Coachella pop-up, with onlookers declaring that they “definitely looked like they were fully back together,” according to People.

In 2016, the two split after 18 months together, reportedly due to their busy schedules, only to reunite as exes on the Victoria’s Secret runway for a fashion show ― stars, they’re just like us.

The “Starboy” singer went on to date Selena Gomez, but the two ended their relationship in October 2017 with the former Disney star getting back together with ex Justin Bieber shortly after.

Gomez and The Weeknd “have been going back and forth for a few months about their relationship,” a source told People about the split at the time. “It’s been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn’t easy on them.”

A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Apr 15, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT

The Weeknd’s new heartbreak-tinged album is rumored to be about Gomez.

During his Coachella set on Friday night, the singer got emotional while performing his new track “Call Out My Name,” belting out lyrics like, “We found each other / I helped you out of a broken place / You gave me comfort / But falling for you was my mistake.”

But don’t feel too bad for The Weeknd, as he and Hadid are reportedly inching back to a full-blown relationship after reconnecting in recent months.

“They are just getting back to a good place,” a source told E! News about the duo. “She loves hanging out with Abel and they always have fun together and is very hopeful of their future relationship.”

Adam Rippon, a bronze medalist figure skater at the Winter Olympics, won the “Dancing with the Stars” athletes-only competition on Monday with partner Jenna Johnson.

“The Mirrorball has now taken on a new meaning, someone like me is accepted and I feel loved,” Rippon, the first openly gay athlete to compete for the United States at the Winter Games, said before his last dance, according to People magazine.

Rippon and Johnson got a perfect score for a jazz routine to “Anything You Can Do” on their first performance:

Then they earned 28 out of 30 for a freestyle to “Scooby Doo Pa Pa”:

Football player Josh Norman and Shana Burgess finished second, and Tonya Harding and Sasha Farber were third.

Rippon said the trophy would go right next to his bronze medal, which he won in the team event in South Korea.

Rippon appeared to be the Mirrorball favorite from the very first show, when he and Johnson aced a vogue-ing cha cha to “Sissy That Walk.”

“You were born to do this show,” panelist Carrie Ann Inaba told Rippon at the time.

Now he’s the winner.

Chris Mosier has made his fifth national duathlon team. He finished sixth in his men’s 35-39 age group at the Draft-Legal Sprint Duathlon National Championship in Greenville, S.C., on April 7, securing his place in the 2019 World Championship in Pontevedra, Spain.

Overall Mosier finished 47th out of 305 racers, beating 84% of all of the entrants across age and gender. He competes in the men’s 35-39 category.

“I set a personal record for the distance and for the 5k run,” Mosier told Outsports. “I was hoping to place higher in the standings, but it was truly the best of the best out there this weekend, and I couldn’t be happier with my performance.

“I really feel like my best racing days are ahead of me.”

Mosier has been turning expectations of transgender athletes upside down over the last few years. While so much attention is paid to perceived “advantages” of trans women in sports, Mosier is showing that trans men can compete against cisgender men on national and world stages and perform incredibly well.

He was Outsports’ 2016 Person of the Year.

One student from each HBCU ― Xavier University of Louisiana, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University and Bethune-Cookman University ― will receive the money.

To qualify for the Homecoming Scholars Award Program, applicants need to have at least a 3.5 GPA. Each university will select its own finalists and winner, with winners set to be announced sometime this summer.

The news comes on the heels of Beyoncé’s show at Coachella, where she brought out her former Destiny’s Child bandmates for a mini-reunion. She was the first black woman to headline the major music festival.

The scholarship program is Beyoncé’s second through her philanthropic BeyGOOD initiative. Last year, BeyGood’s Formation Scholars Awards Program gave money to students studying creative arts, music, literature or African-American studies at Berklee College of Music, Parsons School of Design, Howard University and Spelman College. Those scholarships were in commemoration of the one-year anniversary of the singer’s visual album, “Lemonade.”

The announcement for the Homecoming Scholars Award Program ties the gifts to the Coachella performance, saying the show “put the spotlight on art and culture, mixing the ancient and the modern,” and was the “impetus to mark her second scholarship program.”

WASHINGTON ― A bipartisan group of senators is taking another crack at making Congress do its job and vote to authorize wars.

Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on Monday unveiled a new authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, that redefines the limits on President Donald Trump’s ability to attack non-state terrorist groups around the world. This is not related to Trump’s recent strikes in Syria.

Their proposal does four things.

Most notably, it expands Trump’s authority to take military action against al Qaeda, ISIS or the Taliban, wherever they may be geographically. It also authorizes military action against “associated forces” of those groups.

It repeals a 2002 AUMF that authorized military action in Iraq and a sweeping 2001 AUMF that allowed military action against al Qaeda.

It requires the president to report to Congress any time he sends new forces into a new country. The president has 48 hours to notify Congress, and lawmakers have 60 days to pass legislation to remove that authority if they don’t agree. If lawmakers don’t take any action, the existing authorities stay in place.

Finally, every four years, it requires the president to submit to Congress a plan to repeal, modify or keep the authorizations. If Congress does nothing within 60 days, the existing AUMF stays in place.

“For too long, Congress has given Presidents a blank check to wage war,” Kaine said in a statement. “We’ve let the 9/11 and Iraq War authorizations get stretched to justify wars against multiple terrorist groups in over a dozen countries, from Niger to the Philippines. Our proposal finally repeals those authorizations and makes Congress do its job by weighing in on where, when, and with who we are at war.”

Here’s a copy of the bill.

Co-sponsors of the bill include Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has scheduled a hearing to debate, amend and vote on his legislation next week.

“There have been a number of efforts over the years to update these authorities,” he said in a statement. “I am pleased that we have reached an agreement on a product for the committee to consider and that I hope will ultimately strike an appropriate balance of ensuring the administration has the flexibility necessary to win this fight while strengthening the rightful and necessary role of Congress.”

The senators get points for pushing an issue that Congress keeps putting off. But they’ve got serious obstacles ahead.

Republicans, who typically want to give the president as much power as possible to take military action, have reasons to get on board. But this isn’t going to go over well with Democrats who have been pushing for tighter restrictions on the president’s ability to start wars, whether it’s by imposing geographic limits or on the number of U.S. troops being deployed. They also won’t like that this AUMF doesn’t expire.

Then there’s the issue of Hill leaders letting the bill get a floor vote at all. Congress is constitutionally required to authorize any sustained military action, but House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have denied war authorization votes for years, for no real reason other than shielding their party members from a politically tough vote.

Congress’ inaction has infuriated a relatively small but bipartisan group of lawmakers who argue they are shirking their role in war-making decisions and letting presidents abuse the never-expired 2001 AUMF.

President Barack Obama stretched the legal limits of the 2001 authorization to unilaterally bomb ISIS, arguing it is an offshoot of al Qaeda. And just last week, Speaker Ryan said Trump could use the 17-year-old war authorization to bomb the Syrian government, which has nothing to do with al Qaeda.

Kaine, who has been loudly calling for a new AUMF for years, said holding a war authorization vote really comes down to lawmakers having a spine or not.Cohen managed to stop a story in Us Weekly that would have detailed a relationship Trump Jr. allegedly had with dumblonde singer Aubrey O’Day between 2011 and 2012, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. The newspaper did not say how Cohen managed to quash the piece.

American Media Inc., which also owns The National Enquirer, purchased Us Weekly in 2017 from Wenner Media. The Enquirer has been accused of paying $150,000 to buy all the rights from former Playboy model Karen McDougal about an alleged affair with Trump that the tabloid never planned to publish.

Page Six was the first to report last month on the relationship that allegedly occurred while Trump Jr. was working as an “adviser” on his father’s reality TV show. Us Weekly, for the first time last month, also reported about the relationship that it said began after the two met on the “Celebrity Apprentice” set in 2011.

Vanessa Trump last month filed for an uncontested divorce from Trump Jr. in Manhattan Supreme Court.

“After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways,” said a statement by the couple, according to CNN. “We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. We have five beautiful children together, and they remain our top priority.”

When Vanessa Trump was pregnant in 2007, her husband complained in a radio interview about what “hell” it was to be visiting the Playboy Mansion with a pregnant wife. “It doesn’t get worse than that, does it?” he asked.

The information about Us Weekly was part of a larger piece in the Journal. The paper tracked Cohen’s hush-money payments to both Stormy Daniels, the adult entertainment actress who has claimed she had an affair with Trump, and to the Playboy Playmate who had a relationship with Elliott Broidy, a major GOP donor and venture capitalist.

Broidy issued a statement last week confirming that Cohen had arranged a payment of $1.6 million to the Playboy model after Broidy learned she was pregnant. She subsequently decided to have an abortion, said Broidy, who stepped down as the Republican National Committee’s deputy finance chairman after the news broke.

The payment to Daniels came from Delaware company Essential Consultants LLC, sources told the Journal. Broidy paid Cohen’s $250,000 fee for arranging the $1.6 million to the Playboy Playmate to the same company, the newspaper reported.

Cohen’s office was raided last week by the FBI as part of a criminal probe.
