TUXTLA GUTIÉRREZ, MEXICO — Sitting at the kitchen table in her friend’s apartment, Fanny Romero flicked her fingers across the screen of her smartphone, scrolling through seemingly endless WhatsApp messages from men inquiring about her availability for the night.

Huddled up to her, Anyela Zuniga scrutinized the names flying by on the screen. “Ugh, I blocked that guy, too. He gave me the creeps,” she told her friend, pointing at one name as the scrolling came to a halt.

Both transgender women, Romero and Zuniga are sex workers in the city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the humid capital of Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas. They work for themselves, communicating with clients through Facebook and WhatsApp and deciding their own hours and rates. Their occupation involves many risks and challenges ― the biggest of them all simply staying safe while on the job.

In 2012, Mexico passed a law to combat human trafficking. Yet sex workers and their advocates say that the legislation actually hurts the people it’s intended to protect, pushing an already stigmatized profession deeper into the shadows and making people working in the country’s sex industry more vulnerable to violence and disease.

“It’s very difficult because you see that in the streets we are exposed,” Romero said from her kitchen table. “We are exposed to the possibility that a psychopath arrives and hires you, takes you to a motel, and you don’t know what kind of feelings he may have toward you.”

To have someone close in case anything goes wrong, Romero and Zuniga work out of their homes ― for Zuniga that’s the apartment she shares with two roommates, for Romero the apartment where she lives with her two chihuahuas. Romero also rents out her home to friends and acquaintances who don’t have a safe space to meet with their clients. That, however, puts her at risk of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment for up to 30 years.

When Romero rents out a room to fellow sex workers, she violates multiple articles under Mexico’s 2012 law against human trafficking. Article 20 of the law prohibits obtaining “economic benefit” from the prostitution of another person. Article 41 goes even further: it forbids anyone from facilitating or collaborating with someone to do sex work.

The human trafficking law, which was last reformed in 2014, is based on a United Nations protocol created in 2000 that aims to “to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children.” But sex workers and their advocates say that in Mexico the legislation is being used to prosecute the women and migrants the laws are supposed to protect.

As is the case for many of their colleagues, a complicated mix of circumstances puts Romero and Zuniga at risk of danger and exploitation. Mexico has decriminalized prostitution, but the practice is regulated in less than half of the country’s states, forcing many sex workers to operate in the shadows.

Migrant sex workers like Zuniga ― she migrated to Mexico several years ago to escape violence and discrimination in her home country of Honduras ― often lack a local support system and are less likely to know their rights. This makes them vulnerable to human rights violations.

Transgender women suffer a third layer of vulnerability. A 2016 University of Toronto Law School report found that Mexico had the second highest number of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the Americas. At least 594 LGBTQ individuals (or people perceived as such) were killed in attacks that appeared related to their sexual orientation or gender identity between January 2013 and March 2014, according to the Organization of American States. Half of those victims were transgender women.

There are several reasons the anti-trafficking law has become a tool to prosecute rather than protect sex workers, said Vanessa Maldonado, a PhD student in Mexico City who has studied the legislation. She says that the law doesn’t make a clear distinction between trafficking and sex work and therefore doesn’t force authorities to distinguish between voluntary and forced prostitution.

One unintended consequence is that during an arrest, police put sex workers into one of two categories: victim or trafficker. If the sex worker admits to prostitution, they’re obliged to name a trafficker.

For migrant workers, the dilemma brings heightened concerns, Maldonado said. In addition to sex workers, armed raids on bars and clubs throughout Chiapas have ensnared women employed as waitresses and bartenders, according to Maldonado. Many of those arrested are migrants from Central America. If they don’t reveal a trafficker’s name, they face the threat of deportation or are labeled traffickers themselves. Many see no other option than naming a co-worker as the head of the supposed “operation.”

Central American migrants are disproportionately targeted under the anti-trafficking law, Centro Prodh, one of Mexico’s leading human rights organizations said in a 2016 report. When the organization first began researching the situation in 2015, 24 percent of the inmates in the women’s prison outside of Tapachula were held on human trafficking charges. Of that group, 70 percent were migrant women from Central America.

The report highlighted the cases of six women ― five Central American migrants and one Mexican ― all of whom local authorities arrested and imprisoned in Chiapas on charges of human trafficking. The Centro Prodh investigation found that prosecutors used illegal evidence in all of their cases, including confessions and accusations acquired through coercion, threats and degrading treatment. Two of the women told the human rights group that they were tricked or forced into signing blank sheets of paper. These signatures later appeared on confessions of guilt.

Sex workers and their advocates are not the only critics of how Mexico’s law classifies victims. U.S. Department of State reports show a drastic increase in convictions of alleged traffickers and rescues of victims in Mexico since the passage of the 2012 law. In 2011, before the law was passed, Mexico reported 14 convictions and 89 victims. By 2016, those numbers had shifted to 228 convictions and 740 victims.

The increase in arrests and rescues don’t necessarily indicate an increase in the crime of human trafficking. The State Department’s 2017 Trafficking in Persons report indicated that “some public officials misunderstood the legal definition of trafficking and conflated it with migrant smuggling and prostitution.” It also faulted Mexican authorities for orchestrating “anti-trafficking raids for the purpose of detaining individuals in prostitution and irregular migrants.”

Local governments have been complicit with real incidents of human trafficking, the 2017 report also suggested. “Despite persistent reports of extensive official complicity, authorities did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking in 2016,” the report reads. “The government has not convicted a complicit official since 2010.”

Federal and state officials in Mexico did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In the cases where they do arrest and prosecute someone who is actually involved in human trafficking, it’s typically someone very low down in the operation, said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the research and human rights advocacy organization, the Washington Office on Latin America.

“There certainly doesn’t seem to be as much investigative capacity or focus on going after leaders of trafficking networks,” she added.

This is similar to what Maldonado has seen in Chiapas. She does not see the raids as effective for catching actual criminals. “Human trafficking still thrives,” she said. “What they are actually doing is going after sex workers, going after undocumented migrants and allowing real human trafficking to continue.”

Romero and Zuniga continue trying to make their livings as safely as possible without being ensnared by the laws that are supposed to protect them. It’s a fine line to walk. “Perhaps in the moment they see it as easy money,” Romero said. “But we are risking our lives more than everything, and you can’t buy life or bring it back.”South Korean demonstrators hold banners during a rally to mark International Women's Day as part of the country's Me Too movement in Seoul on March 8, 2018.

By Kim Hyun-Yoo, Jessica Prois HuffPost Korea/HuffPost U.S.

A measure that involves avoiding contact with women as a way to buffer oneself against allegations of abuse has traversed the globe from the U.S. and found its way to South Korea. And apparently, we’re back to 14th-century Chosun Dynasty standards.

Searches and posts about the “Mike Pence rule” spread across social platforms and within Korean search portal Naver News last week, with internet users pointing to it as a “countermeasure” to avoid being called out by the Me Too movement.

The concept of the “Mike Pence rule,” covered by the Korea Times and other outlets, was a term coined from an interview last year with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, in which he said that he never eats alone with women other than his wife to avoid accusations of sexual harassment.

In Korea, this measure comes with its own brand of reproach. Avoiding one-on-one time with women in a country that already has the largest gender wage gap among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations actually impedes progress.

South Korea ranks 118th of 144 in terms of gender equality, and women earn 63 percent of what men earn. To be sure, Korea is a deeply patriarchal society, where men and elders maintain authority and domination, so this power imbalance is entrenched.

And now, accusations of wrongdoing against famous politics, lawyers and authors have led to a countermovement to Me Too in Korea. Bank teller Park Won-ji provided an example of the “Pence rule” to the Chosun Ilbo, a major South Korean newspaper, saying that her boss has decided to communicate with his female staff members through text messages rather than in-person.

“I feel like I’ve become a criminal in the office. I have done nothing wrong, but men are leaving me out of their gatherings and sometimes treat me as if I am invisible,” Park told the news outlet.

There is, of course, a countermeasure to the countermeasure, with many in Korea pointing to arguments that invalidate the “rule,” such as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg speaking out about how it would be a huge roadblock for equality. She offered the reminder that there is still an imbalance in creating fairness for women since there are far more male executives on a given staff than female.

“I feel like I’ve become a criminal in the office. I have done nothing wrong, but men are leaving me out of their gatherings and sometimes treat me as if I am invisible.” - Bank teller Park Won-ji, speaking to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper

But beyond those workplace dynamics, the presumption of sexual harassment in every interaction characterizes both men and women as lacking agency and also discounts structural issues that impede gender equality. Korean society ― or any society ― won’t prosper this way.

When the ideas behind the “Mike Pence rule” began circulating in the U.S., anecdotes included a male surgeon saying he no longer greets a colleague with a hug, detailed in The Washington Post, and issues with canceling one-on-one meetings on work trips.

The Post points out not only does the Pence rule abdicate men of responsibility and cast woman as untrustworthy narrators, it also implies men are motivated strictly by sex. As the Post points out:

“Instituting rules that create de facto segregation by gender is a tacit admission that men are inherently unable to control themselves around women. If we follow the logic to its natural end, the inevitable conclusion is that the only line separating a co-worker and a harassment suit is convenience.”

Emma Gray, writing for HuffPost, points out men are certainly better than that.

In the wake of the allegations of misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, Gray also noted that workplace mobility is undeniably related to forming the right relationships and establishing proper allies.

In Korea, where longstanding traditions can create boys’ club workplaces, and where bonding is often carried out in the form of drinking after hours, women don’t need another obstacle.

As Gray pointed out, if men decide to limit their interactions with women, women are the ones left to pick up the pieces of the ensuing disrepute: “Let’s put the onus for professional behavior where it belongs ― on the male power-brokers ― rather than punishing the women who have to deal with their predatory behavior.”

Ohio GOP congressional candidate Christina Hagan is using dramatic video footage of migrants in Morocco hastily climbing a wall to suggest Mexicans at the southern U.S. border in a campaign ad.

The footage, as CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski pointed out in a tweet Friday, can be traced to a 2014 report on migrants crossing from Morocco into territory occupied by Spain on the African mainland, aired on the Italian television network RepubblicaTV.

“We must stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into this country,” says Hagan in a voiceover as colorless video shows dozens of people streaming over the border. Hagan, an enthusiastic supporter of President Donald Trump, is running to replace a retiring Republican in the congressional race.

I will fight to #DrainTheSwamp, secure our borders, protect good paying jobs, and stop disastrous trade deals!

It’s at least the second time a conservative candidate has used the Morocco footage in an attempt to stir anti-immigrant sentiment.

Trump himself used it in early 2016 during his presidential run, PolitiFact reported. Halfway through the ad, as the migrant footage plays, a narrator says Trump will “stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for.”

A longer version of the clip can be seen here:

Three women who have accused President Donald Trump of sexual harassment and assault recently sat down with People magazine to share their thoughts on Stormy Daniels, the porn star who says Trump’s personal attorney paid her to stay silent about an affair with the president.

“I think I have more respect for her than for our president. I never thought I’d be rooting for a porn star, I think it’s a more honest way to make a living than what he’s doing,” said one accuser, who asked to stay anonymous because of the threats she received after going public with her story. The outlet noted that the woman has accused Trump of grabbing and kissing her without her consent.

Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, says she had an affair with Trump starting in 2006, a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to Trump’s youngest son, Barron. Her story received renewed attention in January when it was revealed that Trump’s attorney arranged a $130,000 payment to Daniels before the 2016 election ― an exchange that may be illegal. Trump has denied allegations of an affair and any knowledge of the payment, and Daniels is currently fighting a legal battle to share her full story publicly.

Journalist Natasha Stoynoff, who accused Trump of pinning her against a wall and kissing her in 2005, told People that she is also a fan of Daniels.

“Let’s just say that all week I’ve been envisioning her as Time’s ‘Person of the Year’ come December,” Stoynoff said of Daniels, adding that she’s definitely cheering on the porn star and accomplished equestrian.

Trump has been accused by 21 women of sexual misconduct, including harassment, assault and rape. The president has categorically denied all allegations and called them “fake news.”

“She’s got a lot of guts and like many women, I trust she’s had enough of his lies. Here’s hoping she puts an end to them once and for all for the sake of country,” Stoynoff said.

She added, “From what I’ve seen so far, I like her.”

Jessica Leeds, who says Trump groped her on a plane in the 1980s, is not as sold on Daniels and the possible effect her story could have.

“His supporters don’t care,” Leeds said. “They knew all along and accepted the fact. I don’t think it will change anyone’s opinion, even if she wins her suit.”Apparently there’s one thing that National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch hates almost as much as sensible gun laws: Neil Young’s singing voice.

Loesch has tweeted at least 15 negative comments about the rock legend over the past decade, according to the Daily Beast, including referring to his voice as “a dying cow fart” at least three times.

@chris_renner Love that tag. Geebus I loathe Neil Young. His voice sounds like a bloated cow farting and dying all at once. — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) June 4, 2010

My stepdad likes Neil Young. I always thought Neil Young had the vocal tonality of a dying cow fart. He’s also hard of hearing. My stepdad. — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) June 17, 2015

Young was apparently unaware that he’s been targeted by Loesch until the Daily Beast called it to his attention.

He was amused. Very amused.

“The spokesperson? That woman? She doesn’t like me?” he asked. “Well, she’s one of the gang over there. Although Trump likes my music. He’d come to all my shows.”

After a pause, he said, “Well, I’m glad I got under her skin.”

As for the comparison that Young’s singing voice sounds like bovine flatulence, he wondered, “Why doesn’t she just shoot me?”

He then thought better of his glib response.

“You know, I hate to say that, because I have kids and I really don’t want anybody to shoot me. I’ve still got to bring up my kids, so don’t take that seriously!”

Although Loesch has gone as far to suggest that if she ever won the Powerball, she would pay Young, Nickelback and Bush to stop playing, the Canadian-born Young says she’s entitled to her opinion.

YouTube singer/songwriter Chase Holfelder, who is best known for his “Major to Minor” series, put together a version of the company’s famous jingle in a sad minor key.“Love, Simon” has generated a whirlwind of pre-release buzz as Hollywood’s first mainstream coming-of-age comedy to center on a gay teen. Regardless of how the movie fares with critics and audiences, it represents a more personal milestone for actor Keiynan Lonsdale.

Lonsdale plays Bram Greenfeld, a high school soccer jock and one of several possible swoonworthy love interests for the film’s closeted protagonist, Simon Spier (Nick Robinson). Prior to being cast in the role, the actor had never spoken publicly about his sexuality. At the movie’s wrap party in Atlanta last year, he came out as bisexual.

“Timing is a very funny thing. I never imagined, especially as I was going through my own issues, that I would get to play this character in a queer love story,” the 26-year-old told HuffPost. The film, which hits theaters Friday, “gave me a kick to reflect and think about how I wanted to deal with my internalized shame,” he added.

Unlike some of his cast mates, the Aussie-born actor worked with director Greg Berlanti previously on the CW series “The Flash.” Lonsdale said witnessing Berlanti interact with his now-husband, Robbie Rogers, and the couple’s son, Caleb, on the “Love, Simon” set convinced him that the time was right to live authentically.

“I realized, ‘Wow, all the circumstances here are so perfect.’ Here’s a gay director with his family on set, I’m playing this character in a gay love story, and everyone is so supportive and accepting,” he said. “Yet here I am, with so much fear. I’m the only one who’s holding me back at this point.”

He continued, “The characters in the film were growing more than I was. I was like, ‘Damn! These are high school kids, and I’m not completely brave enough yet.’” (It should be noted that both Lonsdale’s co-star Joey Pollari and Robinson’s real-life brother were inspired by the film to come out publicly.)

A post shared by 🌊❤️💫🌸 Keiynan Lonsdale 🔑🎶🍭🌱 (@keiynanlonsdale) on May 12, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT

Shortly after opening up about his sexuality to his “Love, Simon” cast mates, Lonsdale relayed the news to his fans in a powerful Instagram post in May.

“I like to take risks with how I dress,” he wrote in the post, which currently has more than 89,000 likes. “I like girls and I like guys (yes), I like growing, I like learning, I like who I am and I really like who I’m becoming.”

Since then, the actor said, he’s received “genuine support and love” from young LGBTQ people, some of whom may still be coming to terms with their sexuality. It’s something he doesn’t take for granted, especially given the rampant biphobia that exists within the queer community.

Lonsdale, who is half-Nigerian, would like audiences to witness Bram’s on-screen journey to acceptance in “Love, Simon” with similar enthusiasm. The actor believes seeing a black actor or entertainer “who was open and proud of who he was” would’ve had a huge impact on him as a closeted teen and aspiring performer.

What much of Lonsdale’s newfound “Love, Simon” fan base may not realize is that he began his career as a singer and a dancer. He released a hip-hop single, “Good Life,” last year, and is currently at work on a full-length album. Meanwhile, he’s continuing to build his TV résumé, and will join the CW’s “Legends of Tomorrow” as a series regular this year.

Moving forward, Lonsdale said his only mission is to “be honest about my own journey.”

“All I can do is be exactly me,” he said, “and hope that connects with people that are wanting to be exactly them.”Marvel hinted at, and then promised us, a new “Avengers: Infinity War” trailer this week, and they delivered.

“Infinity War,” directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is due out April 27. Its latest trailer, released Friday, is packed to the brim with ... well, it’s just packed. And in the best way.

Ultimate Marvel Cinematic Universe villain Thanos takes center stage. We see flashbacks of the mad Titan meeting a young Gamora, his “adopted” daughter. (Adopted is in quotes because he killed her parents, tortured her and turned her into a weapon ― not your standard adoption process.)

Gamora and the other Guardians of the Galaxy will finally connect with the Avengers to help stop Thanos from wiping out half of the universe. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord meets Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, and the encounter looks to go as comedically well as we’d all hoped.

There’s plenty of Spidey, Black Panther and, of course, Captain America, who we now know meets Thanos face-to-face in what looks like Wakanda.

“Black Panther,” the last Marvel Studios film, crushed it at the box office. Add the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to Wakanda, and we could see box office records broken once again.

AdvertisementReproductive rights have emerged as a flashpoint in the Democratic primary race for Rep. Dan Lipinski’s (Ill.) seat in Congress, as the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List pours money into helping the right-leaning incumbent defeat his progressive challenger, Marie Newman.

SBA List, a political action committee that normally works to elect anti-abortion Republicans, made the unusual move of endorsing Lipinski this week and spending six figures on ads for his campaign ahead of Tuesday’s primary. SBA’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, called Lipinski “a hero to the pro-life movement” because he opposes a woman’s right to choose abortion and even some forms of birth control. She said the group is trying to save one of its last remaining allies in the Democratic Party.

“They are draining the party dry of any pro-life sentiment,” Dannenfelser told McClatchy. “There’s no tolerance for even pro-choice candidates who think late-term abortion is a bridge too far. No toleration for pro-choicers who think being pro-choice is consistent with being against late-term abortion.”

Lipinski is facing a fierce primary challenge from Newman, a progressive businesswoman who is backed by the powerful abortion rights groups EMILY’s List and NARAL as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Newman challenged Lipinski on reproductive rights in a side-by-side interview set to air Friday evening on Fox 32 in Chicago. Lipinski defended his vote against the Affordable Care Act in 2010, explaining that he opposed the provision requiring religious groups to cover birth control in their health care plans.

“I don’t think the Little Sisters of the Poor should be forced to provide abortion-inducing drugs, things that go against their beliefs,” Lipinski said.

“It’s called birth control, Mr. Lipinski,” Newman responded.

Lipinski also opposes LGBTQ rights, the $15-per-hour minimum wage and the Dream Act, and he refused to endorse Obama for president in 2012. The Blue Dog Democrat considers himself a moderate and has characterized Newman as belonging to the “tea party of the left” ― too liberal for his southwest Chicago district.Tonight at 11/10c, Fox News short-circuits after #NationalWalkoutDay pic.twitter.com/PGOTJMvovX — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) March 16, 2018

Despite what you may have heard, Ariana Grande still has some tears left to cry.

The pop star became emotional during a candid interview with Time magazine about the terrorist attack that followed her concert in Manchester, England, a year ago that killed 22 people.

Grande has been relatively quiet about her feelings about the bombing, preferring to focus on the victims and their families.

“I don’t want to give it that much power,” Grande, sobbing, told the magazine for its Next Generation Leaders issue. “Something so negative. It’s the absolute worst of humanity. That’s why I did my best to react the way I did. The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.”

Time

“Music is supposed to be the safest thing in the world,” she continued. “I think that’s why it’s still so heavy on my heart every single day.”

After the bombing, the singer said she wanted to cancel her scheduled concerts ― she was midway through the Dangerous Woman tour at the time. Days later, she had an epiphany.

“If I don’t do something, these people died in vain,” manager Scooter Braun said Grande told him at the time.

Grande returned to Manchester a month later for a benefit concert alongside artists Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Coldplay that raised $12 million for families of the victims.

“I wish there was more that I could fix,” she told Time. “You think with time it’ll become easier to talk about. Or you’ll make peace with it. But every day I wait for that peace to come and it’s still very painful.”

In April, Grande dropped her first single after the attack, an anthemic bop called “No Tears Left To Cry” that speaks to her own resilience, as well as that of her millions of fans.

“There are so many people who have suffered such loss and pain,” she said. “The processing part is going to take forever.”“Monty Python” star John Cleese is no fan of President Donald Trump.

(By Susan Hood)Shepard Smith derided the journalistic rigor of Fox News opinion programming in an interview with Time magazine, arguing that Fox employees “on the opinion side” can “say whatever they want” because they’re expressing their opinions and not facts.

His comments were a not-so-veiled dig at Fox personalities like Sean Hannity, who criticized Smith, the host of “Shepard Smith Reporting,” as “so anti-Trump” last year. Smith fired back then that “sometimes facts are displeasing; journalists report them without fear or favor.”

“We serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules,” Smith told Time in a profile of him published on Thursday. “They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want. I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming; I’m busy.”

He added: “Some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don’t work there. I wouldn’t work there. I don’t want to sit around and yell at each other and talk about your philosophy and my philosophy.”

“I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming; I’m busy.” - Shepard Smith

Smith and Hannity offer dramatically different perspectives on just about everything. Earlier this month, Hannity praised President Donald Trump in the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 people. Smith reported that while Trump had vowed to survivors that he’d “go strong” on gun control, he quickly backpedaled after he met with representatives of the National Rifle Association.

Smith told Time that he plans to continue to stick to the facts, and said that can often anger conservative Fox viewers. He aims to present news and information “so that you can make decisions about your life and your family” — not to confirm viewers’ worldviews, he stated.

His work can be demanding, Smith said, but his personal life affords him relief. “I have a longtime boyfriend and we’re as happy as we can be,” he told Time. In a speech last spring at his alma mater, the University of Mississippi, Smith said, “I cover the news. I deal with holy hell around me. I go home to the man I’m in love with.”

As for the rest, he says, “I just wish everyone weren’t so angry about it all. I wish that we could have lighter moments and not always be on guard with each other.”

Smith joined Fox in 1996 when the network was founded. Fox announced Thursday that the company has signed Smith to a new multi-year contract as chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news, but did not reveal the terms of the agreement.

“Shepard Smith is an exemplary journalist whose skill in anchoring breaking news is unrivaled,” Fox News’ executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, said in a statement.

AdvertisementLilysmom_11, the white woman’s username, was just trying to take her other daughter, Destiny, to school when “this rap song comes on and it was just ...” She pauses, fighting back tears before regaining her composure. “Disgusting.” She digs into the song, reading off the uncensored lyrics before choking up again and expressing disbelief that the track, Paper Boi’s latest banger, would be played on a mainstream radio station.

So begins the third episode of Season 2 of Donald Glover’s “Atlanta”: with white tears. The reference here is clearly to the famous 13-minute video from 2016 in which a white mother of four goes on an emotional tirade about Vince Staples’ song “Norf Norf.” The song played on a Top 40 radio station while she was driving with her children, and, as she related in the video, she immediately grew upset by the lyrics. “This is on our local radio station, this crap is being played,” she said. “I couldn’t even believe the words that I was listening to. As a mom, it infuriated me.” Like “Lily’s mom,” the unnamed woman recited the unedited song lyrics ― which we doubt played on a Top 40 station ― and frequently stopped to choke back tears as she pondered the question of “why society is so messed up.”

The way Glover uses white women to critique the fraught relationship between white folks and black music is one of many things Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss on this week’s “Run That Back.” (Spoiler alert: We’ll be giving away some plot points.) Other topics at hand include flipping white tears for free liquor; why, exactly, Earn keeps getting stunted on; and just how much Glover’s brilliance got us fucked up.

Earn, Paper Boi and Darius laugh about the video at a bar and attribute the song’s growing profile to the power of a white woman’s tears. The bartender walks over with a free round of shots and takes one with them before “suddenly” recognizing Paper Boi. He asks Paper Boi repeatedly to put him on a track, which makes the rapper visibly uneasy. When Earn interjects, the unnamed server snaps at him, and Earn declines to assert himself as Paper Boi’s manager.

Julia: Donald Glover got me fucked up.

Taryn: RT Donald Glover got me fucked up. I feel personally victimized by Season 2, Episode 3.

Julia: I am victimized and slightly confused as well. Let’s just start from the beginning here because there’s a lot to unpack this go ’round, and I don’t want Glover to have me more fucked up than he already does. The white woman. Her Instagram. My laugh.

Taryn: That white woman was HURT. I hollered the entire time, and I’m so thankful Donald is making fun of these real-life viral white shenanigans. That truly feeds my soul. She sat up there and read the lyrics as if the version her baby heard wasn’t the damn edited version. I was truly laughing at her pain. Idk who’s worse, this lady or the woman who was told by AppleCare that somebody gave a damn about her white feelings.

Julia: AppleCare owes me some money, so I ain’t mad. But, nah, I took the opening song a few ways ― mainly as Paper Boi addressing how he felt in Episode 2. “Bitch, I need reparations. Niggas tired of dancing like The Temptations.” That, to me, reeks of his experiences at Fresh in Episode 2. Also the use of white women to depict the whites’ disconnect to blackness and black music has been interesting this season. All the white people we’ve encountered thus far either want to appropriate, profit, profile or cry about the fact that they can do none of the above.

And idk about the edited version. They cuss on the radio in Georgia sometimes. God bless the Peach State, forever. The white woman’s video was also DUMB, similar to that video of the white woman crying about Vince Staples you sent me! [below]

Taryn: Oh, then I see why so many artists thrive there. #DeathToCensorship. But you’re so right. They want to do everything to black music but understand it ― or leave it the hell alone to just be at the very least. Same way it operates IRL. But Paper Boi, Earn and Darius wasn’t hurt over her shit though lol.

Julia: I love how they took the publicity and got some free shots of 1800 off it. They flipped white tears. ICONIC! **Joanne voice**

Taryn: THAT GAVE ME SO MUCH JOY! From now on, I’m referring to tequila as white tears.

Julia: As will I, sis. As will I. Solidarity.

Taryn: But that waiter who tried to use those lil free shots as an opening to “build” with Paper Boi wasn’t slick at all. And Earn is too passive to be an Atlanta rapper’s manager. He should’ve been able to shut that down with the quickness.

Julia: THAT REALLY HAD ME BENT. LIKE EARN! SAY YOU’RE HIS MANAGER!! “YOU ARE TALKING TO ME, BITCH! I’M HIS MANAGER!” ― that’s all Earn had to say.

Taryn: As we see in yet another scenario, he just ain’t bout that life. And really, throughout this entire episode, we see how Earn just lets shit happen to him without really drawing clear boundaries. He wants to “stunt” but doesn’t understand how to do it in a way that’s truly beneficial to him.

Julia: Exactly! He doesn’t know how to benefit anyone, not even himself, which is bizarre. And his refusal to stand his ground is becoming a theme, and I wonder when he’s gonna have a true breaking point. It’s maddening to watch so I know it’s maddening to experience constantly being stunted on. I just can’t wrap my mind around being that passive, but I walk around thinking my bones dense af all the time so me and Earn ain’t cut from the same cloth. How you the manager for the biggest rising star in the Atlanta rap scene but you don’t have any bass in your voice? Come on, Earn. Start speaking with ya chest, lil nigga.

Taryn: He finally gets the chance to stunt when he finally gets a little coin from this music shit. He gets a check ― which, I’m assuming, had at least one comma ― and wants to treat Van to a date night. Before he can even cash the check, we already know he’s about to fuck up the money because refer to Episode 2. Van is too good for his mess.

Julia: Aight — so let’s parlay into the movie theater scene.

After getting a check off music sales, Earn decides that he, once again, wants to use the little bit of money he has to stunt on the people who so frequently stunt on him. Instead of a fun night out with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Vanessa, he’s racially profiled twice ― the first time by a white woman at an upscale (read: white) movie theater and then again by an African club owner ― and swindled out of his money at a strip club before being humiliated in the club’s parking lot after deciding to race … wait, for it ...

MICHAEL FUCKING VICK.

Taryn: Earn takes Van to a fancy iPic-esque movie theater. His intentions should be to make up for being a shitty boyfriend in Season 1, but no. He just wants to stunt. He pulls out a $100 bill and, of course, the racist woman who works at the theater says they don’t take bills that high. When he tries to pay with his card, she claims they need to make a copy of his ID and card. Earn is, yet again, confronted with his blackness in a white space.

Watch racism work.

Julia: “This is a new policy” is what got me. I was at a D.C. bar one night and they came up with a new ID policy when I asked to order a drink. I have my old vertical ID and they magically stopped taking verticals that night. This was after chastising me for where I sat and looking at me crazy from the time I walked in the door. I say all of this to say that Earn’s experience hit home. This is something all black people deal with and, as frustrating as it was to see him just brush it off and leave ― albeit after a white dude basically pulled a gun on him ― that’s what so many of us do.

When Earn said, “I should be able to use a $100 bill,” I screamed at the TV. We SHOULD be able to, but we often can’t because a black person couldn’t possibly have any money, right? And then Van basically trolling him and refusing to call it racism was annoying but symbolic of the mental gymnastics we all play in these scenarios. “It was weird.” No, it was racist.

Taryn: I couldn’t fault him for that because I probably would’ve done the same thing, then wrote a tweet thread about it later. Hell, I probably HAVE done the same thing. And the folks who’ve done that to me have looked at me with the same “Yea, you’re not welcome here because of your skin color and there’s nothing you can do about it” look that that white lady gave Earn and Van. Legal U.S. tender means nothing when you’re a black person at the wrong (read: white) place.

Julia: And the fact that she wanted to scan his credit card .... I was livid. She had some fucking nerve.

Taryn: I also appreciate how Glover highlighted that this anti-black attitude isn’t always exclusive to uppity venues. When the cops rolled up on Earn and Van at the hookah lounge, I was really tight cause I knew it was about to be about the C note again.

Julia: That scene really exposed how Africans can treat and how they sometimes view black Americans. And I like how Glover showed us that the police ― who knew the bill was real but went along with the club owner ― truly only serve and protect those in power despite who’s right in the situation.

Taryn: MESSAGE! And it was only THEN that Earn admitted that that was some racist shit.

Julia: And I know Earn just wanted to stunt but got damn, he should be able to blow his money and make his piss-poor financial decisions without being profiled. We all should.

Earn’s night really just ... it just ... Donald Glover got me fucked up.

Taryn: You know what else I enjoyed? The fact that they finally went to a strip club. Like it’s Atlanta, strip club capital of the world. It’s a crime that it took them this long to get to Onyx, tbh.

Julia: My fave part was Earn getting dusted by Michael Vick in the Onyx parking lot and not recognizing that the nigga he was racing was MICHAEL FUCKING VICK. I also loved how the dancers and bottle girls weaseled Earn out of his check.

Taryn: Earn needed a W so bad and didn’t realize that he was looking for it in all the wrong places. “It’s Michael Vick.” — Van.

Julia: That’s the most Atlanta L I can think of. You lost money in a parking lot race against Michael Vick out front of Onyx. I’m fucking lkjhgfdfghjkalsdfghj

Taryn: And the whole experience inside Onyx was just so real. Earn getting taxed for turning his money into ones. The DJ shaming Earn for passing the stage and not tipping the dancer. Van feeling bad for the girl whose gimmick is to look like a rookie. Tracy falling in love with one of the strippers and taking up all of her time. Hell, ”The Players Club’s” portrayal of strip clubs wasn’t even this authentic.

Julia: I thought about the money they shave off the top when you exchange your bills at Stadium lmao. Also men who don’t tip dancers should be shamed. Broke bitch. Pay her! She’s performing for you! She deserves!

Taryn: That really pisses me off. WHY ARE YOU HERE IF YOU AREN’T TIPPING??? LEAVE. GO. BYE. WITH YOUR LAVENDER.

Julia: GO BACK TO WHERE YA CAME FROM!

Taryn: Paper Boi also knew the jig. He broke down the whole game of why stunting won’t fix Earn’s problems. He thinks money is gonna get him closer to success but he doesn’t realize that his idea of success aligns with whiteness and no matter how close in proximity he gets to it, he’ll never truly achieve it because the system isn’t for him. Albert “Paper Boi” Miles came through with the reality check: “Money is an idea, man. There’s a reason why a white man dressed just like you can walk into a bank and get a loan and you can’t even spend a $100 bill.”

Julia: MESSAGE LIKE SHIT!!!

Before they join Earn and Van at the strip club, Darius and Paper Boi spend some time in the studio with rapper Clark County. The young rapper schools Paper Boi on the power of connections and how white executives make space for only one black person so he makes sure it’s him. After asking Paper Boi to lay down a track with him, Clark County, who doesn’t smoke or drink, bounces into the studio to rap about smoking and drinking. When the audio recording software crashes, Clark County threatens his audio engineer with physical violence, which seems oddly out of character. It’s a dynamic scene that leave Paper Boi and Darius quite speechless.

Taryn: But you know what I really wasn’t ready for? The studio scene with Paper Boi, Darius and Clark County.

Julia: Before we go there, I wanna give a final shoutout to Michael Vick. Good day to Michael Vick and Michael Vick only and only Michael Vick. Now, on to Clark County!

Taryn: LMAO! It was peak niggadom from the jump. They brought weed and a pint of Henny to the studio thinking they were about to have a lit-ass session with Mr. Yoohoo himself. They were everything but right lmao.

Julia: So is Clark County an abuser? I did not get this scene at all despite watching it three times. I need help. He doesn’t drink. He doesn’t smoke. He’s a bubblegum rapper (I love this genre of rap) but ... is he supposed to be XXXstation or Kashi Cereal 69 or something? Idk them niggas’ names.

Taryn: Clark County is something tf else. He’s a rapper who’s found more success than Paper Boi (Yoohoo sponsorship, “The Fast and the Furious” soundtrack money) because he’s played the game in a very narcissistic, abusive and perpetrating-ass way (like the niggas you named).

He turns down the Henny and kush Paper Boi and Darius offer, then goes into the studio and raps about those very things. When his audio engineer’s software crashes, he threatens him in this very sinister, yet passive-aggressive way. It was SOOO disturbing, yet a brilliant way of reflecting on who the industry lets get a piece of the pie. You can be a shit person who hurts people, but if you make a fire track and rub elbows with enough white folks, you gucci. (Not Mane, of course. All respect due to Mr. Icy, himself)

Even when Paper Boi asked him how he gets all of his deals, Clark said they only let one black rapper in and he gotta get it by any means. So he does. Fuck who he hurts or lies to in the process. Come to think about it, that’s probably why he had his brolic-ass security handle the engineer. He didn’t give them directives to whoop his ass, but they knew what the deal was when he left the room. It absolves Clark of any legal repercussions. No face, no case.

Julia: Omg.

Taryn: Also, I’m Paper Boi and Darius coming back for the half-empty bottle of Henny after security told them to GTFO.

Julia: Wow. I’m mind blown. That makes sense. I thought it was odd that he didn’t smoke and drink, but I didn’t catch that he went in the studio and rapped about it. Do you think this is Glover’s way of saying that authenticity doesn’t get you the bag anymore? Because it use to! But now maybe not so much.

Taryn: Definitely. People don’t care about real shit anymore. If the hook is catchy and the 808s are knocking, damn the facts. Hell, it doesn’t even have to be written by said rapper. This could be a reach, but this climate may even be why Donald Glover is retiring his musical persona, Childish Gambino. I digress, though.

Julia: It could be! I did enjoy just how much Clark County stressed connections and having a good manager. To me, it’s another clue that Earn won’t be Paper Boi’s manager by the end of the season.

Taryn: You’re calling it early, and I truly believe you.Anti-racist protester DeAndre Harris, who was brutally beaten by a group of white supremacists, had the assault charges filed against him dropped after a judge said on Friday the 20-year-old black man was defending himself.

On Aug. 12, a violent white nationalist rally took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead at the hands of an alleged white supremacist. Counterprotesters, including Harris, clashed with the white extremists during the “Unite the Right” event. Photos and video taken the day of the rally show a group of white men attacking Harris in the Market Street Parking Garage.

Harris suffered a concussion, a knee injury and a head laceration, among other injuries, during the assault.

Harold Crews, a lawyer and a neo-Confederate League of the South leader, filed a police report against Harris, alleging the 20-year-old hit him over the head with a flashlight while in the parking garage. Officers then arrested Harris in October on a felony assault charge, news that white nationalist cheered online.

But on Friday, Charlottesville General District Judge Robert Downer Jr. dismissed the charges against Harris, agreeing that the defendant acted in self-defense during the attack.The ladies of Twitter never fail to brighten our days with their brilliant ― but succinct ― wisdom.

Trixie Mattel already snatched hearts and wigs as the lovable underdog turned internet sensation, and now she’s snatched the trophy, becoming the third queen to be crowned on “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” on Thursday night.

The reality competition series has produced a roster of megawatt stars since it premiered nearly a decade ago, but with her blend of self-deprecation and life-sized doll aesthetics, Mattel is also one of the most successful: She’s now topping iTunes charts with her folk music album “One Stone” and stars on Viceland’s weekly “The Trixie and Katya Show.”

The 28-year-old performer might have the best post-“Drag Race” track record around, but her journey on “All Stars” Season 3 hasn’t been without its ups and downs.

After front-runner BenDeLaCreme removed herself from the race mere episodes shy from the finale, the crown was anyone’s for the taking. When a jury of the eliminated queens decided the fates of the final two, unexpectedly striking out the fan favorite Shangela and first season queen Bebe Zahara Benet, Mattel went on to best fellow Season 7 queen Kennedy Davenport in a powerhouse final lip-sync to Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball.”

Both Mattel and Davenport struggled at points during the competition, unlike the previous season’s winner, Alaska Thunderfuck, who was pegged to slay the game before the first episode even aired. Mattel’s win arrives at a time when the “Drag Race” plates are shifting, as its legion of fans are questioning if the twists-for-twists-sake format is robbing some of the most talented queens of a victory. She’s also the third white drag queen ― Mattel is half Native American but refers to herself as a “boring white dude” ― to enter into the hall of fame, causing an uproar after the episode aired on social media.

We caught up with Mattel after her win and, oh, honey, did she spill about everything, including her post-“All Stars” plans, the reception to the finale and what she plans to do with the prize money.

Your journey on “Drag Race” has been tumultuous in the best way, and it feels long overdue for you to go out on a high note. Did you ever expect to be an all star, and what’s your headspace like after the finale?

I’ve always played the game in my career as if this will never happen. I’m happy it happened, but I definitely didn’t ever count on it or bank on it. Both times previously I lost on “Drag Race,” so I’ve only been a winner for like 12 hours. I think if you’re a real all star, you go out and you’re an all star whether or not you never do “Drag Race” again. I envision myself quitting drag some day and being able to say I won the Olympics of drag. That’s cool, but you can be a really strong athlete and not necessarily win the Olympics. I hate to say I feel almost the same, but I just feel really lucky. Shangela, Bebe and Kennedy were so good, and it literally could’ve been any of us.

“The Trixie & Katya Show” is already a success, and your album is topping the charts. What’s next for you?

Well, I’m currently nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award, a major culinary arts award, which is hilarious, so I would like to win this major food award. My album came out yesterday, and I hope people hear it and love it. I’m doing 40-plus cities of a United States tour of my show “Moving Parts,” so people will be able to come see me play my guitar and tell jokes in real life. I’ll be writing a new show this summer. The wheels keep turning. “Drag Race” is really cool, but I’ve always got the next 10 monopoly moves ready.

A post shared by Trixie Mattel (@trixiemattel) on Mar 14, 2018 at 5:54am PDT

Do you feel like you need to defend your success in the competition given that some of the top competitors were knocked out of the race before the final lip-sync?

The people who should have to defend that are the people who pulled the lipsticks, you know what I mean? You saw me in the interview. I really thought Shangela and I were going to be lip-syncing, so I was as shocked as anybody else. I have huge respect for her, and I think she’s such a superstar given her track record. I’m an optimistic realist. I kind of expect the worst but prepare for the best.

There have been conversations about the rules of “Drag Race” and how the endless twists are negatively impacting the show. As a competitor but also a major fan, do you think the show should return to the strict merit-based elimination criteria?

I don’t think so. As much as people might not always agree with the choices made, it’s fun to watch. On a normal season, when people are in the bottom and there’s a lip-sync for your life, people also often disagree about who wins the lip-sync. When they announced that the people choosing were going to be judges, in a certain light maybe that’s more fair because these people were in the workroom and behind the scenes at all times. Who better to make the call than people who were in the Snatch Game with you or learning the choreography next to you? They know how hard everything was, and they know who struggled. In a weird way, they have a lot of insight the judges can’t offer.

You turned a corner about halfway through the competition. What was that like to embrace your creativity after being in the bottom and go for broke the rest of the season?

Once I was in the bottom and Shangela had basically psychologically cat-and-moused me emotionally and spiritually, I had already accepted that I was going home. When I didn’t, it was kind of like when they pull the mask off the killer. I was like, “Oh, this isn’t a ghost. This is ‘Scooby Doo,’ and this is a janitor.” I kind of realized if I lose it doesn’t make me a bad drag queen, and that’s something I’ve always believed anyway.

The fear of losing and the fear of disappointing kind of completely left. I just made bold choices, and that’s it. I was only in the bottom really for Snatch Game, so it was just really one day when I had a bad trip-up. The only other time I was in the bottom was when if you weren’t in the top you were in the bottom. The narrative a little bit was like you haven’t been here or where’s your brain, but I did great in every challenge, and I just fucked up today. But I don’t even think the TV did it justice. I literally probably did the worst Snatch Game in the universe.

You are one of the most active queens on social media and engage with conversations about “Drag Race,” which I think have tapped into some very key elements of the show’s legacy. Did you see hashtags like #AllStarsSoWhite, and what’s your reaction to the frustration about a third white queen being crowned an all star?

I didn’t even see it. I’ve been avoiding [social media]. I’ll post pictures and videos of myself playing guitar in my room, but I don’t interact or weigh in on topics. As you can see when Shangela confronted me about that note, I can’t really handle confrontation or drama well because I’m never in it, so I don’t really know how to handle it when it comes.

I’ve known this day was coming and I’ve known who was in the Top 2. I watched Shangela in the competition, so I knew that it was going to be a surprise. I was watching yesterday, and her heartbreak was obviously upsetting. Watching Bebe have to walk to the back of the stage was upsetting. The Top 4 was three people of color and I’m only, like, half white. Me and Kennedy were the two people in the room that had the least power. We didn’t pull lipsticks. All we did was lip-sync to a beautiful song by Miley Cyrus.

What’s the first thing you bought with the prize money?

I’m white trash garbage who came from nothing and afraid of living in a car eating cat food at any moment, so I’m just going to save all the money. I know it’s not exciting. I might buy a Nintendo Switch. I live in reality and I know at any moment I could stop getting the phone calls and nobody wants to hear me sing or tell jokes anymore. I just save it all so that one day if I quit drag I have a beautiful nest egg to show for it.

Has Katya reached out to you after your win? What was her reaction to her co-host being an official all star?

I haven’t talked to her yet. I’m sure she’s happy. I’m not sure she’s really watching the show right now. I think her journey of health and wellness probably doesn’t leave her a lot of time to watch “Drag Race.” I’m sure whenever she sees it she’ll live. That was my comfort. I was, like, if I lose we are just a couple of losers like the “Wayne’s World” of “Drag Race.” But now I won, so I can look down on her forever. That’s fun.

Season 10 starts next week. What advice do you have for the incoming queens?

I would say the real race is after “Drag Race.” People like Shangela and I are living proof that you don’t need to have that crown to go be America’s Next Drag Superstar. If they don’t live for your fantasy, you can just go live for your own fantasy.
