LONDON (Reuters) - Alfie Evans, the 23-month-old British toddler whose grave illness drew international attention, died early on Saturday, his family said.

Alfie had a rare, degenerative disease and had been in a semi-vegetative state for more than a year. After a series of court cases, doctors at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool removed his life support on Monday, against his parents’ wishes.

He confounded expectations by continuing to breathe unaided for days, but died in the early hours of Saturday, his parents said. “My gladiator lay down his shield and gained his wings at 02:30 absolutely heartbroken,” the boy’s father Tom Evans wrote on Facebook.

“Our baby boy grew his wings tonight ... Thank you everyone for all your support,” his mother Kate James wrote.

Medical experts in Britain had agreed that more treatment for Alfie would be futile, but his parents wanted to take him to Rome, where the Vatican’s Bambino Gesu hospital had offered to care for him. A British court rejected an appeal by the parents on Wednesday to take their son to Italy.

I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie. Today I pray especially for his parents, as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) April 28, 2018

The case has provoked strong feelings over whether judges, doctors or parents have the right to decide on a child’s life. Alfie’s parents have been backed by Pope Francis and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda.

AdvertisementGAZA, April 28 (Reuters) - A 15-year-old Palestinian youth died on Saturday after being shot the previous day by Israeli troops during protests along the Gaza border, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.

Israeli forces have killed 42 Palestinians since Gaza residents began staging protests along the border fence on March 30. The demonstrators are pressing for a right of return for refugees and their descendants to what is now Israel.

The teenager killed was identified as Azzam Aweida. Hundreds of people gathered at his home in the southern town of Khan Younis to attend the funeral.

Mourners carried his body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, to a nearby mosque for prayers before burial. “My son is a martyr and I am very proud of him,” said his father, Helal Aweida.

The Palestinians say Israel is using excessive force against the protesters, 2,000 of whom have been wounded by gunfire.

Israel’s use of live fire has drawn international criticism.

Israel says it is protecting its borders and takes such action only when protesters, some hurling stones and rolling burning tires, come too close to the border fence.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein on Friday called the loss of life deplorable and said a “staggering number” of injuries had been caused by live ammunition.

The Gaza Health Ministry said that three Palestinians were killed on Friday and 200 were wounded by gunfire. The Israeli military said about 14,000 Gazans had been participating in what it described as “riots” and that some had tried to breach the frontier.

GROWING FRUSTRATION

Gaza is run by the Islamist Hamas movement, which Israel and the West designate a terrorist organization. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but, citing security concerns, maintains tight control over its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza.

More than two million people are packed into the narrow coastal enclave, where poverty and unemployment rates are high.

The protests come at a time of growing frustration for Palestinians as prospects for an independent state look poor.

U.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. Efforts by the Trump administration to revive negotiations have shown no sign of progress.

Dubbed the “Great March of Return,” the protest action is to continue until May 15 when, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh says, the Gaza demonstrations will be replicated elsewhere along Israel’s frontiers.

May 15 is the date the Palestinians mark as the “Naqba,” or “Catastrophe,” when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes during violence in the 1948-49 war between the newly-created state of Israel and its Arab neighbors.

Israel refuses any right of return, fearing that the country would lose its Jewish majority.Stephen Colbert doesn’t want fellow “Avengers: Infinity War” superfans ruining his enjoyment of Marvel’s new movie before he’s even seen it.

So, on Friday’s broadcast of “The Late Show,” the comedian revealed his dastardly genius plan to avoid seeing spoilers for the film.

“I don’t want any of you nerds spoiling my nerding,” said Colbert, before spreading some made-up plotlines “so no one will know which ones are real and which ones are fake.” Colbert encouraged viewers to flood Twitter with similar #FakeAvengersSpoilers.

The U.S. has presented a joint bid with Mexico and Canada for the right to host the world’s biggest sporting event. Morocco has issued a competing bid. The North American proposal has hit stiff resistance because of Trump’s travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations, the perception that the U.S. is increasingly hostile to foreigners, and resentment over Trump’s reported reference to Haiti and African nations last year as “shithole countries.”

The World Cup host will be announced on June 13 after a vote by all FIFA member nations.

On Thursday, Trump touted America’s “strong bid” to host the event — and appeared to threaten that the U.S. might withdraw “support” from countries that lobby against it.

The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2018

Several European nations — including Russia, France and Belgium — have already announced their support for Morocco. The country will also be backed by other African nations, which hold a significant percentage of FIFA votes, according to ESPN. Morocco also has the backing of several South American and Asian nations. In addition, the governments of the Caribbean nations St. Lucia and Dominica have pledged support for Morocco.

FIFA issued a statement to Reuters saying that while it cannot comment on specific remarks about the World Cup, it pointed to its rules of conduct, which prohibit governments from interfering in national soccer federations and from exerting “undue influence” on the selection of the World Cup host.

FIFA’s bidding regulations also specifically prohibit anyone affiliated with a bid “from making any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, in relation to the bids of other member associations.”

The rules also instruct member associations to reject “any attempt to be influenced in relation to their function and obligations” as voters.

The North American bid so far has the support of 16 voting nations in South and Central America, as well as Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. won’t be playing in the World Cup competition in Russia this summer because its men’s team wasn’t strong enough to advance.

Brynn Cartelli, a 15-year-old Massachusetts high school student, won “The Voice” on Tuesday, becoming the show’s youngest champion, according to reports.

Cartelli was 14 when she was cast for the singing competition. Her 15th birthday was last month.

On Tuesday, the singer got another chance to celebrate ― this time a victory with Kelly Clarkson, a first-time coach on the program and original winner of another talent show by the name of “American Idol.”

“OH MY GOSH I AM SO HAPPY FOR HER HODA!!!!!” Clarkson wrote of Cartelli to “Today” show host Hoda Kotb in a tweet late Tuesday.

Cartelli, also the youngest finalist, earned the first-place title in viewer voting after two hours of non-competition performances.

Cartelli teamed with Julia Michaels in a medley of the songs “Issues” and “Jump.”

It was Michaels who co-wrote “Walk My Way,” the original song performed by Cartelli on Monday’s first phase of the finale.Yet this time around, Reid had steadfastly denied writing the posts, claiming on Monday her blog was hacked and that a cybersecurity expert had identified “unauthorized activity.” This appears to contradict with her Saturday comments alleging the outside experts were unable to prove she was hacked.

Reid did not address on Saturday her seemingly contradictory statements about the alleged hacking or detail whether cybersecurity experts were continuing to investigate the matter.

A representative for MSNBC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about Reid’s differing statements.

Jonathan Nichols, Reid’s hired cybersecurity consultant, said in a statement Tuesday that he “found evidence Joy Reid’s now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, was breached after a review of suspicious activity.” He did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Reid’s comments Saturday that appeared to state otherwise.

As HuffPost and other outlets have reported, only a pretty bizarre course of events would have led to those allegedly fraudulent homophobic blog posts.Kanye:

On Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time,” the comedian said people, including President Donald Trump, should be held more accountable for their lies.

Speaking about Trump’s “very disturbing” Thursday interview with “Fox & Friends,” Maher said the president had broken “his own record for lying within a sentence.” “I swear to God, he was talking about CNN, and he said, ‘I don’t watch it at all. I watched it last night,’” he said.

People had “normalized” Trump’s lies, Maher added, before claiming “the most important thing we have to do in America right now, is start penalizing liars.”

“[Former President Barack] Obama should sue Trump for saying that he wiretapped him,” said Maher. “I’m just saying that I don’t think we can leave this in the court of public opinion anymore. That’s what the liars want.”Donald Trump got a head start on his weekend tweets Friday night when — again — he called the investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and his campaign a “witch hunt.” This time, though, he said special counsel Robert Mueller should never have been appointed.

The comments again raised the possibility that Trump might be considering firing Mueller.

This time, he called concerns about collusion a “big Hoax by the Democrats.”

House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt! — Donald J.

The Republicans issued their conclusion just hours before NBC aired an interview with Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya in which she said she is a Kremlin “informant.” Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner at Trump Tower in Manhattan during the presidential campaign just months before the election to discuss turning over damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

The Twitterverse wasn’t impressed by the House Republicans — or Trump’s tweet:

So the House Intell Committee concludes no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Hmmm... I’m no Congressman but I think the evidence tells a different story. I think I’ll hold judgment until the Mueller investigation has concluded.

The longtime collaborating musicians came together at the surprise shindig reportedly thrown by West’s wife Kim Kardashian on Friday night, the day after Legend questioned West’s support of Trump in a private text message that West then shared to Twitter.

West tweeted a snap of the pair hanging out at the bash. “We got love,” he wrote. “Agree to disagree.”

Teigen, who already has 2-year-old daughter Luna Simone with Legend, also gave some insight into what went down at the event:A trove of Veselnitskaya’s emails obtained by NBC and The New York Times show that she worked closely with the Kremlin’s prosecutor general’s office to thwart a 2014 U.S. Justice Department request for records concerning Prevezon Holdings Ltd., a well-connected Russian real estate company that was accused of a money laundering scheme in New York.

The NBC interview was the first time Veselnitskaya has publicly described herself in the American media as an informant. But it’s widely known that she has represented several Kremlin interests in her work. The FSB, Russia’s successor to the Soviet-era KGB, was a longtime client of hers, Reuters has reported. Vladimir Putin headed the FSB before he became Russia’s president.It was rapper and poet Ludacris who once suggested that if you are in his way, you should kindly move.

That’s likely what this dolphin thought as it body-slammed a stand-up paddleboarder in Gracetown, Western Australia. The paddleboarder, a 54-year-old who gave his name as Andrew, told 7News Sydney on Saturday that the dolphins were likely herding fish.

He failed.

“What happened with the Paralympics was so incredible and so inspiring to me,” Trump said, referring to the games involving athletes with physical disabilities. “And I watched — it’s a little tough to watch too much ― but I watched as much as I could.”

Several high-profile American medalists boycotted the ceremony, including figure skater Adam Rippon, who said he would skip it because “I will not stand with people who discriminate against those that they perceive as different.”

Olympians from the 2018 Games have been invited to go to the White House today. I will not be going. I will not stand with people who discriminate against those that they perceive as different.

“Record numbers around the world are not finding Paralympics tough to watch,” Paralympic Games said in a tweet. “We hope the U.S. President continues to watch and be inspired by the Paralympics.”

Trump’s “a little tough to watch” comment was meant to be a reference to his busy schedule, the New York Daily News reported, citing an unnamed “person familiar with the situation.”

But the president has shown disdain for people with disabilities in the past. During his presidential campaign, Trump openly mocked a disabled reporter on camera in front of millions of viewers. He later denied doing so, but here he is:

Back on April 28, 2011, the then British member of parliament searched his name on Twitter. But instead of typing his moniker into the search bar, he mistakenly wrote it into a tweet and hit send:

Ed Balls — Ed Balls (@edballs) April 28, 2011

Balls’ post immediately went viral and spawned what has since become a spoof national day ― predictably called “Ed Balls Day.”

This year on April 28, as each of the ones that have gone before it, Twitter users in the United Kingdom have taken to the social media platform in their droves to mockingly commemorate the snafu.

Since leaving politics in 2015, Balls, 51, has gone on to star in “Strictly Come Dancing,” the British version of “Dancing With The Stars.” He also appeared on a charity edition of “The Great British Bake Off.”

Shaquem Griffin is the first one-handed player to be picked in the NFL draft. The Seattle Seahawks took the linebacker with the 141st overall pick Saturday.

Griffin lost a hand when he was 4 years old due to a congenital condition known as amniotic band syndrome. A first-team All-American from the University of Central Florida, Griffin hasn’t allowed the loss of his hand to deter him from becoming one of the best football players in the country.

At the NFL scouting combine back in February, Griffin performed 20 repetitions of 225 pounds in the bench press using a prosthetic attachment in place of his amputated hand. The 22-year-old ran the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds, the fastest time for a linebacker in over ten years, according to ESPN.

Griffin joins his twin brother Shaquil, a cornerback, who was drafted by the Seahawks in 2017.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos provoked an outcry Tuesday when she said schools can choose to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement on potentially undocumented students.

“I think that’s a school decision, it’s a local community decision,” DeVos told the House Education and the Workforce Committee. “I refer to the fact that we have laws and we also are compassionate. I urge this body to do its job and address and clarify where there is confusion around this.”

DeVos was responding to a question from Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) about whether she thinks school leaders should call ICE on students or their parents.

Advocacy groups immediately protested her answer, pointing out that under the Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe, all children ― undocumented or not ― are entitled to a free public education. Some demanded that DeVos issue an immediate clarification in light of this fact.

Elizabeth Hill, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, provided HuffPost with a clarification of DeVos’ remarks on Wednesday. “Her position is that schools must comply with Plyler and all other applicable and relevant law,” said Hill.

During the hearing, DeVos did note that the 1982 Supreme Court decision requires public schools to educate all students, including those who are undocumented. Still, she repeatedly said it was a school’s decision if it wanted to call ICE on kids and their parents.

MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, issued a statement saying that DeVos should resign for “abject incompetence” if she does not “issue an immediate clarification that emphasizes the holding in Plyler.” The organization also said it “stands ready to hold accountable through legal challenge anyone in public education who attempts to report a student to ICE.”

DeVos’ comments could have a chilling impact on undocumented students attending schools, said Andrea Senteno, legislative staff attorney for MALDEF, on Wednesday. Indeed, around the country, schools have seen substantial drops in attendance after ICE raids at local businesses.

“We are very concerned her statement yesterday leaves open to interpretation what the law actually is for schools and administrators and those in the community,” Senteno said. “There are going to be students and family members who are not going to know what that means.”

The Education Department needs to make publicly clear “what the current law is and what students’ rights are,” said Senteno.

The American Civil Liberties Union also blasted DeVos’ comments at the hearing.

“Let’s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status. Secretary DeVos is once again wrong,” said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns for the ACLU, in a statement.President Donald Trump kickstarted his weekend by launching a blistering Twitter attack on Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.).

The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, of which Tester is the ranking Democrat, was probing allegations that White House physician Ronny Jackson had created “a hostile work environment,” which included the improper dispensation of medications and “excessive drinking on the job.”

Trump called on Tester to resign on Saturday morning after the Secret Service said it had no record of an alleged drunken incident that helped to sink Jackson’s nomination to become Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

Disney

Warning: Major spoilers ahead. Major! You’ve been warned.

Ten years and 19 movies into the ever-ballooning Marvel Cinematic Universe, the fabled Avengers have left their respective dwellings and greeted the interplanetary crusaders whose storylines haven’t yet interacted with their own. “There’s an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?” Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, asks incredulously in one of the more relatable moments from “Avengers: Infinity War,” which opens this weekend to an expected $225 million intake.

At last, all our friends ― the ones whose disparate adventures have yielded “Iron Man,” “Thor,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Black Panther” and other assorted tentpoles ― are acquainted. How special. Naturally, there’s no better time to kill most of them off.

Except that’s only sort of what happens at the end of “Infinity War.” After more than two hours of wham-bam chaos, the movie slows to an emotional lull. The culminating battle royal results in the deaths of Black Panther, Spider-Man, Bucky Barnes, the Scarlet Witch, Doctor Strange, Star-Lord, Groot, Drax, Falcon, Mantis, Nick Fury and Maria Hill, each of whom dissolves into a pile of dust at the hands of a purple colossus named Thanos. The how and why hardly matter. What matters is that the final 20 minutes are meant to be a gut punch, testing the tear ducts of Marvel disciples who’ve waited so long to see the OG Avengers collaborate with the franchise’s rookies. Their wishes are granted and denied in the same fatal breath.

Danai Gurira, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Evans, Scarlet Johansson and Sebastian Stan in "Avengers: Infinity War." Disney

What matters even more, though, is that none of this really matters at all. You see, Marvel Studios is a business first (owned by Disney) and a story factory second. And because it’s a business, we know how many movies certain actors are contracted for and which ones have sequels already in development. That includes some whose characters supposedly went bye-bye.

Take T’Challa, for example. His is easily the most shocking of the “Infinity War” deaths, given the ongoing cultural fervor surrounding “Black Panther,” the best film Marvel has made. Seeing T’Challa’s brawny body disintegrate is, in no short order, heartbreaking. But wait. Isn’t the studio “actively” negotiating a deal for Ryan Coogler to return to direct “Black Panther 2”? (Yes.) And hasn’t Chadwick Boseman only completed three of the five movies in his Marvel contract? (Yep.) T’Challa, in other words, will rise again, one way or another.

And what about little Peter Parker, who joined the series in 2016 and graduated to leading lad in last year’s jocular “Spider-Man: Homecoming”? Acting-wise, Tom Holland lands the finest moment in “Infinity War,” pleading with his mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), that he is not ready to die. But we needn’t think hard to connect the dots on this one: 21-year-old Holland will reportedly shoot the next “Spider-Man” movie this summer, even though his web-slinger just perished.

Tom Holland in "Avengers: Infinity War." Disney

For kicks, here’s one more. Sebastian Stan, who plays the well-coiffed Bucky Barnes, is reportedly contracted for nine Marvel joints. (Nine?! Who has the time?) So far, he’s appeared in six ― and that’s only if we include his uncredited cameos in “Ant-Man” and “Black Panther,” which probably don’t count toward Stan’s tally. After the movie that will join “Infinity War” in concluding the principal “Avengers” saga next year, Stan will have at least two to go. What can we conclude from this information? Bucky Barnes will be back, as will the Guardians of the Galaxy, who are slated to conclude their standalone story with a third installment due out in 2020, according to director James Gunn. (Chris Pratt, otherwise known as the “late” Star-Lord, has already discussed “Vol. 3.”)

And so on and so forth. Most of the Avengers left standing at the end of “Infinity War” hail from the first phase of Marvel’s big-screen ambitions. Chris Evans’ and Mark Ruffalo’s contracts are nearing their end, and Robert Downey Jr. has long operated under a picture-by-picture arrangement that does not guarantee his presence in any future entities. Those guys can cede custody of the series to the presumably resurrected generation of superheroes in the aforementioned “Avengers” conclusion, whose title has not been revealed because it would constitute a spoiler that probably concerns these deaths.

Or something! Again, I’m less concerned with how the Great Rebirth will happen than I am with the idea that we have ample cause to assume it will happen. Which brings us back to my original point: Fundamentally, the Marvel machine is not about storytelling. It’s about commerce. These films cost a fortune ― with a reported $300 million to $400 million budget, “Infinity War” may be the most expensive movie ever made ― and must be negotiated years in advance. That only leaves so much room for narrative mystery. When we know which characters are slated for which future installments, death is relatively futile. In keeping, the entire third act of this movie is a manipulative ploy. All those tears shed in multiplexes this weekend? The only real point they served was to ensure you’d hand over another $12 next year to see what comes of your favorite swashbucklers.

But we already know, more or less. There are no stakes.

Even the baton-passing sometimes seen in the corresponding comic books ― a nurse named Jane Foster becoming the new Thor, for example ― can’t override the business transactions made public in this otherwise tight-lipped franchise. Sure, perhaps Shuri, T’Challa’s whiz-kid sister, can don the Black Panther suit next. But then how will Boseman fulfill his contract? (Here, fanboy theories are beside the point.)

No matter what happens in the comics ― crisscrossing timelines, cape-swapping plot devices, whatever ― Marvel’s movies must function as, well, movies. “Avengers: Infinity War,” and anything else that grosses close to $1 billion, is pitched at anyone and everyone who is or isn’t familiar with its literary origins. But as the franchise progresses, the chronology of its events departs further and further from the order in which movies are released. That alone is inane. Historically, sequels, prequels and spinoffs clearly demarcate where an individual installment exists on a series’ grander timeline ― but Marvel makes little effort to do so. Audiences shouldn’t need a guidebook to figure out which plot technically occurred first, and they shouldn’t have to suspend their disbelief by pretending characters committed to future installments are dead. I don’t want to hear anything about how “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3” could maybe, possibly, actually occur before “Infinity War,” despite hitting theaters two years later.

For comparison’s sake, when the “Star Wars” galaxy hopscotches between time periods, each movie’s title clearly contextualizes its placement in the series. Trilogies are numbered by episodes, and one-offs are given the subtitle “A Star Wars Story.” There is no confusion as to how the plots ― or individual characters’ involvement ― fit together, even when the movies are released in a non-chronological fashion. So, from one overlapping Marvel pageant to the next, we should be able to assume that the ensuing movies’ events have a logical through-line. That is, after all, how sequels work, dammit. Just because Marvel is a so-called “cinematic universe” doesn’t make it any different.

To kill off so many vital players in “Infinity War” is a cheap reflection of Hollywood’s bloated franchise infatuation. Disney knows you’ll be back for more next year. Hell, you might even be back for more next weekend. And as someone who just wants to see clever (and sensical) storytelling, I’m tired..@RoseanneOnABC if in the next six months you don’t see Trump’s magic starting to work for you, if you’re still trading pills and driving an @Uber, wouldn’t the more realistic plotline for Season 2 be your disillusionment with Donald Trump? pic.twitter.com/dB3dZr2urV — Bill Maher (@billmaher) April 28, 2018

“Like it or not you are now the face of the Trump supporter because you really do speak for a certain kind of American who knows they’re being screwed by someone, they just don’t know who,” said Maher. “But here’s what you’re missing about Trump, when he says he’s ‘looking out for the little guy,’ he’s talking about his dick.”

The comedian reminded Barr of her socialist roots. “You’re not Archie Bunker, you’re Bernie Sanders,” he stated.

Maher said he was confused with Barr’s character Roseanne Conner coming back as a Trump-supporting Republican in the “Roseanne” reboot, and he likened it to “Will & Grace” returning with Will as a straight man.

He did offer Barr a get-out, however.

“So, here’s the deal. I get that you were mad as hell and wanted to throw a monkey wrench into the whole works, and I won’t judge that,” Maher said. “But if in the next six months you don’t see Trump’s magic starting to work for you, if you’re still trading pills and driving an Uber, wouldn’t the more realistic plot line for season two be your disillusionment with Donald Trump?”

Clockwise from top left: "Life of the Party," "Book Club," "Under the Silver Lake," "Sorry to Bother You"

After a gender-swapped "Overboard" remake jumpstarts the summer comedy slate, box-office queen Melissa McCarthy will do what she does best: thrust herself into more unruly antics. In "Life of the Party" (May 11), she plays a middle-aged divorcee who embraces her inner 20-year-old and returns to college to complete her degree. One week later, the latest superhero movie, "Book Club" (May 18), unites Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen as "Fifty Shades of Grey" converts.



On the indie side, two festival favorites -- "Under the Silver Lake" (June 22) and "Sorry to Bother You" (July 6) -- deliver laughs with a more avant-garde flair. "Lake" stars Andrew Garfield as a Los Angeles stoner who gets wrapped up in the mystery of his missing neighbor (Riley Keough), and "Bother" employs Lakeith Stanfield as a down-on-his-luck telemarketer who suddenly climbs the corporate ladder and finds himself embroiled in a bizarre netherworld replete with a cocaine-guzzling Armie Hammer.For the past three decades, Michigan Central Station has stood vacant, an obligatory stop on the ruin-porn tour of Detroit. In recent years the beaux-arts structure and its grounds also have become a cinematic backdrop for wedding photos, a starting point for community bike rides, and even a course for street racing.

Now, a rumored sale to Ford Motor Co. has ignited giddy local media speculation that the industrial-age relic might soon be converted into a tech hub. Ford has neither confirmed nor denied reports of the talks, saying only that it would like to expand its footprint in the area for autonomous and electric vehicle production.

Detroit’s story is a complex one that refuses to fit neatly into well-worn narratives of urban decline. Once one of the wealthiest cities in America, the city suffered five decades of population loss as its manufacturing base collapsed and unemployment and crime rose, leaving vacant lots sprawled across its neighborhoods and overstretched public infrastructure. Today, it is home to a tenuous, corporate-driven revitalization that has seen local billionaires and corporate investors gobble up real estate in the city’s hollowed-out core.

Revamping the station, situated in Corktown, due west of Detroit’s downtown, would create jobs and turn a haunting vestige of the city’s decline into a beacon of resurgence. But any side effects of an influx of white-collar workers ― rising rents, a changing culture ― would undoubtedly be magnified when set against the metropolis’ broader backdrop of deterioration. In a poor city still starved for investment, this potentially ugly tradeoff between private cash and public benefit raises the central question of who really gains from such redevelopment ― the existing communities and people who live there, or the companies and their middle-class employees who move in.

Ricardo White, a first-time candidate for a state House seat that represents Corktown, says he’s thrilled by the possibility of converting an eyesore into a modern office space.

“But the biggest concern for me is what it means for residents in the neighborhood,” White says. “You hear these words a lot: ‘The new Detroit.’ What happens to people who’ve been with Detroit in its darkest days?”

To appreciate what’s at stake, it’s important to understand how Detroit got to where it is today. Throughout the 20th century, development spread outward from the city’s south-facing bank of the Detroit River along a handful of main traffic arteries that point away from downtown and outside city limits like spokes on a wheel. Concentric semicircles of growth left concentric semicircles of depopulation in their wake, and the ensuing erosion of the city’s tax base culminated in 2013 with the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

Since then, investors have raced to take a stake in Detroit’s downtown, remaking this sliver of the city into a hive of mostly white professionals and a playground for suburban concertgoers and sports fans.

It’s a form of disaster capitalism. The wealthy were able to amass so much real estate and civic clout precisely because of Detroit’s collapse. And local government has cheered the efforts, facilitating them as it can.

“The city itself cannot afford to do this,” says June Manning Thomas, a University of Michigan professor who has authored several books on planning in Detroit. What’s more, she adds, “most of the downtown development didn’t involve displacement because no one was really living there.”

In other words, the uglier side of gentrification has thus far been minimized. But the thorny questions grow more complicated as that development spills outward into more residential areas, like Corktown.

The city’s oldest surviving neighborhood, Corktown is one of the few in Detroit already drawing outside investment, with new businesses and trendy restaurants peppering the main thoroughfare of Michigan Avenue. The growth in property values in the area was among the fastest of any neighborhood in the city from 2017 to 2018, according to the city assessor. Construction began last year on a $150 million mixed-use development centered around loft-style apartments. And in March, a youth athletic facility and banquet hall opened on the lot where the Detroit Tigers’ baseball stadium once stood.

Revitalization of Michigan Central Station would undoubtedly kick what’s happening in Corktown into even higher gear. It would also raise questions about the impact a new corporate campus would have on property values and tax burdens in surrounding areas, such as North Corktown, Southwest Detroit and Core City, parts of which now have high vacancy rates.

Second-term Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has made the revival of such neighborhoods outside of downtown central to his political platform, bulldozing empty houses and improving trash pickup and street lighting. Last year, the city’s planning department unveiled a program targeting three areas for small-scale projects, including renovating dilapidated buildings and converting vacant lots into green space. The five-year program, intended to make these select communities more dense and walkable, is backed by a combination of public funds and nonprofit grants.

“As we all know, the recovery of Detroit is going to be defined by our neighborhoods,” Duggan said in his annual State of the City address in March. “It took 60 years to empty these neighborhoods out and it’s going to take a few years to get them back, but we are treating this issue with the urgency it deserves.”

Noble rhetoric aside, the efforts illustrate the inherent difficulties of equitable redevelopment in a city lacking public resources. Municipal services remain underfunded, a tax foreclosure epidemic continues, and planners must win over residents who’ve experienced a long and racialized history of forced relocation.

Philanthropic organizations have tried to open up the planning process in recent years by jump-starting a development think tank known as Detroit Future City, among other efforts. But community engagement is difficult, even on smaller projects, says local planning professional Lauren Hood, particularly in a city where civic leaders want to see immediate results. The notion that a corporation with its own interests would meaningfully collaborate on a refurbished train station or any other sizable project is difficult to imagine, says Hood.

“Presenting people with an idea and then asking them if they like it is different than bringing them into the decision-making process from the get-go,” Hood says. “Efficiency is inversely related to inclusion. You have to build relationships with people, and you can’t build relationships fast.”

There are reasons to think a happy medium might be found between the strategic imperatives of a company like Ford and the quality-of-life imperatives of the surrounding community. A Detroit Free Press analysis found that the city owns nearly half of the acreage surrounding the 500,000-square-foot train station, which may well give it leverage over any eventual buyer. The price tag of any such project ― likely in the hundreds of millions ― would also trigger a community benefits ordinance requiring the developer to meet with a neighborhood council to discuss issues such as jobs and affordable housing.

Regardless of how the reported talks shake out, mere speculation about the project may already be having an impact. The owners of a 128,000-foot warehouse behind Michigan Central Station put it up for sale in mid-April. Local real estate brokers have already begun reporting an influx of potential buyers for nearby homes.

In Corktown, residents like Blake Almstead, 33, will continue waiting as the possible deal for Michigan Central Station unfolds. Previous attempts to redevelop the station have failed due to a lack of vision, money, or both. “To have a beautiful building like that be renovated would be hugely symbolic for us ― I’m optimistic,” says Almstead, a homeowner.

But Hood, whose development work has spanned various neighborhoods in the city, is ambivalent. She also wonders about the potential side effects of such massive development, including where several hundred new employees might park their cars.

“So many people are so happy to have any development in their neighborhood ― they haven’t seen it for so long,” Hood says. “Others are doing more critical thinking. … Will people be supporting the shiny new things five or 10 years from now?”

Melania “cannot do anything,” Brigitte Macron told Le Monde on Friday, apparently referring to security constraints, the newspaper reported. “She can’t even open a window at the White House. She can’t stick her nose outside. She’s much more constrained than I am. Me, every day, I’m out in Paris.”

No wonder she appears to look so grim, Brigitte Macron said. “Everything is interpreted, over-interpreted,” she added, perhaps referring to scrutiny by the media and the public. “She’s a woman with a lot of character but tries to hide it. She laughs very easily about everything but shows it less than I do.”

The two first ladies got along swimmingly, said Macron. Melania was “really fun,” she said. “We have the same sense of humor. We laugh a lot together.” Macron called her “kind, charming, intelligent and very open.”

France’s first lady admitted that she has to deal with some of the same limitations as her American counterpart because she has to be “careful what I say.”

She added: “I have the impression that every word is a word too many. I’m constantly holding myself back. That’s the hardest part: There’s never really any time off, never a moment when you can be completely calm.”

But she said she tries to live as normal a life as possible and goes out each day. She often visits her three children from a previous marriage, and she visits her grandchildren. Macron said she tries to be more than just a decorative “flower pot” in the shadow of her husband. But that was difficult to do on their trip to the U.S. “Everything was very framed,” she said. “There were small labels on the ground. I put myself where I had to put myself.”

Macron, 65, is 25 years older than her husband, who was once her student. That’s about the same age gap between Donald Trump, 71, and his wife, who just turned 48.A top Democratic contender in the Michigan governor’s race fought to sell off more than 100 animals at a shuttered pharmaceutical testing facility he owned, court records show, contradicting his account of events that culminated in the neglected animals’ rescue.

Businessman Shri Thanedar has been weathering accusations of animal neglect after HuffPost reported Wednesday that animal welfare groups had to rescue over 170 dogs and monkeys months after the Oxford, New Jersey, facility shut down in 2010.

On Thursday, the candidate tried to pin the animals’ neglect on Bank of America, which repossessed the property in April of that year. He said the bank sought to sell the animals against his advice.

But court records show that the court-appointed receiver, charged with managing the disputed property, actually tried to place the animals in sanctuaries against Thanedar’s wishes.

In fact, it was Thanedar’s attorneys who unsuccessfully sought to have the animals assessed and sold.

“The lawyers were just using any leverage to keep the bank to do its job,” Thanedar told HuffPost on Saturday. He said the animals were not abandoned.

The candidate owned the lab, AniClin Preclinical Services, through its parent company Azopharma until it was shuttered in April 2010.

In July of that year, two animal welfare groups rescued 118 testing beagles stranded in the laboratory. Prior to the organizations’ intervention, the animals’ caregivers climbed the fences of the shuttered facility to provide the dogs with food and water, according to a USA Today report at the time.

Another animal welfare group intervened later that month to find homes for 55 long-tailed macaque monkeys stuck there. The group reportedly learned about the situation thanks to a tip from a caregiver.

The candidate went on a media tour Thursday to defend himself.

“I told the bank that there is sensitive research being done ... living animals’ lives involved, and let us take care of it,” Thanedar told Michigan Fox affiliate WJBK. “But they did not accept our advice. They were anxious to sell all of the assets and get their money, and they did.”

Thanedar’s actions at the time tell a very different story.

The firm acting as a receiver, Morris-Anderson & Associates, filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on June 14, 2010, seeking permission to transfer the animals to sanctuaries that had agreed to grant various releases.

“The Receiver has investigated the various options available with respect to the Animals and has determined that it is in the best interests of the Receivership Estate for the Animals to be placed with the various animal sanctuaries,” Morris-Anderson’s motion said.

An attorney for Thanedar’s companies objected to the proposal, arguing instead that Morris-Anderson should have tried to sell the animals. The proceeds from the sale, Thanedar’s attorney maintained, could have benefited the creditors and thus reduced Thanedar’s debts to them.

“The value of the animals could have a range of between $189,000.00 to $445,000.00,” the filing states. “The Motion does not indicate whether Receiver has taken any action to sell the animals (i.e. to another testing facility) for the benefit of the creditors.”

The judge in the case, Rodney Sippel, ruled in favor of Morris-Anderson on June 30, authorizing the animals’ transfer to the sanctuaries. Thanedar’s attorneys had withdrawn their objection by then, the judge noted.

Thanedar is locked in a contentious three-way Democratic primary with Gretchen Whitmer, the former Democratic leader of the state Senate, and Abdul El-Sayed, a physician and former Detroit health director.

Thanedar held a narrow lead over Whitmer, and a double-digit lead over El-Sayed, in a March poll. The primary is scheduled for August 7.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt loves quoting the Bible. That may help him keep his job. Brian Snyder / Reuters

Taking the stage at the glitzy Mayflower Hotel in Washington last November, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt casually quoted the New Testament as he recited his pitch for reimagining the role of the country’s top environmental regulator.

“We as a country have been blessed with tremendous natural resources,” he told the audience gathered for an American Principles Project Foundation gala, according to previously unpublished audio HuffPost obtained. “And to whom much is given, much is required.”

The reference to Luke 12:48 was likely not lost on the crowd gathered that Wednesday night for the conservative religious think tank’s fourth annual Red White and Blue Gala. The event’s brochure, a copy of which HuffPost reviewed, listed the group’s programs on “bioethics and life” and “religious freedom,” and advertised a downloadable white paper responding to the way in which “politics as usual has failed Christian conservatives.”

Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire GOP megadonor and financier of anti-abortion groups, Christian colleges and climate change denial think tanks, bankrolled the confab, according to the brochure.

Brent Bozell, founder of the right-wing Media Research Center, opened the program as the master of ceremonies before Pruitt gave his roughly four-minute speech in acceptance of an award for “human dignity leadership.” The Rev. Thomas Joseph White, a professor at the Catholic Pontifical Faculty of the Immaculate Conception, followed him with an invocation.

This was Pruitt’s hometown crowd. Until 2017, he had served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that called for “a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband and formally opposed “all forms of sexual immorality, including … homosexuality.” The bio on Pruitt’s now-defunct official Twitter account as Oklahoma’s attorney general reads: “Husband, Father, Christ Follower.” He been attending Bible studies with Vice President Mike Pence and other Cabinet secretaries since shortly after taking office at the EPA last year.

While Pruitt’s penchant for rolling back environmental regulations and bolstering the fossil fuel industry is widely touted as the reason President Donald Trump has refused to fire the EPA chief amid a four-week whirlwind of ethical and spending scandals, that largely overlooks Pruitt’s other asset: His reputation as a zealous crusader for conservative Christian politics.

For a president dogged by accusations of adultery and sexual impropriety, that sort of reputation has currency. The ostentatiously devout Pruitt gives Trump cred among evangelical Christian power players at a time when five Republican lawmakers and 170 Democrats in Congress are calling for his resignation. On Thursday, the EPA head testified before two House hearings for a total of six hours, during which Republicans leaped to his defense, arguing the administrator was the victim of “Washington politics,” “innuendo and McCarthyism,” and “a shameful attempt to denigrate the work that’s being done at the EPA.”

Neither the White House nor the EPA returned requests for comment.

“Pruitt is clearly part of the Christian right wing of the Republican Party, and it’s possible that these elite Christian right networks are protecting him, or they’ve sent some kind of message that this is our guy,” said Lydia Bean, author of The Politics of Evangelical Identity. “He’s opposed abortion and worked as an attorney for religious liberty cases, so he checks the right boxes for Christian right evangelicals.”

White evangelicals overwhelmingly support Trump’s job performance, at 61 percent in a December Pew survey, compared to just 32 percent of voters overall. Still, that marks a significant decline from the 78 percent approval in February 2017. Among nonwhite evangelicals, his approval rating plummets, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis.

Pruitt has played an outsize role in courting leaders on the evangelical right. In September, Trump hosted a dinner with “grassroots leaders,” including evangelical heavyweights such as Concerned Women for America CEO Penny Nance, Faith & Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and Tim Goeglein, a vice president at Focus on the Family. In a photo posted to the White House website, Pruitt appears at the table opposite Trump, the only Cabinet secretary in attendance, though his name is not listed in the caption.

As Pruitt’s scandals mount, Christian groups have rallied to defend him. On April 6, the Conservative Action Project published an open letter calling for Pruitt’s “continued tenure at the EPA” and thanking him “for the significant actions he has taken to implement President Trump’s deregulatory agenda.” The list of 186 signatories included Christians for a Sustainable Economy Executive Director David Kullberg, Christian educator Lisa Calvert and Faith Wins President Chad Connelly. Some of the religiously affiliated signatories, such as Anne Schlafly Cori, chair of the “pro-family” Eagle Forum, have a history of backing climate change denial efforts, according to research compiled by the nonpartisan Climate Investigations Center.

White evangelical Christians, more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in 2016, are the least likely of any religious group in the U.S. to understand the science behind climate change, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believed the planet is warming primarily due to human activity, compared to 41 percent of white mainline Protestants and 56 percent of black Protestants. About 37 percent of white evangelicals don’t believe the climate is changing at all.

In 2005, the National Association of Evangelicals was on the cusp of affirming climate science in a new national platform called “For the Health of a Nation.” But, after passing the board unanimously, the rank-and-file rejected that followed a campaign by oil, gas and coal-linked groups. Since then, the same dark-money donors ― including Mercer ― who sponsor the network of think tanks that provide contrarian (and readily debunked) research contesting the consensus on climate change have also funded conservative Christian groups. The fossil fuel industry made climate change denial, as Splinter’s Brendan O’Connor described it last year, “the word of God.”

Pruitt hasn’t been shy about proselytizing that view. Last October, Pruitt invoked God’s warning to pagans in the book of Joshua to “choose this day whom you will serve” in a speech announcing a new policy barring scientists who receive EPA research funding from serving on the agency’s advisory boards.

In a February interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Pruitt said, “The biblical worldview with respect to these issues is that we have a responsibility to manage and cultivate, harvest the natural resources that we’ve been blessed with to truly bless our fellow mankind.”

In March, Politico published tapes from more than decade ago in which Pruitt disputes evolution: “There aren’t sufficient scientific facts to establish the theory of evolution, and it deals with the origins of man, which is more from a philosophical standpoint than a scientific standpoint.”

The statements have rankled EPA workers.

“It’s terrifying,” said one EPA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “The impression we are left with is that his faith has led him to counterfactual beliefs.”

The staffer, who identifies as queer, said Pruitt’s past affiliations with groups that take hard-line stances on gender and sexuality “are painful to confront.”

“Knowing that the man I work for every day not only disrespects the agency’s mission but also believes that I, as a pansexual woman, and many other EPA employees … are ‘perversions’ in his belief system, is a heavy weight I feel each day at work,” she said.

Though Pruitt’s reputation for piety may help protect him for now, Bean cautioned that it may not filter down to ordinary evangelical voters.

“He’s not an individual with a mass following, not a household name for the evangelical rank and file,” she said. “I do not think Scott Pruitt has a national brand as an evangelical leader that, by itself, would stop Trump from firing him.”

Pruitt’s legacy could alienate him from moderate evangelicals. In 2015, the National Association of Evangelicals adopted a resolution calling for climate action. Ronald Sider, a professor at the Palmer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, called Pruitt’s lead role in pushing Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord one of the administration’s “really big, longer-term negative policies,” and said the administrator’s failure to take climate change seriously will define his tenure for years to come.

“It’s really immoral and tragic,” Sider said. “Unless that can be turned around fairly soon, our grandchildren will pay for it.”
