Football great Jim Brown and legendary boxer Mike Tyson also will be on the guest list, according to the Rev. Darrell Scott, a White House outside adviser who said he spoke to Trump in the Oval Office Thursday during an event for the National Day of Prayer.

Scott said the president was committed to the multiracial gathering, which will include musicians and athletes in perhaps early summer.

“He is 100 percent for it,” Scott said. “He’s very enthusiastic about it.”

Trump, whose history is rife with racist comments and behavior, will be there, Scott said. “We don’t want to sanitize it,” Scott said. “I want people from the left to attend. I want it to get heated, but I want it to be respectful.”

Scott is organizing the summit with Andrew Giuliani, a top aide in the White House Office of Public Liason and son of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, reported Politico, which described plans for the race conference as preliminary.

Kaepernick may be the most surprising invitee, given Trump’s criticism of the NFL quarterback and the league after he started a widespread movement of athletes kneeling for the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and police brutality. He did not play in the league last season and has filed a grievance alleging the NFL has conspired to keep him out of a job because of his activism.

Asked to comment on the summit report, a rep for Kaepernick told HuffPost on Friday: “Colin isn’t doing any media at this time.”Sylvia Antuna is worried. The cook has worked at the Paris Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for 18 years. But after some fellow cooks showed her a video of a restaurant in China that uses robots, she’s become concerned her job won’t be around much longer.

“I said, ‘Oh my God, who would ever think we’d be replaced by robots?’” she told HuffPost. “The robots had actual hands making the food, and they actually had robot people taking the food to the tables.”

CULINARY WORKERS UNION LOCAL 226

Although Antuna may not have been replaced by a robot – yet – she is well aware of the ways in which technology has already replaced workers in the Las Vegas hospitality industry. The hotel where she works has laid off more than a dozen prep cooks in recent years. Instead, it has bought pre-cut fruit and vegetables from a company that relies heavily on machines. And several Las Vegas restaurants have begun replacing servers with iPads that take customers’ orders.

Around 10 million U.S. jobs ― especially service jobs such as cooks, cleaners and janitors ― are at high risk of automation within the next five to 10 years alone, according to an October 2017 analysis. These are jobs that have traditionally benefitted from strong union support, and while unions are stepping up to address this challenge, in some places this is becoming an increasingly difficult task, especially in light of declining membership and influence.

But workplace experts say unions need to figure out how to help workplaces and workers adapt to new technologies to reduce layoffs if workers are to have hope of surviving and even thriving in the face of this threat.

This is the aim of Antuna’s labor union, Culinary Workers Union Local 226, by far the biggest and most powerful in Las Vegas. For the first time ever, the union, which represents 50,000 cooks, servers, housekeepers and other workers at 34 casino-hotels in the city, is making automation a big part of current negotiations for a new contract. That’s beyond the typical issues it bargains over, like raises, vacations, health coverage and pensions.

The union is pushing for the hotels to train employees to oversee or work alongside robots rather than be replaced by them. Unsure how soon robots will arrive and what form they will take, Culinary Union officials say they want to explore with hotel management what the most useful forms of training would be.

“Technology for us is a very serious issue in these negotiations,” said Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the Culinary Union’s secretary-treasurer. “We realize we cannot stop technology. But we have to figure out how to make the companies understand that it can be more of an opportunity for workers, and not so much mean the elimination of jobs.”

Arguello-Kline says automation can help workers – robots, for example, could assist housekeepers by pushing their 300-pound carts loaded with towels and sheets down the hallway. But she also warns the casino-hotels that a headlong rush to embrace robots could backfire. “Human contact is something people really like about Las Vegas,” she said. “It’s not the same thing to receive a drink from a robotic machine as receiving it from a cocktail waitress.”

The Culinary Union is just one of many labor unions grappling with how to respond to the spread of automation and artificial intelligence – whether driverless trucks or lifting and sorting machines at warehouses. Alongside the fears automation poses to workers, there are concerns that it is also undermining the very organizations designed to support them: labor unions.

Harry Katz, former dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said automation has reduced unions’ might in many industries by shrinking their membership and making it easier for companies to break or survive a strike. Organized labor is likely to lose further power and membership as a result of the ongoing wave of automation, he said.

Katz added that today’s new technologies could undercut unions in another way – by diluting concentrations of workers, for instance, by letting more people work from home and enabling organizations to disperse employees geographically.

“Unions are strong when there are large collections of workers, and people get pissed off and have a mass action,” Katz said. “In a subtle way, the decentralization we’re seeing is weakening unions and making a big snapback in unionization harder.”

“If we don’t get more active in shaping how technology is used, more jobs will be going away and there will be more income inequality,” said Thomas Kochan, a professor of industrial relations at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. “Workers and unions aren’t going to be invited in. They have to insist on playing a role.”

The Teamsters union – whose members include long-haul truck drivers and warehouse workers – has done just that. For example, when several entrepreneurial companies sought a green light to introduce delivery robots in San Francisco that would travel on sidewalks and make restaurant and other deliveries, the Teamsters objected and helped persuade the city council to place strict limits on these robots, allowing a limited experiment and then only by companies that agreed not to oppose unionization.

The Teamsters has resisted the idea that there’s going to be “a robot apocalypse” that obliterates millions of jobs, said Doug Bloch, political director for the Teamsters’ Joint Council in Northern California, including Silicon Valley.

Even before a self-driving Uber car killed a pedestrian in Arizona in March, Teamsters’ leaders were questioning Silicon Valley’s boasts that driverless trucks would soon be common on the nation’s interstates. The union’s officials assert that humans will continue to be needed in truck cabs – to make deliveries, handle paperwork and unexpected problems, and help when reaching warehouses or navigating through urban areas.

“The only thing inevitable is that technology is coming,” said Bloch. “Everything else is up in the air. It’s an opportunity. But we can’t let the companies write the rules.”Fox News host Neil Cavuto had some harsh words for Donald Trump on Thursday: Mr. President, you stink.

The host listed some of Trump’s worst lies and misstatements, including claiming there was widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election and the recent revelation that he repaid his personal lawyer Michael Cohen for $130,000 in hush money given to porn star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, after he’d repeatedly denied knowing about the situation.

“How can you drain the swamp if you’re the one that keeps muddying the water?” Cavuto asked. “You didn’t know about that $130,000 payment to a porn star until you did.”

Cavuto, one of the few hosts on Fox News who calls out the president, said Trump cannot criticize the press for reporting “fake news” when he repeatedly makes false statements without correction.

“Your base probably might not care,” Cavuto added. “But you should. I guess you’re too busy draining the swamp to ever stop and smell the stink you’re creating. That’s your doing. That’s your stink. Mr. President, that’s your swamp.”The Citrus County School District in Florida received two complaints about teacher Dayanna Volitich in the months before a March HuffPost article exposed her as the host of a white nationalist podcast, according to the results of a school district investigation.

One complaint, filed by a parent last August, expressed concerns that Volitich was injecting political bias into her middle school classroom. Another complaint, made anonymously, informed administrators of Volitich’s Twitter alias, Tiana Dalichov, and of her racially incendiary musings online.

Following those complaints, the district monitored Volitich’s social media, made more visits to her classroom and interviewed students. But at the time, the kids did not substantiate the concerns about her teaching, and administrators did not notice anything out of line.

Earlier this year, HuffPost informed the district of a podcast in which Volitich brags about bringing her political views into her social studies classes. Following the HuffPost report, Volitich was removed from the classroom and an investigation was begun. In April, Volitich formally resigned from her post. This week the results of the investigation were released and reported by the Citrus County Chronicle.

The investigative report said that the inquiry had centered on whether Volitich violated “professional practices by being deceptive in changing her teaching practices when administration enters her classroom and by encouraging her students to go along with the deception.”

Indeed, in a Feb. 26, 2018, podcast, Volitich said that when parents complained about her inserting her white nationalist opinions into her teaching, she lied to school administrators and said it wasn’t true.

The investigation found probable cause for disciplining Volitich. But because she has already resigned, the district will not be taking further action, according to the report.

Investigators interviewed 16 students and four other teachers. Most of the interviewed students had positive feelings about Volitich’s class and her ability as an educator. Most also said that she had a habit of discussing her political views in class, but denied that they were told not to inform their parents or encouraged to change the topic when administrators visited.

But five students said Volitich made them uncomfortable when she discussed topics like immigration, segregation, President Donald Trump and the Democrats.

One student, who is biracial, told administrators that Volitich described the Ku Klux Klan as “a good thing,” called for immigration to be “shut down” and said segregation should be restored in schools. Another student said that Volitich told the class that Democrats believe they need help raising pets or children, whereas Republicans don’t believe they need help with such activities. Another said that Volitich would sometimes talk about how Hillary Clinton should be in jail and claim that Democrats want to raise your taxes.

Of the four teachers interviewed, one expressed concern about Volitich injecting racial bias into her classroom practices and took issue with Volitich allegedly seating black male students together. The educator also described a tense conversation with Volitich about politics, in which the educator expressed fears that Trump would try to get rid of black people. In response, Volitich simply said, “Well,” the educator alleges.

The parent who had filed the complaint last August told investigators about new comments made to his son. Volitich allegedly told the child that “Google is down because the Democrats were busy helping to delete all Hillary Clinton’s e-mails.”

District officials did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the results of the investigation. Volitich’s lawyer, Charles E. Moore, also did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Volitich’s answer to the allegations is included in the investigative report. She took issue with the inquiry’s results, suggesting that media coverage might have primed students to remember more innocuous comments. She also responded to many of the kids’ specific claims. In response to the allegation that she said Democrats need help raising pets and children, Volitich said she was teaching students about the two major political parties. Instead of arguing that Clinton belongs in jail, Volitich claimed that she said Clinton should be in jail if there is proof she committed a crime. Her comment about Google and Clinton’s emails was a joke, she said.

“Over 85% of the students interviewed stated they learned a lot in my class, felt they were able to express their own opinions and views, denied my telling them not to talk to their parents about material discussed in class,” Volitich wrote.

She also vehemently disagreed with the one former colleague’s recollection of certain discussions.

The other teacher “admits no one but she and I were present for these conversations, and that she never reported anything to administration or to the district. Everything she claimed is mere hearsay, a terrible warping of the truth designed to smear my character,” Volitich wrote.“If they do do Ivanka, which I doubt they will, the whole country will turn on him,” Giuliani told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night. “They’re going after his daughter?”

Hannity then asked the former New York City mayor about Kushner.

“Jared is a fine man, you know that,” Giuliani said, “But men are, you know, disposable. But a fine woman like Ivanka? Come on.”

The remark didn’t get much attention at first, given that Giuliani made headlines with several other comments.

He admitted that Trump repaid $130,000 to his personal attorney Michael Cohen that had been sent to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement just before the 2016 election.

The comments about Kushner have some wondering if Giuliani was sending a message.

Former federal prosecutor Paul Butler said on MSNBC that one reading of Giuliani’s comments “might be he’s offering Jared Kushner’s head up on a platter to Mueller as long as he leaves the president’s daughter alone.”Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) is a plaintiff in a suit seeking to bar the Census Bureau from counting undocumented residents. Bloomberg / Getty Images

Alabama is suing the Trump administration to force the Census Bureau not to count undocumented people as part of the decennial tally used to determine how many seats in Congress each state gets.

The suit signals a continued conservative interest in changing the way the census counts immigrants. In a statement, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the plaintiffs in the suit, said apportionment should exclude immigrants and be based on only the citizen population. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) have made similar calls. Missouri lawmakers are considering legislation to base their state legislative districts based only on citizen population.

Last week the top official in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division said the Trump administration had “no position” on whether districts should be apportioned based solely on citizen population.

Every 10 years, the census counts all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, and that tally is used as the basis to figure out how many congressional seats each state gets. The 14th Amendment says congressional seats should be apportioned based on simply the number of “persons.”

But in a suit filed Tuesday in federal court in Alabama, Brooks and the state’s Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) argue that in the 18th and 19th centuries, the word “persons” would not have been understood to include undocumented people in the country. They argue that including undocumented immigrants in the count to determine congressional representation unfairly allows states with large undocumented populations to have inflated political representation. Alabama is projected to lose a congressional seat after the next census.

In March the Commerce Department announced it would add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census ― the first time it will do so on a decennial survey since 1950. Civil rights groups say including the question will drive down response rates among immigrant groups.

The results of the census have significant consequences; in addition to determining how many House seats each state gets, the count determines how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated.

The suit seeks to block a census rule directing the bureau to count citizens and foreign nationals in the United States at the address where they live or sleep most of the time. The plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the 14th Amendment “by robbing the people of the state of Alabama of their rightful share of political representation while systematically redistributing political powers to states with high numbers of illegal aliens and their citizens.”

Legal experts and historians cast doubt on the lawsuit’s foundational claim ― that the word “persons” was previously understood to exclude undocumented immigrants.

Franita Tolson, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a scholar of the 14th Amendment, said she was “unaware of any historical support” for Alabama’s argument. She said the legislative history surrounding the 14th Amendment shows that those who passed it understood the word “persons” to apply to those ineligible at the time to become citizens.

“To say that Alabama’s argument is a stretch is being overly generous,” she wrote in an email. “The text says ‘persons’ and the history illustrates that this term applies broadly.”

Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, noted that the founders added a clause to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution to prevent slaves from being counted as people for the purpose of determining how many congressional seats each state gets. If the Founding Fathers had intended to exclude people illegally in the United States, he said, they could have added a clause to explicitly say so.

Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, pointed to information on the website of United States Customs and Immigration Services noting that immigration in the 18th and 19th centuries was “relatively free and open.” It wasn’t until 1875 that the U.S. Supreme Court said the federal government had a responsibility to regulate immigration, and it wasn’t until 1880 that Congress began to enact immigration legislation.

“At the time of the Founding, there simply wasn’t a category of ‘undocumented’ immigrants,” she wrote in an email.

John Thompson, a former director of the Census Bureau, noted that there is no good way for the census to determine whether people are in the country legally. Census officials, he said, can’t simply walk up to people and ask them if they are legally in the United States and expect to get an accurate count.

The suit offers no method for the Census Bureau to count legal immigrants but exclude unauthorized residents.

Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Marshall, dismissed the practical concerns.

“It is important to know who is here both legally and illegally. Our lawsuit is only focused on the question of counting illegal immigrants in the apportionment portion of the census,” he said in a statement. “There are a variety of proposals that would allow the census to identify immigrants without legal status. We will address the appropriate remedy in the course of the litigation.”

Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues, said the case could go to the Supreme Court. He added that it was “fiction” that the Founding Fathers intended to exclude undocumented people from the census.A teacher in Anderson, South Carolina, has retired after a video went viral showing her standing on a black student’s desk and pulling on his hair.

Lisa Houston, who is white, taught math for 27 years at Palmetto High School and voluntarily resigned this week after the episode came to light. A video posted on Snapchat showed her, among other things, tapping the student on the face, turning his head, pulling his hair and pushing him in the chest with the bottom of her foot, according to The State newspaper.

She said her actions were simply her way of waking the student in a lighthearted way.

“If you ask any kid I’ve taught, they’ll tell you I kid around with them, make them stay awake and laugh with them,” Houston told local TV station WYFF. “I know the video looks bad. If you don’t know the situation, you don’t know what’s going on, but it was not a malicious act. It was all in fun. I want the public to know that I love the student, and that our rapport with each other was great. I would have never done anything to hurt him.”

Anderson School District One officials said that as soon as they heard about the video, they started investigating but that Houston made the decision to resign on her own.

“The district wishes our community to know that the school administration immediately conducted an inquiry into what occurred,” Jane Harrison, an assistant superintendent for the school district, told The Greenville News in a written statement. “The individual has already separated as an Anderson 1 teacher. Although the district is unable to comment in detail about the matter, the administration took seriously what occurred, and the teacher, who has had an exemplary record of teaching performance, decided of her own accord that she would retire in the best interest of her school.”

Houston’s attorney Ryan Beasley told reporters the video does not tell the whole story.

“There were many witnesses in the classroom as to what happened and the playful nature of her relationship with her students,” he said. “We are confident that as more facts come to light, her reputation as an excellent and loving teacher will be restored.”

Other students in the classroom can be heard laughing in the video.

Julian Johnson, the father of the student in the video, told Fox Carolina that his family never asked that Houston be disciplined for her actions.

“My son has nothing to do with this. He was tired and went to sleep,” Johnson said. “I didn’t call for her to be fired. I wish it would go away and that it never happened.”

Many other students, parents and officials are protesting Houston’s resignation, saying she’s getting a raw deal.

More than a hundred past and present students marched from the school to the district office to lament her leaving the school.

“She is an amazing educator, an amazing woman in this community and Anderson District One lost a great teacher in her,” former student Marcus Coppola told WSPA TV.

On Wednesday, school board member Doug Atkins resigned from the board in response to Houston’s retirement, according to Fox Carolina.Even Deadpool has some limits.

Actor Ryan Reynolds, co-writer and star of the upcoming “Deadpool 2,” said there was one joke he wasn’t allowed to make.

“This is a sore spot for me because there’s a joke in the movie that is not in the movie now because ― I’m probably not even allowed to say this ― Fox made me take it out,” Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly. “It had more to do with Disney, and they made me take it out. As I look back at it, I think maybe that was a wise decision.”

Disney wasn’t completely off-limits. There is a recurring joke about “Frozen” in the film, EW reported.

Disney was in negotiations to purchase most of Fox at the time “Deadpool 2” was in development, which may have played a role in the orders delivered by the studio. While Deadpool belongs to Disney-owned Marvel, licensing arrangements that predate Disney’s 2009 purchase of the comic company placed the film rights to certain characters in the control of other companies. In this case, Fox had control over Deadpool on the big screen.

Late last year, Disney reached a deal to purchase much of Fox. The deal is expected to close next year.A peek into Earn’s childhood explains why he is the most flawed character of “Atlanta.”

Warning: This recap includes discussion of suicide.

The latest episode in the series’ second season, “FUBU,” follows a pivotal day in young Earn’s life, opening on a scene at Marshalls with his mom. He convinces her to buy a questionably discounted yellow FUBU jersey, because name brand is everything. Eager to stunt on his classmates at his middle school, young Earn shows up the next day ready to gain the validation and status that he’s presumably never experienced prior.

His fly aspirations come to a screeching halt, however, when another boy in his class, Devin, arrives in a FUBU shirt that looks very similar to his, but isn’t quite the same. Their peers note the differences ― Earn’s has two stripes with no patch, Devin’s has one stripe with a patch ― and determine that one is fake. The quest to find out which commences, spanning the entire school day, as Earn tries to dodge “FEBE” jokes from other kids and heed his cousin’s advice: to just be confident in himself. Eventually, Al swoops in — as he still does in the present — to save the day, convincing the other kids that Earn’s shirt is real and Devin’s is fake.

What Earn didn’t know is that Devin needed this win much more than he did. After being bullied by some older teens and experiencing issues at home, Devin killed himself. Earn and Al’s moms learn of the news and tell the boys to look after each other, right after reminding them that what a black man in America wears matters.

Robbin’ Season has repeatedly highlighted how much we value materialistic things. Yet, in the pursuit of money or status, every one of the show’s major characters has lost something greater — something that actually matters. On this week’s ‘Run That Back,’ Julia Craven and Taryn Finley examine true highway robbery, the relationship between black people and our clothes, black kids’ mental health and how Earn has yet to learn from the lessons life tried to teach him as a child.

FX NETWORKS

Earn is running around in Marshalls when he comes across a FUBU jersey, the ultimate symbol of black excellence throughout the ’90s and into the early 2000s. His mother agrees to buy the shirt for him, and he’s so excited to wear it the next day that he can’t sleep. He wakes up before his alarm and dashes to the bus stop. Earn has always had a deep desire to stunt, but it’s clearer than ever emanating from his timid middle-schooler self. On the bus ride, a kid attempts to throw a cup of yogurt out the bus window, but it ends up smacking a classmate seated further back in the face. The yogurt-faced kid punches the yogurt thrower so hard that his head hits the bus window. The moment — and the timely camera pan to Earn’s face — provides a glimpse into how routine violence will take a darker turn later in the show.

Taryn: So. The fresh az I’m iz episode was a lot.

Julia: Yeah, it was in a number of ways. Mainly, I am quite triggered by how accurately it displayed middle school. I was teased a lot ― as many of us were ― over the littlest things, so it brought back a lot of memories of things I’ve grown past. (Kids are awful. I get it. I let it go lmao.)

Taryn: Yeah, it was very triggering in a way that brought up old shit on a personal level. Middle school is already rough, but for black kids it can be excruciating on a lot of levels. And if you don’t heal, that shit will turn you into adult Earn. But unlike adult Earn, my heart went out to young Earn. He didn’t really want the FUBU shirt he asked his mom to buy him while they were in Marshalls. He wanted what the shirt represented and the clout it would give him in school. Which is normal for a kid.

I loved his mom’s reaction when he asked her to buy it. “It better not have no craziness on it,” while looking everywhere but at the shirt in Earn’s hand lmao.

Julia: I, too, felt for Young Earn. I don’t place any blame on any of the kids in this episode ― something a number of the reviews have grossly done ― because they’re children who are dealing with their own shit and they don’t understand how to not project that onto people. But the way Young Earn’s face lit up when he saw that FUBU jersey was very symbolic of how we learn to thirst after status symbols at a young age. We want the status. We want to be cool. I remember I was 8 and I was trying to be cool (I failed like shit lmao). I walked by this girl and she said, “Julia tries so hard to be cool but shakes head.” Now when I think about it, and after seeing this episode, I wonder why I gave a fuck.

Taryn: I hate that so much and speaks to how quickly we adultify black kids. Ugh!

Julia: And that head shake now as a grown woman is pretty fucking funny. She was sad about my failure to be dope and I get it lmao. I was whack!

Taryn: That was most of us. I think that’s why they showed all those other black kids in the store at the beginning. Trips to those discount stores were routine. I remember begging my mom for Baby Phat jeans at Marshalls way back when layaway was a way of life. We struggled financially, but clothes have played such an important role for us in a way that speaks to the larger societal obstacles we have to overcome.

That’s why Earn was so geeked to get to school the next day. You know his mama would’ve had to come pull his ass outta bed any other day. Earn’s always had aspirations to stunt on niggas and he thought he would finally get that day with this FUBU shirt.

Julia: Right. For black people, clothing is so important. How we present ourselves to the world is one way we have of feeling great, feeling powerful. And, at times, many of us like to believe that it can help counter the racism we receive. (IT CAN’T, SO TO READERS WHO WANNA POP OFF ABOUT THIS, DON’T EVEN TRY IT.) Maybe it can change the perceptions of us. Clothing is a way to hide pain and express oneself. This is something black people got on lock. It’s one source of pride in a world that hates us, a world that demonizes our fashion. But still we stunt.

Taryn: Word. And the role fashion plays is still vital as an adult. We see that when Earn’s mom is talking to him about wearing a suit to his piano recital in the last scene. “You are a black man in America. When you meet people, you need to look good. Your clothes are important.” We’ve all heard a version of that from our parents before.

It’s one of the first forms of respectability politics that we’re taught to use as a shield to protect us. Time and time again, though, we see that shit doesn’t always matter, as you said. This is why I hate the “Jordans vs. passports” debate every time it pops up on Black Twitter. It ignores that and feels very removed from what’s real ― to say getting a passport is more valuable than getting a fresh pair of J’s for all black people. But that’s a whole other conversation.

Julia: Sis, I’ve had “passport” muted since Amanda Seales went off about it and then blocked me on Twitter when I came after her about it. Also Jordans are cheaper and more cost-effective. You don’t need to travel. You need shoes.

Taryn: LMAO. I forgot she blocked you. Damn. Yeah, death to that debate. It’s elitist af.

Is it bad that 13-year-old me would probably beat somebody ass on the bus if they threw their yogurt out the window and it landed on me, too?

I’m lying, I was soft as Earn. But I was smarter than his dumb-intelligent ass. I’ll throw hands at the tender age of 26, though.

Julia: Oh, middle school me would have beat ass over that. This chat is revealing so much about me to the world. But as a middle schooler, moments like that are more about pride and demanding respect than they are about doing the right thing — whatever the “right” thing is in a situation like that.

Taryn: And that’s OK. Vulnerability is healing, so I’m told. I ain’t tried it yet, though.

Julia: LMAOOOOOOO

Despite the bus incident, Earn arrives at school feeling good about himself and his FUBU jersey. He’s gliding through his morning until first period when he encounters Devin, who has on a similar-yet-different FUBU jersey. The kids in class pick up on the difference with one lamenting, “Yoooo, niggas wearing fake FUBU now?” Earn expresses his concerns to a white classmate who doesn’t understand what the big deal is — a clear nod to how black and white people move through the same spaces in remarkably different ways. Looking for true guidance, he finds Alfred, who is stealing from someone’s locker. Young Paper Boi tells Earn to be confident in himself and just say the shirt is real. Flash forward to the end of the day, and Earn is surrounded by teens — including Johnny Lee, a teen who is the deciding factor in what’s fake and what isn’t. Lee says the jersey is fake. Earn is faced with a decision: He can apply Paper Boi’s knowledge or own up to the fact that his jersey likely isn’t authentic. Instead, Paper Boi swoops in, declares Earn is in the real jersey and allows his lil cuzzo to come out victorious. Earn runs onto the bus, probably in fear of being found out, and watches as Devin is mercilessly bullied. The next day, the principal tells Earn’s class that Devin dies by suicide.

Julia: Aight so we get to school and Earn is funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party. And we see that Earn and Devin have on the same jersey. Now I’m gonna say Earn’s is fake. I never owned a FUBU jersey, but I saw enough of them in Lexington to know that it definitely has a logo patch in the upper right corner.

Taryn: Chile, he thought he was doing it, OK! He took off that sweater ready to stunt.

Julia: Sis was stuntin like shit.

Taryn: So let me let you in on a lil secret. Come close so I can whisper.

Both of them shits was fake, sis.

Real FUBU jerseys have the patch AND the double stripe on the arm.

Julia:

Taryn: Marshalls knock-offs like shit. Even though Marshalls does have real name-brand shit and I will forever be a customer. Don’t sleep.

Julia: I, too, would have been wearing FEBE.

Taryn: Shit, I wouldn’t be surprised if some of my shit was FEBE. I’m actually about to bring FEBE back. FEBE jersey dresses all summer 2018.

Julia: Fight me. Please. PLEASE!

Taryn: squares up

Julia: falls to ground, presses charges 🤑

Taryn: bfifhiudgbfrjkf. I guess I’m going to jail in my FEBE then.

Julia: But one thing this season has done is make a lot of comments on what we value as a society and, specifically, as black people. A lot of emphasis is placed on the materialistic in America, and it’s jarring that that isn’t what people have been robbed of this season. In the pursuit of the materialistic, everyone has been robbed of something greater, something that actually matters. The best example is Earn. In the pursuit of money and status, he’s lost his relationships with Van and Al. He’s lost his job. He’s on probation so he’s lost his freedom. He’s lost everything. And the most recent example, Devin’s suicide, is the most concrete example of loss thus far. It speaks to what you can lose when you place too much in things that don’t matter.

Taryn: Right. It’s like this season is the Glover brothers’ “wake up” moment, a la Spike Lee’s “School Daze.”

I think it was important for Earn’s episode to date back to childhood because we’re starting to see the roots of where a lot of this started. The series of events in this episode was a pivotal moment in Earn’s lifetime that still, clearly, has an impact today. It’s kinda like he’s still stuck in the mental space he was in as a child.

I think one of the most telling moments ― not just in regard to Earn but also our relationship to fashion and appearance ― is Earn’s interaction with his white classmate. He’s telling him about his FUBU or FEBE dilemma and the white boy is lost as to why it’s even an issue. “I don’t see the big deal. I’ve worn this shirt twice this week,” he told Earn. That spoke so many volumes. The white boy can wear damn near whatever and no one will bat an eyelid, because white people don’t have to use clothes as metaphoric defensive mechanisms or tools for advancement. They just wear them. We many not always recognize that as a privilege but it is. Our identity is so intertwined with everything we do that we can’t just wear the same thing twice in one week and not get judged by the world. (I mean I do now, but I’m grown and pay my own damn bills and I wish a bitch would say something. Thirteen-year-old Taryn couldn’t.)

Julia: AMEN! Also he didn’t know what bootleg meant and my black ass was appalled.

Taryn: Sis, I thought everybody knew what bootleg meant. And he in the South, so what’s really good?

Julia: It is definitely an episode about mental health and how certain inherited norms hurt us and then follow us into adulthood. Devin’s suicide was a part of the story line that made sense, probably more than anything has this season. I wasn’t shocked that a bullied kid killed himself. That is sadly very common, especially among black children. What got to me was what this says about Earn and his complete lack of evolution. He’s seen the extreme. The materialistic things he cares so much about as an adult have pushed people to suicide. Yet, Earn’s lust for things hasn’t tempered or been put into perspective. Earn has lost every contest he’s been in this season. Tracy beat his ass. Van beat his ass at Ping-Pong. Michael Vick dusted his ass in the Onyx parking lot. And the one time he wins, he sees how fatal it can literally be to win a stuntin’ contest.

Now, I don’t want to say that being materialistic is bad, because I’m prolly gonna hit the Nike store once we finish up this chat. But something about Earn the adult and this incident shows me that he hasn’t developed or grown from this. He’s stuck here. He’s still trying to stunt. He seems high yet broken off that one win. And I want to say I understand it, but I don’t. I’ve also never been in this particular situation. But I wonder what that says about him and our society.

Taryn: As much as I love to drag Earn, I’m gonna play devil’s advocate for a second. I can kind of see why this character flaw followed him into adulthood. It was really disturbing to me how divested the adults in this episode were in checking in on not just Earn but all the kids in Devin’s class to help them process his suicide and move to a place of healing. The principal made an announcement to the class about Devin’s death and the teacher started class right after without skipping a beat. Sure, they had permission to leave class to talk to a counselor ― whose office they probably associate with disciplinary action ― but rarely do schools give black kids the option to ask for help outside of curriculum work. As we saw more blatantly in the “Woods” episode, what you don’t heal from can haunt you for life. Adult Earn may not know it, but he is stuck in this very traumatic moment he played a part in as a child.

FX NETWORKS

Julia: I 100 percent understand that. But, the dreaded but ... while I see how it could have followed him, I have a hard time letting him off the hook for all the further abuse he has caused. This episode provides a lot of rich context, but Earn is a grown man who knows right from wrong. I can’t feel sorry for him as an adult. As a child, absolutely. But I think our society ― and I know this isn’t what you’re doing ― gives men too much time to grow. Those boys in the episode were never truly checked on their behavior. They were yelled at, which is exemplary of a bigger issue with schooling black kids. But I think about Daneisha, who was singled out over having her head down, and how black girls don’t get to be visibly affected by their trauma. And maybe I’m halo-reaching or super sour on Earn, but I don’t see it for him carrying this this heavily as a grown man.

I also think about Devin, who needed this win. Badly. And when he didn’t get it, when he was teased for crying about being bullied, for crying about everything else, he committed suicide. And now Earn, who is understandably traumatized, still hasn’t done the work required to move forward. Come on. I can’t rock with him.

TL;DR ― Fuck Adult Earn SZN. As for Paper Boi, his issue (the toxic relationship with Earn) is still in his life, so “Woods” made more sense to me.

Taryn: All very true. Earn needs to take accountability ― and to see a therapist. He’s too old for the shit he’s pulling.

My heart especially went out for Daneisha, poor baby. Do you know how many black girls I shared a class with were carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders and the only way they could express their pain was “my head hurt” and they still were publicly chastised by the teacher for it. Shit, I’ve been that girl. Going back to clothes for just a second, that’s why Daneisha wore her coat in class. That, too, was meant to serve as a defense mechanism, in a way that becomes more layered as we intersect race and gender. (Black girls are still disproportionately disciplined in school for minor infractions more than any group but I’m sleep.)

My heart went out to Paper Boi too, my God. He’s really been holding it down for Earn from Day 1. Lord knows he’s tired.

Julia: I wore coats and jackets all the time because I hated my natural hair. So I kept my hood on. And I was disciplined over it. No one asked why I was doing it. My head always hurt, too. My heart goes out to her as well. I want to know more about her, but her presence said enough.

And yeah let’s #pivot to Earn and Alfred because this episode told us exactly why Al is TYED of his lil cousin.

SCREENSHOT / FX NETWORKS

In another part of the school, Paper Boi is living his best adolescent life. He’s a cool kid. He’s in the principal’s office for stealing a calculator from a peer and then selling it back to the same student. He goes on to tell Young Earn to be confident and saves him from years of bullying. After hearing the news about Devin, Paper Boi listens silently as his mother tells him and Earn to look out for one another. No matter what. It’s a moment that brings the Earn-Alfred dynamic full circle for viewers.

Taryn: I applaud Alfred for always being about his bread.

Julia: ALWAYSSSSSSSS. That hustler’s spirit is tried and it is true.

Taryn: A hustler from the start. The fact that he stole this boy’s calculator, sold it back to him and evaded trouble is inspiring.

Julia: This could be a reach but it speaks to how smart dope boys are to me.

Taryn: Dope boys are smart af. Quick on their feet and good at math. No reach there at all. Earn, though book smart, is the opposite and would’ve got caught up if it weren’t for his cousin.

Julia: Al been looking out for that boy his whole life. I’d be exhausted to, especially when it’s a parasitic relationship. Al had to tell Earn to be confident and just say the jersey is real. Earn heard that but didn’t apply it (another thing that hasn’t changed). Then Al still had to swoop in and say it was a real jersey, because Earn, once again, wasn’t gonna stand up for himself. It drives home what Paper Boi said in Episode 2: “Money is an idea, man. There’s a reason why a white man dressed just like you can walk into a bank and get a loan and you can’t even spend a $100 bill.”

Paper Boi been telling him forever that while he needs and should have money, purely stuntin won’t fix his issues. Confidence will. Earn hard-headed.

Taryn: WHEW! Still a bop. I might put that quote on a shirt. Ultimately, Al carried the burden of Devin’s suicide heavier than Earn. You can tell in the final scene how much it weighed on him as he sat in the chair quiet as his mom and aunt talked to Earn. After hearing about the bullying, they told them to look after each other cause that’s what family does. The thing they don’t know is that Al been doing that. Earn hasn’t and probably doesn’t know how. Earn would find solutions to his problems easier if he’d just stop always thinking of himself as a victim.

Julia: That final scene of them sitting beside each other was heavy. “You and your cousin gotta look out for each other.” That showed that this toxic dynamic was bestowed upon Paper Boi even though he had already taken it upon himself to do it anyway. It was an ordainment. A heavy familial obligation put onto Al early. It reminded me of last episode ― and I don’t think we talked about it ― but one thing that stood out to me in Paper Boi’s semi-firing of Earn was when he said, “I need shit. Lotte need shit. You need shit.” Al has been doing this and he’s going to continue doing it once Earn gets out the way so he can do it peacefully.

And I just noticed that they were sitting beside each other much in the same way as kids. Earn was sitting up, Al leaned back. Same as in “North of the Border.” Only in this one they sat closer together, which makes it clear that this disconnect hasn’t always been there.

Taryn: Wow. Symbolism on 10. I wonder what will happen to Earn without Paper Boi. You think he’ll finally get his shit together?

Julia:Cheryl Burke of “Dancing With the Stars” had one hell of a birthday.

The celebrity dancer and choreographer confirmed on Instagram that her boyfriend, actor Matthew Lawrence, 38, popped the question on Thursday — her 34th birthday.

Burke shared a photo of her boo kissing her as she proudly displayed her shiny new rock.

“OMG! So far so good for 34!” she captioned the post, adding, ”#amilliontimesyes #imengaged #herecomesthebride.”

Burke “was totally surprised” by the proposal,” Entertainment Tonight reports.

“The diamond has special meaning as it’s the same diamond that Cheryl’s late father, Steve Burke, gave to her mother,” Burke’s rep told ET. “Matthew, with the help of his mother Donna, Cheryl’s mother Sherri and XIV Karats had the stone reset and added more diamonds to create the ring he proposed to Cheryl with.”

Burke and the former “Boy Meets World” and “Mrs. Doubtfire” star rekindled their romance last year after dating from 2006 to 2008 and initially met through his brother.

“We dated 10 years ago for two years,” Burke told ET in in 2017. “Actually, Joey Lawrence was in the audience tonight. He did ‘Dancing With the Stars,’ and then he introduced us, and now we’re back, reunited.”

In April, Burke told Us Weekly that she and Matthew Lawrence have a pretty solid bond.Actresses Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabrielle Union have buried the hatchet.

Pinkett Smith said in an interview Thursday that a “touching” episode on her new Facebook Watch show “Red Table Talk” features the two ending their mysterious feud.

“We haven’t really been on the best of terms for 17 years and we have a reconciliation,” Pinkett Smith told Extra.

The “Gotham” actress said she and “Breaking In” star Union “don’t even know how it started.” Smith’s mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, was also in on the chat and said she’s pleased they patched up their differences because she’s fond of Union.

Glad those two have reached a peace ― over whatever the heck the rift was about.On April 28, 2008, Sarah Schacht received an email that terrified her. The Sunlight Foundation, a government transparency group, had invited Schacht, the head of a budding good-government nonprofit, to join a conference call. There on the invitation list was Clay Johnson — a man she says once tried to rape her.

Reeling, Schacht called a friend at Sunlight, who told her the foundation had just hired Johnson. Within an hour, she said, she was on the phone with Sunlight’s executive director, Ellen Miller.

Schacht said Miller received her story with a stern voice and a battery of excuses: “Well, I’m sure there was some confusion, it was so long ago, he was so young at the time, and now he’s in this great relationship,” Schacht recalls Miller saying. In her disbelief, Schacht blurted out that she wasn’t Johnson’s only victim, but that didn’t seem to faze Miller either. “I left the phone call shaking,” Schacht said.

Although Miller insists no such call ever happened, the conversation Schacht remembers must have been repeated many times. For more than a decade, women have accused Johnson, a leader in the world of political technology, of physical and verbal abuse. They’ve complained to some of the most powerful people in Washington’s nonprofit and progressive circles — only to watch, horrified, as Johnson became a powerful figure, too.

During Johnson’s first job in politics, on Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign, Schacht and a fellow campaign worker separately accused Johnson of sexual assault. Word of both women’s complaints reached several of Dean’s top deputies. But Johnson kept his job, and his work on the campaign became his ticket to a high-profile career.

He went on to co-found a pathbreaking political consulting firm. Powerful groups and people sought his thoughts on the future of tech in politics; his Twitter banner shows him cracking a joke to a roomful of government officials including President Barack Obama. Despite Schacht’s warning about his behavior, the Sunlight Foundation chose him to head its flagship technology division. He left amid a staff insurrection over his lewd and menacing behavior. And still, he rose higher.

His reputation seemed to be an open secret.

“People would go, ‘Oh yeah, that’s Clay,’” said Erie Meyer, a tech worker who said Johnson harassed her at a 2013 conference. “And I’m thinking, ‘How have you all been letting him wander the halls of progressive power and know he’s like this?’”

HuffPost spoke with more than two dozen of Johnson’s former supervisors, peers and colleagues, many of whom talked on the record, in search of an explanation. The answer implicates not only Johnson as a serial abuser but a constellation of progressive and good-government groups that failed to put their values into action. On the eve of the most consequential midterm election in a decade, it also raises grave questions about how prepared politicians are to protect the people who get them elected. Nearly 20,000 people will work in the local and national campaigns this year, and as many as 5 percent of all registered voters will volunteer. Should they face harassment or abuse, few of them will have any recourse.

“We just pass creeps from campaign to campaign,” said Meg Reilly, vice president of the Campaign Workers Guild, a new union seeking to organize political workers across the country. “The excuse becomes, ‘We’ll deal with this once the candidate gets elected.’ People tell themselves that if they’re working for this candidate who’s really fantastic, who opposes sexism and racism, then everyone on the campaign is immune from committing the same sins.” Once the election ends, little prevents abusive employees from starting a second act in government, political advocacy or nonprofits.

Johnson, in interviews with HuffPost, described his history in the workplace as “awful” and said it filled him with shame, hurt and regret, although he disputed the details of most of his accusers’ stories.

“I don’t know the answer to that,” he said when asked if he had sexually assaulted two women on the Dean campaign. “What I can tell you is, I had two women complain to management on the Dean campaign about sexual harassment, and I was given a warning.” Later, he said his memory of his encounter with Schacht didn’t include anything he would describe as “assault.”

“My entire career was littered with treating people very poorly,” he continued. “Whether that was the Sunlight Foundation, the Dean campaign, or anywhere else I worked. I did not behave appropriately. I was awful to people, to nearly every single person, and I really wish I hadn’t been.”

In the summer of 2003, the Howard Dean campaign felt electric with promise. Although the former Vermont governor’s presidential bid would later be remembered for the Dean Scream, at the time people noticed the groundbreaking way his supporters met and organized online. Schacht, who was raring to work in political tech, joined the campaign as an intern in New Hampshire. “I thought, wow, I really want to work with those guys, on that team,” she said. “I wanted that experience to be the start of my career.”

Specifically, Schacht wanted to work with Clay Johnson, who had joined the Dean campaign earlier that year, first as a volunteer and then full-time in the Burlington, Vermont, headquarters as its lead programmer. Johnson, who is more than 6 feet tall, had a domineering personality and usually spoke without a filter. But he struck Schacht as smart and ambitious. When he said he could look for an opening for her on his team, Schacht recalled, she moved to Vermont. She spent 10- and 12-hour days doing odd jobs as a volunteer for the finance and youth outreach teams. At night, she crashed in one of the Dean campaign’s ubiquitous group houses.

One night in late fall, she was staying at an apartment that Johnson rented. She was sleeping on an air mattress in the living room when he woke her up by stumbling against the walls, she said. Schacht recalled worrying that he was sick or so drunk he might hurt himself, and she got up to ask him if he was all right.

“He kissed me, and I was surprised. But before I could say anything, the next thing I remember is I was pinned on his bed,” she said. He was trying to have sex with her. “I’m saying ‘No!’ I’m saying ‘Stop.’ I’m saying, ‘Don’t do this, stop.’”

Schacht said she brought her knees to her chest and with all four of her limbs tried to shove Johnson away. She doesn’t know how long she held him off, she said, but it felt like an excruciatingly long time. He didn’t let up until he passed out drunk, she said, and she pushed him off her.

The morning after Johnson’s alleged assault, Schacht said, she abandoned the air mattress and checked into a hotel.

Johnson said his memory of that night is “radically different”.

“It’s not a recollection that would involve the word ‘assault,’” he said. “That said, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is that she has pain over this encounter, and I have caused her that pain.”

I asked Johnson if he was saying sexual assault is a matter of interpretation.

“I think that there is a clear line, but the line gets much less clear after 15 years of memories,” he replied.

Later, in an email, Johnson claimed he and Schacht never discussed the idea of her joining his team but that they went on several dates “with what I believe to be romantic intent” before the night in question. “On our first date, she stopped me on the way into a restaurant and kissed me. I started to avoid Sarah after that.”

Within weeks, Schacht told several of her colleagues about the incident, including a Dean campaign employee, Amanda Michel, who let Schacht share her rented bedroom once the hotel became too expensive. (Schacht slept in the walk-in closet.)

Michel confirmed to HuffPost that Schacht told her about Johnson’s alleged assault; in all, HuffPost spoke to six people who said Schacht told them Johnson had assaulted her. Michel also said that a second woman told her Johnson had sexually assaulted her and that Schacht and the other woman did not seem to be aware of one another at the time. (Michel was director of HuffPost’s OffTheBus project in 2007 and 2008. The second woman declined to speak for this article; HuffPost is withholding her name because it does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault without their consent.)

Alarmed, Michel told her boss, Zephyr Teachout, who was the campaign’s director of online organizing and nominally Johnson’s supervisor on some projects, although Teachout didn’t believe she had the authority to fire him. Teachout doesn’t recall being aware of the second accuser. But she alerted at least two members of Dean’s inner circle — Bob Rogan, the deputy campaign manager, and Joe Trippi, who oversaw the entire operation — that Johnson faced a serious allegation of sexual assault. Two former Dean staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity said they got word of the second accusation to Rogan.

Teachout asked what the accuser should do. Trippi essentially waved her aside, Teachout said. “My impression was that he had no plans to do anything about it and no suggestions for what an accuser should do,” she said. Rogan, whom she met with separately, was more diplomatic but no less evasive. “I left feeling like nothing would be done,” Teachout recalled. “It was totally demoralizing and radicalizing and unacceptable. I had nothing to tell anyone about what they could do with accusations, no recourse, no process, no recognition. It haunted me.”

Schacht was in a daze. “I just didn’t know what to make of what had happened to me,” she said. “I knew it was wrong. I knew I had fought him off. I just didn’t know where to go or what to say.” She realized her future could depend on being part of Dean’s team. She decided to stay with the campaign and take a new, paid position in Iowa. She was 24.

That winter, Schacht said, she received calls from a lawyer for the Dean campaign and a female campaign official. They asked questions about her encounter with Johnson that made her deeply uncomfortable. “I ended up reporting that he had attempted to rape me.”

Johnson couldn’t recall anyone asking him questions about his behavior. But there had been one repercussion, he said: Rogan, in the presence of his co-deputy campaign manager, Tom McMahon, gave Johnson a warning. “They were like, ‘This complaint has come in, so like, cool it,’” Johnson said. “I would say it made me more defensive. I’m not sure I would say it altered my behavior.”

“They were like, ‘This complaint has come in, so like, cool it.’ I would say it made me more defensive. I’m not sure I would say it altered my behavior.” - Clay Johnson

Rogan, who is now the chief of staff for Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), said he didn’t recall any discussions he may have had about Johnson. Neither did McMahon. Trippi, who has worked on dozens of Democratic campaigns since, didn’t recall a conversation with Teachout either. But he doubted it would have lasted very long. “It would have gotten like a nanosecond of me even recognizing what she was saying,” he said. “I dealt with the bigger strategy. If it was about money or people, it would have been, ‘Go talk to Bob.’”

The Dean campaign was not unique in lacking a process for dealing with complaints of harassment and abuse. Unless the people in charge make a conscious decision to put rules in place, chaos is a campaign’s default setting. Political campaigns are short-lived organizations where every dollar and body is applied toward the singular goal of winning. The pay is low, the hours are grueling, and the whole operation collapses after Election Day. Typically the only people willing to work under these conditions are true believers — young ones whose expectations about work are still unformed.

The Dean campaign, former staffers recall, combined all these factors. Dean’s was the Bernie Sanders or Barack Obama campaign of 2004 — the one attracting scores of 19- to 25-year-olds who had never worked in politics. A former official recalled pleading with staffers not to drink and drive through the streets of Burlington. “You’re wearing shorts and T-shirts,” said one Dean campaign worker. “Your furniture is whatever you pulled out of the garbage. You’re not doing it for the money, so you don’t see it as a job … although it is.”

“I regret to say that I didn’t know what to do when she told me.” - Sarah Schacht's supervisor on the Dean campaign

That campaign worker was one of the first people Schacht spoke to about Johnson’s alleged attack. In the chaos of the campaign, he was loosely considered Schacht’s supervisor. He asked for anonymity to be candid about how he responded to her report.

“I regret to say that I didn’t know what to do when she told me,” he said. “Maybe because I’d never had a real job — I was always on campaigns — I really wasn’t sure what you do. … I almost felt like I was in college and somebody told me they’d had somebody cross the line. But looking back now, Jesus Christ, it’s pretty simple, you do A, B, C.”

Dean, by all accounts, was never involved in any of the discussions about Johnson. “This is the first I’m hearing of it,” the former candidate said.

He said if a campaign receives a complaint, it ought to fire the accused campaign worker immediately. It’s possible the person being fired did nothing wrong, he continued, but it’s more important to keep the campaign running smoothly. “In politics, unfair things happen to people sometimes,” Dean said. “There’s a greater cause [at stake], and it’s the campaign.”

But the same mentality makes it difficult for campaign workers to report abuse. “What if it goes public and takes down the campaign?” Michel said. “No one wants to be the story or be part of the story that takes down their candidate. Not when you’ve sacrificed so much.”

Asked how future candidates could change that mentality, Dean had little to offer. He suggested that candidates make their values clear and post rules of conduct in the campaign office.

“Look, you just don’t have time to straighten these things out,” he said. “Campaigns are chaotic. … There’s not going to be a campaign where there’s going to be a process.”

Johnson said something similar. “Campaigns are strange creatures,” he said when asked if he was surprised he wasn’t fired. “They don’t live very long. There’s not a lot of time for investigation and fact-finding.”

Later, he emailed to say he’d reconsidered the question. “Yes,” he said, he was surprised. “If anybody that worked for me acted the way I did on that campaign on any given day, but especially given those allegations, I would fire them.”

Blue State Digital's website brags of the firm's progressive values. Blue State Digital

The Dean campaign collapsed in February 2004, but its reputation for revolutionizing politics online endured. Buoyed by this legacy, Johnson and three other Dean alums — Joe Rospars, Jascha Franklin-Hodge and Ben Self — founded a lucrative consulting firm, Blue State Digital.

The firm easily attracted top-tier clients, such as the Democratic National Committee (where Dean was elected chair in 2005 and McMahon became his executive director) and a presidential hopeful, Sen. Barack Obama. But multiple former Dean staffers — men and women alike — said they passed up opportunities to work with Blue State Digital because of Johnson’s reputation. Their hesitancy seems warranted. Two of Blue State’s early employees said Johnson was an unmitigated bully. One of them recalled witnessing Johnson tell a pregnant Blue State employee, “You’re going to push that baby out under the conference table because that’s as much maternity leave as I’m going to give you.”

“I don’t believe I said that,” Johnson said. “I did say, ‘I’m glad that we’re not eligible for FMLA.’ I made an obnoxious comment, but not that obnoxious comment.” (FMLA refers to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires employers of a certain size to provide eligible workers unpaid leave for the birth of a child.)

“You’re going to push that baby out under the conference table because that’s as much maternity leave as I’m going to give you.” - Johnson's alleged remark to a pregnant Blue State employee

Blue State said it wasn’t aware of Johnson’s “unacceptable” comment and that it has always offered paid parental leave, including to that employee.

While Johnson launched into the next phase of his career, some of his former Dean colleagues continued to agonize over his abusiveness. “I felt like we had totally failed,” Teachout said. She felt hesitant to tell Johnson’s future employers about an accusation she had heard secondhand and thinks it’s even possible she provided a positive reference. Occasionally, she and Michel discussed how to stop serial abusers from moving from one campaign to another and wondered why the national party didn’t have a hotline or a system in place. (“Yeah, there could be a role for the party,” Dean said.)

At the end of 2007, Blue State Digital forced Johnson out. “Clay was asked to leave the company because his partners didn’t want to work with him anymore, not because of any allegations of inappropriate behavior,” the firm said in a statement. “Clay would not be hired today, we’re glad we fired him over a decade ago and we regret he was ever associated with the company.” The firm wouldn’t provide further details.

Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation in 2008, said she doesn't remember Schacht making any accusation against Johnson. Sunlight Foundation

By spring 2008, Johnson had been quietly hired by the Sunlight Foundation — at the time, the center of gravity for the open-government movement. Johnson started work at Sunlight that summer overseeing its digital technology lab. He gave the impression that he’d left Blue State a wealthy person, several former Sunlight employees said, and it was clear from the outset that he played a significant role in helping the nonprofit raise money and attract grants.

Schacht had fallen into Sunlight’s orbit, too. In the years since she worked on the Dean campaign, she had founded a small but scrappy nonprofit, Knowledge As Power, that offered a free legislative tracker to local governments. “Thinking about her capabilities, and planfulness, and knowledge, I kind of view her as a visionary,” said Gary Pollack, who worked for KAP starting in 2010. “She has this vigor and this capacity to keep the forest and the trees in her sightline.” In January 2008, Sunlight extended KAP a small grant. More significantly, Ellen Miller, the foundation’s executive director, gave Schacht glowing introductions to numerous potential donors and collaborators.

But Schacht claims there was an abrupt change in the relationship after she told Miller that Johnson, Sunlight’s star new hire, had once attacked her. The flattering introductions stopped, and Schacht got the impression she no longer had Sunlight’s imprimatur.

It started with the email inviting Schacht and Johnson to a conference call. The call was to discuss an upcoming Sunlight conference, and Schacht contacted a friend at Sunlight, John Wonderlich, to make sure she and Johnson wouldn’t share any panels. Schacht heard Wonderlich gasp. Sunlight had just hired Johnson, he said. Wonderlich, who is now Sunlight’s executive director, said he felt obligated to tell Miller, and he arranged for Miller and Schacht to speak. By then, Schacht had spoken directly to Johnson’s other accuser from the Dean campaign, and she told Miller both of their stories.

Miller seemed unmoved, Schacht said. Later that year, Schacht claims, Sunlight shut down KAP’s request for a larger grant, and it announced plans to launch a legislative tracker that Schacht felt was in direct competition with hers.

Miller said there was no chilliness and no such phone call. Sunlight made hundreds of small grants to groups like KAP, she said, but rarely, if ever, gave out larger sustainable grants. It’s true that she stopped introducing Schacht to potential donors, but that’s because there were only so many donors to introduce.

“It only happens once, at the beginning of the process, and that’s all there really is to the story,” Miller said. As for the phone call: “I simply do not recall either a phone call or an interest in having a conversation with her about Clay Johnson. I would have remembered a serious accusation like that one, I would remember that, and I would tell you I remember that.”

In response to Miller’s denial of the call and Johnson’s claim that their relationship was ever romantic, Schacht said, “Their statements do not match my interactions with them.”

“She’s perhaps the one person I can think of in the world that has a real issue with me.” - Johnson in a 2008 email to Miller referring to Schacht

Johnson said he wasn’t aware of any hasty phone call between Miller and Schacht. But he emailed Miller in June 2008 to warn her that he and Schacht had a history from the Dean campaign. “She hates me,” he wrote, in an email he shared with HuffPost. “Absolutely despises me. Happy to talk to you about it in person, but it’s mainly gossip, innuendo, stale and old. It is weird, I’m happy to talk about it with you. But the short story is: It was a presidential campaign, it was Vermont. She was like 22, I was 26 and we were both shamefully less professional in the workplace. You can put the rest of that story together. I promise there’s not a long slough of disgruntled female campaign staffers in my closets. But there is one, and it is her.”

Johnson added that Schacht was very talented and smart and that Knowledge As Power was an impressive project. “That being said, she’s perhaps the one person I can think of in the world that has a real issue with me.”

Johnson claims he told Miller in person that Schacht had filed a sexual harassment complaint with the Dean campaign. Miller insists this isn’t true: “He didn’t say anything about a sexual harassment claim against him at the Dean campaign, I’m certain.”

Many of Sunlight’s staff members would come to have issues with Johnson as well. Johnson routinely made obscene comments toward his co-workers, according to multiple former Sunlight employees. Nisha Thompson, one former employee, described him as “leery” and “a bully.” Once, she ran into him at a bar outside of work. As soon as she said hello, she claims, Johnson replied, “I’m going to fuck you in the ass.” He sought her out at work the next day to say he’d been blackout drunk, Thompson said.

Johnson’s most frequent target was a young digital designer who reported directly to him. Her desk was next to Johnson’s, and other members of the labs team said she was the butt of all his lewdest comments. In summer 2010, he said something so inappropriate that the team, in dramatic fashion, dragged her desk away from his and surrounded her with their own desks. No one could recall the exact comment. But both the designer and a former Sunlight employee, Hafeezah Abdullah, said the incident involved Johnson spraying the designer in the face with a can of compressed air used for dusting keyboards. The designer and at least one other team member told HuffPost they complained to the head of operations, who was Sunlight’s de facto HR rep.

Johnson didn’t recall his barside run-in with Thompson. It was possible it happened while he was blacked out from drinking, he said; he’s now in recovery. He remembers spraying the designer in the face, but he doesn’t remember making a lewd remark. “I can see how my actions toward her made her uncomfortable,” Johnson said. “I looked at her like a kid sister. I made comments like, ‘Hey, those are great shoes,’ and I probably did so too frequently. … I’m really sorry that in our professional relationship, I did not treat her with the respect of her talent that she deserved.”

Sunlight didn’t ask Johnson to leave over the spray-can incident, he said, but it gave him a warning. He quit the next day out of anger and defensiveness after seeing the rearranged desks. Sunlight, he said, “asked me to stay.” Former staffers said Sunlight never addressed the staff about his behavior or departure. The foundation, saying it could not discuss personnel matters, declined to respond to a list of detailed questions.

Multiple former employees said Sunlight’s failure to address Johnson’s behavior emboldened other men whose conduct also crossed lines. “Because of Sunlight’s lack of response, things escalated,” an ex-employee said. Said another, “It became a totally permissive culture.” A few of the senior men on staff hit on new female hires as a matter of course, two former employees recalled, and made sexually inappropriate comments. On a work trip, one senior staffer told a young female employee he had a genital piercing.

Sunlight struggled with these issues long after Johnson was gone. “An issue I was very disappointed to encounter at Sunlight was the lack of clarity around how to handle hostile work environment or sexual harassment issues,” an employee wrote in a 2015 exit memo obtained by HuffPost. “It became clear to me that, as colleagues came to me with examples of these issues they actively faced at Sunlight, they did not feel there was anyone in the organization they could turn to for addressing the issue.”

After Sunlight, Johnson moved into a covetable role as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, part of a group of tech luminaries enticed by a signature Obama administration program to dedicate six months to improving government technology. He published his book, The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Consumption, and became a fixture at conferences where lecturers spoke grandly about technology’s role in making government more transparent and accountable.

All this time, “his party trick was bringing women down a notch,” said Erie Meyer, the tech worker. At Personal Democracy Forum in 2013, Johnson humiliated her by saying to a group of CEOs she was meeting for the first time, “This is Erie Meyer. She’s Gray Brooks’ fiancée and she has herpes.” She was neither engaged nor did she have a sexually transmitted infection, but “this was Clay’s way of letting people know that I was a plus-one — I was not a person of note.” Meyer sobbed in a stairwell and skipped the rest of the conference.

A year later, Johnson became a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “We heard no reports of any kind of inappropriate behavior before, during or after Clay Johnson’s time at CAP and would have acted if the case was otherwise,” a spokesperson told HuffPost.

The Presidential Innovation Fellows program didn’t respond to requests for comment. No one provided evidence that either CAP or the fellows program was warned about Johnson’s behavior — although plenty wondered how his reputation could have escaped them.

Today, Johnson and his family live in his home state of Georgia. He worked as a senior vice president at the international volunteer organization Points of Light from 2016 to 2017 until, according to him, the commute into Atlanta became too long. He said he now mostly keeps to himself, writing Medium and Twitter posts for a sizable online following.

He said he regrets his past behavior and left Washington to get off the destructive path he was on.

Asked if he was surprised to have had a successful career despite that behavior, he said, “Am I surprised or shocked at what I was able to accomplish and how I was able to do it? I don’t know, I don’t have an answer.”

But he has been thinking about how politics could treat men differently.

“There’s no one that ever said to me in Washington, ‘Hey, Clay, you have a problem and you need to get some help.’ That’s not to say I’m not responsible for my actions, but [a cultural change] there, especially amongst young men, to watch out for this kind of behavior and to have the courage to say something could really go a long way.”

“Young men in particular are able to, in politics, ascend very, very quickly and with almost no executive coaching,” he continued. “I had never been through any training in sexual harassment. I had no idea how to treat women in the workplace. Most of the people my age that found power and success in that community were also the same way, meaning no one had any form of mentorship.”

I suggested that many of his former colleagues hadn’t required coaching to treat one another with decency.

“I’m not trying to defend myself,” Johnson said. “There are people who figure out how to run marathons on their own and there are also people who need help.”

“To the women that I know that have had issues with me, if they would have anything to do with me or want to be near me, I would extend an apology immediately, and I do not blame them for not” wanting to encounter him ever again, he said. “If these people are still feeling pain as a result of an encounter with me, or knowing me, or me being in their lives, even for a moment, that’s fucking awful, and there’s not an excuse for that. There’s not something I can do to make that go away.”

Although Johnson avoided self-destruction, he left a trail of devastation behind him. Numerous people recalled avoiding work opportunities — especially at Blue State Digital — that would place them in Johnson’s path. Because Schacht remained in the same industry, she was forced to see him occasionally, but she steered clear of events and projects where she might encounter him one-on-one. A few years ago, the lack of funding for Knowledge As Power forced her to shut it down. Johnson’s other accuser from the Dean campaign left politics altogether.

“The fact that I’ve seemed to encounter people across my career who think he’s problematic, the number of people who are concerned about him but are flies on the wall to his behavior, I find that so incredibly disturbing,” Schacht said. “To know that in the Dean campaign, to now know that there were two reports, and nothing was done? And that kicked off his career and led to all of these other things? It’s appalling.”

“I hope other organizations and people who are putting together campaigns take a lesson from what happened here,” she continued. “I’m a powerful person. I get shit done. For me, who was physically powerful enough to physically hold a massive man off of me, and overcome my fear, and find any opportunity to keep doing my work, but still have to dodge and weave this guy — that’s too much to ask of even the strongest of us.”

A change could take a while. After the incident at Personal Democracy Forum, Meyer emailed the most prominent CEO who had been present for Johnson’s herpes remark. “Why didn’t you say anything or stand up for me?” she asked. “What went through your mind?” At first, the executive, whose identity Meyer promised to keep secret, was dismissive. “Because in the 5 minutes prior he repeatedly called me a child molester,” he replied. “Like 5 times.” When she pressed him, he replied, “I took what he said to you to mean you were part of the circle, you were cool and I should pay attention to you. I actually thought *more* of you not less,” he wrote. But he added, “I understand why you were offended.”

That was several days following the conference. In the moments after Johnson spoke, nobody had said a word.
