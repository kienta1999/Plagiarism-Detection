A star was born at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

Bishop Michael Curry, who presides over the Episcopal Church, preached a lively, powerful sermon about love at the ceremony in England on Saturday that resonated with people around the world. Since then, the preacher has been parodied on “Saturday Night Live.” He’s been stopped for selfies, invited to chat on morning news shows, and his sermon has been reprinted in its entirety on the websites of secular news media.

Aside from all the publicity, the bishop claims the gravitas of the historic moment was not lost on him ― the fact that a black American preacher, a descendant of slaves, was chosen to preach to British royalty, descendants of a monarchy that left a bitter legacy of colonialism, segregation and disenfranchisement for people of color throughout much of the globe.

Appearing on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday, Curry suggested that only love could have accomplished such a feat.

“The reality is, the love between those two people, between that royal couple, was so powerful, not only did we all show up, but it brought all these different worlds together,” he said. “It brought different nationalities, different ethnicities, different religious traditions, people of all stripes and types, people of different political persuasions. ... For a moment we were actually together, organized around love.”

“Their love was a sign of God’s love and what that love can do in our lives,” he continued. “It brought together our African heritage, our British heritage, our American heritage.”

Curry made a splash during the royal wedding, quoting Martin Luther King Jr., gesturing enthusiastically to his listerners and referring to hymns sung by black slaves in captivity.

Curry on Tuesday also was on NBC’s “Today” show, and host Craig Melvin asked him if he was concerned whether his fiery, energetic preaching style would not be well received at the royal wedding. Some members of the royal family could be seen on camera smiling and chuckling while listening to the bishop’s sermon.

“I didn’t know [if it would play well],” Curry said. “But I knew they had asked me to come, and that’s me. So I showed up. ”

Curry, a Chicago native, is the first black leader of the Episcopal Church, an American denomination that is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Queen of England is the supreme governor of another member denomination, the Church of England ― making Curry a logical, if unconventional, choice to deliver a sermon at the wedding of an American actress and the British prince.

The selection of Curry was particularly significant because it came during a time when the American church is at loggerheads with the wider Anglican Communion over LGBTQ Christians. The Episcopal Church embraced same-sex marriage in 2015, departing from the conservative stance taken by other Anglican churches.

The 65-year-old bishop said that the royal couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, were the ones who chose him to preach at their wedding. They reportedly consulted with the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.

When an Episcopal Church staff member first told Curry about the news, he said during his “Good Morning America” interview that he genuinely couldn’t believe it.

“I said, ‘Get out of here, it’s April Fools. You got to be kidding me.’”

Curry said he had to keep the honor a secret ― even from his wife ― for almost two months.

The bishop admitted he was nervous on the day of the wedding. But once he started preaching, he said it felt like the historic St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle had turned into a regular church ― and that he was just speaking to a young couple in love.

“They are so passionately in love with each other you could see it,” he said on “Today.” “You could actually see when they looked at each other that their love was in that moment reorienting the world.”

Rev. Jon White, the director of the news and commentary site Episcopal Café, told HuffPost he was thrilled when he learned Curry was going to be part of the service. He said reactions to the sermon have been overwhelmingly positive in his own church and among Episcopalians online.

“He is an impassioned and inspiring preacher and I was gleeful awaiting his sermon at what many expected to be a stuffy and formal ritual,” White wrote in an email. “He did not disappoint.”

White said that in much of the developed world, Christianity is often portrayed as being filled with “mean-spiritedness,” “exclusion, abuse, and corruption.” But in the middle of the pageantry of the royal wedding, Curry portrayed a faith that was simple, authentic, and real, he said.

The Austrian government announced plans to ban kindergarten and primary school girls from wearing headscarves in the classroom ― an issue that Austrian Muslims say is “marginal.”

The country’s center-right government, led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, revealed plans on Wednesday to draw up what it calls a “child protection law” by the summer, The Associated Press reports.

Kurz, who rose to power with tough rhetoric against the influx of Muslim migrants into Austria, claims the number of young girls wearing headscarves in Austrian kindergarten and primary schools is increasing. He told the Austrian broadcaster ORF that his government’s goal is to “confront any development of parallel societies in Austria.”

“Girls wearing a headscarf in kindergarten or primary school is of course part of that,” he said, according to Reuters.

The proposed ban would reportedly affect girls under the age of 10.

But the Islamic Religious Community in Austria, an umbrella group known as IGGO that represents Austria’s Muslim communities, said the proposal addressed a “marginal phenomenon.” The organization says most Muslim kindergarteners in the country do not wear headscarves.

Many Muslim women only begin wearing religious headscarves, or hijabs, after they reach puberty.

In the rare instances that elementary school children do don headscarves, the organization said that each case should be considered individually and with the desires of the young girl in mind.

The organization called the government’s move toward an outright ban both “patronizing” and “absolutely counterproductive.” The group also pointed out that no one would think of banning children from wearing skullcaps or crosses in class.

“What appears most problematic is that this is also about fundamental and human rights, such as the right to education and freedom of religion,” IGGO’s statement reads.

Last year, Austria began imposing fines on Muslim women who wore face veils in public. However, women and girls have still been allowed to wear scarves that cover their hair.

Any bill to ban headscarves in kindergartens would need to pass Austrian Parliament with a two-thirds majority, Reuters reports.

People seeking asylum from the Middle East now make up almost 2 percent of Austria’s population, according to BBC. The influx of migrants has raised concerns among native Austrians that the newcomers pose a threat to the country’s mainstream culture.

Kurz was sworn in as Austria’s chancellor last December, after a campaign that capitalized on Austrian citizens’ anxieties about immigration. To form his coalition government, Kurz forged an alliance with Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, which was founded by neo-Nazis after World War II.“Stranger Things” creators Matt and Ross Duffer did not steal the idea for their hit Netflix series, acccording to emails and documents obtained by TMZ.

Filmmaker Charlie Kessler is suing the brothers, claiming the show has close similarities to a short film he made in in 2012 called “Montauk,” about top-secret government experiments. The lawsuit, filed this week in Los Angeles, says Kessler pitched the Duffers a series based on the short film in 2014, but never heard back.

“Stranger Things” was originally sold to Netflix in 2015 under the title “Montauk.” That’s ... strange, right?

But actually, the Duffer brothers were working on the “Stranger Things” series as far back as late 2010, according to TMZ. Emails from that time period use phrases like “paranormal” and “gritty eighties,” and explicitly state the show is set in Montauk, a village on New York’s Long Island.

An accompanying Google document from 2013 reportedly describes the opening scene nearly beat for beat with how the Netflix version began: A group of kids are playing Dungeons and Dragons at one of their houses, one kid leaves on his bike, and is kidnapped into a “strange world.”

“These documents prove that Mr. Kessler had absolutely nothing to do with the creation of ‘Stranger Things,‘” the Duffer brothers’ lawyer said.

The creation is an undeniable hit. According to Nielsen, the second season’s first episode was watched by 15.8 million people in its first three days.More awkward news for the beleaguered head of the Environmental Protection Agency: An energy lobbyist’s name was scratched out as the landlord on Scott Pruitt’s controversial condo lease and replaced with the name of the lobbyist’s wife.

Three Republican members of Congress have now called for Pruitt’s resignation since it was revealed the EPA chief paid a favorable rent last year to live in a Washington, D.C., condo linked to prominent energy lobbyist Steven Hart.

Details of the deal emerged in the wake of an investigation into Pruitt’s unusually expensive travel as part of his work for the EPA. One trip to Morocco last year cost $40,000. Pruitt spent his time touting liquified natural gas exports to that nation. The only exporter of liquified natural gas from the continental U.S. is Cheniere Energy Inc. The company was a client of Hart’s lobbying company, Williams & Jenson, while Pruitt was renting the condo. Exxon Mobil is also a client.

Steven Hart told ABC News that the condo was co-owned by his wife, Vicki Hart, with other unnamed partners. He said he believed the rent Pruitt paid — $50 a night a block away from the Capitol — was close to market rate.

A copy of Pruitt’s lease was published Thursday by The Washington Post. “Steve” is clearly seen scratched out on the lease to be replaced by “Vicki” Hart.

The EPA ethics office signed off on the condo deal, but a memo obtained by CNN and the Post, which included a copy of the lease, now says that not all the facts were known at the time.

Pruitt’s lease claimed he used only one room of the condo when he was in town, but it’s difficult to imagine he had roommates. Several EPA sources told The Washington Post that Pruitt’s daughter stayed in a second bedroom of the condo while she was working in the White House.

“Some have raised questions whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the terms of the lease,” the EPA lead ethics official, Kevin Minoli, wrote in his April 4 memo.

The impartiality rule requires that government officials avoid doing things that could create an “appearance of favoritism in government decision-making,” according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.

Ethical concerns about the condo are among several new issues dogging Pruitt. Two of Pruitt’s aides were recently granted raises (of 52 percent and 33 percent) despite the White House rejecting the increases. Pruitt told Fox News Wednesday that he was attempting to determine how that happened. But two unnamed EPA officials told the Post that Pruitt instructed aides to award the raises.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that “we take this seriously and we’re looking into” the condo lease.

But President Donald Trump on Thursday told reporters aboard Air Force One that Pruitt has been “very courageous . . . I can tell you at EPA he’s done a fantastic job.”Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is now saying that Florida's coastal waters are not exempt from the administration's offshore drilling plans. Tom Williams via Getty Images

WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Friday walked back previous statements about the Trump administration’s offshore drilling plans, indicating Florida’s coastal waters are in fact still on the table.

“No one was exempted,” he said, according to The Associated Press.

The comment came at an offshore wind energy forum in Plainsboro, New Jersey, where Zinke spoke about American’s energy potential and the Trump administration’s all-of-the-above approach to powering America.

In January, the Trump administration released a sweeping plan to boost America’s fossil fuel production that would open nearly all U.S. waters, including huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans, to oil exploration. Less than a week later, just two days into a 60-day public comment period, Zinke traveled to Florida, where he announced that, at the recommendation of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), he was withdrawing the state’s coastal waters from the areas that could be leased.

“I support the governor’s position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver,” Zinke said at the time.

Zinke faced intense criticism over the decision, which many saw as arbitrary and political. Democratic governors, lawmakers and other officials demanded that their states be granted the same exemption. And Republicans from Atlantic coastal states, including some who support offshore drilling, said the decision to allow it in coastal waters ultimately should be made by local officials.

Muddying the situation, Walter Cruickshank, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, told lawmakers at a congressional hearing in mid-January that Zinke’s statement on Florida “stands on its own” and “is not a formal action.” But Zinke later defended his exemption, indicating it would stand.

“The coastal currents are different, the layout of where the geology is,” he told CNN in late January.

Adding to the confusion, The Associated Press reported that at Friday’s event Zinke “specifically noted that Florida has not been exempted.”

During his public comments Friday, Zinke acknowledged that there has been “a lot of opposition” to new offshore drilling, in particular off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.DENVER ― Root, root, root for the home team. If they don’t win, it’s a shame pretend you’re in someone else’s home...

It’s baseball season in the Mile High City. To honor the occasion, the Denver Post produced what it called an “ultimate visitors guide” for fans attending the Colorado Rockies’ home opener Friday.

The otherwise solid rundown of Coors Field’s amenities contained just one tiny error: The newspaper used a photo of Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.

It’s a great picture. So great that readers could easily see “Phillies” above the scoreboard in the team’s iconic swooping cursive. The absence of the Rocky Mountains behind the stadium was also a pretty clear tell.

The Phillies were quick to call out the error:

What a lovely photo of Citizens Bank Park.



Right, @denverpost? 😉 https://t.co/CHV1mC4Gr2 — Philadelphia Phillies (@Phillies) April 6, 2018

The Denver Post owned up to what it labeled a “production error” and tweeted an apology. It also published a good-natured mea culpa a few hours later, asking fans to submit photos of Coors Field for a chance to win tickets to a game.

“With your help,” the paper joked, “we might finally know what Coors Field looks like.”

Embarrassing as the error is, it’s easy to see how it might happen.

The hedge fund that owns the paper, Alden Global Capital, has systematically whittled away at the staff. Although the Post has reportedly turned profits as high as $25 million in recent years, Alden Capital has taken a “strip-mining” approach to management, cutting dozens of journalists who would otherwise catch mistakes before sending the paper to print. The paper was forced to cut one-third of its remaining staff just last month.Bitcoin enthusiasts envision a world in which the entire economy runs on blockchain technology, allowing people to buy their homes, write their wills and even vote without the involvement of a third party.

By Jen Fifield

Things have been kind of crazy in Massena, New York, since the bitcoin miners came to town. So crazy that Steve O’Shaughnessy, the new town supervisor, says he hasn’t unpacked his office since he started his job in January.

O’Shaughnessy says it’s a good thing, though. In the past decade, his town of about 13,000 on the St. Lawrence River has lost much of its main industry — as a powertrain plant closed and an aluminum manufacturing plant downsized. But now, one and possibly two bitcoin mining companies are moving in, and they have promised to create dozens of jobs.

Across the United States, bitcoin miners — who set up computers to solve complex math programs and unlock new bitcoin — are rushing to small towns and wide-open states with cheap rent, land or electricity. Many places are shunning the bitcoin mining companies, saying they suck up too much electricity without producing jobs. But places such as Massena are putting out the welcome mat — not just for bitcoin miners, but for any and all “cryptocurrency” industries.

The idea is to attract entrepreneurs who are developing new uses for blockchain technology, which records agreements and transactions on an open, online ledger. Bitcoin was the original blockchain technology, but enthusiasts envision a world in which the entire economy runs on the technology, allowing people to buy their homes, write their wills and even vote without the involvement of a third party.

While bitcoin mining may not create many jobs, state officials and cryptocurrency advocates believe in the economic potential of the industries created through blockchain technology.

To signal that they’re open for business, states — especially those with small or shrinking populations — are enacting laws that, for example, exempt certain cryptocurrency transactions from the licensing laws that apply to others who transmit money, like banks. At least six states — Kansas, Illinois, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming — have enacted laws or issued guidance in the past four years that exempt some digital currencies from money transmitter licenses.

“There is a bit of a battle going on between states to be the next Silicon Valley for open blockchain networks,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on issues pertaining to cryptocurrency and related technology.

Enthusiasts in small towns are advertising their cheap electricity, organizing meetups, and trying to get businesses to accept cryptocurrencies — even as the value of bitcoin has declined over the past four months, and despite warnings that the largely unregulated industry is vulnerable to fraudsters, hackers and money launderers.

“We’re seeing a little mini-gold rush of blockchain companies right now,” said Wyoming state Rep. Tyler Lindholm, a Republican. “And I want them all.”

Appearing ‘Crypto-Woke’

Blockchain technology enables people to make agreements and transfer value without a centralized system. Each transaction is secured and recorded through cryptographic functions, or high-tech math, and verified through a network of users. By design, it is meant to regulate itself. Examples include bitcoin, but also applications that allow people to come to contractual agreements without involving banks, courts or lawyers.

Despite the system’s built-in protections, agreements and transactions made with blockchain technology are still susceptible to fraud, hacking and theft. That’s why some states have enacted regulations. New York, for example, in 2015 created a regulatory system, BitLicense, in which anyone doing “virtual currency business activity” must first get a license from the state.

Justin Wales, chairman of the blockchain technology and digital currency practice at Carlton Fields, a law firm, said New York’s law is flawed because it forces nearly everyone in the “tokenized economy” to follow the same financial rules as banks, even though there are many different types of tokens and transactions.

On the other hand, Wales and Van Valkenburgh say, the cryptocurrency-friendly laws that some states are rushing to enact don’t always make sense, either.

Regulators “want to do something just to be seen as doing something,” Wales said. This is a risky approach, he said, because poorly written laws could restrict the technology and stifle innovation.

Wales cites laws enacted by Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Vermont in the past two years as examples. The laws clarify that contracts secured on the blockchain are legally binding. The problem, Wales said, is that most states already have laws that verify that digital signatures are legally binding. Enacting new laws that make this technology-specific could have unintended consequences, he said.

“That’s an example of states wanting to appear ‘crypto-woke,’” Wales said.

Defining Cryptocurrency

Van Valkenburgh and Wales say states need to clarify when a license is needed to exchange tokens for dollars or tokens for other tokens.

“It could be good to get rid of the ambiguities,” Van Valkenburgh said, “a positive signal to the industry.”

Wyoming is trying to lead the way in defining the new market as it tries to diversify its economy with new technology innovation, said Lindholm. Wyoming lawmakers last month approved five cryptocurrency-friendly bills cosponsored by Lindholm, including one that makes it clear that the state distinguishes digital tokens from typical currencies and securities. Another exempts cryptocurrencies from state securities regulations.

“I don’t think hard regulations ever produced something that changed the world,” Lindholm said. “That’s what we are looking for and what everyone is looking for across the world.”

But it may be too late for U.S. states to compete with other countries that have far fewer regulations, said New Hampshire state Rep. Keith Ammon, a Republican who cosponsored a money transmitter bill last year.

Ammon thinks blockchain technology will transform human interactions.

“It’s akin to Christopher Columbus discovering a new continent,” he said.

Mining Moratoriums

In Massena, there’s an advocacy group working to attract blockchain technology entrepreneurs, said Nancy Smith-Weller, a member of this group and a cryptocurrency enthusiast. But not everything is in the hands of local advocates.

The Massena Electric Department recently put a hold on new mining projects until it can figure out how to meet the demand for power. The town has a limited capacity of cheap electricity, and according to one estimate, each bitcoin transaction consumes as much electricity as a U.S. homeowner uses in a month, about 900 kilowatt-hours.

Also, in March, the New York Power Authority, which provides some of the town’s electricity, adopted a moratorium on approving cheap power rates for cryptocurrency businesses. After the announcement, Blockchain Industries, a large company that was considering locating in Massena, scrapped its plan, according to Smith-Weller. She says the company hired her to act as a liaison with the town.

Not everyone in Massena is so sure that the benefits of having the cryptocurrency industry in town will outweigh the costs.

Timmy Currier, the mayor of the village of Massena, which is located within the town, said he is worried that the increased demand for power will raise electric rates and make the power less reliable.

Bitcoin companies promise jobs, he said, but there is no guarantee.

“They just expect us to believe them,” he said.

Despite the moratoriums, O’Shaughnessy wants the companies to come. He said there is plenty of power available from other sources, and the town has no qualms about attracting an industry that may not pan out.

Smith-Weller said the businesses will help the town reinvent itself.Teachers participate in a one-day strike against the government's privatization drive in public education in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 19. RICARDO ARDUENGO via Getty Images

In another bleak development for Puerto Rico’s decimated education system, the island’s Department of Education announced Thursday that it would close an additional 283 schools this summer, a 25 percent reduction in the current number of public schools.

Puerto Rico Education Secretary Julia Keleher said a sharp decline in student enrollment and the territory’s ongoing economic crisis, especially since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, had prompted the closures. Almost half of all schools are at less than 60 percent of enrollment capacity, Keleher said, with nearly 39,000 fewer students than a year ago. Officials have said several thousand more students are expected to leave the island for the mainland to continue their education in the coming years.

“We know it’s a difficult and painful process,” Keleher said of the impending closures, according to The Associated Press. “Our children deserve the best education that we are capable of giving them, taking into account Puerto Rico’s fiscal reality.”

The closures are expected save the education department about $150 million, said Keleher. She stressed, however, that no teachers would be laid off but some would be transferred between schools.

Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory in September, dealt a major blow to Puerto Rico’s education system, which had already been suffering from an enrollment slump. Last summer, 179 public schools on the island were shuttered and 150 more were closed from 2010 to 2015.

Following the new spate of closures, just 828 public schools will remain open, AP reported.

Teachers and parents have reacted with fury and frustration to the new closures.

“This is like killing 300 communities,” Aida Díaz, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Teachers, told Education Week. “We’re going to have communities that are not going to have any schools. The only place they have to meet is the school.”

The association said the school closures would affect 60,000 students and 6,000 teachers, reported Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo Dia newspaper. Díaz estimated that 4,000 non-tenured teachers would leave their jobs regardless of the Education Department’s no-layoffs promise.

“I don’t even know where the schools they’re being located to are,” Haydee Del Valle, whose 12-year-old son will need to transfer, told NBC News on Friday. “I don’t know if they’re too far away from us or if the school bus they take now will be able to take them there.”

“This makes me sad because this is a great school,” she added.

Díaz criticized the Education Department for not being transparent about how it decided which schools to close, noting that 45 of the schools had been recognized as schools of “excellence.”

Thursday’s closure announcement comes on the heels of a controversial education reform bill signed in March by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. The bill aims to introduce a charter school pilot program and private school vouchers for 3 percent of students.

Thousands of teachers went on strike on March 19 to protest the bill.

“They think that because our island is vulnerable, because it doesn’t have electricity, that we’re going to let them privatize our schools, get rid of our teachers,” Mercedes Martínez, president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation, told NPR in March of the reform effort.WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - The United States imposed major sanctions on Friday against 24 Russians, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for what it called a range of “malign activity,” including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.

The action, taken under pressure from the U.S. Congress, freezes the U.S. assets of “oligarchs” such as aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of Putin, and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, whose family controls Russia’s largest gold producer, Polyus.

The sanctions are largely a reply to what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Russian interference in the presidential election, although the Treasury Department painted them as a response to a series of adversarial actions by Moscow.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been under fire for not taking strong action against Russia after a series of diplomatic disputes reminiscent of the Cold War era and the sanctions could complicate his hopes for good relations with Putin.

Relations already had worsened in recent months as the United States expelled Russian diplomats over a poisoning case in Britain and imposed sanctions on Russians for alleged links to cyber attacks.

The latest sanctions are aimed at seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, plus 17 senior Russian government officials. They freeze the U.S. assets of the people and companies named and forbid Americans in general from doing business with them.

Trump has faced fierce criticism - including from fellow Republicans - for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling, its actions in Ukraine, and its support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war.

U.S. intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of using hacking and disseminating false information and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 elections and eventually try to ensure Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

OLIGARCHS AND ELITES

In addition to Deripaska and Kerimov, other businessmen on the sanctions list include Viktor Vekselberg, key owner of Renova holding group who Forbes magazine ranks as Russia’s 9th richest businessman with a net worth of $14.4 billion. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia.

Also targeted is Kirill Shamalov, a minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur. Shamalov married Putin’s youngest daughter Katerina in 2013, multiple sources who were at the wedding told Reuters. After the marriage, he swiftly grew his wealth through investments in Sibur but unconfirmed media reports say Shamalov and Putin’s daughter have since split.

Deripaska and other oligarchs on the list were not immediately available for comment but a spokesperson for Deripaska’s industrial group Basic Element said:

“The Company regrets this development and is currently analyzing the situation with its legal advisors.”

In announcing the sanctions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement, “The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites.”

He said Moscow “engages in a range of malign activity around the globe, including continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence in eastern Ukraine, supplying the Assad regime with material and weaponry as they bomb their own civilians, attempting to subvert Western democracies, and malicious cyber activities.”

Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said, however, Moscow’s contacts with the U.S. government would not be brought to an end by the sanctions. Russia denies interfering in the U.S. election.

The sanctions could hurt the Russian economy, especially the aluminum, financial and energy sectors, and are a clear message to Putin and his inner circle of U.S. displeasure.

Shares in some Russian companies targeted by the sanctions plummeted but the broader market and rouble showed little reaction to the new round of geopolitical tensions.

Shares in EN+ Group, which was put on the sanctions list and manages Deripaska’s aluminum and hydropower assets, were down 19.7 percent on the London stock exchange.

Deripaska resigned as president of EN+ in February after he was one of dozens of billionaires placed on a U.S. government list of Russian oligarchs in January.

Rusal, a Russian aluminum giant also included on the list, fell 10 percent on the Moscow Exchange.

Douglas Jacobson, an attorney with Jacobson Burton Kelley firm in Washington, D.C., said that while the sanctions prohibit U.S. banks from helping the companies targeted on Friday raise capital, most other international Western banks also are likely to also follow suit.

“These companies now are radioactive,” he said.

Russian state companies under the U.S. sanctions will receive additional government support, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said, according to Interfax.

RUSSIA AND TRUMP

Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, urged Trump to set out steps “to deter Kremlin aggression” against the United States and its allies.

“Nearly 15 months into this administration, the American people and our allies are still questioning whether the president is willing to fully defend our democracy and our national security,” said Menendez, co-author of the law under which Friday’s sanctions were imposed.

U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump’s election campaign colluded with Russia, something that Trump denies. Mueller has indicted 13 Russians and three organizations in his probe.

Daniel Fried, the U.S. government’s former coordinator of sanctions policy under former President Barack Obama, said the sanctions list “is a solid piece of work.”

“It doesn’t do anything dumb, like go after Russian gas exports. It goes after oligarchs that deserve it,” said Fried, now at the Atlantic Council in Washington.

Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former senior U.S. Treasury Department official, said the sanctions were significant, although there is more to do.

“I would hasten to say that Russia hawks may welcome this but wouldn’t find it satisfying. And by no means would this be the sum total of what the U.S. government should do to advance its concerns,” said Rosenberg, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.

Trump angered many members of Congress by failing for months to implement sanctions on Russia that lawmakers passed nearly unanimously last year.

But pressure for the United States to take action against Russia, especially from U.S. lawmakers, has been increasing.

Putin’s government has been blamed for the poisoning of a former Russian double agent living in Britain last month and the United States and several European states announced plans to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats in response.

In February, the White House blamed Russia for the international “NotPetya” cyber attack, which has been called the most destructive and costly in history.

On March 15, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on 19 people and five entities, including Russian intelligence services, for cyber attacks stretching back at least two years.Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt both knew about and supported massive raises for two of his longtime aides, despite denying having any knowledge of the action, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Citing two EPA officials familiar with the decision and a White House official, the Post said Pruitt instructed agency officials to give a $56,765 raise to Sarah Greenwalt and a $28,130 raise to Millan Hupp. Both women worked with Pruitt in Oklahoma where he served as attorney general and followed him to Washington, according to The Atlantic, which first reported the salary bumps.

Just a day earlier, Pruitt was subject to a blistering line of questioning from Fox News’ Ed Henry, who asked if the EPA administrator had any knowledge of the pay increases, which were carried out through a provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act after the White House rejected them.

“I found out this yesterday and I corrected the action, and we are in the process of finding out how it took place and correcting that going forward,” Pruitt said after attempting to duck the question several times. Henry later asked if the EPA chief was “embarrassed” by the size of the raises.

The report adds to a growing mountain of ethical issues dogging Pruitt’s tenure, ranging from his sweetheart rental of a condo on Capitol Hill to the ongoing inquiry into his first-class air travel. On Thursday, the Post and the Times reported that several high-ranking EPA officials have been reassigned or demoted for questioning the administration’s spending.

One of Pruitt’s top advisers, Samantha Dravis, resigned on Wednesday and his chief of staff has also considered leaving as pressure grows and lawmakers increase calls for his resignation, the Times also reported this week.Sergio García began the Masters tournament on Thursday as the defending champ, but a historically bad hole turned him into a chump.

If any reader has a mind to take up golf, just watch one of the game’s best players crumble out of contention in a hurry.

García, of Spain, came into the 15th hole at one over par while competing at Georgia’s Augusta National Golf Club. In the end, he required 13 strokes for the par-5 hole, tying for the worst score ever on one hole at the tournament, ESPN noted.

He hit the ball into the water five straight times at one point.

“I don’t know what to tell you,” he said afterward. “It’s one of those things. It’s the first time in my career where I make a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that. I felt like I hit a lot of good shots and unfortunately the ball just didn’t stop. It’s one of those things. It’s just unfortunate, but that’s what it is.”

What a difference a year makes. He carded a 3 on the same hole when he played it in 2017 during his march to the title, Sports Illustrated wrote.

Quite frankly, Sarah Paulson, 43, doesn’t care what you think about her relationship with her 75-year-old girlfriend, Holland Taylor.

“If anyone wants to spend any time thinking I’m strange for loving the most spectacular person on the planet, then that’s their problem. I’m doing just fine,” Paulson told Modern Luxury for the publisher’s June issues, as excerpted by People.

She also described to the magazine how the two, who revealed they were a couple in 2015, began dating.

Paulson said that she met Taylor at a dinner party about a decade ago, and although the “Ocean’s 8” star was dating someone else at the time, she thought Taylor was “probably the most exquisitely beautiful woman I’d ever seen.”

A few years later, the two apparently crossed paths and decided to follow each other on Twitter. They eventually slid into each other’s DMs and the rest is history — some of which has been documented in the women’s public declarations of their love for one another online.

Paulson has always seemed absolutely enamored with Taylor, who has had memorable roles in “Two and a Half Men” and “Legally Blonde.”

A former top CIA official who served as the agency’s station chief in Moscow is sharply criticizing his former boss, John Brennan, accusing him of doing Vladimir Putin’s “bidding” through his harsh attacks on President Trump.

In an interview on the Yahoo News podcast “Skullduggery,” CIA veteran Daniel Hoffman charged that Brennan’s public comments and tweets in recent weeks have played into Putin’s hands, helping the Russian leader stoke political divisions within the country and thereby undermine U.S. national security.

“I don’t think we’ve ever seen something like this,” said Hoffman about Brennan’s public comments about the president. “Gosh, I can’t remember ever seeing an instance of this in our history where a retired director of the CIA went as far as he did.”

Hoffman was reacting to a series of tweets and public statements the former CIA director has made in recent weeks after signing a contract to be a commentator for NBC News.

In one tweet on March 17, Brennan reacted to Trump’s apparent gloating about the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe (the president called it a “a great day for Democracy”) by writing about the president: “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.”

Then, in a March 21 appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Brennan said of Trump: “I think he is afraid of the president of Russia. One could speculate as to why. The Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult.”

Brennan declined to comment for this story. But shortly after his “Morning Joe” comments, he emphasized to the New York Times that he had no hard evidence that the Russians had blackmail material on Trump, notwithstanding the contents of a still-uncorroborated dossier prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele making similar allegations. “I do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail,” he told the Times.

But Hoffman, who served as CIA station chief in Moscow during President Barack Obama’s first term and later worked under Brennan as chief of the agency’s Near East operations, was not dissuaded.

“Sometimes, the president can bring out the worst in his enemies or his opponents, for all that entails,” said Hoffman in his “Skullduggery” interview. Even though Brennan appeared to back away from his “Morning Joe” comments, “the damage is done.”

“I found it quite disconcerting that he went as far as he did,” Hoffman said on the podcast. “Basically, accusing the president of being subject to blackmail by Vladimir Putin is an extraordinarily strong statement to make and carries with it a lot of damage.

“The people hearing that — the viewers, not just in our country but worldwide — would presume that John Brennan, based on his former position, would actually know the answer to that [Russian blackmail] question.”

“There’s no speculation there. He was the director of the CIA. He knows a lot. The nuance is lost on those who heard John Brennan’s statements.”

Hoffman first detailed his discomfort with Brennan’s public comments in an article he wrote this week for the Cipher Brief, a website that specializes in coverage of the U.S. intelligence community. The article got attention because Hoffman is the first CIA insider to publicly call out Brennan over his postgovernment comments. He wrote in the piece that Brennan’s tweets were “cringe worthy” and that, in his public statements, “partisanship reached a new low — and they were shocking to intelligence officers, who expect former and sitting CIA directors to carefully parse their words, especially when speaking to the media.”

Hoffman expanded on the critique in his “Skullduggery” interview, saying that the former CIA director appears to have been “blinded by his antipathy towards the president.”

To be sure, Brennan is not the only former U.S. intelligence official to publicly criticize Trump. Many of these officials were offended when, in one of his first acts as president, Trump visited CIA headquarters and, while standing in front of the Hall of Stars honoring former officers who died in the line of duty, devoted much of his talk to boasting of the crowd size at his inaugural speech.

“Look, freedom of speech is something we all value in this country,” Hoffman said. “But I think, if I could be so presumptuous to say, that as a retired director of the CIA — and Russians like to say there’s no such thing as a former intelligence officer, that just doesn’t exist for them — you almost want to say that you almost take the Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm to our national security when you’re exercising your freedom of speech.”

Hoffman noted that a principal goal of Putin’s influence operations against the United States was to stoke partisan tensions within the country and undermine the public’s faith in the government, including the intelligence community. In that sense, he argued, Brennan inadvertently aided Putin in his goals.

“What Vladimir Putin wants is what John Brennan delivered,” said Hoffman. Brennan, he said, “drove the partisan wedge between the two parties that much deeper. Democrats and Republicans are at each other’s throats over just about everything. It’s hard for them to agree on anything. When you have a retired director of the CIA immersing himself in this dialogue in a not-so-productive way, … that’s going to drive that partisanship to a new low.”

And, he added, it will “cause the president, frankly, to be concerned, and his team to be concerned, that maybe, yes, the Obama administration intelligence community team was in some ways biased against him.”

What Brennan should have done, he said, is hold his fire and “trust the process.”

“Go to the special counsel [Robert Mueller] and explain to the special counsel what your concerns are, if there are any, and avoid the damage that you would cause by the public statement that he made against the president.”Republican strategist Steve Schmidt blasted Donald Trump’s wild speech during a tax-touting roundtable talk in West Virginia on Thursday, saying the president sounded like a “drunk guy in Queens” spouting “total nonsense.”

Trump claimed that “millions and millions” of people in California voted illegally in the presidential election and that record numbers of women were being raped along the route of a group of migrants traveling from Central America into Mexico. There’s no evidence for either comment.

Trump sounded “like a drunk guy in Queens at the end of the bar talking complete and total nonsense,” Schmidt said on MSNBC. “That’s the president of the United States of America. It’s just extraordinary.” He derided Trump’s “lack of any comportment” and “dignity.”

“It’s inherent racism, this notion of people are coming here, and they’re black and they’re brown and they’re rapists and they’re murderers,” Schmidt added. “He is speaking to the ugliest threads in the country and in the country’s history.”

He has “no conception about the greatness of country and why it’s great,” Schmidt said. “And that is a tragedy.”

Schmidt said he couldn’t explain Trump’s behavior because “I’m not a psychiatrist.”

Trump made a big deal about throwing his prepared remarks out at the start of his talk in White Sulphur Springs. Trump disparaged criticism of him during the campaign when he called Mexican immigrants “rapists.” Women are “raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before,” he said, referring to the migrant route.

Jeremy Bash, former chief of staff of the CIA and the Department of Defense during the Obama administration, said, “This president, when he goes off script, he just starts lying.”WASHINGTON ― The Michigan state government declared Friday that water in the city of Flint has been “restored” and is as safe for drinking as municipal tap water in other American cities.

The government also announced that it would no longer provide bottled water through distribution centers and that “deliveries will end once the current supply of state-funded bottled water is exhausted.”

“We have worked diligently to restore the water quality and the scientific data now proves the water system is stable and the need for bottled water has ended,” Gov. Rick Snyder (R) said in a release.

Flint’s water had been contaminated with high levels of lead, a deadly neurotoxin, following treatment mistakes in 2014. After initially denying the problem, Synder’s government admitted its mistake when research showed higher blood levels in Flint children.

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a Flint pediatrician who led the research exposing elevated blood lead in Flint kids, said it’s too early to end bottled water distribution.

“This is wrong,” Hanna-Attisha tweeted. “Until all lead pipes are replaced, state should make available bottled water and filters to Flint residents.”

This is wrong.



Until all lead pipes are replaced, state should make available bottled water and filters to Flint residents.#FlintWaterCrisis https://t.co/z1gNVaDGXS — Mona Hanna-Attisha (@MonaHannaA) April 6, 2018

Like many American cities, Flint has a lot of homes that are connected to water mains via service lines made from lead. The water crisis occurred because the state failed to ensure proper water treatment to prevent the water from excessively corroding the service lines.

Rather than dig up and replace the lead pipes serving 7 to 10 million homes across the U.S., federal regulations tell states to try to reduce the corrosiveness of the drinking water.

In the wake of its water crisis, the city of Flint has undertaken an aggressive regime of pipe replacement that won’t be completed for several years. Fully replacing a service line typically involves tearing up both the street and yard in front of a home at a cost of thousands of dollars. Hanna-Attisha pointed out that research has shown the work of replacing service lines can temporarily spike lead levels because of how it jostles the pipes.

Any home with a lead service line could have lead in its tap water, though plumbing fixtures can also contribute small amounts of the heavy metal as well.

Under state guidance, local governments gauge lead levels in tap water by taking samples from people’s homes. Flint’s water has actually exceeded federal standards for two years, but before Friday, the city hadn’t made such a bold declaration about the water’s safety.

Though his own analysis of Flint’s water has shown similar progress, Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineer who helped expose Flint’s water lead problem, said the government’s initial response badly hurt its credibility.

“It is reasonable to believe that many Flint residents will never trust the government again,” Edwards said in an email.

The Environmental Protection Agency has long been considering changes to the regulation that failed to prevent the Flint water crisis, but EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has continued the pattern of delaying proposed revisions.The Trump administration is proposing rolling back protections for close to 300 threatened animal and plant species.

A new proposal — “Removal of Blanket Section 4(d) Rule” — was posted Monday by the Department of the Interior on a government database and was spotted by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental nonprofit.

The proposal’s title refers to a measure in the Endangered Species Act that extends protections to hundreds of threatened plant and animal species.

An endangered species is in danger of extinction, while a threatened species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. Threatened species include such animals as manatees, sea otters, the Guadalupe fur seal, wood bison, the gray wolf, the grizzly and polar bear, the northern spotted owl and other species of birds, snakes, corals and lizards, among others.

Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity said the proposed rule change is an attempt to ease restrictions for companies that operate in wildlife habitats.

“Trump is erasing America’s natural heritage to make his friends richer and allow polluters to ravage our environment,” Greenwald said in a statement. “If these critical protections for threatened species are eliminated, Trump will go down in history as the extinction president.”

Details of the specific proposal haven’t been publicly released. U.S. Wildlife Fish and Game spokesman Gavin Shire told CNN that the proposal is a “draft” currently under “internal review,” and that it would be “premature” to discuss it.

Shire told Courthouse News Service that public input will be invited once a detailed proposal is formalized.

The Interior Department’s move to eliminate the rule comes after two petitions to rescind it were filed by the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation.Amy Schumer has apparently canceled a scheduled interview on a local news station owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group after critics decried the company for forcing its anchors to read a script casting doubt on media integrity, BuzzFeed reported Thursday.

As part of a press tour to promote Schumer’s latest comedy, “I Feel Pretty,” the actress was reportedly set to appear on WJLA, a local ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C.

A rep for Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

She is joined by a handful of Democratic candidates who have so far pledged not to advertise on Sinclair-owned networks: Maryland gubernatorial candidate Krish Vignarajah, Kentucky congressional candidate Amy McGrath, Maryland congressional candidate David Trone, North Carolina congressional candidate Ken Romley and New York congressional candidate Gareth Rhodes.

“We’ve decided not to support a corporate media giant that bullies its employees into reading propaganda,” Romley said in a statement. McGrath said she felt that Sinclair’s script “eerily mimics the propaganda efforts” of “authoritarian regimes.”

A source close to the matter told BuzzFeed that the controversy also factored into Schumer’s decision, and that she does not wish to work with any Sinclair-owned station in the future.

Sinclair, the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations, sparked the criticism last month when it required anchors to read a statement parroting language on “false news” and “fake stories” used by President Donald Trump. The controversy came to a head this week after Deadspin released a video showing dozens of anchors reciting the scripted dialogue, their voices joining in unison.

The broadcaster ― which has a history of requiring its stations to air conservative segments ― has not backed down.

Scott Livingston, Sinclair’s senior vice president of news, said in a statement he “find[s] it curious that we would be attacked for asking our news people to remind their audiences that unsubstantiated stories exist on social media, which result in an ill-informed public with potentially dangerous consequences.”

While social media users can spread some false stories, including misinformation peddled by Russian trolls, Sinclair’s scripted message references “members of the media” whom it claims “use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda.”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ramped up calls on Friday to criminally prosecute immigrants who cross illegally into the United States, adding to a barrage of statements on immigration by the administration of President Donald Trump this week.

Pointing to an upswing in border crossings to levels seen during former President Barack Obama’s tenure, Sessions said he was ordering U.S. attorneys offices near the Southwest border to prioritize bringing cases against first-time offenders.

Once border crossers are charged with illegal entry and deported, they can be charged with a felony carrying significant jail time if they are caught crossing illegally again.

Trump signed a memorandum on Friday ordering the end of the policy known as “catch and release,” in which illegal immigrants are released from detention while awaiting a court hearing on their status.

Ending “catch and release” was one of Trump’s central promises during the 2016 campaign, but immigration authorities have faced a shortage of space to house people who have been detained.

Among the measures outlined in the memo, Trump directed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to produce a list of military facilities that could be used to detain illegal immigrants.

Earlier this week Trump pledged to deploy the National Guard to assist with border operations because he has not been able to secure funding to fulfill a central campaign promise of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed a memo on Friday authorizing the deployment of up to 4,000 National Guard troops. The memo said the troops “will not perform law enforcement activities or interact with migrants.”

About 150 National Guard members from Arizona will deploy to the border next week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said on Twitter. The Texas National Guard said it was preparing to send about 250 troops to the border within three days.

The United States has sent military to the border a number of times over the years.

Sessions directed the U.S. attorneys offices in southern California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to prosecute all the cases referred to under the criminal entry statute, known as 1325, “to the extent practicable.”

Sessions in April 2017 had instructed prosecutors to increase their focus on criminally charging first-time offenders as well as people with multiple entries.

Some federal prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges have expressed concerns that charging border crossers en masse is a drain on court resources.

Supporters of Session’s approach have said that criminal penalties deter repeat crossers, while detractors have said the prosecutions can deny legitimate asylum seekers the ability to properly file claims.

“This will be assembly-line justice, where large numbers of defendants are forced through the system without adequate time to consult counsel,” Cecillia Wang, a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.

In December 2017, a group of immigrant advocacy organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties division claiming that some immigrants being criminally prosecuted for crossing the border were being forcibly separated from their children.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the complaint.A flurry of town halls to address the country’s gun violence epidemic are planned nationwide for Saturday, marking the next major action organized by March For Our Lives.

The forums with elected officials and their constituents are the result of a call to action issued March 25 by David Hogg, a 17-year-old survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and outspoken member of the #NeverAgain movement to end gun violence.

Got it! Everyone should call for a town hall with their representative on April 7th. Your town hall should be 2hrs and start between 8am and 4 pm call your rep today to organize it and if they refuse to show up just invite their opponent. LETS GO!! Visit @townhallproject for help — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 25, 2018

March For Our Lives partnered with Town Hall Project, a volunteer-based initiative that identifies and promotes congressional forums, to help students organize each event, known as a “Town Hall For Our Lives.”

By Friday afternoon, there were more than 120 Town Hall For Our Lives events listed on Town Hall Project’s website, with over 30 Democratic members of Congress having organized or accepted invitations to the forums.

But their Republican counterparts failed to accept a single invitation to a Town Hall For Our Lives, causing the bulk of the events to be planned as “empty chair” town halls, in which the invited lawmakers aren’t expected to show up.

To be sure, the organizing process behind Town Hall For Our Lives appeared less seamless than that of March For Our Lives, the massive student-led protest against gun violence held nearly two weeks ago in Washington, D.C., and other cities worldwide.

Over a dozen events were added to Town Hall Project’s website just days before April 7, which could make it difficult for some lawmakers to rearrange their schedules given such short notice. In one case, a retired congressman was listed as having been invited, though it was unclear why.

HuffPost reached out to all of the roughly 90 Republican members of Congress who were invited to a Town Hall For Our Lives, as listed on Town Hall Project’s website. Ten responded.

Representatives for six of the Republican lawmakers who responded to HuffPost’s request for comment ― Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) and Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Lou Barletta (Pa.), Bob Goodlatte (Va.) and Jim Renacci (Ohio) ― cited scheduling conflicts as their reasons for being unable to participate. All but one of those spokespeople did not respond when asked if the lawmakers planned to host a town hall on gun violence at a later date.

“We don’t have any town halls on the calendar but certainly [are] open to hosting a productive forum to talk about it,” a spokeswoman for Renacci told HuffPost in an email.

A spokeswoman for Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas) told HuffPost that “no invite was extended,” but that he would be unable to attend either way because of a scheduling conflict. Two students organizing separate town halls in Texas disputed her statement.

“The necessity for dialogue between constituency and representative transcends ideology and party identity.” - Chris Pino, senior at Seven Lakes High School in Katy, Texas

Chris Pino, an 18-year-old senior at Seven Lakes High School in Katy, Texas, told HuffPost that the spokeswoman’s statement that Olson was never invited to a Town Hall For Our Lives was “simply not true.”

“I have reached out to him and his office on at least four occasions throughout the past week, both by phone and email,” Pino told HuffPost in an email on Thursday. “Each of those times, I received no definitive response. Today, I finally received a definitive response, which was a no.”

“The necessity for dialogue between constituency and representative transcends ideology and party identity,” Pino wrote. “Although elected officials and many of their constituents will disagree on some grounds, dissent in opinion is not a mark of division; rather, it is a building block for unity and for bridging the partisan divide. Simply stated, we must work together in order to succeed as a nation.”

A spokeswoman for Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) said his office never received an invitation to a Town Hall For Our Lives, despite the listing on Town Hall Project’s website. HuffPost was unable to connect with an organizer to verify that an invitation was sent. Womack’s spokeswoman did not respond when asked if he planned to attend or host a town hall on gun violence at a later date.

One Republican congressman was decidedly against participating in the Town Hall for Our Lives events for a different reason. Tyler Sandberg, a spokesman for Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), said the lawmaker had hosted a town hall with students Thursday, but would not attend the Town Hall For Our Lives he was invited to on Saturday because of its connection to ProgressNow Colorado, a progressive political advocacy organization.

“By all means, young folks should speak their minds,” Sandberg told HuffPost in an email. “But this rally is being organized by ProgressNow — a hate-inspired partisan group looking to raise money and win elections, not solve problems. Mike has no interest associating with the smear merchants at ProgressNow. He is seeking solutions, not stunts.”

Coffman’s position was “very disheartening” to Ian Gaskins, a 17-year-old junior at Mountain Range High School in Westminster, Colorado, and an organizer of the Town Hall For Our Lives that had invited Coffman.

Gaskins acknowledged that ProgressNow helped Never Again Colorado, a student-led anti-gun-violence group, organize the town hall. But he said he had no idea why Sandberg would call the organization “hate-inspired.”

“We are working with other groups just because we haven’t done this before,” Gaskins told HuffPost. “Just because we’re getting help, doesn’t mean it’s not our event. ... We are just students who want to be safe in our schools.”

A spokesman for Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that he is “unable to attend” a Town Hall For Our Lives, but noted he led a roundtable Thursday about school safety with school officials and members of local law enforcement.

Not every Democratic lawmaker responded to the Town Hall For Our Lives invitations either. Roughly 20 of them who had been invited had not yet confirmed their attendance as of Friday afternoon, according to Town Hall Project’s website. A much smaller number of Democratic members of Congress were invited to these town halls, likely because they are traditionally already in favor of gun reform legislation. However, a handful of them hosted related forums earlier in the week.

Florida Rep. Ted Deutch (D) was one of the dozens of Democratic lawmakers to heed Hogg’s call to action. Deutch hosted a Town Hall For Our Lives on Tuesday. It drew over 1,000 people to the Coral Springs Center for the Arts ― just 3 miles down the road from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Thank you to everyone from FL22 who joined the town hall. We came together tonight because this isn't over. We all need to rely on one another, support one another, and work together to make our communities safe from gun violence.#EndGunViolence #TownHallForOurLives pic.twitter.com/mwWMf4GBZ1 — Rep. Ted Deutch (@RepTedDeutch) April 4, 2018

Many students, parents and community members encouraged the 17 elected officials present at Deutch’s town hall, including mayors and state legislators, to pursue stricter gun laws in the wake of the Feb. 14 Parkland massacre. A handful of gun rights advocates showed up to the event as well.

“Their argument is that guns don’t kill people, that bad people kill people,” Coral Springs Commissioner Dan Daley said after a pro-gun attendee heckled him from the crowd. “Why would you want to make it easy for a bad person to get a gun?”

Jimmy Dahman, executive director of Town Hall Project and a former organizer for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, called the students’ efforts “incredibly inspiring.”

“These students have shown great determination in wanting to engage in the democratic process,” Dahman told HuffPost. “It’s elected officials’ responsibility to listen to their constituents.”

“Democracy is best served when the people show up,” he added.
