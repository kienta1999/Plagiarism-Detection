Filipino melon grower Denis Miguel was intrigued to hear of a young Indian farmer who in 2011 had broken the world record for growing rice by using an unconventional method of cultivation that needed only half as much water and one-tenth as many seeds but resulted in spectacular yield increases.

Miguel, from Isabela province, had never grown rice before, but he teamed up with a local rice farmer to try out the system. Last year, he reaped the equivalent of 10.8 tons of rice per hectare, or four times as much rice as the farmer usually grew on that land.

He was astonished. “A harvest of 10.8 tons per hectare on a rain-fed farm which used to produce only 2.5 tons was a great success. I was a newbie rice farmer. It was my first attempt at rice farming. It was an eye opener to all the people who were witness,” he said in an email.

Miguel is not alone. Reports from China, India, Southeast Asia and Africa suggest that average yield increases of 20 to 50 percent are regularly being achieved by farmers adopting the “system of rice intensification” (SRI), which aims to stimulate the root system of plants rather than trying to increase yields in the conventional way by using improved seeds and synthetic fertilizers.

Rice is the major staple crop of nearly half the world and is primarily grown by small farmers. Seedlings are traditionally planted in large clumps in flooded fields. One kilogram of rice typically requires about 660 gallons of water.

SRI, in contrast, involves the careful spacing of fewer but younger plants, keeping the topsoil around the plants well-aerated by weeding, using manure and avoiding flooding.

What was a grassroots movement spreading slowly by word of mouth since it was developed by French priest Henri de Laulanié in Madagascar in 1983 is now growing fast as regional governments in China and India join anti-poverty groups like Oxfam to back the method.

According to the SRI International Network and Resources Center at Cornell University, an estimated 10 million rice farmers in 60 countries have adopted SRI.

“It has the potential to reduce the amount of water, money and labor that farmers in developing countries need to spend. Time and again, farmers have seen improvements in yield, profitability and resilience,” says Norman Uphoff, professor of international agriculture at Cornell.

The idea of using less to gain more is seen as an important innovation for adapting farming to climate change and a way to increase yields at a time when human populations are growing fast but traditional plant breeding and genetically modified techniques have failed to increase yields more than a few percentage points, says Uphoff.

In Bihar, one of India’s poorest states, more than 335,000 hectares of rice are grown using SRI methods. Scientist Anil Kumar Verma from the rural nongovernmental organization Pran and the state government have led a push to develop new weeding tools to help farmers and yields have increased dramatically.

“SRI is changing the life of many farmers. Not only is it addressing food security problems, it is also emitting less carbon, which adds to global warming,” Verma says.

The new way to grow rice is proving most popular in water-stressed countries, says Tavseef Mairaj Shah, a Ph.D. researcher at Germany’s Hamburg University of Technology. “Rice growing in Kashmir largely depends on irrigation systems that draw water from the river Jhelum. But climate change is leading to drier winters, untimely rains, and warmer summers.”

“SRI promises to be a viable alternative, not just from the water-savings perspective but because it offers better yields and soil conditions. Different studies, both at the experimental level and farmer-participative level, have shown that SRI improves yields with less water,” Shah adds.

Some academics, the global seed industry and the international community have rejected reports of “fantastic” yields, accusing farmers of falsifying records and researchers of carelessness and “non-science.” But more than 600 articles, collated by SRI International at Cornell University, have shown benefits.

“The last published [academic] critique of SRI was in 2006,” Uphoff says. “There is nothing more to prove. The original hostility has gone. It may have been linked to the fact that SRI came from the grassroots and not the well-resourced global agricultural industry, which for 50 years has invested heavily in genetics, mechanization, improved seeds and the use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides.”

But, Uphoff says, the early opposition has resulted in comparatively little scientific research being conducted into SRI and a slow uptake by funders. “SRI was made controversial within the academic and donor communities. Donors have been reluctant to get involved although there are a variety of initiatives at the country or regional level,” he says.

Large donor agencies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation say they prefer to invest in high-performance seeds and genetically modified technologies.

“[We fund] investments in rice breeding and genetics because we believe innovations in these areas have the greatest potential to empower smallholder farmers and lift their families out of poverty. We don’t currently invest in rice crop management research,” said Gina Ivey, head of global policy for agricultural development with the Gates Foundation.

Attitudes are changing, however. The United Nations has come out in support of SRI in countries including Mali, Cambodia and Vietnam, and the World Bank has begun to promote it in India and Egypt. In 2017 SRI was endorsed by the science journal Nature.

“Clearly SRI is one of the technology options that has the potential to increase paddy yields for small farmers. We have invested in scaling up SRI systems in rice in both Bihar and Tamil Nadu [states] and based on our experience have observed that there is potential of more than 25 percent increase in the yield [and a] 64 percent increase in output per unit of water for SRI,” says Vinay Kumar Vutukuru, a World Bank senior agricultural specialist.

Uphoff calls for governments to study the experiences of grassroots farmers: “The principles of SRI can be applied to many crops. It is a genie that can no longer be stuffed back into the lamp. We could have accomplished so much more for farmers, consumers and for the environment if we had even some very modest support [from international donors] and hadn’t had to rely on personal resources and a lot of volunteered effort.”

Porter resigned from his position on Wednesday, the White House confirmed.

Porter’s ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby, said he emotionally, mentally and physically abused her, according to a report in The Daily Mail. After getting into an argument with her in 2010, Porter allegedly pulled her from the shower by the shoulders and yelled at her.

Colbie Holderness, Porter’s first wife, alleged that he punched her in 2005.

“He threw me down on the bed and punched me in the face,” Holderness told The Intercept. “I think he was shocked that he had lost control to that extent.”

Holderness provided photos to the publication showing a black eye she said she sustained during the incident.

Senior White House aide Rob Porter physically assaulted two ex-wives, they tell @theintercept. Full story to come in the morning.



His first wife, Colbie Holderness, provided these photos from a vacation they took together in Florence, Italy: pic.twitter.com/tl3TbyGA8Y — Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) February 7, 2018

Porter has denied the allegations against him.

“These outrageous allegations are simply false,” Porter said in a statement. “I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described.”

“I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,” Porter added.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly defended Porter in a statement and implored him not to resign, CNN reported.

“Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can’t say enough good things about him,” Kelly said. “He is a friend, a confidante, and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.”NEW YORK ― Planned Parenthood provided new details to HuffPost on Tuesday about the departure of its longtime president, Cecile Richards, and the next steps for replacing her.

Richards, the iconic face of Planned Parenthood for over a decade, will officially step down from helm of the organization in May, just after the April release of her new memoir, Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead — My Life Story. The search committee for Richards’ replacement will be led by Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist and novelist Anna Quindlen, whose mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 40.

“Anna’s unique voice on behalf of women has motivated us for decades,” said Naomi Aberly, chair of the board at Planned Parenthood. “The board is grateful for her willingness to help us find our future leader.”

The search committee, a group of nine women and one man of diverse backgrounds, includes Dr. Luz Towns-Miranda, activist and mother of “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda; Dominican-American television journalist Carmen Rita Wong; Democratic fundraiser Aimee Boone Cunningham; and various leaders and board members at Planned Parenthood. The board has specifically instructed the committee to seek candidates who reflect Planned Parenthood’s patients, most of whom are women and roughly 40 percent of whom are people of color.

Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit reproductive health provider that offers affordable contraceptives, cancer screenings, STI treatments and abortion care to 2.4 million patients a year, most of whom are low-income. The political arm of the organization, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, advocates for reproductive rights and helps elect candidates who support them. Richards’ replacement must be an effective and charismatic political organizer as well as the public face of the health care provider.

Loretta Ross, a black reproductive rights activist, made a strong case for a woman of color to replace Richards in her HuffPost column on the subject:

Planned Parenthood’s financial structure depends on the low-income black and brown women who rely on its services in communities with the greatest needs ― places like Texas, which has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world.

Under a white president, Planned Parenthood could still focus on the needs of low-income women. But to put a woman of color in the top job ― one with a fundamental understanding of how class works in a racialized health care system ― would send a strong signal to current and potential clients of color that the organization can be trusted and that it believes in empowering women who share their experiences.

Imani Gandy, senior legal analyst for Rewire, specifically called for a black woman to lead the nation’s largest family planning provider, because it would defang Republicans’ charge that Planned Parenthood is racist for having clinics in predominantly black neighborhoods.

“I want a Black woman—specifically a Black feminist—to be appointed,” she wrote in Rewire. “I’m hoping that the cognitive dissonance of blaming an organization run by a Black woman of supporting Black genocide might cause anti-choicers’ brains to scramble.”

Indeed, women of color have been critical in the fight for reproductive rights and women’s equality for many decades, but their voices are often left out. Richards pointed out that during the Women’s March last month, it was black women who led Democrat Doug Jones to victory in the deep-red state of Alabama.

“From Virginia to Alabama and to last week in Wisconsin, women have beaten the odds to elect our own to office. ... Women of color, transgender women, rural and urban women,” Richards said.

“White women, listen up. We’ve got to do better. ... It is not up to women of color to save this country from itself. That’s on all of us. That’s on all of us.”

Planned Parenthood, under Richards’ leadership, has been increasingly conscious of intersectional feminism and the need to elevate the voices and stories of women of color. The organization said it will strongly consider women of color as candidates to be its next leader.

In the meantime, Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, will take over as the public face of the organization once Richards leaves in May. She will also weather Planned Parenthood’s political fights as President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress remain determined to pull federal funding from the family planning provider.

Joe Solmonese, former president of the Human Rights Campaign and former CEO of EMILY’s List, will serve as transition chair to temporarily oversee day-to-day operations of Planned Parenthood. And Debra Alligood White, the organization’s general counsel, will partner with the board and search committee to run an “inclusive and transparent process” of finding Planned Parenthood’s new leader.

Richards, meanwhile, will be promoting her book and using her fundraising power to help elect Democratic female candidates in the 2018 midterms. A record number of women are running this year, inspired and motivated by an opposition to Trump’s presidency.

“As a lifetime organizer, I’ve never been more excited, despite this Congress and this presidency,” Richards told The New York Times in late January. “There’s this kind of organic activism by women.”

Richards is leaving Planned Parenthood in good shape ― since she took the helm in 2006, the organization’s supporters have grown from 2.5 million to 11 million. Republican congressmen can’t seem to make it through a town hall meeting without a woman in a pink shirt pressuring them to leave Planned Parenthood funding alone. And so far, members of the GOP-controlled House and Senate have been unable to defund the provider, despite many of their campaign promises to block Medicaid patients from accessing its services.

“We are determined to protect women’s health through the upcoming legislative sessions and in elections across the country,” said Aberly. “We are confident that our leadership at the national office and at Planned Parenthood affiliates will maintain the organization’s momentum as we search for a new president to replace the outstanding and dynamic leadership of Cecile Richards.”President Donald Trump has instructed government officials to start planning for a massive military parade to take place in Washington, D.C., sometime this year, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday.

The Pentagon confirmed the Post’s report on Tuesday. “We are aware of the request and are looking at possible dates,” Pentagon spokesman Charlie Summers told reporters, according to NBC.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters Wednesday that the Pentagon is “putting together some options” for the parade, saying that it reflects Trump’s “respect and fondness for the military.”

Trump, who has never served in the armed forces and avoided the Vietnam War draft on account of bone spurs, has long dreamed of showing off the United States’ military prowess in a large public display.

After he won the presidential election, Trump’s staff confounded officials by asking the Pentagon to send photographs of military tactical vehicles that he might include in his inaugural parade.

Confronted with the potential image of tanks and missile launchers rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue, some worried it might resemble the massive military parades in North Korea, a source involved in inaugural preparations told HuffPost last year. They were also concerned that the heavy tanks could damage D.C. roads.

But the president appears to have had better luck with his vision the second time around.

“The marching orders were: I want a parade like the one in France,” a military official told the Post. “This is being worked at the highest levels of the military.”

Trump attended a Bastille Day celebration in Paris last year as a guest of French President Emmanuel Macron and reportedly walked away “awestruck.”

“It was one of the greatest parades I’ve ever seen,” Trump, seated next to Macron, told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. “It was two hours on the button, and it was military might, and I think a tremendous thing for France and for the spirit of France.”

“We’re going to have to try to top it,” he added.

Officials have yet to decide on a date for the parade, the Post reported, though Veterans Day on Nov. 11 is currently a strong contender. Trump has reportedly said he hopes the display would run along Pennsylvania Avenue and pass by Trump International Hotel.

The number of jobs in the solar industry decreased last year for the first time since 2010, and the Trump administration’s new import fees on solar panels are set to worsen the decline, according to a report released Wednesday.

The industry’s job growth dipped 4 percent, a decrease of nearly 10,000 jobs, the Solar Foundation’s annual census found. Solar companies saw record-setting growth in 2016, and a slight drop was expected in 2017. But new tariffs imposed last month on the cheap, imported solar panels that fueled the solar boom are now expected to cause hiring to sputter.

“It’s very likely there will be a slowdown in job growth, perhaps more job declines into 2018 and in 2019 as well,” Ed Gilliland, senior director at the Solar Foundation, told HuffPost.

The findings mark a dramatic downturn for an industry that, just two years ago, created one in every 50 new jobs in the United States. In 2016, the industry employed 260,077 people, roughly 53 percent of whom were at companies that install solar panels. That number fell to 250,271 last year, though installation still made up 52 percent of jobs.

Part of the reason for the decline is that few companies expected the Republican-controlled Congress to renew the federal investment tax credit at the end of 2015. That prompted a rush to build solar projects while the financial benefits were still in place, and, given the months it takes to develop and construct solar farms, the boom carried over into 2016.

Cheap solar panels made overseas helped the solar industry grow 168 percent since 2010. But fears over new trade restrictions on those panels loomed large in 2017.

Solar installation jobs made up the vast majority of employment in the industry. Solar Foundation

In April, Suniva, a Georgia-based manufacturer owned by a Chinese company, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission after declaring bankruptcy, arguing that it was impossible to compete with imported prices. In May, SolarWorld, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel marker, joined the complaint. The companies requested that the Trump administration impose tariffs on panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the price of solar cells from about 33 cents to more than 78 cents per watt.

Manufacturing made up the second-largest chunk of solar jobs since 2010, comprising roughly 15 percent of employment in both 2016 and 2017. The sector also suffered about 2 percent fewer job losses between 2016 and 2017 than installers. In August, a group of 27 solar manufacturers warned the International Trade Commission that tariffs “endanger[ed] manufacturing jobs at our factories,” and urged the agency to reject Suniva’s request.

“We have been building our companies to meet demand from a large and growing domestic solar market. That market is now under threat,” the companies wrote in an open letter. “As true U.S. solar manufacturers, and on behalf of our 5,700 workers, we ask that you not grant Suniva’s request for global safeguard measures.”

But on Jan. 22, President Donald Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported panels, decreasing by 5 percent per year over four years. The fee was in line with what the International Trade Commission recommended in October, a proposal Suniva called “disappointing” because it was not as aggressive as what the company requested. Still, Suniva and SolarWorld executives “applauded” Trump in a joint statement, and urged him to increase the first-year tariff to 50 percent.

“It’s very likely there will be a slowdown in job growth, perhaps more job declines into 2018 and in 2019 as well.” - Ed Gilliland, senior director at the Solar Foundation

Roughly half of all solar equipment used in the U.S. this year is expected to come from overseas. The new fees are forecast to send solar installations plummeting by 11 percent over the next five years, according to GTM Research, a renewable energy market data firm. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projected solar deployments to drop by 5 percent over seven years, owing to a predicted uptick in construction after the four-year tariff expires. But the previous rate of job growth is unlikely bounce back, as solar companies seek new ways to cut costs as panel prices rise.

“There will be a recovery in how much solar is built and deployed. However, that won’t necessarily translate into jobs in the same way it has in the past,” Hugh Bromley, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told HuffPost. “The U.S. solar industry is begging for some labor efficiencies to be found to drive costs down to where they need to be to be competitive.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said the tariffs would lead to 23,000 job losses this year alone in both the solar installation and manufacturing sectors.

“The tariff decision was unfortunate, we were disappointed in it, and it will have an unnecessary negative effect on solar deployment and employment,” Daniel Whitten, a spokesman for the SEIA, told HuffPost. “But in the years ahead solar is going to resume its place as the leading new source of electricity in this country. It’s just unfortunate that it’s been perhaps delayed by this tariff decision.”

The Solar Foundation conducted its survey of 2,389 solar businesses ― some of which included various outposts of the same company ― in October and November, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ methodology to make 59,300 phone calls and send 35,000 emails. At this point, the White House’s impending decision on the trade case hung over the industry, and the survey responses reflect the uncertainty over the ruling, Gilliland said.

Even in anticipation of the decision, the survey projected a 5.2 percent increase in jobs in 2018 to a record 263,293, with a 6.2 percent spike in installation and a 1 percent manufacturing bump.

It’s unclear how much the tariffs will affect those outlooks in 2018, given that many projects have already purchased their building materials. But Gilliland said the fees could hurt all sectors.

“If the prices go up instead of down, which could happen because of the trade case, then we very likely could see a fall off in installation jobs, and potentially even a falloff in manufacturing jobs as their installers are using less of the manufactured goods,” he said.

It’s not all gloomy for the industry, however. Solar jobs increased in the District of Columbia and 29 states in 2017, including Utah, Minnesota, Arizona, Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Tennessee. States and cities emerged as vital counterbalances over the past year after Trump announced plans in June to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and proposed slashing funding for renewable energy.

In July, mayors from 1,481 cities representing 148 million people and 41.8 percent of electricity use across the U.S. signed a pledge to go 100 percent renewable by 2035. California vowed to get 50 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030, and could now hit that target a decade early. New York set the same goal, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans last month to divest a $5 billion stake in fossil fuels from the city’s five pension funds and sue oil companies for damages related to sea-level rise.

The rising tide pulled by cheap, imported solar panels buoyed manufacturing jobs in the U.S., too, as employment peaked in 2016 abreast of the installation sector. But solar manufacturers warned that the Trump administration's tariffs could hurt hiring at their factories. Solar Foundation

“What we’re seeing is many of the states are still setting renewable portfolio standards and setting goals for renewable energy,” Gilliland said. “So there’s very strong momentum toward renewable energy.”

Those regional policies caused diversity to increase in some parts of the solar workforce, and fall in others. Black representation climbed nearly 1 percent in 2017, largely due to the growth of jobs in areas with large black populations, such as the District of Columbia and several Southeastern states. But employment of Hispanics and Asians dipped 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, as states like California, Texas and Hawaii saw jobs contract in 2017. The number of women employed in solar fell 1.1 percent as jobs decreased in the sales and distribution sector, where most women in the industry work.

The majority of Americans understand global warming is happening, and that humans are causing it, though partisan divides remain stark over how to address greenhouse gas emissions. Solar energy nonetheless enjoys sweeping support, with nine out of 10 U.S. adults in favor of expanding its use, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center poll. Solar capacity around the world is still on track to multiply 14 times over by 2040, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance study found last year.Early viewers of the Marvel film “Black Panther” can’t stop purring about it ― and they want you to claw your way into theaters ASAP. Just look at the Rotten Tomatoes rating.

The early Rotten Tomatoes score for the film was already 100 percent after the first 55 reviews went up Tuesday.

“Black Panther” doesn’t roll out in North American theaters until Feb. 16, so the 18th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe could lose scoring steam by next week. But for now, it doesn’t look like it.

As per Rotten Tomatoes, critics are saying that the film “elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU’s most absorbing stories ― and introducing some of its most fully realized characters.”

Additionally, “Black Panther” is making massive waves with both its glorious celebration of African culture and the #BlackPantherChallenge.

Recognizing the significance of a primarily black ensemble cast, New Yorker Frederick Joseph worked with GoFundMe to raise $40,000 to take children from the Harlem Boys & Girls Club to see the film. Joseph has since rallied others to build on this gracious act with the #BlackPantherChallenge. Thousands of people have gotten involved and have donated over $260,000 to similar campaigns.

If the Rotten Tomatoes score for “Black Panther” stays at 100, it’ll be the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and DC universe) to garner a perfect rating. As The Hollywood Reporter noted, both “Wonder Woman” and “Captain America: Civil War” had 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes in early reviews, “but ended up at 92 percent and 91 percent, respectively.”Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) doesn’t seem to want to answer a key question about his much-hyped memo.

“Did the White House have any role in the memo, Sir?” asked CNN’s Manu Raju on Tuesday:

Here was the exchange: https://t.co/o9dhZbeo1X — Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 7, 2018

Nunes quickly walked away from Raju and other reporters.

“Democracy dies in darkness, my friend,” was all he would say.

That phrase ― minus the “my friend” ― is the slogan of The Washington Post.

Later, on Twitter, Nunes replied to Raju’s tweet showing the clip, saying:

In the ad, footage of Trump’s address pans to the Republican side of the chamber, where lawmakers are seen launching to their feet and clapping. The video quickly jumps to close-ups of several prominent Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Overlays in the ad call the behavior “disgraceful” and say Democrats are “disrespecting our country.”

“President Trump’s State of the Union address was so profound that even the mainstream media called it ‘strong’ and ‘inspirational,’” said Michael Glassner, executive director of the Trump campaign, in a statement on Tuesday. “Yet, our ad demonstrates that the unprecedented expressions of disrespect shown by the Democrats towards our President, our people, and our country were also profound ― for the wrong reasons.”

He continued: “The breathtaking indifference in reaction to President Trump’s calls for unity and to the President’s bold stories of freedom-loving heroes speaks for itself. The Democrats just sat there, and they were disgraceful.”

Democrats did, in fact, voice their discontent during the State of the Union, Trump’s first since assuming office. Many lawmakers stayed seated during some of the more rousing and self-congratulatory moments of the president’s speech, and his extreme comments on immigration drew audible boos.

The president made similar claims to the ad earlier this week, when he said Democrats who did not clap for him were un-American and treasonous.

“Can we call that treason?” Trump asked during a speech in Ohio on Monday. “Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much. ... Even on positive news, really positive news like that, they were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said treasonous. I mean, yeah, I guess, why not.”

Lawmakers are working, once again, toward a bipartisan budget deal to fund the federal government by Thursday. Such negotiations seemed to be progressing, but Trump waded into the debate on Tuesday, saying he’d “love to see” another government shutdown “if we can’t get this stuff taken care of.”Comedian Nicole Byer issued a PSA (of sorts) for airline passengers on Tuesday’s broadcast of “Conan.”

“The people need to know to not use a blanket,” she told host Conan O’Brien, after recounting a disgusting story about a Delta Air Lines flight she took from Louisiana to Atlanta in March.

Byer was feeling “chilly” and pulled one of the airline’s in-flight blankets out of a sealed plastic bag so that she could cover up. But a “little brown crumble” fell onto her lap — which she said turned out to be human poop.

“The smell hit me and I was like ‘oh my God,’” said Byer.

my flight number was DL5321 my confirmation number was HSAGVI I was in seat 1A and the blanket had a big ol shit. — nicole byer (@nicolebyer) March 16, 2017

Nicole, I'm so sorry for your experience this morning. *CB — Delta (@Delta) March 16, 2017

Delta apologized via Twitter. According to Byer, it also offered her compensation on condition she didn’t talk about the incident. But she declined, and insisted that people should hear her story.

The ordeal wasn’t completely over, however. Byer revealed she later found more poop in her cellphone case — which had been on her lap at the time. “It’s gross, plain and simple,” she told O’Brien.

The Eaton County, Michigan, sheriff’s office announced on Tuesday that John Geddert, the former U.S. women’s gymnastics Olympic coach who worked closely with former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar, is facing a criminal investigation.

The Lansing State Journal reported on Tuesday that the sheriff’s office said “there are new people coming forward” with complaints against the former U.S. Olympic coach. The department said it could not comment about the details of the complaints as the investigation was ongoing.

Neither Geddert nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Geddert was the head coach for the women’s gymnastics team during the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 London Olympics. He owned two training centers where Nassar worked and was reportedly very close with the disgraced physician, who has been accused by over 265 women of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar repeatedly molested many young girls at Geddert’s training center Twistars.

USA Gymnastics suspended Geddert in January amid Nassar’s highly publicized sentencing hearings. A few hours later, Geddert announced his retirement.

During Nassar’s sentencing hearings, dozens of survivors accused Geddert of being physically and verbally abusive, with some saying he must have known about Nassar’s abuse.

“My mother once told me ‘If a boyfriend ever treats you the way John does, leave him,’” survivor Annie Labrie said during her victim impact statement.

At least one athlete said in her victim impact statement that Geddert walked into the room while Nassar was molesting her.

Geddert and Nassar first began working together at the Great Lakes Gymnastics Club. Later, in 1996, Geddert brought Nassar on to work at the gym he currently owns, Twistars USA Gymnastics Club.

Geddert was competitive and was borderline abusive, verbally and physically, to gymnasts, according to Outside the Lines.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson reportedly mused about how a dystopian America much like the one depicted in “The Purge” films could actually happen.

Carson told guests at a Christmas party in December that a North Korean missile detonating in the exosphere would knock out the nation’s electrical grid, according to The Washington Post.

The newspaper reported:

“What’s that movie where there’s complete lawlessness and anarchy for one night a year?” Carson said, calmly resting his right hand over his left. “‘The Purge’! It will be like ‘The Purge’ all the time.”

“The Purge” movies envision a future where all crime is legal one night a year.

The fourth film in the series hits theaters this summer.

The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the sock saga.

Social media, however, has offered all the comments about the socks:

Enjeti told HuffPost via a Twitter direct message he had “absolutely no clue” who the socks belonged to, but that he did notice them on a day when it was pouring rain ― which would likely explain the wetness.

He also told us that “nobody who sits or stands around that area” of the briefing room “has any idea either” of where the socks came from.

“I’m not at the White House today because POTUS is traveling, but I will check on them Monday and tweet an update,” said Enjeti.

Stewart has not said whether she removed her shoes to protest the French festival’s rule requiring women to don high heels, and her representatives did not return HuffPost’s request for comment. But the star has spoken out in the past against what many consider an arcane dress code.

At the 2016 festival, Stewart told Vanity Fair that the policy needed to change immediately.

“If [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, ‘Excuse me, young lady, you’re not wearing heels. You cannot come in,’ then [I’m going to say], ‘Neither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?’” she said at the time. “It can work both ways. It’s just like you simply cannot ask me to do something that you are not asking him. I get the black-tie thing but you should be able to do either version — flats or heels.”

Here’s the sitch: Don’t call us or beep us, unless you want to talk about “Kim Possible” getting a live-action revival on the Disney Channel, OK?

The beloved animated children’s series about a high schooler by day and spy by night, which ran for 87 episodes on the network from 2002 to 2007, is currently being redeveloped as a live-action movie.

“Mark and Bob created an enduring character and kids all over the world found a friend in her, an average girl who just happens to spend her off-school hours thwarting evil villains,” Adam Bonnett, executive vice president, original programming for Disney Channels Worldwide, said in a statement, according to Variety. “Although Kim Possible ‘can do anything,’ kids and tweens found that this animated redhead was just like them. As we embark on the fun challenge of making Kim and Ron fully dimensional, I’m thrilled to be working again with Mark and Bob and to welcome the addition of a dynamic creative team – Josh, Zanne, Adam and Zach – into a world where anything is indeed possible.”

The film will be written by series’ creators Mark McCorkle and Robert Schooley, who will also executive produce, along with Josh Cagan. Adam B. Stein and Zach Lipovsk will take over directing duties.

Disney hall of famer Christy Carlson Romano voiced Kim in the original series, with Will Friedle playing her best friend (and sometimes love interest) Ron Stoppable.

Even so, quite a comeback.Michael B. Jordan has stepped out of the “Black Panther” universe to portray another kind of Black Panther on British GQ’s March cover.

The actor, who plays Erik Killmonger in Marvel’s upcoming “Black Panther” movie, believes it’s important to offer uplifting representations of blackness on and off screen.

GQ

“I feel like I never had that many actors to look at and inspire me growing up,” he told British GQ. “Black actors that I could identify with, that look like me on screen. … And I’m just thinking about what this movie is going to do to the kids growing up … specifically black kids who don’t have that many positive examples to look at on TV and film.”

With a 100 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and a Hollywood premiere that asked guests to dress like African royalty, the movie “Black Panther” has already become a symbol of black representation.

And with this cover, Jordan ― wearing the traditional Black Panther Party dress of black turtleneck, leather jacket and beret ― makes the link between an inspiring fictional universe and the historical activism of the Black Panthers.

The party was founded in Oakland, California, in 1966 as a way to protect and uplift the black community. Like the Marvel movie, the Black Panthers strove to represent blackness as it had not been seen before. Party members initiated breakfast programs for schools, promoted black beauty and monitored police behavior to protect their neighborhoods.

Government officials, however, responded to the very idea of armed and organized black people as a threat to national security. The Black Panthers was targeted by the FBI’s secret counterintelligence program ― COINTELPRO ― aimed at discrediting black activist and other dissident groups.

Now, artistic representations like Jordan’s cover celebrate the movement’s positive impact. Images in a mainstream magazine work to normalize its history and its narrative.

This Black Panther-inspired cover isn’t a first for the GQ franchise. Last year, the U.S. version of the magazine named Colin Kaepernick its “Citizen of the Year” and featured him on the cover dressed in Black Panther Party attire.

A year and another Black Panther cover later, Jordan told GQ that he looks at the present moment as one of progress and hope.

AdvertisementThat's the good news for those who fear Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― First, the dark clouds for those worried about fascism in America: President Donald Trump has adopted a phrase used in Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany to attack the free press. He has reportedly demanded loyalty to himself, rather than to the Constitution, from top law enforcement officials. Most recently, he called political opponents “treasonous” for failing to applaud him ― a tactic also used by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

Now, the silver lining, according to some of his fiercest critics: Trump has neither the cunning nor the self-discipline to set himself up as a truly authoritarian leader.

“He’s too incompetent to be a successful fascist,” said Eliot Cohen, a top State Department official under President George W. Bush, who nonetheless called Trump’s latest remarks “extraordinarily reckless.”

Trump made the “treason” comments at a Monday speech in Cincinnati, where he was supposed to be taking credit for the strong economy. He appeared to go off script to complain about the Democrats who did not clap for him at his State of the Union speech last week.

“They were like death and un-American. Un-American,” he said, and then playing to the audience, added: “Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”

Treason is a specific crime defined in the Constitution and the U.S. criminal code as levying war against the nation or giving aid and comfort to the enemy. It is punishable by death.

The White Office scrambled Tuesday to downplay Trump’s comment, with press officers explaining that his remark was “tongue in cheek” and then trying to shift the blame to the Democrats for allegedly wanting the country to do badly just so it would reflect poorly on Trump.

“The president was clearly joking with his comments,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at Tuesday’s daily press briefing.

But since becoming president, Trump has not just flung the word “treason” at congressional Democrats who didn’t applaud him enough. In a Wall Street Journal interview last month, he described the FBI agent who had expressed critical views of him in text messages in 2016 the same way. “That is a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act,” Trump said.

Those accusations follow Trump’s labeling the news media as “the enemy of the American People.” That turn of phrase was used in Adolf Hitler’s Germany and Josef Stalin’s Russia to attack critics, often with fatal results.

Since he took office, Trump has also demanded personal “loyalty” from top FBI and Justice Department officials – a dramatic abandonment of the modern idea that those agencies should operate with a degree of independence.

This leadership style, critics say, is more in line with that of a mafia don or a dictator than the president of the United States.

“We’re dealing with someone with clear authoritarian tendencies,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor and expert on Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. While the United States of today is a very different country than Italy of the 1920s and there is no fascist movement here per se, she suggested that Trump’s behaviors are reminiscent of Mussolini’s.

“He clearly would like to rule by executive fiat,” Ben-Ghiat said of the American president. “He attacks those sectors of society who deal with facts, like the press and the judiciary.”

Republicans who support Trump argue that his opponents are taking his words too literally.

“Pure Trumpism. Nothing to worry about,” said one top Republican National Committee member, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the president candidly.

“He obviously gets into trouble when he goes off script,” said a GOP consultant, who similarly spoke on condition of anonymity. “He doesn’t understand how government works. He has a limited vocabulary. He doesn’t do nuance.”

The consultant added that he doubted Trump would be able to change his behavior much, at this point in his life. “It’s hard to get someone 71 years old to change. It’s like trying to convince a dog to fly.”

Plus, “he’s not someone who admits mistakes,” the consultant said. “Combine that with a lack of knowledge of history and a limited vocabulary, and you run into problems.”

One British historian agrees that Trump’s opponents are overreacting to what he acknowledges are the president’s “fascist impulses.”

“Trump will be removed either after two years or six years, and that will be the end of Trumpism,” said Roger Griffin of Oxford Brookes University. “I wish people would talk less about Trump than the glories of the American constitution that prevents him from acting like a tin-pot dictator.”

Making inflammatory comments is not the same thing as acting on them, Griffin added. “It will be a bad day for American democracy when Trump actually proposes making not clapping treasonous and the judiciary allows it,” he said. “Then we can start worrying.”

But to Cohen, who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, ignoring Trump’s provocations carries its own risks. “By destroying norms, he’s opening the door for others who would be better at being fascists,” Cohen said.

And Robert Paxton, a Columbia University historian and author of The Anatomy of Fascism, said that while he agrees Trump is too incompetent to become a true authoritarian ― the president has proven unable to mobilize Congress to support most of his professed priorities, for example ― he could still do great damage to the country on a whim.Nicole Eggert filed a police report on Tuesday against former “Charles in Charge” costar Scott Baio ― after he dared her to do so. The actress told Los Angeles detectives that Baio sexually abused her when she was a minor, according to Eggert’s lawyer, Lisa Bloom.

LAPD detectives interviewed Eggert in Bloom’s office, TMZ reported.

“Nicole answered all of their questions for over an hour and told her story of sexual abuse by Scott Baio when she was a minor,” Bloom said in a statement Wednesday to HuffPost. She said “Charles in Charge” costar Alexander Polinsky “told the detectives about inappropriate touching he witnessed, as well.”

“We appreciate the Los Angeles police detectives’ interest in this case, and we will fully cooperate with their investigation,” Bloom added.

Last month, Eggert accused Baio on social media and in television interviews of sexually assaulting her when she was underage. She said Baio, who is 11 years older, digitally penetrated her when she was 14, and had intercourse with her when she was 17.

Baio has denied the claims, saying he and Eggert had consensual sex when she was 18. He has repeatedly told Eggert to file a police report, and wrote in a Facebook post Jan. 28 that his lawyers “requested” that she go to the police.

Bloom said associates of Eggert witnessed Baio’s “inappropriate behavior” when her client was underage. “We provided those names to the police today,” Bloom said.

A rep for Baio told TMZ: “We’ve been demanding since last year that Nicole Eggert bring her story to the authorities. It’s good that she finally has, even if it’s part of a publicity campaign. Perhaps she can explain to them her ever-changing story.”

Eggert also claimed that Baio told her to keep quiet about the assault when the 1980s sitcom was on the air lest the show be canceled and he be jailed.

“It took Nicole a long time to come to the decision that she wanted to let the world know what Scott Baio did to her and it’s been very freeing for her to finally talk about what happened,” a rep for Eggert told the New York Post. “Nicole is very happy that the report is done and she looks forward to seeing how they handle the investigation.”Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has been calling the FBI the "shadow government."

WASHINGTON ― Here’s an extraordinary claim that Fox News viewers have been hearing in recent days: The second-in-command at the Justice Department, the Republican law enforcement veteran whom President Donald Trump tapped to become deputy attorney general, threatened the Republican members of Congress investigating his department. He might be guilty of a crime.

Big, if true.

Gregg Jarrett ― a Fox News legal analyst who has recently taken to calling the FBI “America’s secret police” and the “shadow government” while calling Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation “illegitimate and corrupt” ― has recently begun telling Fox News viewers that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened members of Congress.

Jarrett has claimed that a “highly reliable congressional source” told him that Rosenstein “used the power of his office to threaten members of Congress” by threatening to subpoena their texts and emails during a Jan. 10 meeting with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and others.

A 2nd source has now confirmed to me that, in a meeting on January 10, Deputy A-G Rosenstein used the power of his office to threaten to subpoena the calls & texts of the Intel Committee to get it to stop it’s investigation of DOJ and FBI. Likely an Abuse of Power & Obstruction. — Gregg Jarrett (@GreggJarrett) February 3, 2018

A dubious claim from a cable news analyst isn’t normally worth dwelling on. But with the Fox News-addicted president indicating he wants Rosenstein gone and Mueller’s special counsel investigation, which Rosenstein oversees, ended, Jarrett’s claim could wind up in the presidential Twitter feed at any moment. It might even give Trump the excuse he wants to fire Rosenstein, the Republican the president has previously suggested he believes is a Democrat.

In an environment where most of Trump’s supporters already buy into the notion that the FBI is biased against Trump, Jarrett’s allegations against Rosenstein ― along with attacks from Fox host Sean Hannity and members of Congress ― could continue to sour public opinion of Rosenstein, who was well respected on both sides of the aisle before Trump made him deputy attorney general on April 26. He is in control of the Russia investigation, from which Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself.

A recent survey showed that of Trump voters who had heard about Nunes’ memo alleging misconduct at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBI, 56 percent said they got at least some of their information from cable TV, and 95 percent of that group said they watched Fox News. Jarrett’s allegation about Rosenstein has been repeated on Gateway Pundit, World Net Daily and other right-wing sites. Conservative blogs like Hot Air and RedState, on the other hand, have treated Jarrett’s reporting with a great deal of skepticism.

The president’s oldest son has promoted it on his Twitter feed.

If true that’s really scary. https://t.co/OK2tuGu5hh — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 3, 2018

The Justice Department would not comment on Jarrett’s allegations against Rosenstein. Sessions, who has gently defended the Justice Department as a whole as it has come under attack from his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, said last week that Rosenstein represents the “kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.”

It’s certainly possible that Rosenstein mentioned members’ texts and emails. But it’s tough to imagine a scenario in which the deputy attorney general would actually threaten to subpoena the text messages of members of Congress who were investigating the Justice Department. At the time of the reported meeting on Jan. 10, members of Congress were zeroing in on text messages exchanged by two FBI employees who were having an affair. Lawmakers, focused on the idea that the “deep state” was out to get Trump, would later investigate “secret society” texts that were obviously a joke.

Nunes doesn’t seem interested in clarifying or shooting down incendiary reports being aired during Fox News’ prime-time block. Nunes appeared on Hannity on Monday night, claiming that the Hillary Clinton campaign had “colluded with the Russians.” A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to a request for comment.

The airing Fox News has given to Jarrett’s initially single-sourced claim about the deputy attorney general raises a broader issue with Fox News’ coverage of the Justice Department, which suffered a big blow when Bret Baier falsely reported on a “likely indictment” of Clinton just ahead of the 2016 election. (Baier subsequently apologized.)

These days, the most explosive and unsubstantiated claims getting aired on Fox News aren’t coming from its national security reporters, such as Catherine Herridge. Instead, they’re coming from figures like Jarrett and Fox News contributor Sara Carter, who appears to be in close contact with the House Intelligence Committee and currently posts her stories on SaraACarter.com. Neither typically appears on the programs Fox News considers hard news.

Last week, after the release of the Nunes memo, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) accused Rosenstein and other Justice Department officials of treason. So if Republicans really are accusing the deputy attorney general of the United States of committing a criminal act during a meeting with them, it’s pretty clear the knives are out for Rosenstein ― even if they’re really dull.Activist Gloria Steinem during the 2018 Makers Conference in Hollywood on Feb. 6. Bloomberg via Getty Images

LOS ANGELES ― Gloria Steinem sees your worries about backlash to the #MeToo movement and is unmoved.

When HuffPost caught up with her for a few minutes at the Makers Conference in Hollywood on Tuesday, the 83-year-old feminist icon was clearly excited and hopeful about the global movement, in which increasing numbers of women are telling their stories of sexual harassment, assault and rape. As part of this wave, more than a few powerful men have lost jobs over credible accusations.

Women have experienced these things for eons, Steinem said.

“It’s not new except in its numbers, which is very important. So now it’s like a tidal wave,” Steinem told HuffPost on Tuesday. “What’s profoundly different: It is a majority movement,” she said.

Crucially, she added, “Women are being believed for the first time ever.”

As the number of stories about sexual misconduct have grown, there’s been an increasing rumble from several women and men concerned that there will be a backlash to #MeToo, which will shut down the conversation.

When asked if she was concerned about that, Steinem was blunt.

“Fuck them,” she said, laughing.

It’s hard to worry about backlash here at Makers, where about 500 women and men gathered over three days to talk about female empowerment. (Makers is also owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.) This year’s gathering, the fourth of its kind, hummed with urgency in light of #MeToo.

A panel of women from Time’s Up, a coalition of Hollywood entertainers devoted to fighting harassment and misconduct, opened the event on Monday with a call to arms. The hashtag ― there’s always a hashtag ― for the event was #RaiseYourVoice.

Speakers ranged from corporate stars like Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Stitch Fix CEO Katrina Lake to political legends like Pat Schroeder to Marcia Clark, who famously prosecuted the murder trial of O.J. Simpson.

Union organizers talked about sexual harassment on farms and in restaurants.

Academics and others spoke of the urgent need for intersectionality and the recognition that women don’t merely face sexism, but also racism and classism as well as other kinds of discrimination.

Talks ranged from the deeply personal to the highly technical. Uber’s chief brand officer Bozoma St. John elegantly sidestepped any issues with her troubled company by talking about her devastating time dealing with the death of her baby ― born at just six months ― followed by the tragic loss of her husband. She paused midway through her story as her eyes filled with tears. The hall was silent waiting for her to speak again.

There had already been tears earlier that day when 96-year-old Betty Reid Soskin, the oldest living park ranger, talked about her life and what it’s like to outlive everyone you know.

“I’m on the edge of life. I know that life has become so precious now. Not only in the months and the days, but now the hours. I wouldn’t have it any other way,” she said, as many in the audience moved to get tissues.

Others spent their time on practical ideas to help solve the pervasiveness of sexism.

Sandberg and her LeanIn co-founder announced a new program called MentorHer, a direct rebuke to the #MeToo backlash, where more men seem afraid to meet alone with with women.

“This is not the answer and that is unacceptable,” Sandberg said. “We need to end sex harassment now and forever and we need to invest more in women, not less.”

“If this moment is going to lead to real change, it’s going to be at the policy level,” Sandberg told HuffPost after her talk.

On the last day of the conference, Hillary Clinton gave a speech broadcast live from New York.

It was impossible to leave Makers without feeling hope that women are now, more than ever, speaking their truth and being heard.
