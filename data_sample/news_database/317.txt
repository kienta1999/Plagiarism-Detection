Oh, deer.

A Minnesota man looking for mushrooms ended up discovering something incredible: conjoined fawns.

The man found the stillborn fawns in May 2016 near Freeburg, Minnesota, about a mile from the Mississippi River.

The animals appeared to be recently deceased and were clean and dry, according to Gino D’Angelo, a University of Georgia researcher who studied the deer.

He said he believes the two-headed animal is the first pair of conjoined fawns reach full term and then be delivered by their mother, according to a University of Georgia press release.

Since the only other examples of conjoined fawns have been found in utero, these stillborn twins are a scientific marvel.

“It’s amazing and extremely rare,” D’Angelo said in the release. “We can’t even estimate the rarity of this. Of the tens of millions of fawns born annually in the U.S., there are probably abnormalities happening in the wild we don’t even know about.”

When researchers at the University of Minnesota’s veterinary diagnostic laboratory conducted a necropsy and MRI and CT scans of the body, they discovered the female fawns had one body but two separate necks and two heads.

When the animals’ lungs were placed in water, they sank straight to the bottom ― confirming that the fawns never breathed air and were stillborn.

Other anatomical abnormalities include two separate gastrointestinal tracts (but only one connected all the way to the anus), two hearts and extra spleens but only one liver, which was malformed, according to ScienceAlert.com.

“Their anatomy indicates the fawns would never have been viable,” D’Angelo said in the release. “Yet, they were found groomed and in a natural position, suggesting that the doe tried to care for them after delivery. The maternal instinct is very strong.”

New York is investigating an American company accused of selling millions of fake followers to social media accounts, the state’s chief prosecutor said Saturday.

The announcement from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman follows an in-depth New York Times investigation into Devumi, which it alleges has sold automated followers to politicians, celebrities and other public figures, often using the names, pictures and personal details of real people on those bot accounts.

If the accusations prove true, Schneiderman tweeted, Devumi may be found guilty of impersonation and deception. The violations alleged in the Times, he added, unfairly allow people with money to buy “apparent influence.”

Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York law. We’re opening an investigation into Devumi and its apparent sale of bots using stolen identities. https://t.co/uvxGOp7soQ — Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) January 27, 2018

The growing prevalence of bots means that real voices are too often drowned out in our public conversation. Those who can pay the most for followers can buy their way to apparent influence. — Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) January 27, 2018

Devumi, which the Times described as trafficking in “counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence,” advertises on its website that $10 will buy customers at least 500 Twitter followers in one to two days. For $49, it guarantees 10 times that number in two weeks or less. The firm also offers other forms of online social currency, such as retweets and video views.

Customers run the gamut. The Times named China Xinhua News, the country’s state-run news agency; Michael Dell, the computer billionaire; Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Lenín Moreno, president of Ecuador; and a slew of actors, athletes, reality stars and other public figures.

Devumi did not immediately return a request for comment on Schneiderman’s investigation.

Three more women are accusing actor Jeremy Piven of sexual misconduct, bringing the total number of public accusers to eight.

The latest allegations against the “Entourage” star describe aggressive and unwanted sexual advances taking place between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BuzzFeed reported.

One woman, who was not identified in the BuzzFeed story, accused Piven of grabbing her by the arms and trying to kiss her in his hotel room around 1994. Another woman, an extra on the 1990s sitcom “Ellen,” in which Piven co-starred, said the actor exposed himself, pinned her on his bed and forcefully kissed her while giving her a tour of his home in 1996.

Susan McCain Olson, an extra in the 1986 film “Lucas,” told BuzzFeed that Piven, who played a school bully in that movie, followed her into a trailer on the set, pinned her down on a sofa and forcefully kissed her.

“At one point I kind of was like, ‘This is it, this is where I’m going to get raped,’” McCain Olson told BuzzFeed. “I kept trying to push him away. I was like, ‘No, get off me.’”

Piven steadfastly denied the new allegations, noting in a statement to BuzzFeed that he had passed a polygraph test in which he said he had never forced himself on anyone nor exposed himself to anyone or restrained anyone against their will.

Evan Spiegel, Piven’s attorney, called the allegations “simply not true” in a statement to HuffPost on Sunday.

“As has been previously reported, to help prove that the allegations against him are not credible and that the media cannot rely on these people’s unverified stories, Mr. Piven previously provided polygraph results to BuzzFeed and other outlets to support his denials,” Spiegel said.

Piven was first publicly accused of sexual misconduct in early October 2017 by actress Ariane Bellamar, who tweeted that he had groped her in his trailer on the “Entourage” set in 2005. Weeks later, actress Cassidy Freeman accused him of “predatory behavior” in an Instagram post.

In November, BuzzFeed reported on three other women accusing Piven of sexual misconduct, including one who alleged that he’d grabbed her breasts without consent on the set of “Entourage” in 2009. Piven has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) says she is now open to supporting legislation that would make it harder to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the Department of Justice’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

“It would certainly not hurt to put that extra safeguard in place, given the latest stories,” Collins said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” She had said in December she saw no need of such legislation.

Trump ordered that Mueller be fired last June, but he backed off after White House Counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign over the matter, according to a bombshell report by The New York Times last week.

Collins said she had faith in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who gained direct authority over the probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, to resist any pressure from the White House to fire Mueller.

Discussing the Times story on the reported effort to fire Mueller, Collins said, “I think what happened here is, the president had a bad idea.”

She added: “He talked with his counsel, who explained to an angry and frustrated president why it was a bad idea, and that was seven months ago. And the White House counsel is still on the job, and Mr. Mueller is still aggressively investigating. And that’s as it should be.”

Several bills have been introduced in Congress that would shield Mueller and his investigation from White House interference, but none have gotten anywhere. A bill authored by Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) would only allow the firing of a special counsel in the event of “misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, or conflict of interest.” Another bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J) would require an extensive judicial process to fire a special counsel. Neither has gotten out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“It’s pretty clear to me that everybody in the White House knows that it’d be the end of President Trump’s presidency if he fired Mr. Mueller,” Graham said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” But he didn’t offer specifics as to how Congress would or should respond in that scenario.

Two bills to protect Mueller’s investigation were also introduced in the House, but their chance of passage looks even smaller.

“I don’t think there’s a need for legislation right now to protect Mueller,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet The Press.”Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says the Republican National Committee should donate or return any money raised by Steve Wynn if the sexual misconduct allegations against the billionaire casino mogul “have merit.”

″Yeah, we should do of ourselves what we ask of the Democratic Party if these allegations have merit,” Graham said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “I don’t think we should have a double standard for ourselves.”

Should the RNC return any money raised by Steve Wynn amid allegations of sexual misconduct? Sen @LindseyGrahamSC tells @MarthaRaddatz “Yes. We should do of ourselves what we ask of the Democratic party.” #This Week pic.twitter.com/Xz4tGRomxF — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) January 28, 2018

Wynn resigned his post as the RNC’s finance chair on Saturday, one day after The Wall Street Journal reported numerous allegations of sexual harassment against him that spanned several decades. The accusations ranged from lewd comments and inappropriate touching to soliciting sex acts from women who worked as manicurists and massage therapists in his Las Vegas casinos.

Wynn, 76, has vehemently denied the accusations.

“The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” Wynn said in a statement Friday. “We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits.”

The RNC has been noticeably silent on what they will do with money raised by Wynn, despite quickly calling on the Democratic National Committee to return contributions from Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, a major Democratic fundraiser, after the flood of sexual misconduct allegations against him in early October.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and several Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, returned or donated Weinstein’s contributions shortly after news broke of the allegations.

But their Republicans counterparts haven’t made any such announcements about Wynn’s contributions. Graham said Sunday that RNC chair Ronna McDaniel should be given “a chance to see how deep” the Wynn allegations go first.A newlywed gay couple claim to have discovered a legal loophole enabling them to have their marriage legally recognized in their native Russia.

Pavel Stotzko and Eugene Wojciechowski were married in Copenhagen, Denmark, earlier this month. And when the couple returned home to Moscow, they presented their Danish marriage certificate alongside their passports, The Independent reported on Saturday.

Though Stotzko and Wojciechowski said they expected pushback from customs officials, a clerk stamped the marital status page in their passports and filled their names in. The men are interpreting this as legal recognition of their union.

Russian law states marriages that were registered abroad will be recognized if they do not “contradict article 14 of the Family Code,” according to The Moscow Times. That prohibits polygamous unions and marriages between close relatives, but makes no mention of same-sex couples.

“Same-sex marriages are recognized in Russia as it turns out, thanks to our precedent,” Stotsko told RT. “There was no surprise on their faces. They simply executed the law and we’re thankful to them.”

The couple’s joy, however, could be short lived. After news of the story broke, Russia’s Interior Ministry spokeswoman Irina Volk told RT that Voytsekhovsky and Stotsko’s passports have since been listed as invalid in a federal database. Meanwhile, the customs official who “committed violations of Russian legislation and her direct supervisor will be dismissed from law enforcement agencies,” she said.

Meanwhile, Stotzko and Wojciechowski may face legal charges due to “intentional damage to passports or negligence,” according to The Independent.In an interview with Piers Morgan set to air Sunday night in the U.K., President Donald Trump used the word “terrible” to describe the initial decision last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to overturn an Obama era ban on the import of elephant trophies.

Trump also says he does not believe the substantial fees that hunters pay to hunt elephants and other species actually go toward conservation efforts, as is often claimed, and instead are pocketed by government officials in other countries.

Trump confirms that the ban on importing elephant trophies from the African nations of Zimbabwe and Zambia will remain in place. That was not clear after he initially put the ban reversal on hold, pending further study.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, overseen by Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke, announced on Nov. 15 that it was rescinding an Obama administration ban on the import of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, saying money generated by the hunting goes toward conservation efforts.

“Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,” the service said.

But the announcement on reversing the ban was met with scathing criticism from both the left and right. Powerful conservative media figures like Michael Savage and Laura Ingraham criticized Trump for the decision and called on him to keep the ban in place. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres announced a campaign to persuade Trump to maintain the ban that quickly went viral through the hashtag #BeKindToElephants.

On Nov. 17 Trump tweeted, “Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!”

Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2017

The announcement that he was putting the reversal on hold shocked many, primarily because his two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are both avid hunters and have been criticized for hunting wildlife in Africa.

Trump also is closely aligned with the National Rifle Association, which strongly lobbies for trophy hunting rights. Two days after he made that announcement, he tweeted, “Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.”

Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017

That tweet led some to believe the ban would remain in place but no further announcement was made as promised.

In his comments to Morgan, Trump said, “Well, I changed it,” referring to reversing the move to end the ban.

He continued: “I didn’t want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks brought back into this [country] and people can talk all they want about preservation and all of the things that they’re saying where money goes towards ― well, money WAS going ― in that case, going to a government which was probably taking the money, OK? I turned that order around. You know, that was an order. I totally turned it around. Were you shocked that I did it?”

Morgan: “I was surprised.”

Trump: “I thought it was terrible. That was done by a very high level government person. As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around. That same day ― not even a day went by. No, I was not believing in [the conservation argument].”Trump meets with Prime Minister Theresa May during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on January 25, 2018.

LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would take a “tougher” approach to Brexit negotiations than Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May, he said in a television interview to be broadcast later on Sunday.

In the interview with British channel ITV, Trump said the European Union was “not cracked up to what it’s supposed to be” and claimed he had predicted the result of the June 2016 referendum in which Britons voted to leave the EU. Trump was elected to the U.S. presidency later the same year.

When asked if May was in a “good position” regarding the ongoing Brexit talks, Trump replied: “Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn’t negotiate it the way it’s negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude.”

Pressed on how his approach would be different, he said: “I would have said the European Union is not cracked up to what it’s supposed to be. I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out.”

May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration in January last year and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands.

But the “special relationship” between the two nations has since faced several ups and downs, including Trump rebuking May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.

He said in an earlier extract from the same interview that he had not intended to cause offense in Britain by sharing the videos and that he would apologize if the original posters were horrible racists.

Trump’s comments on militant attacks in Britain have angered some and he has often exchanged barbs on social media with London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Trump also said in the interview that he had anticipated the Brexit referendum result because of many Britons’ concerns over immigration ― also a key plank of his U.S. election campaign.

“I said because of trade, but mostly immigration, Brexit is going to be a big upset. And I was right,” he said. “I know the British people and understand them.”

“They don’t want people coming from all over the world into Britain, they don’t know anything about these people.”

Trump also said he had been invited by May to make two visits to Britain this year.

Earlier this month, he canceled a trip to London to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for “peanuts.” Some Britons are angry at the prospect of a visit by Trump, with large protests expected when he does arrive.

Asked in the interview if he had been invited to the wedding of Britain’s Prince Harry and his American fiancee Meghan Markle, Trump said: “Not that I know of.”

He declined to say if he would like to attend the wedding at Windsor Castle but added: “I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy.

“They look like a lovely couple.”STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Billionaire IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who turned a business he launched as a teenager into one of the world’s best known furniture brands, has died at the age of 91, the Swedish company said on Sunday.

IKEA’s simple but sturdy designs and self-assembly products are now familiar in homes around the globe and the retailer is aiming to generate 50 billion euros ($62 billion) in annual revenues by 2020.

Kamprad started IKEA in 1943 when he was just 17, but his big break came in 1956, when the company pioneered flat-pack furniture.

He got the idea when he watched an employee taking the legs off a table to fit it into a customer’s car and realized that it could be developed to save money on transport, storage and sales space.

The business now has around 400 stores, many of them cavernous warehouses in out-of-town malls and roughly 1 billion people visited them last year.

“One of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century, Ingvar Kamprad, has peacefully passed away, at his home in Smaland, Sweden, on the 27th of January,” the company said.

Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Lofven praised Kamprad as an inspirational figure whose influence had reached far beyond his native land.

“Ingvar Kamprad was a unique entrepreneur who had a big impact on Swedish business and who made home design a possibility for the many not just the few,” national news agency TT quoted Lofven saying.

Born on March 30, 1926, in southern Sweden, Kamprad started off selling matches to neighbors at the age of five and soon diversified his inventory to include seeds, Christmas tree decorations, pencils and ball-point pens.

Despite his wealth, Kamprad prided himself on being frugal, driving an old car and encouraging staff to write on both sides of a sheet of paper to avoid waste.

Kamprad was also controversial figure.

He was forced to apologize for his time as a member of the New Swedish Movement, a nationalist, far-right group that supported fascist parties around Europe, in the 1940s.

His decision to live abroad, mainly in Switzerland, to avoid Sweden’s high income taxes was also widely criticized.

In recent years, Kamprad had stepped away from the day-to-say running of the empire he created, though he remained an advisor.

His sons ― Peter, Jonas and Mathias ― still sit on the boards of various IKEA entities, but the family is no longer at the helm.

“Ingvar Kamprad was a great entrepreneur of the typical southern Swedish kind - hardworking and stubborn, with a lot of warmth and a playful twinkle in his eye,” the company said.

“He worked until the very end of his life, staying true to his own motto that most things remain to be done.”

($1 = 0.8052 euros)Garrison Keillor, a former Minnesota Public Radio host, denounced the head of MPR and said his accuser “was a friend” in a statement denying recent harassment allegations against him.

Keillor wrote his statement in response to MPR president Jon McTaggart’s letter to listeners. In his letter, McTaggart explains why MPR cut ties with Keillor and answered questions sent to the station in response to his firing, including ones accusing MPR of tarnishing Keillor’s reputation.

“Listeners smelled a rat,” Keillor wrote in his statement, which was sent to HuffPost and published on his website. “Listeners know me far better than MPR management does and they know I’m not abusive.”

MPR fired Keillor in November and launched an investigation after a woman who worked on his show, “A Prairie Home Companion,” accused him of acting inappropriately. Keillor later told Minnesota’s Star Tribune that the claim stemmed from an incident in which he “accidentally” put his hand on the woman’s bare back.

In his statement, Keillor accused MPR’s management ― which he referred to as “McTaggart” and “his committee of faceless people who are in a panic” ― of failing to meet with him in person to talk about the accusations. If they had done so, Keillor wrote, “this all would’ve been avoided.”

Keillor defended his innocence while criticizing MPR in a statement sent to HuffPost Garrison Keillor

Keillor also claimed his accuser was “a friend” who was employed by him, not by MPR, and worked from home as a freelance researcher. He also accused her of signing off on her emails by writing, “I love you.”

“Our friendship ― which was mutual, reciprocal and respectful ― continued in frequent emails about our kids and travel and family things that continued to my last show and beyond,” Keillor wrote.

“She signed her emails ‘I love you’ and she asked if her daughter could be hired to work here, and so forth,” he added.

This week, MPR News published an investigative report on Keillor that suggested the host did far more than place his hand on a woman’s back.

The report claims Keillor wrote and displayed a suggestive poem about an employee in his bookstore, sent $16,000 and a confidentiality agreement to a subordinate he was romantically involved with, and told a 21-year-old student in his writing class that he was intensely attracted to her. It also revealed a 1998 lawsuit filed against MPR by a former employee who claimed Keillor discriminated against her based on her age and gender.

The report did not include information on the incident which resulted in MPR firing Keillor.

In his statement, Keillor called the woman’s complaint “a highly selective and imaginative piece of work” and said he would write of this experience in a novel.“Saturday Night Live” alum Will Ferrell returned to his old stomping grounds to remind us that no matter how bad things get, we really don’t want to return to the days of President George W. Bush.

Ferrell, reprising his old role as Bush in “SNL’s” cold open, addresses his fellow Americans from a fake Oval Office he has constructed in his basement. HIs approval rating is at an “all time high” because the polling numbers for “Donny Q. Trump” are in the toilet and “I’m suddenly popular A.F.,” he notes.

But “I just wanted to address my fellow Americans tonight and remind you guys that I was really bad — like historically not good,” Ferrell/Bush points out. “I get why you don’t like this current guy. Heck, I voted for Jill Stein all the way ... [but] don’t forget we’re still in two different wars that I started. What has two thumbs and created ISIS? This guy.”

And while he’s no “economer,” he knows the stock market was “no bueno” when he was in the White House.

Like Trump, Bush first won the presidency “despite losing the popular vote,” says Ferrell. “Though back in my day we didn’t let the Russians rig our elections,” he adds. “We used the Supreme Court — like Americans.”

SURABAYA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Suicide bombers suspected to be from an Islamic State-inspired group killed at least 11 people and wounded 40 in attacks on Christians attending Sunday morning services at three churches in Indonesia’s second-largest city of Surabaya, officials said.

Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has seen a recent resurgence in homegrown militancy inspired in part by Islamic State.

East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said explosions took place in three churches and at least 11 had died and 40 had been taken to hospital. He called on people to remain calm.

“All places where the public can gather, security has been tightened in those places,” he told a news conference.

Earlier, he told Reuters that an unexploded device at one location had been “secured”.

Television footage showed one church where the yard in front appeared engulfed in fire, with thick, black smoke billowing up. A large blast was heard hours after the attacks, which Mangera said was a bomb disposal squad dealing with a device.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.

Wawan Purwanto, communication director at Indonesia’s intelligence agency said Islamic State-inspired group Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) was believed to be behind the bombings.

JAD is an umbrella organization on a U.S. State Department “terrorist” list that is estimated to have drawn hundreds of Islamic State sympathizers in Indonesia.

The attacks come days after militant Islamist prisoners killed five members of an elite counter-terrorism force during a 36-hour standoff at a high-security jail on the outskirts of the capital, Jakarta.

The church attacks were likely linked to the prison hostage standoff, Purwanto said.

“The main target is still security authorities, but we can say that there are alternative [targets] if the main targets are blocked,” he said.

SUICIDE ATTACK USED MOTORBIKE

At St Mary’s catholic church, the first place of worship to be attacked, the bombing happened after an earlier mass was over and when the church was getting ready to hold another service.

Inspector general Machfud Arifin told CNN Indonesia the suicide attack at St Mary’s was carried out using a motorbike.

A witness interviewed by CNN Indonesia said shortly before the explosion he saw a person on a motorbike drive in carrying a cardboard box.

Separately, an internal police report reviewed by Reuters said a suspected bomb exploded in a car in the parking lot of a Pentacostal church, setting alight dozens of motorbikes.

In the third location, the Indonesian Christian Church, two veiled women entered the church’s yard where they were stopped by a security guard before an explosion occurred at the same spot, according to the police report.

Television images showed toppled and burnt motorcycles and debris scattered around the entrance of one church and police cordoning off areas as crowds gathered.

President Joko Widodo was due to visit the wounded in Surabaya on Sunday, police said, while Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Masudi condemned the attacks.

“We will not back down in the fight against terrorism,” Marsudi said in a message sent on Twitter.

A spokesman for PGI, Indonesia’s church association, called on the government for more help on security at churches.

“PGI is concerned because this had happened many times and often taken place around the time of Sunday services,” said Jeirry Sumampow, a spokesman for the Indonesia’s Communion of Churches.

Nearly 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but the country is also home to sizeable communities of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs.

Indonesia has had some major successes tackling militancy inspired by al Qaeda’s attacks on the United States in 2001. But there has been a resurgence of Islamist activity in recent years, some of it linked to the rise of Islamic State.

The most serious incident was in January 2016 when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in central Jakarta.

Churches have also been targeted previously, including near-simultaneous attacks on churches there at Christmas in 2000 that killed about 20 people.Melania Trump’s spokeswoman has slammed “salacious” and “false reporting” as the media raised questions about a possible chill between the first couple in the wake of news about Donald Trump’s reported payoff to porn star Stormy Daniels.

“She is focused on her family and role as FLOTUS — not the unrealistic scenarios being peddled daily by the fake news,” spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tweeted on Friday. She didn’t detail what those “scenarios” might be, but may have been referring to a report in the Daily Mail that Melania decamped to a D.C. hotel after the Daniels report.

She is focused on her family & role as FLOTUS - not the unrealistic scenarios being peddled daily by the fake news. — Stephanie Grisham (@StephGrisham45) January 26, 2018

The first lady had planned to accompany the president to support him during his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Grisham had announced. She suddenly changed her plans due to “scheduling and logistical issues,” according to her spokeswoman. The announcement was made the evening of Jan. 22, the Trumps’ 13th wedding anniversary, though there was no mention of that nor any apparent celebration.

Cancellation of the trip followed news reports that Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen, allegedly paid $130,000 to Daniels — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — a month before the 2016 election to keep quiet about her alleged 2006 affair with Trump while his wife was caring for their newborn son, Barron. Cohen has denied the payment and Trump has denied the affair.

While Trump was in Davos, the first lady made a solo trip to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., on Thursday and tweeted three photos and a video of herself very much on her own with a museum guide. She then flew to West Palm Beach. As The New York Times headline for a Maureen Dowd column noted: “Trump Hits Alps, but Melania Is Frosty in Florida.”

Historian Kate Andersen Brower, an expert on America’s first ladies, told CNN that a first lady’s cancellation of such a major trip is unusual. Trump’s relationship with his wife has appeared a bit unusual from the start, she said. The two lived apart until she finally moved to the White House with Barron in June.

“We haven’t had a relationship this fraught since, I think, the Clintons, even going back and looking at someone like Eleanor Roosevelt or Jackie Kennedy, where there were lots of rumors surrounding their relationship,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.

Melania Trump also notably did not post a photo of her with her husband in a post marking his first year as president. She instead shared a picture of herself posed with a Marine and with an ear-to-ear grin, an expression Dowd notes the first lady rarely has while with her husband.

Scroll below to see more stars wearing white roses and Time’s up pins.It was time to ask the President a question I suspect he’s never been asked. “Do you identify as a feminist?” He looked startled, then half-smiled as if the mere notion was ridiculous.

“No, I wouldn’t say I’m a feminist. I mean, I think that would be, maybe, going too far. I’m for women, I’m for men, I’m for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it, and they have to win. And women are doing great, and I’m happy about that.”Jay-Z got political Saturday and lambasted Donald Trump’s reported “shithole” remarks about African countries as “disappointing — and hurtful.”

“Everyone feels anger,” he said on the debut of CNN’s “The Van Jones Show.” “After the anger it’s really hurtful because he’s like looking down on a whole population of people, and you’re so misinformed because these places have beautiful people. This is the leader of the free world speaking like this.”

“On the other side, this has been going on, this is how people talk, this is how they talk behind closed doors,” he added, referring to “closet racists.”

Trump reportedly slammed the African nations and Haiti during a discussion in the Oval Office about immigration. “Why do we want all these people from shithole countries coming here?” he asked, according to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

On Sunday, Trump appeared to respond to Jay-Z’s CNN interview on Twitter by requesting someone inform the rapper about “Black Unemployment.”

Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2018

But during the CNN interview, Van Jones had asked Jay-Z whether Trump would be a good leader if he increased employment for blacks.

“No, because it’s not about money at the end of the day,” the rapper said. “Money doesn’t equate to happiness. That’s missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings. That’s the main point.”

He added: “My problem with government is I think they forget it’s real people behind these decisions that they’re making ... people going through ... real time in real pain. When you ignore that pain for so long, people act out and .... want to see something different, and that opens the door to what we’re living through now.”

Jay-Z also characterized the president as a “superbug,” apparently because his virulent power grew from societal efforts to merely cover up racism rather than addressing it.

“You don’t take care of the problem,” he said. “You don’t take the the trash out. You keep spraying whatever over it to make it acceptable. As those things grow, you create a superbug. Then now we have Donald Trump, the superbug,” he said.

“I’m being funny,” Jay-Z added. “Somewhere along his [Trump’s] lineage something happened to him, and he’s in pain and he’s expressing it in this sort of way.”

Asked about the #MeToo movement, Jay-Z said: “This had to happen to purge itself ... For it to get uncovered and the world to correct itself, this is what has to happen.”

The rapper also talked about his love for his wife, Beyonce, and his three children. He said the couple has fought to keep their marriage together despite complications because she’s his “soulmate.”

“We chose to fight for our love, for our family — to give our kids a different outcome, to break that cycle for black men and women,” he said. “We were never a celebrity couple, we were a couple who just happened to be celebrities. We are real people.”

Jay-Z tells @vanjones68 about mending his marriage with Beyoncé: "For us, we chose to fight for our love. For our family. To give our kids a different outcome. To break that cycle for black men and women" #VanJonesShow https://t.co/wLq6GxxpVc https://t.co/Nq4mLVAvSJ — CNN (@CNN) January 28, 2018Four people are dead after a gunman opened fire at a car wash roughly 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh early Sunday, officials said.

Police initially reported five fatalities, but lowered the death toll to four during a news conference Sunday afternoon. They noted that the shooter was on life support but not expected to survive.

The four victims’ bodies were discovered by police shortly before 3 a.m. when they responded to a 911 report about a possible shooting at Ed’s Car Wash in Melcroft, Pennsylvania, according to Fayette County District Attorney Richard Brower. Two of the bodies were found in a pickup truck and two others were outdoors by the side of the car wash.

Brower identified the victims as William Scott Porterfield, 27; Chelsie Lou Cline, 25; Courtney Sue Snyder, 23; and Seth William Cline, 21.

Another woman, whom police did not identify but said was in her early 20s, survived by taking cover in the backseat of the pickup truck. She sustained minor injuries from breaking glass.

The shooter, 27-year-old Timothy O’Brien, used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a 9 mm handgun to carry out his attack, officials said. He was also carrying a .308 rifle.

O’Brien sustained a possibly self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and was transported to a local hospital, where he was on life support.

Family members of the victims told local NBC affiliate WXPI that the shooter was a man who used to date one of the victims, although police would not confirm this during the news conference since the investigation was ongoing.

Ed Bukovac, owner of the car wash, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that a neighbor alerted him around 4 a.m. that something was wrong at his business. He said that police were already at the scene when he arrived and that he had few, if any, additional details to offer.

Brower described the shooting as “horrible” and “senseless.”

The Sundance Film Festival provides the first snapshot of what Hollywood has in store in any given year. Almost without fail, at least a few gems leave Park City, Utah, to become mainstream smashes. Last year’s slate gave us “Call Me by Your Name,” “Get Out,” “The Big Sick,” “Mudbound” and “Icarus,” all of which are now Oscar nominees.

But 2018′s crop lacked the same sense of discovery. The buzz of Sundance didn’t coalesce around any one or two movies the way it usually does, nor has it yielded a massive distribution deal destined to produce the year’s indie success story.

That isn’t to say there weren’t still gems to be found in the mountains. But will any of them appear on the 2019 Oscar ballot? It’s questionable. Gone, mostly, were the breathless eight-figure acquisitions built on rousing premieres and emphatic tweets. It seems distributors took notes after Fox Searchlight ponied up a record-breaking $17.5 million for “Birth of a Nation” in 2016, only to watch that movie smolder with controversy by the time it opened in theaters. The largest deal, so far, is that of “Assassination Nation,” an aggressive thriller about misogyny and social-media antics. It went for an impressive $10 million, while others sold for quieter sums.

Even if the 2018 festival supplies fewer breakouts than previous years, there were still plenty of conversation starters. HuffPost was on the ground for a week’s worth of Sundance flicks. Of the couple dozen films we saw, here are the six you should pay attention to in the coming months, as well as some standout performances and a few buzzy titles we didn’t catch.

"Sorry to Bother You" Courtesy of Sundance Institute We could build an entire cultural discussion around Danny Glover's career advice for Lakeith Stanfield in "Sorry to Bother You": As a telemarketer, you're better advantaged if you disguise your voice to sound white -- but not "Will Smith white." (Fun side note: Sundance juror Jada Pinkett Smith was in the audience at the premiere. Quick, someone ask what she texted her husband afterward.) But that counsel only skims the surface of this rowdy, surreal comedy about an Oakland 20-something hawking a wellness program that, come to find out, doubles as an elaborate slave-labor ploy.



With a character name like Cassius Green, an artist-activist girlfriend played by Tessa Thompson (just wait till you see her statement earrings) and a coke-guzzling boss (Armie Hammer!) who demands Cassius freestyle at a party, Stanfield and writer-director Boots Riley have conceived a character torn between wokeness, economic gain and a very human urge to keep the peace. But as events grow increasingly bizarre -- have you ever seen a horse-man penis? -- the movie also finds a soulfulness, resonating ever more strongly as it threatens to fly off the rails. Merrill Garbus ofTune-Yards fame wrote the score, so imagine an effervescent joyride in which corporate greed, racist stereotypes and palatial orgies make cameos. -- Matthew Jacobs "The Miseducation of Cameron Post" Courtesy of Sundance Institute



As Cameron meets her fellow "disciples," including Jane Fonda (Sasha Lane) and Adam (Forrest Goodluck) , she comes to realize she's not the only one who understands that what they're being pressured to do is anything but normal. Tackling fear and confusion with laugh-out-loud humor, this coming-of-age film celebrates its characters' individualities while showing the horrors of facilities that try to manipulate young men and women into changing who they are -- facilities that are unfortunately For her second feature, "Appropriate Behavior" writer, director and star Desiree Akhavan tackles a topic so disturbing, it's hard to believe it actually exists. "The Miseducation of Cameron Post," based on the book by Emily Danforth, finds Cameron (Chloe Grace Moretz) engaging in a sexual relationship with a female friend before she's sent to God's Promise, a conversion-therapy center that uses traumatic methods on teens "struggling" with same-sex attraction and gender identity.As Cameron meets her fellow "disciples," including Jane Fonda (Sasha Lane) and Adam (Forrest Goodluck)she comes to realize she's not the only one who understands that what they're being pressured to do is anything but normal. Tackling fear and confusion with laugh-out-loud humor, this coming-of-age film celebrates its characters' individualities while showing the horrors of facilities that try to manipulate young men and women into changing who they are -- facilities that are unfortunately still legal in 41 states. -- Leigh Blickley "The Tale" Courtesy of Sundance Institute



Writer-director Jennifer Fox "The Tale" will remain a conversation piece because of its courageous portrayal of sexual assault, told through the lens of a crafty documentarian (Laura Dern) reconsidering what she once convinced herself was a loving adolescent relationship with her adult running coach (Jason Ritter) and horseback riding instructor (Elizabeth Debicki). It's also a staggering piece of filmmaking.Writer-director Jennifer Fox turns her own experiences into a meta narrative about a woman who, as a young girl, was hungry for the affection her parents denied her. Storytelling at its most adept and sophisticated, "The Tale" uses fiction conceits to depict trauma from the vantage of someone seeking the truth about her own biography. It's as much a salve as it is an investigation. Only someone with an intimate understanding of sexual power dynamics could sketch this snapshot. That Fox did is a testament to her wisdom as a filmmaker. And, as always, Dern gives a powerhouse performance. -- MJ "Monsters and Men" Courtesy of Sundance Institute Out of the powerful slew of race-related films to hit Sundance this year, Reinaldo Marcus Green's "Monsters and Men" stands out, partly due to its presentation of different points of view of the same bodega shooting in Brooklyn.



Featuring heart-wrenching turns by Anthony Ramos, John David Washington and Kelvin Harrison Jr., the film focuses on the story of three men -- a devoted father who inadvertently films the incident on his iPhone, a black policeman balancing work and home life, and a young baseball prodigy who risks his future for the good of his community -- as they grapple with an all-too-common tragedy on the streets of New York. -- LB "Skate Kitchen" Courtesy of Sundance Institute The girls in "Skate Kitchen" glide through the New York streets, skateboards propelling their adolescent odyssey. This motley clique -- made up of different races, sexualities, temperaments, insecurities -- have a preternatural connection, catching one another when they fall and absorbing each other's lives the way only teenagers can.



Director Crystal Moselle, who made the 2015 documentary "The Wolfpack," said she met the group on the subway. Incorporating their real personas, she scripted a gauzy narrative about a shy newcomer (Rachelle Vinberg) who finds refuge with this very different sort of wolf pack. Invoking shades of "Kids" and "American Honey," "Skate Kitchen" is a vérité ollie full of life at its most bittersweet and its most vivacious. The plot is loose in the best sense, and the results make for a serene jaunt through the fleeting, beautiful days that will soon make these girls -- and the boys who surround them, including one played by Jaden Smith -- nostalgic for their youth. -- MJ "Colette" Courtesy of Sundance Institute This movie could not come at a better time. Touching on many themes presented in the Time's Up movement, Wash Westmoreland's "Colette" highlights the story of the famed 1900s French novelist (Keira Knightley) during the period when her husband, Willy (played by a delightfully villainous Dominic West), claimed ownership over her masterful "Claudine" books.



As Colette comes to terms with her own identity -- professionally and sexually -- her marriage begins to crack, leading her to discover her own unique path to success and happiness. With delectable costumes and scenic sets, "Colette" transports you to a time when women's voices were unfortunately lost but eagerly waiting to be found. -- LB

And a few standout performances:

• Robert Pattinson is something else in the Zellner brothers’ “Damsel,” a quirky, deadpan western set in the mountains of Utah. He brings true comedy (and life) to the film as a man desperate to find and marry his presumed fiancée-in-distress, Penelope (Mia Wasikowska). Highlight: He grabs a guitar and sings (!!!) a little ditty called “Honey Bun,” and it’s enlightening.

• Gossip frontwoman Beth Ditto is a comedic force in Gus Van Sant’s “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot,” playing a recovering alcoholic who enters AA meetings like a brash banshee.

• We’ve been patiently waiting for Carey Mulligan to utilize her true chops, and we’re happy to say she finally gets that chance in Paul Dano’s directorial debut, “Wildlife.” Playing an unstable mother of a 14-year-old boy in 1960, Mulligan soars to new heights as her character Jeanette strikes up an affair while her husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) is out fighting wildfires at the edge of the Rockies in Montana.

• Kelvin Harrison Jr. was the highlight of last year’s apocalyptic chiller “It Comes at Night.” After standout turns in two Sundance vehicles, Harrison is officially the Next Big Thing. He’s the MVP of both “Monsters and Men” (playing a sports phenom) and “Monster” (playing a wrongly incarcerated teenager). Remember this guy’s name; his movies’ titles will be easy to mix up.

• In the sterling HBO documentary “Jane Fonda in Five Acts,” Lily Tomlin jokingly laments that she wasn’t included alongside Fonda on the cover of Vanity Fair’s 2016 Hollywood issue. “Was it Sir-SHAY,” she asks, referring to whether the magazine spread features Saoirse Ronan. “Not even from Hollywood. Irish.”

• “Ophelia,” a retelling of “Hamlet” from the perspective of the doomed prince’s girlfriend, drowns in grandiose melodrama ― except for Naomi Watts, who pulls double duty as an egocentric Gertrude and a witchy recluse brewing potions in the woods. Watts has become a case study in picking bad movies but nonetheless submitting commanding performances.

• Although “A Kid Like Jake” boasts a stellar cast and compelling logline, it falls by the wayside in terms of delivery. But Claire Danes brings depth to the film as a lawyer-turned-stay-at-home mom who slowly comes to terms with her young child’s gender identity.

• “Hamilton” breakout Daveed Diggs and performance poet Rafael Casal portray rhyming BFFs navigating Oakland’s racial politics in “Blindspotting,” which opened the festival. Lionsgate acquired this affecting sizzler, plotting a wide release for later this year.

• “Hearts Beat Loud” is the sort of twee charmer you can half-watch on Netflix. But you won’t look away when Kiersey Clemons and Nick Offerman are making music together. They play a college-bound Brooklyn teenager and her widowed record-store-owner father, who form an indie-electronic duo called “We’re Not a Band.”

• In the impressionistic drama “We the Animals,” best described as "Beasts of the Southern Wild" meets “Moonlight,” newcomer Evan Rosado conveys what it’s like to be the artistic kid of sparring parents (Sheila Vand and Raúl Castillo) struggling to provide a harmonious home life for their children.

• That Kathryn Hahn delivers another dynamo performance should be no great shock. That she does so in "Slums of Beverly Hills" and "The Savages" director Tamara Jenkins' first movie in a decade makes it even more thrilling. Portraying a New York writer struggling to get pregnant in the Netflix dramedy "Private Life," Hahn is a thunderbolt of fatigue, disenchantment and hopefulness all rolled into one.

Based on buzz, the movies we’re sad to have missed:

• “Eighth Grade,” Bo Burnham’s directorial debut about a teenager preparing to leave middle school behind. A24 already had its hands on this film when the festival began. [Read The Daily Beast’s profile of Elsie Fisher, the 14-year-old breakout star.]

• “Hereditary,” a horror movie that seemed to haunt everyone who saw it. Toni Collette plays the matriarch of a family chilled by the death of their reclusive grandmother. It hits theaters June 8. [Read Vanity Fair’s review of the Ari Aster-directed thriller.]

• “Leave No Trace,” the latest from “Winter’s Bone” director Debra Granik. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie, who appeared in “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies,” play a father and daughter who reject conventional society to live in the woods ― until authorities intervene. [Read Vulture’s interview with Granik.]

FBI agents aren’t feeling the love these days.

Call it the war on G-men. As they’ve run interference for Trump by undermining the special counsel investigation being led by Robert Mueller, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have unleashed broad attacks that suggest the nation’s premier law enforcement agency is tainted by corruption and malfeasance.

They’ve latched onto a text showing a FBI official joking about a “secret society,” and suggested there was a “deep state” plot to “subvert the will of the American people.” They’ve compared the actions of U.S. law enforcement officers to the KGB, and said they have a secret memo ― written by Republican staffers ― proving “shocking,” “sickening,” “jaw-dropping” law enforcement conduct that was “worse than Watergate.”

When the Department of Justice said a tech issue meant that some text messages between two FBI employees who were lovers were missing, some Republicans smelled a coverup and saw a conspiracy afoot. “This is like the dog ate my homework, the excuse they give,” Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said on Fox News. “This is something that just should not take place.”

Trump called the the missing texts “one of the biggest stories in a long time.” And then the texts were recovered.

In recent years, Republicans have typically rallied to the defense of members of law enforcement who come under criticism. They’ve cautioned against painting law enforcement with too broad a brush.

So the lack of caution from some Republicans in accusing the DOJ and the FBI of engaging in a massive conspiracy has been notable. And it has many of the bureau’s supporters ― as well as other members of the GOP ― concerned.

“Unhelpful and unhealthy,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said in response to a question from HuffPost about the attacks that members of his party have been launching.

“Obviously, not everyone who works for the FBI is always above board,” Flake said. “But when you throw some blanket conspiracy over the organization, you make it more difficult to actually focus on causes where there might be an issue.”

Flake sees the attacks as an effort to “confuse” the public about Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and says the assaults are being perpetrated by politicians who are “ingratiating [themselves] to the president.”

He’s disturbed by that. “I think all of us are ― well, not all of us, but most of us ― are very troubled,” Flake said.

Ron Hosko, a former FBI official, has praised the approach that the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have taken to law enforcement. In a Fox News opinion piece last month, Hosko wrote that Trump’s inauguration “signaled the welcome end of eight years of unwarranted criticism from the Obama administration.”

He’s also got concerns about some of the texts exchanged by the two lovers, as well as “legitimate questions” about the FBI’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. That probe, he said, looks like it was “conducted by amateurs who were on a mission to let her off the hook.”

But Hosko laughed at the notion that the FBI is a hotbed of liberalism, as some Republicans seemingly would have it.

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said. “At its core, the FBI is still a pretty conservative, right-leaning organization that tries to divorce itself of politics.”

He views Mueller’s investigation as serious and well-run, and he’s concerned by some of the broader attacks on the bureau.

“There is certainly a group that sees damaging the FBI as the path to undoing Mueller and having Mueller go away,” Hosko said. “The image of the FBI is being tarnished. I’m hurt by it, I’m offended by it, because it’s my badge that’s being tarnished as well.”

The text messages exchanged by Lisa Page and Peter Stzok, the two FBI employees having an extramarital affair while playing roles in both the Clinton email investigation and Mueller’s probe are, no doubt, fascinating. The pair were part of two of the most critical investigations in the FBI’s history ― including the one that may have spelled Clinton’s presidential defeat and changed the course of U.S. history. Reading contemporaneous texts from two key players in that investigation is engrossing, especially when they offer sharp criticisms of Trump, as well as Democratic politicians and DOJ officials.

It’s all riveting palace intrigue. But as members of Congress and Trump attack Page and Strzok, it’s still not clear whether any of the texts reveal any actual wrongdoing ― let along anything so egregious that it could justify shutting down the Mueller probe that neither have been involved with for six months.

What’s been revealed so far might be useful for a defense attorney trying to illustrate bias and sow the seeds of reasonable doubt at a jury trial. Instead it’s being used by members of Congress to give Trump political cover to shut down an investigation that has already resulted in criminal charges against four of his aides. And it’s all happening before the DOJ’s inspector general issues a report that could offer clarity on whether Page and Strzok crossed any lines.

‘An attack on the integrity of these organizations’

FBI employees “put their lives on the line every day defending our country from a huge array of threats,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said in a recent statement. She wrote a letter to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has zeroed in on the “secret society” text and claimed to have an “informant” who talked about “secret meetings offsite.” It was all quite conspiratorial, and McCaskill wasn’t buying it.

“You have now made serious and damning allegations,” McCaskill, the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote. “I would assume that you would never make those kinds of allegations without serious and substantial hard evidence.”

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has had plenty of disagreements with the FBI, most recently over encryption. But he said it was important to him that his policy disagreements with the bureau would never be seen as an attack on the “wonderful people” who work there. That’s what he sees some Republicans doing.

“My own view is this is really an attack on the integrity of these organizations, and I think that is really regrettable,” Wyden said. “It undermines the vast majority of the people in these organizations who are so dedicated to the well-being of our country.”

“I’ve disagreed on policy with Bob Mueller, but Bob Mueller is a decorated war hero. People tell me he’s a Republican; I don’t know what party he belongs to, but he’s served Republicans, he’s served Democrats, he’s been doing his inquiry by the book,” Wyden said. “So disagree all you want on policy, but to me I think it’s very regrettable that there is an attack on the integrity of these organizations that I think day in and day out do so much to ensure that Americans are safe.”

A ‘Trickle Down’ Impact on Morale

Sessions, a former GOP senator from Alabama, has previously expressed serious concerns about law enforcement officials being smeared due to the actions of a few bad actors. He even backed troubled police departments with entrenched cultures of unconstitutional policing over his own Justice Department, calling reports by its Civil Rights Division on these matters “pretty anecdotal, and not so scientifically based.”

Following weeks of attacks on his department from members of his own party, Sessions on Friday offered somewhat of a rebuttal, saying that the DOJ would “defend our investigators and prosecutors from criticism that is unfair” while cooperating with congressional investigations.

There hasn’t been much indication of that defense so far.

Hosko, the former FBI official who is now president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, has praised Sessions’ support of the law enforcement community. But he’d like to see him be more vocal in the face of the attacks onMueller and the FBI, while, recognizing the attorney general is in a difficult spot.

“If you look at how Donald Trump sees the world ― that somehow the attorney general is supposed to be his protector and defender ― he doesn’t have that attorney general,” Hosko said. “He has an attorney general who I think has, in this regard, followed the law and done the right thing by recusing himself (from the Russian election-meddling probe). The president sees Jeff Sessions as having failed him, and so Sessions is at risk.”

But even those Republicans who haven’t taken the lead on criticizing the FBI are not necessarily willing to stick up for the bureau. In 2015, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas chaired a Senate subcommittee hearing titled “The War on Police: How the Federal Government Undermines State and Local Law Enforcement.” Cruz aired the notion that scrutiny of law enforcement, the type he thought was coming from Democrats, was causing jumps in crime and the murder of police officers. Law enforcement should not be treated as “the enemy,” he said.

“In my view, it is deeply harmful, not only for the men and women of law enforcement, but for the safety of the American people,” Cruz said at the time.

His colleagues’ treatment of the FBI doesn’t seem to have raised any similar alarms for Cruz. Here’s HuffPost’s exchange with Cruz on Thursday:

HuffPost: Senator, is there a secret society within the FBI trying to take down the president?

Cruz: I have no idea.

HuffPost: OK, what do you make of those texts?

Cruz: I haven’t read the texts, so I don’t know. I’ve read some of the coverage on the texts, but I haven’t read the text themselves.

HuffPost: What do you make of the coverage of the texts?

Cruz: I ... I don’t know.

HuffPost: You don’t know. You’re a DOJ alum, it seems like something that might pique your interest...

Cruz: It is ... concerning ... that lead investigators at the FBI and senior prosecutors at the Department of Justice have a demonstrated hard partisan bias against the president. I think it was a serious mistake to staff this investigation with Democratic partisans. If you look at the contribution history of...

HuffPost: But that’s illegal to look at when you’re hiring, isn’t it?

Cruz: If you look at the ... no it’s not.

HuffPost: You’re saying that based on party, political donations, you can make decisions on who you’re going to hire?

Cruz: I didn’t say hire ...

Mueller is, in fact, barred from taking political contributions into account when making personnel decisions involving positions on his team. But Cruz said that Mueller, a Republican, had made a serious mistake by staffing his special counsel office with people who donated to Democrats.

Cruz went on to bring up his complaints about issues from the Obama era, saying that the prior administration “badly undermined” the nonpartisan tradition of the FBI and the DOJ. He offered no defense of the FBI writ large.

Several conservative commentators have urged Republicans to use caution, and some FBI critics have attempted to limit the scope of their complaints, insisting they were only complaining about high-ranking officials at the bureau.

Donald Trump Jr., a potential target of the Mueller probe, tweeted on Thursday that it was “fun watching main stream media defend law enforcement for the first time ever.”

He also suggested that the media was only supporting “elitist” bureaucrats. “Try supporting the boots not the suits for a change,” Trump Jr. tweeted. “That’s where the real risks are taken and sacrifices are made.”

In a statement on Monday, a White House spokesman said Trump has “enormous respect for the thousands of rank-and-file F.B.I. agents who make up the world’s most professional and talented law enforcement agency.” The president’s concerns, the spokesman said, were about “misconduct at the highest levels of the FBI,” from “politically motivated senior leaders” whose actions had “tainted the agency’s reputation for unbiased pursuit of justice.”

But those criticisms have an impact on the rank-and-file, said Thomas O’Connor, an FBI official speaking to HuffPost in his capacity as president of the FBI Agents Association.

“The attacks on the FBI from all different kinds of sources clearly trickle down to the person, the agent, the analyst, the FBI employee on the street, in the field offices,” O’Connor said.

Still, he expressed confidence that FBI agents can soldier through as the integrity of the bureau comes under attack.

“Even when people are saying things that we know are untrue,” he said, “we’ll make it through this.”
