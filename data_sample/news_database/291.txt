WASHINGTON ― Several Republican lawmakers on Sunday said that despite claims by President Donald Trump and some of their colleagues, a GOP-authored memo critical of the Russia investigation doesn’t undermine the need for the probe to continue.

Following the release of the memo on Friday, Trump used the memo to call the investigation into possible collusion by his campaign with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential campaign a “witch hunt” and an “American disgrace!” Trump also said the memo ― which alleges that senior Department of Justice and FBI officials improperly used information from the so-called Steele dossier to get a court to approve surveillance warrants on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser ― “totally vindicates” him.

In Trump’s view, the memo buttressed his repeated calls for an end to the Russia investigation. Members of his own party who appeared on Sunday talk shows disagreed.

“I actually don’t think [the memo] has any impact on the Russia probe. There is a Russia investigation without a dossier,” Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C) said on CBS’ “Face the Nation”

“DOJ and the FBI should continue doing their job,” Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) said on ABC’s “This Week.”

He added that he didn’t view the memo as an attack on Robert Mueller, the special counsel who heads the Russia probe, or as “an attack on the men and women in the FBI,”

Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), called the memo “a separate issue” from the investigation. “I don’t think it really has anything to do with that,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The memo “doesn’t end [the need for the Mueller investigation] at all,” Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the special counsel shouldn’t complete his work.”

This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2018

The views of these Republicans not only put them at odds with Trump, but also with many of their House colleagues and prominent Fox News hosts who the president relies upon for political insights.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also tried to separate the memo from the Mueller probe last week, even as some members of his caucus accused top DOJ and FBI officials of committing treason against the U.S. Speculation continues that the memo will give Trump political cover to have Mueller fired and squelch the probe that has already seen charges brought against four of his campaign aides.

But Gowdy, who was closely involved in drafting the memo, listed a number of aspects of the investigation that have nothing to do with putting Page under surveillance based on the Steele dossier, which was funded by Democratic interests.

“The dossier has nothing to do with the meeting at Trump Tower. The dossier has nothing to do with an email sent by Cambridge Analytica. The dossier really has nothing to do with George Papadopoulos’ meeting in Great Britain.”

Gowdy was referring to Donald Trump Jr.‘s meeting at New York’s Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Clinton, the Trump campaign’s dealings with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that may have helped the Russians spread fake news and the disclosure by Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos’ disclosure to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain that the Russians had negative information on Clinton.

Gowdy also said the memo “doesn’t have anything to do with obstruction of justice” ― possible efforts by Trump and others in his administration to stymie Mueller’s probe.

“So there’s going to be a Russia probe, even without a dossier,” Gowdy said.

Stewart said that he had been “contacted by FBI agents” in the past few days who said, in reference to the memo, “thank you for doing this, we recognize that you’re trying to hold us accountable.”

He said the FBI and DOJ had “enormous power, enormous authority. With that must come enormous accountability. That’s all we’re trying to do here.”

Matt Olsen, who served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s national security division during President George W. Bush’s administration, called the memo “politically motivated” and “sort of amateurish” in comments on “This Week.”

Hurd said he did not agree with Trump that the memo vindicates the president.

“I don’t agree with some of my colleagues” who were using “hyperbole” and “exaggerations” when they spoke about the memo, Hurd said.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The New England Patriots band will break up after the Super Bowl and they have every intention of going out on a high note when they take on the underdog Philadelphia Eagles in Sunday’s National Football League championship game.

Playing in their third Super Bowl in four years the Patriots success could be their dynasty’s demise with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive mastermind Matt Patricia poised to move to the head coaching ranks soon after the Vince Lombardi trophy is hoisted.

The three pillars of the Patriots empire, quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft, remain in place but even there cracks in the foundation have begun to appear with an ESPN report this month detailing dissension at the top of the New England ranks.

The Patriots, however, have rarely been distracted from their objective. Even the Deflategate scandal that swirled around the team in 2015 could not cause them to lose focus as they beat the Seattle Seahawks to be crowned champions.

“We prepare for all situations that we can going into a game,” Belichick told reporters. “We have a game plan, as the game unfolds then we’ll adjust as we go.

“Every game is different, every team’s different, every situation is a little bit different so we’ll just do what we normally do.”

Normally that means winning championships.

Brady and Belichick have teamed up to win five Super Bowls, including two in the last three years and another on Sunday would tie them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by any franchise.

Number six will once again hinge on the arm and play of their evergreen 40-year-old quarterback, who has faced as many questions about retirement during Super Bowl week as he has about the Eagles pass rush.

NO GOOD REASON

Statistically, there certainly would seem no good reason for Brady to hang up the cleats.

He led the NFL in passing yards this season with 4,577 while his 32 touchdown passes ranked third.

For those looking for a sign of decline there has been none.

He has his team back in the Super Bowl for the third time in four years and has had the type of season that has once again placed him in the most valuable player conversation.

Brady could be without his favorite target in tight end Rob Gronkowski, who remains under concussion protocol, but will have plenty of weapons at his disposal including Danny Amendola, who had two touchdown grab catches in their comeback win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC championship game.

The Patriots and Eagles have met once before in the Super Bowl, in 2005 when New England beat Philadelphia 24-21 and Brady will be the only player from either team on the field on Sunday who took part in that game.

Since then New England has been back to the Super Bowl four times, winning it twice. Philadelphia has been back once.

The Eagles have made it to their third Super Bowl despite losing number one quarterback Carson Wentz to a knee injury in Week 14 after leading his team to a 10-2 record.

The loss looked a devastating blow to the city’s hopes of celebrating a first Super Bowl title but back-up Nick Foles has stepped up, leading Philadelphia to playoff wins over the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings.

The key to victory for Philadelphia will be the play of their defensive line, which is among the league’s best, and putting pressure on Brady.

The Eagles will give the Patriots the respect they have earned and deserve but will not be intimidated.

“All I can tell you is, we’re coming home with that trophy,” Philadelphia wide receiver Alshon Jeffery said.It’s the Super Bowl! New England Patriots! Philadelphia Eagles! TV ads! Today America sits down to its modern national pastime: watching the lesser of two evils lose in humiliating fashion, against a backdrop of extremely woke potato chip commercials.

Liana Finck, a cartoonist for the New Yorker, will be live-drawing as well.A Spirit Airlines flight full of Philadelphia Eagles fans, heading from Los Angeles, Calif., to Philadelphia, Pa., appeared to be getting a bit rowdy Friday evening ahead of Sunday night’s Super Bowl. The flight attendant took to the loud speaker to tell the passengers to “tone it down a little bit.”

“I know you’re excited,” he continued in a video posted to Twitter by one passenger.

Eagles fans booed the crew’s instructions and instead broke out into the team’s fight song, singing “Fly, Eagles, fly, on the way to victory!”

Among those passengers was Eagles fan Tony Hermosillo of Lawndale California (responsible for the above video), who traveled to Philadelphia to watch the big game with the home team fans.

“The mood was amazing,” Hermosillo told CNN. “Everyone was friendly and excited.”Netflix is adding quite a few quality movies over the next few days.

AdvertisementAlec Baldwin was back as President Donald Trump — under the covers, tweeting — in a “Saturday Night Live” cold open that skewered “Fox & Friends” and the FBI-attacking memo released by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).

The sketch started with Alex Moffat (playing Steve Doocy), Heidi Gardner (as Ainsley Earhardt) and Beck Bennett (as Brian Kilmeade) in the studio of “Fox & Friends,” talking via remote with White House communications director Hope Hicks (Cecily Strong).

Bennett points out her amazing career trajectory from working for Ivanka Trump’s clothing company to the White House.

A ditzed-out Strong responds: “There are no real jobs here, you know? Every day feels like when a group of strangers suddenly work together to push a beached whale back into the sea.”

Then “Trump,” munching an Egg McMuffin and listening to his Fox “intelligence briefing,” calls in to tout his State of the Union speech. It pulled in a cool “10 billion viewers,” he says, and it better than Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Dream of Jeannie” speech.

“Now they say there’s only 7 billion people on earth so where did other 3 billion come from?” he asks. “Illegals? I don’t know.”

Even more exciting was the Nunes memo, Baldwin’s Trump adds. “This memo might be the best memo since the Declaration of Independence. I don’t know. I haven’t read either of them.”

The Fox crew hails him as the “most innocent guy in the whole wide world.”

“Daddy needed that. He needed that,” Baldwin says.WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, said in an interview on his dad’s favorite cable news network on Saturday that the GOP-authored memo his father declassified amounted to “sweet revenge” for him and his family.

“There is a little bit of sweet revenge in it for me and certainly probably the family in a sense that if they wouldn’t have done this, this stuff would be going on,” Trump Jr. said, referring to the Republican allegation that the Justice Department and FBI improperly used their surveillance powers.

The staff of House Intelligence Committee chairman and Trump transition team member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) wrote the memo that accuses the nation’s premier law enforcement agency of omitting information about the partisan nature of a source used to get permission to surveil a former Trump campaign associate.

“This would be going on at the highest levels of government. They’d be continuing doing it to my father, trying to undermine his actions,” Trump Jr. added.

Trump Jr. ― whose father greatly benefited from the FBI’s disclosures about their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails during the 2016 campaign ―accused Democrats of weaponizing the Justice Department and the FBI against his father. Asked by Jesse Watters of Fox News whether the Russia investigation was rotten to its core, Trump Jr. replied that “it always has been.”

.@DonaldJTrumpJr on the memo: "Imagine how effective [@realDonaldTrump] can be, given the year he's had, without this cloud over his head." https://t.co/yb9zbeS8tq pic.twitter.com/jj5vvXn0Fm — Fox News (@FoxNews) February 4, 2018

Trump Jr. complained about the “millions in legal fees” he had to pay in connection with the Russia probe, the time he’s had to waste, and “being smeared throughout the media for a year.”

Democrats have said that the Republican memo mischaracterizes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application that the Justice Department prepared to seek permission to surveil former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The FBI ― headed by the Republican who Trump nominated to take over the bureau after he fired another Republican, James Comey ― had “grave concerns” about “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”Toronto police think they’ve caught a serial killer.

As another high-profile murder investigation is carried out in the provincial capital following the surprising deaths of billionaire couple Barry and Honey Sherman, police are trying to figure out just how many people Bruce McArthur, 66, may have killed around the city’s gay village ― or elsewhere.

The accusation follows years of dark rumors haunting the area over a series of unexplained disappearances, as McArthur and some of his alleged victims were found to have ties to the gay community.

“We are validated in our concerns, but there’s no joy to be had in that,” community activist Nicki Ward told CBC News late last month, adding, “Why weren’t we listened to earlier?”

While the case has not received much attention south of the U.S.-Canada border, it’s captivated our Canadian neighbors since the suspect’s Jan. 18 arrest. Officers tailing McArthur, a landscaper, reportedly brought him into custody because they feared for the life of a young man they saw enter their suspect’s apartment. According to the Toronto Star, they found the young man tied up but unharmed.

McArthur became a target of suspicion through a pair of Toronto police investigative initiatives. Police launched “Project Houston” in November 2012 to look into the disappearances of Skandaraj Navaratnam, Majeed Kayhan and Abdulbasir Faizi, who frequented the gay village, but it concluded in April 2014 with no convictions. “Project Prism,” a police investigation centered on the deaths of Selim Esen and Andrew Kinsman, who both disappeared in 2017 and also frequented the village, led to McArthur.

McArthur was first charged with the deaths of Esen and Kinsman. Two weeks later, police added charges for the deaths of Kayhan, Dean Lisowick and Soroush Mahmudi. Causes of death have not been released.

McArthur is thought to have killed others. He was romantically involved in the early 2000s with Navaratnam, who disappeared from the gay village in 2010, according to CBC News, citing a friend of Navaratnam.

He has also been linked to presently unidentified remains of three different people found in planters at a suburban Toronto home where McArthur worked as a landscaper. The authorities’ search has now expanded to include other homes where McArthur worked and other disappearances in the city’s gay community.

“It’s a serial killer — alleged serial killer,” Toronto police Sgt. Hank Idsinga said at a news conference in Toronto this week.

“It certainly encompasses more than the gay community. It encompasses the city of Toronto,” he added.

Idsinga told CBC News on Saturday that there was “no truth” to a rumor that McArthur had cannibalized his alleged victims.

The search may be complicated by McArthur’s transient history. A native of a small Ontario town, he worked as a traveling salesman in the 1980s and 1990s hawking socks and underwear to stores across the province, according the National Post, a Canadian publication. He was married for three decades before coming out as gay, leaving his wife behind to move to Toronto proper around 2000.

He has one prior conviction, per the National Post, for assaulting a man with a metal pipe, and he reportedly declared bankruptcy in 1999. As part of his assault conviction, he was barred from Toronto’s gay village and prohibited from spending time with male sex workers, the Toronto Star reported.Happy Super Bowl Sunday Janet Jackson Appreciation Day!

Fans of the legendary pop diva flooded Twitter with messages of love and support for Jackson, whose third studio album, “Control,” dropped 32 years ago on Sunday.

“A Queen. An Icon. Black History. Black Present. Black Future,” tweeted journalist and activist George M. Johnson.

Happy #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay

Filmmaker and former NFL player Matthew A. Cherry initially proposed the hashtag tribute to Jackson on Friday. It quickly gained the support of thousands of fans, including her nephew Taj Jackson. By Sunday afternoon, Cherry’s original #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay tweet had over 7,000 likes.

Appreciate the love for #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay today. Let's see if @rockhall is watching and listening. @JanetJackson is way overdue to be in the Hall of Fame among her peers.

Cherry intentionally planned for the unofficial celebration to occur on the same day Jackson’s 2004 Super Bowl halftime show co-performer Justin Timberlake would take the stage again ― this time at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for Super Bowl LII.

Jackson’s friends and family slammed the NFL for not including her in this year’s show, despite Timberlake being invited back to perform for a record-breaking third time.

The pair’s 2004 halftime show famously ended in a “wardrobe malfunction,” in which Timberlake exposed Jackson’s right nipple on national television after pulling off part of her outfit.

Jackson’s fans hoped she would make an appearance during this year’s show, but the five-time Grammy Award-winning icon squashed those rumors herself on Saturday.

Despite her expected absence at this year’s Super Bowl halftime show, Jackson’s fans did the best they could to make Sunday about her anyway.

Thousands of Twitter users, including celebrities such as Chance the Rapper and actress Laverne Cox, paid tribute to Jackson’s incomparable influence on music and culture.

The Lifeline answered three times the normal amount of calls in the two hours after the 28-year-old rapper performed his Grammy-nominated song “1-800-273-8255” at the awards show on Jan. 28, according to TMZ and CNN.

Logic, whose real name is Sir Robert Bryson Hall, received widespread praise from mental health advocates for the moving performance, which also featured pop star Alessia Cara and singer Khalid.

“Logic’s performance during the 2018 Grammys was an incredible moment in suicide prevention,” Frances Gonzalez, director of communications for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, told CNN.

“By sharing a message of hope and taking the stage with individuals who have been personally affected by suicide,” he continued. “Logic demonstrated on a global scale that healing is happening every day for people in crisis, and that there is help available.”

We were so moved by @Logic301's performance 💚 Thank you to all of the survivors for your strength, we commend you, and to Logic for sharing our lifesaving resources. There is hope & there is help. You are never alone. #GRAMMYs — The Lifeline (@800273TALK) January 29, 2018

During the performance, Logic wore a black sweatshirt emblazoned with the hotline’s number and belted out lyrics that were inspired by his own struggles with mental illness:

What’s the day without a little night?

I’m just tryna shed a little light

It can be hard

It can be so hard

But you gotta live right now

You got everything to give right now

The performance aimed to send an important message to anyone struggling with mental health issues: You are not alone.

Hotline activity took off last year, following the April 2017 release of “1-800-273-8255,” according to Dr. John Draper, the director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

“We had the second-highest call volume in the history of our service the day of the song’s release,” Draper told Variety. “It’s remained high ever since.”

The Lifeline’s call volume increased 50 percent following Logic’s performance of his suicide awareness anthem at the August 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, according to USA Today.

“That makes me feel so good,” Logic told Newsweek about the increase in call volume following the 2017 VMAs. “It really makes me feel special and makes me smile and get excited to know that there are people out there who are being helped ... because of a song that I made that was initially inspired by those people to begin with.”

Jenner announced Sunday that she had delivered a girl on Thursday, who weighed in at 8 lbs., 9 oz. She apologized to fans for not confirming the pregnancy sooner, citing her desire for a “stress free” experience.

She has yet to reveal the child’s name.

She also released a video documenting the pregnancy and confirming rapper/ boyfriend Travis Scott as the baby’s father. Jenner shares footage of ultrasound appointments, gatherings with both her family and Scott’s and interviews with close friends.

here’s a little glimpse of the last 9 months.. ♥️ https://t.co/dkRKkcxwsS — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) February 4, 2018

Throughout the video, friends and family members recount how they first heard about the pregnancy and what a great mother they expect Jenner will be.

The video also provides a first glimpse at sister Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s new baby, Chicago.

If you’ve been keeping up with the Kardashian-Jenner clan (who among us has not ― both inadvertently and intentionally), then you know rumors about Jenner’s pregnancy have been swirling for months.

Multiple outlets confirmed the pregnancy in September and, despite that, the youngest member of Kris Jenner’s brood never addressed the reports or confirmed to the public that she was pregnant.

This refusal to speak wasn’t the worst part. In the weeks leading up to the birth, Jenner only posted photos of things like the new matte lipsticks for her Kylie Cosmetics brand or close-up shots of her face on social media. In Snapchats and other posts where Jenner’s midsection could possibly be seen, any sort of glimpse of a pregnancy was visually obstructed by baggy sweatshirts or oversized T-shirts.

A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 13, 2017 at 1:33pm PDT

The 20-year-old was also bizarrely missing from the family’s Christmas card photo shoot this year ― the Kardashian-Jenners will give us nothing for free!

Jenner has been dating Scott since April 2017. The two were first seen together at Coachella not long after Jenner split with rapper Tyga, whom she had dated on and off for a few years.

All that’s left to say now is: Congrats, Kylie!Pennsylvania Republicans moved Friday to vacate the state Supreme Court’s decision striking down the state’s congressional map on the grounds that one Democratic justice should have been disqualified from voting in the case.

In its 5-2 ruling last month, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held the congressional map was so partisan that it “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s constitution.

Lawyers for House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R) asked the court to throw out multiple orders in the case because they said Justice David Wecht (D) had taken a position opposing gerrymandering during his 2015 campaign for his high court seat. The justices run for office in partisan elections in Pennsylvania.

The Republicans also called on Justice Christine Donahue, another Democrat, to further disclose her views because she said as a candidate three years ago that “gerrymandering will come to an end” if she, Wecht and another Democrat were elected to the high court.

The Republicans’ filing pointed to several publicly reported comments made by Wecht. Among those was a remark at a 2015 candidate forum in which he said “gerrymandering is an absolute abomination. It is a travesty, it is deeply wrong.”

He told a Lancaster County editorial board that one of the ways the state could fix low voter turnout was by working to “stop this insane gerrymandering. ... People who are disenfranchised by this gerrymandering abomination eventually lose faith and grow more apathetic. Why? Because their voting power has been vastly diluted and they tend to figure, ‘Well, I can’t make a difference, I’ll just stay home.’”

In those comments, Wecht alluded specifically to redrawing state legislative districts ― not congressional maps, which are the subject of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling. In Pennsylvania, state districts are drawn by a commission, with four members appointed by the parties and a fifth member picked by the other four or, if they can’t agree, by the Supreme Court. Wecht referred to the importance of the Supreme Court’s role in picking that fifth member.

Friday’s filing was the latest in a series of steps Republicans have taken to challenge the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling against their congressional map. They have appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court and Scarnati had said he won’t comply with the state court’s order to turn over election data because he believes it’s unlawful.

Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University and an expert on legal ethics, said that although the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that state judicial candidates can announce their views, it was not clear whether a state can forbid a candidate from making a “pledge or a promise.”

“The petition makes a strong argument that one justice should not have sat [on the gerrymandering case] because of his campaign statements, which read to me like a promise, not merely an announcement,” Gillers said in an email to HuffPost, speaking about the Republican leaders’ request.

But he added, “HOWEVER, it is universally understood that a litigant has a duty to make a recusal motion quickly after she learns or could have learned the facts warranting recusal. You can’t hold back and see how the judge will vote and then seek recusal, or first start your research on the judge’s statements, if you lose.”

Gillers pointed out that there was a public record of Wecht’s earlier remarks ― the media reported them in 2015 ― and suggested that “a little research before the case went to the state supreme court” would have uncovered them.

Turzai spokesman Stephen Miskin said the Republicans were only moving for disqualification now because they had been unaware of the comments. He said Wecht should have disclosed them.

This is Bookstein’s “money story,” a term the nonprofit Resource Generation (RG) uses as part of its work to help wealthy millennials give their money to groups fighting social, economic and racial injustice. The idea of the money story is to get people to be open about their relationship with money – how much they have, where it’s from and how it’s benefited them.

In a society where talking about wealth is almost on a par with talking about your sex life, revealing oneself as rich doesn’t always feel comfortable.

This was certainly the case for Bookstein. Post-college and becoming increasingly politicized, she was in denial about her privileged position, “not in denial in the sense that I thought I didn’t have it ― I definitely knew that I did ― but I was trying to distance myself from it,” she says.

Adam Roberts, now an RG staffer, says he was also keen to keep his wealth under wraps before the nonprofit “kicked my butt into gear.” Roberts used to give less than $200 a year, but as part of RG, he’s now giving more than $50,000.

Resource Generation

There’s a collective silence around money and class, says Iimay Ho, RG’s executive director: “It’s a totally intentional part of what keeps inequality so normalized.”

RG aims to break this. The 20-year-old organization works with around 500 members ― all between ages 18 and 35 and in America’s top 10 percent by wealth ― through 17 chapters across the U.S. “There’s a pretty broad range of experience,” says Ho, “from a tech worker from a working-class background to someone who inherited a trust fund.”

The idea is to help them to understand where their wealth came from, how it’s connected to inequality, and how to “move” it (to use RG parlance) to grassroots movements. There’s practical education on how to budget, be accountable and evaluate organizations to make sure money is put directly into the hands of those affected by injustice. There’s also campaign work aimed at pushing for “structural change” around issues such as health care, taxes and workers’ rights.

“We are not funders,” says Ho, “so there’s no mechanism where we pool money and make decisions about where it goes out. What we do teach is our social justice philanthropy principles.”

Ho has her own money story. Her parents are Chinese immigrants who came to the U.S. as grad students. Her mom built up a successful insurance business and Ho’s parents now have assets of more than $1 million.

Growing up in a wealthy white suburb of North Carolina before heading to the University of North Carolina, where she became involved in activism, she struggled with her identity. “This whole time I have no debt, I’m secretly wealthy. I’m with other people who identify as Asian, as queer, and my whole life experience is so different to theirs,” she says.

A desire to be “more authentic” was her catalyst to join RG, originally as part of its D.C. chapter, before becoming a staff member in 2014 and taking up the executive director role last year.

RG is operating at a time of sharp divisions in the U.S. Between 1963 and 2016, families in the top 1 percent saw their wealth increase sevenfold, while families in the bottom 10 percent went from having no wealth to being, on average, $1,000 in debt.

The inheritance system is set to make things worse, says Richard Reeves, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank. “As income inequality becomes wealth inequality, that’s much easier to pass on generation to generation,” he says. An estimated 34 to 45 percent of wealth in the U.S. is inherited, and baby boomers are set to transfer an estimated $30 trillion to their children.

It’s this mounting inequality RG wants to fight; just don’t call it philanthropy. “Private philanthropy is a way to continue to hoard and accumulate wealth,” says Ho, “and because it’s voluntary … if redistribution is up to individuals to give money away, we’re never going to restructure the economy.”

RG differentiates itself by stressing that those most affected by social injustice should be the ones who decide how the money is spent.

For Hanna Mahon, who sits on the board of her family foundation and is also part of a dog walking collective in Washington, D.C., it was squeamishness around traditional philanthropy that led her to RG. “There are huge contradictions in trying to do social justice philanthropy where I’m still a wealthy white person acting as a gatekeeper.”

Through her RG membership, 26-year-old Mahon has focused her family foundation’s giving “to actually help shift power dynamics in the world and help shift inequality.” It currently gives to 15 social justice organizations led by people of color.

“If redistribution is up to individuals to give money away, we’re never going to restructure the economy.” - Iimay Ho, executive director of Resource Generation

Race is a big issue for RG. “The history of wealth inequality and accumulation is a history of institutionalized racism,” the organization says. In 2016, the average wealth of white families was seven times greater than that of black families.

When Elizabeth Baldwin, who is of Indian descent and was adopted by a white family, initially came across RG, she says “it wasn’t as people-of-color-oriented as I would have liked it to have been.”

Since then, she’s been heavily involved in the organization’s push to include people who don’t have a traditional white American background. She also set up a group to consider how to genuinely support grassroots anti-racist groups. “It’s not just putting a Band-Aid on everything; it’s really going to the root of [injustice] and the cause and saying, OK, what are we going to do to change this part?” she says.

Of course, it’s easy to mock RG’s members for being wealthy and woke. “In a perfect world, we might want a situation where you aren’t able to accumulate such wealth, that public policies don’t allow for that to happen,” says Reeves. But that’s not where we are, he adds. He praises RG members’ efforts to use their money, power and influence to try to shift the debate on inequality.

“A big problem with inequality is failure of people to recognize it and [instead] to see themselves as the winners,” Reeves says. The myth of ‘work hard and get rich’ starts to look shaky when people are more open about how much the system was stacked in their favor, he adds.

Many RG members say that it’s a choice between doing nothing or really examining their relationship with class and wealth. “My life is an example of things that are unfair and [that] I want to work against,” says Bookstein, “but I think that’s also what motivates me, because I can constantly see the way that the system is working to my advantage, and that’s what motivates me to fight harder against it.”

AdvertisementHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) really wants you to know how great the Republican tax cuts are.

Worried that the partisan Nunes memo released Friday will undermine the FBI’s ability to do its job? Ryan is happy to remind you, ”The tax cuts are working.”

On Saturday, Ryan outdid himself again with a tweet bragging about the extra $1.50 a week that a Pennsylvania secretary is making thanks to the GOP legislation.

“A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week ... she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year,” Ryan tweeted on Saturday.

The tweet refers to an anecdote about the secretary, Julia Ketchum, in an Associated Press article.

A dollar and 50 cents a week amounts to $78 a year. Although every little bit counts for Americans living paycheck to paycheck, an extra $78 a year is a very small amount of money by any standard.

The tweet predictably drew mockery, and Ryan deleted it Saturday afternoon.

To be fair, the $1.50 figure likely reflects Ketchum’s reduced tax withholding in her paycheck due to lower tax rates. As a result of increases in deductions, including a doubling of the standard deduction, she may also get more money back after filing her 2018 taxes next spring.

Ketchum’s experience nonetheless exemplifies a fundamental truth about the tax bill: The gains it provides ordinary people pale in comparison to the boost it gives the super-wealthy.

Middle-class households will, on average, see a $930 increase ― or 1.6 percent boost ― in after-tax income thanks to the GOP tax cut, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

By contrast, the top 1 percent of earners ― households making more than $730,000 ― stand to get a 3.4 percent bump, or about $51,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.

And the TPC projects that the top 0.1 percent of earners, who make $3.4 million a year or more, are due for an extra 2.7 percent, or $193,000.

Notably, other policies more targeted at lower- and middle-income Americans have been shown to provide significant increases in Americans’ hourly take-home pay, as opposed to the boost Ketchum is seeing in her weekly check.

Raising the federal minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour by 2024 would raise pay for almost one-third of American workers, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. The average full-time worker affected by the increase would get a $3,500 raise once the $15 minimum is phased in, the EPI estimates.

Another key avenue for workers seeking higher wages that grow in tandem with their employers’ profits are labor unions. In 2017, the median pay of a unionized worker was 25.6 percent higher than the median pay of a non-union worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Uma Thurman is speaking out about Harvey Weinstein.

In an article by New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd, the actress describes a series of abuses at the hands of Hollywood men, including the now-notorious film producer.

In the piece, Thurman expresses her complex feelings about what happened and wrestles with feeling guilty over other women who were assaulted after her.

“I am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did,” she said. “Quentin used Harvey as the executive producer of ‘Kill Bill,’ a movie that symbolizes female empowerment. And all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do.”

Thurman described an incident after the release of “Pulp Fiction,” when she said Weinstein donned a bathrobe during a meeting in a Paris hotel room and got her to follow him into a steam room, at which point she left. At the time, she wrote it off as him being “kooky.”

But on another occasion shortly thereafter, she said, Weinstein physically assaulted her, pushing her down, attempting to expose himself and doing “all kinds of unpleasant things.”

When Thurman later tried to confront Weinstein, he allegedly threatened to ruin her career as an actress, her friend, Ilona Herman, told the Times.

In a statement sent to HuffPost, a Weinstein spokeswoman characterized what happened in the Paris hotel room as “an awkward pass” made by Weinstein after “misreading [Thurman’s] signals.” Weinstein apologized for the incident and “deeply regrets” it, according to the spokeswoman.

The statement also maintains that Weinstein never assaulted Thurman.

“Her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue,” the statement reads “And this is the first time we have heard those details.”

The statement included several photos of Thurman and Weinstein at events, which the spokeswoman purports demonstrate the pair had a “strong relationship.”

Through the spokeswoman, Weinstein also denied that he had ever threatened Thurman’s career.

“Throughout the years, Ms. Thurman was a close friend and one of Mr. Weinstein’s favorite actresses to work with,” the spokeswoman said.

In the Times article, Thurman also discussed being coerced into sex at age 16 by an unnamed actor, as well as an abuse of power by director Quentin Tarantino.

Thurman told Dowd that on the set of “Kill Bill,” Tarantino pressured her into doing her own stunt driving in a situation where she felt unsafe. The incident ended in a crash, which left her with a “permanently damaged neck” and “screwed-up knees.”

Despite all that had happened previously with Weinstein, it was the crash that truly left her feeling powerless in the industry.

“I had been through so many rings of fire by that point,” she said. “I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?”

Tarantino’s representatives did not immediately reply to a request for comment from HuffPost.

Thurman first spoke about Weinstein, and the Me Too movement in general, back in November.

“I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you,” she told Access Hollywood when asked about Weinstein, in a video that can be seen above.

She added, “I’ve been waiting to feel less angry. And when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.”

The clip, in which Thurman’s slow, ultra-controlled demeanor made her sound like she was fighting to rein in her rage, went viral.

Weeks later, she posted a foreboding message on Instagram, writing, “I feel it’s important to take your time, be fair, be exact, so... Happy Thanksgiving Everyone! (Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators ― I’m glad it’s going slowly ― you don’t deserve a bullet) ― stay tuned.”It’s been a week since the mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, and the National Rifle Association has had time to make sense of why, exactly, this happened.

It’s because of an abundance of doors. And junk food. And not believing in God.

These are the things the NRA has blamed for 10 people being killed and 13 people being injured in last week’s massacre. Not once did the gun rights group raise concerns over the shooter’s easy access to firearms ― the 17-year-old student just used his dad’s guns ― or acknowledge that school shootings are now happening with such frequency in America that kids are developing post-traumatic stress disorder.

The Texas shooting was the 16th school shooting this year. Another school shooting took place while this article was being written.

But the NRA says guns aren’t the problem. Here’s a look at all the other things the group has said are the reasons for the horrifying uptick in gun violence at schools.

A “culture of violence”

Incoming NRA president Oliver North said the solution to mass shootings at schools is to focus on the “disease,” which is not about easy access to guns.

“The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” North said on Fox News Sunday. “They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases.”

Godlessness

NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said it’s helpful to offer “thoughts and prayers” after every mass shooting because it brings God back into the discussion.

“Taking God out of our culture ... is at least partly to blame for the violence we see today,” he said on his Monday show.

Too many doors in schools

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a fierce opponent of gun control, said the Santa Fe shooting may have been caused by schools having “too many entrances” and that it may be time “to look at the design of our schools moving forward.”

NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch tweeted that Patrick is “exactly right.”

Unhealthy diets

NRA board member Ted Nugent said Tuesday that kids’ unhealthy diets are making them want to shoot up their schools.

“Mark my words when the studies are finalized, you will find that Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, certainly Sandy Hook, these maniac murderers in Parkland and now Santa Fe, if you really studied the slovenliness and the zombie-like conduct of these murderers, you go back to their diet and examine what they’ve put into their sacred temple, and it’s all garbage,” Nugent said in an interview on Newsmax TV, a conservative media outlet.

“I know people think I’m trying to get away from the gun issue, but it’s not a gun issue,” he added. “It is a conduct issue.”

Ritalin

North said the combination of kids growing up in a violent culture and then taking medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is causing a spike in school shootings.

“They have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,” he said on Fox News Sunday. “If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.”

The overmedication of children

“The problems that are producing scores of isolated young disturbed children who have convinced themselves that murdering their classmates is the way to get attention will not be solved at the gun store. It is in the home,” Loesch said Tuesday on an NRATV segment titled “The Overmedication of Children Is an Epidemic.”

“It’s about the kind of people we’re raising these kids to become,” she said.

“Progressive culture”

NRATV commentator Colion Noir said loose gun laws aren’t the problem behind school shootings. It’s America’s progressive culture.

“When are we going to be completely honest and acknowledge the awkward, bullied, sexually frustrated, psychotropic drug-laced, suicidal, mass shooters in the room for what they are?” he said on a Sunday NRATV segment. “Or are we just going to keep acting like we don’t know what’s going on in the name of not confronting the miserable reality that they are a creation of our so-called progressive culture and media?”

Criticizing masculinity as toxic

In the same segment, Noir blamed school shootings on parents failing to teach their kids “how to cope with the harsh realities of life.”

“We shield them in safe spaces and give them participation trophies incentivizing mediocrity, and tell our young boys that their masculinity is toxic and our young girls that being a woman means acting like a man, further confusing the hell out of kids who are naturally going to struggle with their identity as is,” said Noir.

Mainstream media

NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said Monday that mainstream media outlets “wrote the mass shooters playbook.”St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner dropped invasion of privacy charges against Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens for nude photos he allegedly took without a woman’s permission, the Kansas City Star reported Monday.

The prosecutor dropped the felony charge against Greitens after the judge in the case ruled that the defense would be allowed to call Gardner to the witness stand. The circuit attorney’s office asked the court to assign a special prosecutor to refile the charges against the governor, which stem from accusations Greitens’ former mistress has made against him.

“When the court and the defense team put the state in the impossible position of choosing between her professional obligations and the pursuit of justice, the Circuit Attorney will always choose the pursuit of justice,” Gardner’s office wrote in a statement. “The court’s order leaves the Circuit Attorney no adequate means of proceeding with this trial. Therefore, the court has left the Circuit Attorney with no other legal option than to dismiss and refile this matter.”

Greitens has been under investigation for months after admitting to an extramarital affair with his hairdresser, an unidentified woman who claims her encounters with the governor weren’t always consensual. The governor’s accuser told a Missouri House special investigative committee that Greitens took nude photos of her without her permission, only to say later she may have imagined the photos being taken of her.

She also alleged that Greitens forced her to the ground and coerced her into having oral sex, according to the committee’s report released last month.

Greitens’ accuser told the committee that the governor told her not to mention his name or he would “take these pictures, and I’m going to put them everywhere I can.”

The governor was indicted in February on first-degree felony invasion of privacy over the photographs. Greitens’ trial began on Thursday, though his attorney Jim Martin told the Star that prosecutors failed to find evidence of the photo.My grandma once found a fry in her onion rings and one hour later found 1$ on the street.

We might just be stupid lol #brokeforlife #MyWeirdSuperstitionBill Maher took aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Friday night’s broadcast of “Real Time.”

Maher suggested a memo drafted by Nunes’ staff that alleges the FBI and the Justice Department inappropriately spied on President Donald Trump’s campaign team is “not an intelligence document.”

Instead, Maher likened the dossier — which Nunes released Friday after Trump declassified it — to “a Facebook post that you briefly skim before clicking unfriend.”

“Republicans talk about this memo like it’s some smoking gun piece of evidence that they uncovered,” Maher said. “No. They wrote it. They uncovered it in their printer.”Bill Maher wants Donald Trump’s supporters to confess that the president duped them over his U.S.-Mexico border wall campaign promise.

“Just admit you got conned when you actually thought that Blob the Builder was going to erect the Eighth Wonder of the World for free and Mexico would pick up the check,” Maher said on Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time.”

“C’mon man, we’ve all been there. You bought weed in the park and when you got home, it was pine needles and oregano,” he added.

Maher later broke down why Trump’s supporters don’t actually need the southern border barrier. Because “everything that wall represents — the bigotry, the racism, the ignorance, the paranoia — is already in your heart,” he said.On Friday, “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” called out what it described as the “repetitive nightmare” of Donald Trump’s presidency with its updated version of the Bill Murray classic movie.President Donald Trump on Friday declassified a Republican-authored memo that claims to show the Justice Department and FBI inappropriately conducted surveillance on a member of the Trump presidential campaign.

FBI Director Chris Wray isn’t having any of it.

In a message to employees after the memo’s release, he portrayed it ― and the media’s reaction ― as little more than cheap talk, irrelevant to the far more important work the bureau does on a daily basis.

“The American people read the papers, and they hear lots of talk on cable TV and social media,” he wrote. “But they see and experience the actual work you do ― keeping communities safe and our nation secure ... and that will always matter more.

“Talk is cheap. The work you do is what will endure.”

Wray added: “Remember: keep calm and tackle hard.”

On Wednesday, while Trump was weighing whether to declassify the memo, the FBI issued an unusual public statement highlighting the “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”Yet Croston was clear that he would embrace an openly gay teammate. Only one of the players I spoke with, Ted Karras, had a teammate in high school or college he later found out was gay. “He was always a good teammate and it didn’t change anything for me,” Karras said.

The views of all the linemen I spoke with were pretty clear — for them, a gay teammate would be just one of the guys. Here is what they said.

Cameron Fleming, tackle, 4th year

”I don’t think it would be an issue for me. It’s a workplace like everywhere else. It definitely is a little bit different but I’d be fine with it and accept it.”

LaAdrian Waddle, tackle, 5th year

”I don’t think you’d know about [acceptance] until it happened. Different people have different opinions. I wouldn’t care. It wouldn’t matter to me.”

Joe Thuney, guard, 2nd year

”Everyone just wants to work for a common goal. Everyone wants to win and we want whoever can contribute to a winning effort. We just want to win. What can you do to help the team win that’s the bottom line.”

Ted Karras, guard, 2nd year

”I can only speak for myself and I think where we are in our society I think that would be absolutely OK. I would totally accept a teammate regardless of [his sexual orientation].”

David Andrews, center, 3rd year

“Whatever people decide to do in their personal life, that’s their choice.”

Cole Croston, guard, rookie

”I would absolutely not have a problem. I think he’d be accepted for sure. We’re in the year 2018 where that kind of thing is happening all over the place so I don’t think it’d be an issue. He’s just another guy on the team.”

James Ferentz, center, practice squad, 3rd year

”I think we’ve been ready for it. I think we live in a world where we’re more focused on playing football vs. what you do in your spare time. We’re more worried if he’s a good teammate and football player, that’s the biggest thing.”

”I’m sure along the way [I’ve had a gay teammate]. I’ve been playing football for 12 years now, I’m sure somewhere along the way someone was. Does it even matter?”

”My understanding is it’s not a choice, you’re born a certain way. For anyone to have to hide what you are is wrong in my opinion and I’d like to think I play in a league where we’re openly accepting of anybody. We’re more worried about you as a teammate and a football player, that’s really what’s important.”
