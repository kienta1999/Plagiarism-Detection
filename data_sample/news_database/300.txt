For a limited time next time, comedy titans Jon Stewart and Dave Chappelle will take the stage together.

They will perform a total of seven dates, starting June 11, 12, and 13 in Boston. They’ll move onto Houston for June 21 and 22 performances and finish in El Paso on June 23 and 24.

The two previously took the stage together last August when Stewart made a surprise appearance at Chappelle’s Radio City Music Hall standup show.

It was shortly after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, when white supremacists showed up with Tiki torches and President Donald Trump claimed there were “very fine people on both sides.”

“Music and words and art is a power that can extinguish a Tiki torch,” Stewart said during that show.

If comedians discussing the social and political landscape is your thing, then the combination of Chappelle and Stewart is a must-see.If you’re one of those people who has been hankering to stream reruns of Chad Michael Murray playing basketball, you’re in luck. “One Tree Hill,” which left Netflix in the fall of 2017, is coming to Hulu this month.

As White House legal and national security experts reviewed the document, the Senate’s No. 3 Republican, John Thune, urged his House of Representatives colleagues to allow the Senate Intelligence Committee to review the document and to heed the FBI’s concerns before they made it public.

Democrats have called the four-page memo misleading, based on a selective use of highly classified data and intended to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s criminal probe into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to help him win the 2016 presidential election.

The document was crafted by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, and commissioned by Devin Nunes, the panel’s Republican chairman.

Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday sent a letter to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for Nunes to be removed as chairman, saying Nunes had acted dishonestly in altering the memo. The committee’s senior Democrat, Adam Schiff, late on Wednesday said he had discovered Nunes had sent the White House a version of the memo that was “materially altered” and not what the panel voted on Monday to release.

“This action is not only dangerous, it is illegitimate, and violates House rules,” Pelosi said.

Mueller’s investigation and the FBI probe that preceded it have hung over Trump’s year-old presidency. Russia and Trump have both denied any collusion.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a rare rebuke on Wednesday to the president and his fellow Republicans in Congress who are pushing to release the memo.

“The FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the FBI said in a statement. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”

Justice Department officials have also said releasing the memo could jeopardize classified information.

The administration official told Reuters earlier the memo was likely to be released on Thursday. The timing, however, remained in flux.

Nunes has dismissed the objections to the memo’s release as “spurious.”

‘CAREFUL ATTENTION’

Thune, attending a political retreat in West Virginia with other lawmakers in Trump’s party, urged fellow Republicans to slow down regarding the memo’s release.

“I think the Senate Intelligence Committee needs to see it, for sure,” Thune said. “They need to pay careful attention to what our folks who protect us have to say about what this, you know, how this bears on our national security.”

Thune also said he believed that a counterpoint memo written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee should be made public if the Republican document is released.

The Republican memo accuses the FBI and Justice Department of misleading a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge in March as they sought to extend an eavesdropping warrant against Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, four sources familiar with it have said.

They said memo contends that the FBI and Justice Department failed to tell the judge that some of the information used to justify the warrant included portions of a dossier of Trump-Russia contacts that was opposition research paid for by Democrats.

However, the sources said the memo does not mention that the request to extend surveillance on Page, which began before Trump took office, also relied on other highly classified information and that U.S. agencies had confirmed excerpts from the dossier included in the request.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign using hacking and propaganda to attempt to tilt the race in favor of Trump. The president has called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and “hoax.”Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) initial reaction to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address was one for the books.

During Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Sanders was caught on camera slow clapping. It seemed as if he’d rather be anywhere else.

Later, Sanders offered a longer response to Trump’s comments, but his immediate reaction was noticed on Twitter ― where it became a viral meme:

Bernie Sanders reluctantly clapping for the President with a faraway look in his eyes is what is going to keep me going until 2020. #SOTU — Jeanne Hulme (@jeannes_jargon) January 31, 2018WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had little interest in opening Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling until a friend “who’s in that world and in that business” called and told him Republicans have been trying to do so for decades.

It was at that moment, it seems, that it became a competition.

“After that I said, ‘Oh, make sure that’s in the [tax] bill,’” Trump said during a speech at the GOP congressional retreat in West Virginia.

“I really didn’t care about it,” he added. “And then when I heard that everybody wanted it — for 40 years they’ve been trying to get it approved — I said, ‘Make sure you don’t lose ANWR.’”

Trump didn’t say who first urged him to push for opening the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area.

The GOP tax bill passed in December includes a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), that requires Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each covering no less than 400,000 acres — in the refuge’s coastal plain. The region is home to polar bears, moose and caribou, and it has been the subject of a decades-long battle between energy companies and conservationists.

Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) told a rather different story shortly after Trump’s speech. In an interview with The Washington Post, Sullivan said he and Murkowski briefed the president on several Alaska issues, including ANWR, early last year and were surprised at Trump’s knowledge about the state. Trump’s grandfather reportedly worked on an 1890s route that led to the Yukon gold fields.

“He actually knew a fair amount about Alaska,” Sullivan told the Post. “It’s pretty amazing history. His grandfather was there.”

Described by some as “America’s Serengeti,” ANWR covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. Scientists, environmentalists and a bipartisan group of former Interior Department officials have warned that fossil fuel extraction there could spoil the landscape and harm the species that call it home.

The Trump administration’s fiscal 2018 budget, released last year, called for allowing oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain. In May, Zinke signed an order to “jump-start Alaskan energy production.” He said at the time that the move was an “important first step in a smart and measured approach to energy development in ANWR.”

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the ANWR provision would generate slightly more than $1 billion in federal revenue over the next decade — a figure that has been widely disputed. Within the drilling leases, the measure allows for 2,000 acres of the coastal plain to be developed above ground with wells and support facilities.

In his speech Thursday, Trump called the refuge “one of the great potential fields anywhere in the world” and said drilling it is a “great opportunity for Alaska.”Collecting the most money has always been the way to win in Monopoly, but a new version of the classic game changes how you get that money.

INSIDER reported this week that Hasbro is releasing a “Cheater’s Edition” of the beloved board game this fall, which encourages player to lie, cheat and steal their way to financial dominance.

Happy to show off the newest addition to #Monopoly this fall — a version of the game just for cheaters. And it's called the Cheater's Edition. @HasbroNews https://t.co/hcO5Cs0dPR pic.twitter.com/cVIQEicTQe — Kirsten (@KirstenAcuna) January 30, 2018

The idea for the game originated after a Hasbro survey revealed that more than half of Monopoly players try to cheat during the game, said Jonathan Berkowitz, Hasbro senior vice president of gaming.

“We’ve finally decided to embrace our less-than-honest fans by encouraging them to partake in those iconic (yet sometimes unspoken) Monopoly moments that occur during family game nights,” Berkowitz told INSIDER.

And that sordid behavior becomes easier with no banker. That’s right, no one person is in charge of the bank. Instead, each player acts as banker during their turn.

The new edition includes a jail just as the original game did, but now players who go to jail must slap on a toy handcuff attached to the board.

Encouraging cheating is far removed from the game’s left-leaning origins. In 1903, Washington, D.C., stenographer Elizabeth Magie patented The Landlord’s Game, an early version of Monopoly, which the Parker Bros. later bought. That game’s intent was to teach players the dangers of income inequality and monopolistic wealth practices, reflecting Magie’s own progressive beliefs.The TV-viewing figures for President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address are in, and he’s not winning.

Trump averaged around 45.6 million viewers during his 80-minute speech to Congress and a TV audience on Tuesday night, according to media research company Nielsen, which collated data from 12 broadcast and cable networks.

That’s a 2.1 million dip from the 47.7 million people who watched Trump’s inaugural address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, and was lower than the number of people who watched former President Barack Obama’s speeches on similar occasions.

Obama scored 52.3 million for his inaugural address to a joint session of Congress in 2009, and just over 48 million for his first State of the Union speech in 2010.

Viewing figures for the State of the Union speech usually decline during a president’s time in office. Obama’s final speech in 2016 was only seen by 31.3 million people.

Trump has not fared well in comparison to Obama in other areas in recent months.

“The Tick” (Season 1B)Colin Kaepernick is a man of his word.

Kaepernick, who is still a free agent after opting out of his San Francisco 49ers contract in March, confirmed the news to fans on Twitter in a short video Wednesday afternoon.

I am happy to announce I have completed my #MillionDollarPledge. For the final #10for10 joining me is my brother @usher! He is donating $10k to match my $10k for $20k for H.O.M.E from Lithonia, GA.

To wrap up his pledge, the 30-year-old asked a number of high-profile athletes and artists to donate $10,000 to a charity of their choice, which he then matched dollar-for-dollar in what he called the #10for10 challenge.

Joining Kaepernick in Wednesday’s donation was Usher, who pledged $10,000 to Helping Oppressed Mothers Endure Inc. (or HOME), a Georgia-based advocacy organization for single mothers who are emerging from divorce or domestic violence.

Day 10 of my #10for10! Thank you @usher for choosing H.O.M.E. for the #MillionDollarPledge! We’re donating $10k each to them for a total of $20k!

The news comes one day after President Donald Trump took a subtle dig at protesters in the NFL during his State of the Union address Tuesday.

The president’s remarks came as he was speaking about Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old California boy who started a movement to place flags on the graves of veterans last year. Sharp was a guest of the president and first lady at the address.

“Preston’s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem,” the president told the crowd.

Kaepernick, however, isn’t likely to be deterred.LG Electronics Vice President of Marketing David VanderWaal presenting the LG InstaView smart fridge at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images

We’ve all been there: You’re at the grocery store, staring at the carrots, trying to remember whether you still have some languishing in your refrigerator’s crisper drawer.

There’s no way to know without looking in your fridge, but that’s impossible. Or is it? New smart technology refrigerators, such as LG’s forthcoming InstaView ThinQ fridge, allow you to use your phone to remotely check on the contents of your fridge. The fridge is also equipped with Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, so you can ask it to create shopping lists, set food expiration dates, or tell you the weather.

The LG fridge joins the ranks of products that are connected to the internet and billed as able to make our lives easier by performing automated tasks. The global smart home market is set to explode; one study published earlier this month estimates it will reach more than $53 billion by 2022.

Thanks to constant upgrades, the release of new models and tech companies purposefully shortening the lifespan of their products ― a practice known as planned obsolescence ― people are buying new tech items more and more frequently. As appliances like washers, air purifiers, printers and stoves become more like other gadgets, it’s likely consumers will be replacing them more often.

And throwing them out more often.

That means a fresh glut of used electronics going into landfills and contributing to water, soil and air pollution. Plus, making these gadgets is very resource-intensive, using metals such as lithium, cobalt and aluminum, as well as silicon wafers and plastics. There’s also a human element to consider: Workers risk their health and safety by exposing themselves to hazardous chemicals while processing the waste.

Some progress is being made with increased recycling rates and “takeback” schemes, but experts say corporations and the government need to make sure electronics are more sustainable throughout their life cycle.

“The market system is set up to ask companies to focus on profit,” said Eric Williams, an associate professor of technology at the Rochester Institute of Technology and an expert on electronics waste. “Performance and price of the product are really the dominant design factors.”

Electronics waste — discarded items such as computers, TVs, mobile phones and printers ― has been steadily on the rise, from 41 million metric tons in 2014 to 45 million metric tons in 2016. It is the fastest growing waste stream in the world.

And some say the figure is likely far higher than what is being reported.

“I am convinced that all available stats for e-waste volumes are understated,” said Bob Houghton, a pioneer of electronics recycling in the U.S. and CEO at Sage Sustainable Electronics. “There are now electronics in everything from toys to cars, which are never included in industry estimates.”

But as electronics trash has risen, so, too, has the amount being recycled. Forty-one percent of discarded electronics were recycled in 2014, compared to 10 percent in 2000, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

This is partly because large technology and consumer goods companies have made it easier for customers to recycle their used electronics. Most big brands now offer takeback options for consumers. Apple’s Renew program allows consumers to recycle any Apple device. LG operates a similar initiative that has significantly boosted the company’s recycling rates. It recycled 41 million pounds of electronic devices in 2016, compared to 8 million pounds in 2010.

“There’s been a major evolution over the years,” said Rick Goss, senior vice president of environment and sustainability at the Information Technology Industry Council, which advocates on behalf of major technology companies.

Energy and the environment are now factored in at the very beginning of product design, Goss said.

“[Our customers] want recycling options,” he said. “They are demanding it from us.”

Yet huge amounts of e-waste remain in landfills. Only around 20 percent, or 9 million metric tons, of e-waste was recycled around the world in 2016.

Companies need to do more to make sure their products are easier to recycle, said Tensie Whelan, director of the Center for Sustainable Business at New York University’s Stern School of Business. This means designing electronics in such a way that the toxic parts, such as lead and mercury, can be easily separated from nontoxic parts for proper disposal.

“It’s a very complex challenge. I won’t sugarcoat it.” - Rick Goss, senior vice president of environment and sustainability at the Information Technology Industry Council

But the onus is not just on corporations. Governments have a big part to play in keeping e-waste levels low. They can pass laws to stop the illegal shipping of used electronics to developing countries like India and China ― countries that often lack the infrastructure to safely recycle toxic waste, which puts people and the environment at risk.

Forty percent of e-waste given to recyclers in the U.S. was shipped to junkyards abroad, mostly in Asia, according to a 2016 report from environmental nonprofit the Basel Action Network. There is currently no federal law in the U.S. that bans the export of these goods, even though it’s illegal in many other countries to import e-waste.

“We [in the technology sector] are in lockstep with governments, and what we’re all trying to accomplish is to stop the illegal transfer of e-waste to countries that can’t manage it,” Goss said. “It’s a very complex challenge. I won’t sugarcoat it.”

Goss acknowledged that the “innovation cycle for our products is rather fast.” The proliferation of products from different manufacturers is also an issue, he added, especially from smaller manufacturers which may lack the reuse and recycling commitments of bigger companies.

John Taylor, senior vice president of public affairs and sustainability at LG Electronics USA, said customers ask for upgraded features. People want their devices to be interconnected and controllable with the click of a smartphone button, he said.

“We don’t just develop these products because we think they’re cool,” Taylor added. “We’re responding to consumer demand.”

But consumers are often forced to upgrade their devices because companies make it difficult for older models to work optimally, said Williams from RIT.

“Premature obsolescence is an ongoing issue,” he said. “Devices can be difficult to repair or sometimes need upgrading to keep up with new operating systems, leading to extra purchases of new devices.”

That’s not to say that smart home products can’t be used in a green way.

“A talking fridge that adjusts its energy use to be less intensive and helps you better manage your food so you have less food waste would be extremely useful,” said Whelan of NYU.

The challenge is what happens to the fridge when it is done talking.

Clarification: Language paraphrasing Goss’s remarks on the production cycle and obsolescence have been amended to reflect that the author, and not Goss, was suggesting that this results in more devices being thrown away.

A badly beaten Raquel Pennington can be hard telling handlers in her corner “I’m done” and “I want to be done” after the fourth round of her bantamweight bout against Nunes in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. But the handlers appear to disregard her plea to throw in the towel. “No, no, no,” a coach can be heard saying. Then Pennington is told, “We’ll recover later.”

"I'm done!"



Corner: "No, no, no, no."

Pennington answered the bell for the fifth round, absorbing a flurry of punches before the referee stopped the match.

Check out the highlights beginning at 1:20 into the clip.

“If she didn’t have the right conditioning to fight, then the coach should have thrown in the towel for sure,” a triumphant Nunes said, per MMA Junkie. “I think my coach wouldn’t let me go through that. It’s sad. Everyone must be saying a lot of bad things about him on social media, but I really think she needs to surround herself with people who want the best for her so she can really evolve for her next fights. Unfortunately, tonight (the cornerman) failed.”

The decision sparked online debate, but Pennington’s fiancee, Tecia Torres, defended the move in an Instagram post.

“Both us and our coaches agree with the decision made to go into the 5th round,” Torres wrote. “We know Raquel more than anyone else and know if we let her give up on herself going into the last round she would have always regretted it. She fought with heart and grit until the end.”Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui could probably have a second career as an Amy Winehouse impersonator.

In recent weeks, Sarah Jessica Parker has been making the interview rounds, offering the part of Samantha to both Stephen Colbert and Ellen DeGeneres. In true “Watch What Happens Live” fashion, Cohen went a step further on Wednesday night. He staged an impromptu “audition” for the role by reenacting a famously raunchy SATC scene in Samantha drag, alongside Parker as Carrie.

The longtime pals couldn’t resist cracking up throughout the scene, given Samantha’s numerous references to oral sex throughout. At one point, they even broke character as one element of the scene mirrored one of Cohen’s real-life hookups.

“I did do it with a FedEx guy once, and that’s why she’s looking at me funny,” the host reveals in the clip above. “I did it with a FedEx guy once!”

SJP’s verdict? “You’re more suited, certainly, than Stephen Colbert, and I don’t know if Ellen’s actually interested,” she told Cohen. “So the role, by default, is yours.”

Parker later said she was “heartbroken” by the media firestorm that ensued last fall when Kim Cattrall, who originally played the part of Samantha, announced she had no interest in returning for a third “Sex and the City” movie. Cattrall’s decision threw the project into jeopardy, and the actress hinted that her relationship with Parker, which was rumored to have been contentious for years, was a factor in her choice to back out.

In a harsh rebuke of Rep. Devin Nunes, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday demanding that Nunes step down from his position as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Thursday’s letter comes a day after Nunes was accused of making “material changes” to a secret memo before it was sent to the president for public release. The memo reportedly accuses the Justice Department and the FBI of inappropriately surveilling Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Democrats have called the memo misleading, and in a rare public move, the FBI has warned that the memo withholds key facts.

“As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,” the FBI said in a statement.

Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, blasted Nunes in her letter, saying the California Republican has “disgraced the House Intelligence Committee.”

“It has now come to our attention that Congressman Nunes deliberately and materially altered the contents of the memo since it was voted on by the House Republicans,” Pelosi said. “This action is not only dangerous, it is illegitimate, and violates House rules.”

Ryan must “put an end to this charade,” Pelosi said.Employees remove internal organs from pigs at a Smithfield Foods Inc. pork processing facility in Milan, Missouri on April 12, 2017.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pushing forward with a proposed rule that would forego line-speed limits in hog processing plants, a move that could endanger the well-being of workers and consumers, activists say.

The proposal is part of the USDA’s effort to “modernize” the swine industry, the organization announced earlier this month. These plants, which already work at feverish speeds of up to 1,106 hogs per hour, would likely use the change as an opportunity to further increase the pace of production.

In addition to increasing line speeds, the proposal would allow employees to take over some of the oversight duties that USDA inspectors currently handle on the kill lines.

The way it works now, USDA inspectors are expected to examine every animal that comes down the line, and are tasked with identifying diseased hogs and visible fecal matter. Under the proposed rule, plant employees would take over that job before the carcasses reach federal inspectors.

The move could potentially help the hog industry’s bottom line. But faster speeds could also put consumers at risk, since inspectors may not be able to examine each carcass adequately for diseases and other issues. Increasing the rate of speed lines could present more risks for plant workers who already face a slew of hazards at the industry’s current pace, including amputations and musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

But the USDA maintains that it’s not its responsibility to ensure worker safety ― that’s up to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Carmen Rottenberg, deputy administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at USDA.

The proposal is “a gift to the industry,” said Tony Corbo, senior lobbyist with Washington-based advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “The industry has been pushing to deregulate inspection all the way back to the Reagan administration.”

Corbo added that while the proposed rule fits in with the Trump administration’s “deregulatory talk,” the concept actually precedes the current presidency.

During the Obama administration, the USDA approved a similar plan for poultry plants in 2014. But after getting bombarded with pushback from activists and the media, the government organization decided to prohibit plants from ramping up the speeds on slaughter lines.

Rottenberg told HuffPost that the revised protocol would increase efficiency and free up USDA inspectors to perform other tasks around the hog plants.

The organization pointed to the “success” of a pilot program that started in the late 1990s, which allowed five hog plants to operate as their own designated speeds.

“For large-volume establishments, this new swine inspection system does make better use of the agency’s resources while also removing unnecessary regulatory obstacles to industry,” said Rottenberg.

But a 2013 report from the Office of the Inspector General harshly criticized the USDA for its lack of oversight of pork slaughterhouses in general, and took issue with the five plants involved in the pilot program in particular.

The report concluded that between 2008 and 2011, three of the 10 plants with the most citations for food safety and animal welfare violations were part of the USDA pilot program. Those plants, which had 50 percent more citations than the plant with next highest number, continue to run at the same speeds.

Workers’ advocates also say that faster line speeds will make an already dangerous job even more dangerous.

Serious injuries ― those that require work restrictions or days off from work ― are more than three times higher in meat packing than other U.S. industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

While protecting workers is not within the USDA’s regulatory purview, activists say that workers at slaughterhouses – who are often refugees and immigrants that are reluctant to speak up about hazardous conditions ― rely on USDA’s rules to keep them safe.

“Food safety regulations have acted as a de facto throttle on line speeds, and has consequently protected workers,” said Nicole Civita, a lawyer, professor, food ethicist and director of the Food Recovery Project.

Before moving forward with the proposed rule, the USDA will accept comments from the public for 60 days, through mid-March. Earlier this week, the USDA rejected a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that poultry processing plants be allowed to do away with line speed maximums.

Activists say there’s no difference between the poultry and hog industries: If the USDA rejected the idea of increasing line speed for chickens, they should also reject it for hogs for the same reasons.

HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.A radio station in Little Rock, Arkansas, is making negative waves online with its “Babe Bracket,” a long-running contest that ranks the female reporters and news anchors in the area by attractiveness.

One local TV news director wrote a blog post asking that it finally be stopped.

“The days of referring to educated women who serve as role models to our children as ‘babes’ are over. It’s time to evolve with the times,” said KARK news director Austin Kellerman.

“[These women] deserve to be celebrated — just not like this,” he said.

The Babe Bracket runs on KABZ-FM 103.7. The hosts of its morning “Show With No Name” pit 16 women against each other and lets the show’s listeners vote on who makes it through each round. Last year, KATV weekend anchor-reporter Janelle Lilley “won.”

The brackets are “sponsored” by Seductions Lingerie.

And it’s been going on for over two decades, according to KABZ-FM’s program director, Justin Acri.

Acri told HuffPost on Thursday that the station’s hosts are “constantly evaluating content and this bit is no different.”

“Even before the consternation from our friends and station fans at KARK-TV, Tommy Smith (the morning co-host who began the bit) was weighing his options of continuing with it this year or replacing it with another bracket idea,” Acri said.

On Thursday morning, 103.7 The Buzz took calls from listeners and had Kellerman on the show to discuss what should be done.

Kellerman pointed out that many of the female journalists don’t want their names in the mix. The hosts responded that public figures don’t get to decide how they’re talked about, but added that they had honored one woman’s request not to be included.

The hosts also discussed the word “babe” and whether the use of that term affected how people perceived the contest.

Even if they removed the word “babe,” Kellerman said, their brackets are still not respecting the intelligence of these women or the causes they work for.

In his blog post, he used the example of KATV meteorologist Melinda Mayo and her video “message to all young girls” encouraging them to pursue careers in math and science.

“So are we going to go from that clip to putting Melinda Mayo in the Babe Bracket? I don’t think so,” he wrote.

You can listen to his whole talk with 103.7 The Buzz below:

Kellerman told HuffPost via email that the reaction he’s received to his blog post and call to action has been mixed.

“I’ve received a very positive response from women, but just to give you an example of the climate, here’s a poll I put up (see below). It’s largely been 60% support of the bracket,” he said.

Kellerman added that he believes we need to “rethink the way we look at professional women.”

“What was acceptable in the 80s or 90s, isn’t the norm anymore. In that regard, society has evolved for the better. It’s time for everyone else to come along for the ride. ... Female journalists have come a long way over the last few decades, but there’s still a way to go. Let’s do everything we can to help support them,” he said.

As for the fate of the Babe Bracket, Acri said that a final decision on how to proceed this year and beyond has not been made yet.

Kim Kardashian is redefining petty in real time.

The beauty mogul just launched her new line of Valentine’s Day-themed Kimoji Hearts Fragrance perfumes, which you’ve probably seen influencers promoting social media. The PR box delivered to a select few individuals includes one of the three new perfumes encased in a large heart-shaped chocolate shell.

Well, a handful of boxes have yet to go out yet, and Kardashian has a list in mind and she’s checking it twice (sorry, wrong holiday) with plans to send the gift to some of her feuding partners.

“I decided for this Valentine’s Day everyone deserves a valentine, so I’m going to send them to my lovers, to my haters, to everyone that I think of because it’s Valentine’s Day after all,” she said surveying a table of post-it notes on Instagram story.

Kim K is really out here sending all her "haters" Valentines 😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/W5BavHHDD0 — Complex Pop Culture (@ComplexPop) February 1, 2018

The notes are divided into three color-coded sections, presumably showing exactly who is in Kardashian’s favor. Public enemy No. 1, Taylor Swift, sits in the blue pile, alongside names like Chloe Grace Moretz and Bette Midler, who famously called out the reality TV star over her nude photos.

Blac Chyna, who has been embroiled in an on-going legal battle with brother Rob Kardashian, will also be getting some perfume in the mail, as well as Piers Morgan, Sharon Osbourne and ― we’re confused too ― Sarah Michelle Gellar.

The other two piles are populated by fans of the famous family, including Chrissy Teigen, Hailey Baldwin and Jennifer Lawrence, in addition to sisters Khloe, Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and momager Kris Jenner.

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jan 29, 2018 at 7:44am PSTPresident Donald Trump’s former legal spokesman is expected to tell special counsel Robert Mueller about a previously undisclosed phone call in which White House aide Hope Hicks allegedly promised that emails from Donald Trump Jr. about a 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer “will never get out,” The New York Times has reported.

The Times reported Wednesday that Mark Corallo, who resigned from his spokesman job in July, has accepted an interview request from Mueller’s team. Corallo reportedly plans to disclose that in the call, Hicks, the White House communications director, and Trump discussed the meeting that included Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer who was expected to give them negative information about rival Hillary Clinton.

“Mr. Corallo planned to tell investigators that Ms. Hicks said during the call that emails written by Donald Trump Jr. before the Trump Tower meeting — in which the younger Mr. Trump said he was eager to receive political dirt about Mrs. Clinton from the Russians — “will never get out.” That left Mr. Corallo with concerns that Ms. Hicks could be contemplating obstructing justice, the people said,” the Times reported.

″Mr. Corallo... told colleagues he was alarmed not only by what Ms. Hicks had said — either she was being naive or was suggesting that the emails could be withheld from investigators — but also that she had said it in front of the president without a lawyer on the phone and that the conversation could not be protected by attorney-client privilege.”

A lawyer representing Hicks strongly denied the claims.

“She never said that. And the idea that Hope Hicks ever suggested that emails or other documents would be concealed or destroyed is completely false,” lawyer Robert P. Trout told the Times.

The Trump campaign initially claimed the meeting was arranged to discuss a program for adoption of Russian children by American families. However, news reports later revealed the meeting was actually focused on obtaining political information on Clinton. Trump Jr. later posted on Twitter a chain of email correspondence leading up to the meeting that showed he had been promised information that “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

″[I]f it’s what you say I love it,” Trump Jr. had written in response.

According to three people in contact with Corallo, Trump’s inner circle furiously debated how to respond when news reports on the Russian lawyer meeting surfaced last July, the Times reported.

Several statements were drafted and released by lawyers for various parties involved in the meeting. Corallo’s account is that he told both Trump and Hicks that a misleading statement for Trump Jr. to give to the press, which was reportedly drafted aboard Air Force One, would have negative consequences and that the emails between Trump Jr. and the Russian participants in the meeting would emerge.

The dynamic between Trump and Hicks was noted in Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.

“Completely devoted to accommodating him, she, his media facilitator, was the ultimate facilitator of unmediated behavior. His impulses and thoughts ― unedited, unreviewed, unchallenged ― not only passed through him, but, via Hicks, traveled out into the world without any other White House arbitration,” Wolff wrote.

Wolff also wrote of Corallo’s reaction following the Air Force One meeting.New York Daily News Managing Editor Rob Moore is seen in a photo from April 2017. He came under investigation in January. Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images

The New York Daily News’ parent company has let go of two top editors at the newspaper following investigations last month into harassment allegations made against them by current and former employees, Tronc confirmed to HuffPost on Thursday.

“I can confirm that both are no longer with the company,” said a spokesperson for the company.

Tronc fired Rob Moore, the newspaper’s managing editor, along with Alexander “Doc” Jones, who edited the paper’s Sunday edition.

Moore came under investigation in January only after NPR contacted Tronc, the parent company, to ask about a sexual harassment complaint made against Moore the month before.

Moore was suspended later that week, following a HuffPost report that he fostered a culture of fear in the newsroom, telling employees that he would get rid of anyone who complained about him to HR.

HuffPost also reported that Tronc had suspended and begun investigating Jones, after the company received complaints about him as well. At least some of those complaints were sexual in nature.

Former employees told HuffPost that Jones, who worked at the newspaper for over two decades, displayed a “pattern” of inappropriate behavior toward young women.

Tronc’s investigation into “various complaints” determined that Jones made “unwanted physical contact with female employees such as kissing them, hugging them and/or grabbing their hands,” according to an internal company email obtained by HuffPost.

Additionally, the document revealed that Jones had previously been given a “warning” about his behavior and that the decision to terminate his employment was based partially on Jones’ “own admissions.” It was dated Jan. 30.

Staffers also told HuffPost that the human resources department did not take proper action on complaints against Jones’ behavior prior to Tronc’s takeover.

“Media, as you know, is a tough enough biz to work in these days,” one staffer told HuffPost at the time. “It’s even tougher for women, because you have men like Rob and Doc contaminating the culture.”Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” shut down an on-air interview Thursday with “Fire and Fury” author Michael Wolff after he denied previously suggesting that President Donald Trump had an affair with U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

“I’m going to go as far as to say, you might be having a fun time playing a little game dancing around this, but you’re slurring a woman,” Brzezinski told Wolff before abruptly ending the interview. “It’s disgraceful.”

Rumors about Haley and Trump swirled after Wolff said last month on an episode of HBO’s “Real Time With Bill Maher” that he was “absolutely sure” the president was having an affair. He said people should be able deduce who Trump was romantically involved with from a specific paragraph in “Fire and Fury” ― his controversial tell-all book about the White House.

Wolff’s comments sent the internet ablaze, with readers pointing to the line: “The president had been spending a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air Force One and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future.”

Haley called the rumors “absolutely not true” in an interview with Politico last week.

Wolff “says that I’ve been talking a lot with the president in the Oval about my political future,” Haley said. “I’ve never talked once to the president about my future and I am never alone with him.”

Brzezinski wasn’t the only one to go after Wolff during the segment Thursday. Susan Del Percio, a political strategist and panelist on the show, called Wolff’s actions “so irresponsible.”

But Wolff claimed he didn’t fuel the speculation about Haley.

“I didn’t go after her,” he said. “And secondly, certainly what I meant is that I found it puzzling that she would deny something she was not accused of ... Certainly, I didn’t accuse her of this.”

When asked if he regrets “inferring anything” about Haley, Wolff denied that he had ever done so.

“What I inferred is that ... many of the people around the president believe he is still involved with various women,” Wolff said.

But Brzezinski wasn’t buying Wolff’s defense.

″You’re on the set of ‘Morning Joe’ ― we don’t b.s. here,” she said. “If you don’t get it, and you don’t get what we’re talking about, I’m sorry, this is awkward, you’re here on the set with us, but you’re done.”

After Thursday’s heated interview, Wolff attacked Brzezinski, as well as Joe Scarborough, her “Morning Joe” co-host and fiance, in a series of tweets.

Trump has infamously attacked the MSNBC co-host. In June, he referred to her as “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” in one tweet, and said he had seen her “bleeding badly from a face-lift” in another.

Wolff previously denied instigating the Haley rumors during an interview with theSkimm on Wednesday and claimed the U.N. ambassador appeared to have “embraced” the rumors.

“All she does is hammer on this fact,” he said. “If I were being accused of something, and I’m not accusing her of anything ― I mean she hasn’t tried to avoid this, let’s say ... The book doesn’t accuse her. I didn’t accuse her.”The first lady will likely remain hospitalized for the rest of the week. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

First lady Melania Trump is recovering from surgery she had on Monday to treat a “benign kidney condition,” her office announced.

She will likely spend the next few days in the hospital recuperating after the embolization procedure, a surgery done to prevent blood flow to part of a body, typically with the intent of shrinking a tumor or preventing an aneurysm.

“The procedure was successful and there were no complications,” a statement from her office read. “Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The First Lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere.”

President Donald Trump spoke with his wife before the surgery and with her doctor after, a White House official told NBC. He is expected to visit her Monday.A Massachusetts law banning possession of bump stocks and other accessories that increase a gun’s rate of fire went into effect on Thursday, making the state the first to enact such legislation in the wake of last year’s deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas.

Bump stocks allow semi-automatic rifles to simulate automatic fire. The accessory replaces a standard rifle stock ― the piece that rests against the shoulder ― and harnesses a weapon’s recoil to slide the gun rapidly back and forth onto the shooter’s trigger finger, firing each time.

The gunman who opened fire on tens of thousands of concertgoers in Las Vegas last October had attached bump stocks to at least a dozen assault-style rifles, law enforcement officials said. He was able to shoot more than 1,100 rounds over the span of a few minutes, killing 58 people and wounding 422. More than 400 others were injured in the chaos caused by the shooting.

“We saw in Las Vegas the carnage, which far exceeded the carnage of any other mass shooting in U.S. history, and it made it very clear to me that there’s no purpose whatsoever for a bump stock, other than killing a lot of people very quickly,” said John Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that advocated for the measure.

Bump stocks “should be banned, and I am proud of Massachusetts to be the first state in the nation to do the right thing,” he said.

California and New York had banned the devices before the Las Vegas shooting.

In Massachusetts, anyone found in possession of a bump stock or other similarly banned equipment will be subject to prosecution, with sentences ranging from 18 months to life in prison. The law also prohibits accessories known as trigger cranks, which it defines as any device that “repeatedly activates the trigger of the weapon through the use of a lever or other part that is turned in a circular motion.”

The measure exempts “any weapon initially designed and manufactured to fire through the use of a crank or lever.”

Sales of both bump stock and trigger cranks have been banned in Massachusetts since the legislation was signed into law in November.

Although automatic firearms are strictly regulated under a 1986 federal law, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has determined that the statute doesn’t cover bump stocks or trigger cranks because the items aren’t technically “machine guns” ― defined as weapons that fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger.

Lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to outlaw the devices. But gun rights groups and GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have instead called on the ATF to re-examine whether it can regulate them under federal law. The agency is considering what additional action it can take and is expected to announce a final decision in the coming months.

Although popular models once retailed for under $200, the possibility of a federal ban sent demand skyrocketing, leading bump stocks to sell for as much as $1,500.

Meanwhile, at least 15 states and a number of local jurisdictions have taken taken up proposals to ban the devices following the Las Vegas shooting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

As the first state to officially ban bump stocks amid the recent push, Massachusetts has emerged as a flashpoint in a predictably contentious debate over how the prohibition will be enforced.

Prior to the law’s enactment, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security had sent all 400,000 of the state’s licensed gun owners a notice informing them that they had until Feb. 1 to turn over bump stocks and other restricted devices to law enforcement.

“It was very well publicized in Massachusetts and we expect people to, number one, know about the law, and number two, comply with the law,” said state Rep. David Linsky (D), who authored the bump stock ban measure.

“Police departments have been working with the Office of Public Safety to develop a protocol for the destruction of any weapons that get turned in,” he added. “People have had several months now, because they knew this ban was coming, to either give away or sell their items to someone out of state who could legally possess them.”

It’s unclear how popular bump stocks have been in Massachusetts. Although the state has some of the nation’s strongest gun laws and keeps comprehensive records of firearms sales and transfers, its statutes didn’t cover these sorts of accessories.

Bump stocks “tended to be a novelty item” among Massachusetts gun owners, Linksy said, adding that he didn’t think there were many around the state.

A representative for the Massachusetts State Police didn’t immediately respond to a request for information on the number of bump stocks that had been turned over ahead of the deadline.

Bans on certain types of weaponry often evoke fears of government confiscation, or “gun-grabbing,” among firearms advocates, but Linksy said police wouldn’t be going door to door to proactively enforce the law.

“It will be a law enforcement issue the same way if someone is found with contraband of some other sort,” he said.

Gun rights groups have cried foul over the law’s lack of compensation for owners who surrender their bump stocks. Some gun rights organizations have floated the possibility of suing over the payment issue.

Other gun rights activists say they understand the frustration, but don’t necessarily see the devices as worth fighting a legal battle over.

“They’re not used for any sporting purpose, they’re not used in hunting, they would be impractical for self defense. ... They’re toys,” said Brent Carlton, president and co-founder of the Massachusetts-based gun rights group Comm2A. “But the fact of the matter is people spent money on them, they own them, they presumably have a property interest in them.”

The state is prepared to defend the law if activists do end up filing suit, said Linsky.
