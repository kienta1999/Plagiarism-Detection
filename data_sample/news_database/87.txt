Hogg, who has become a leading advocate for stronger gun laws in the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre at his high school in Florida, told TMZ Sunday that he received an acceptance letter from Irvine last week. The outlet reported previously that Hogg had been rejected by that school and UCLA, San Diego and Santa Barbara despite a high grade-point average.

Ingraham last month ridiculed Hogg on Twitter for failing to gain entry into the colleges. The backlash was fierce. Hogg encouraged his Twitter followers to contact Ingraham’s sponsors. Several advertisers dropped the show, and the host departed on vacation. Ingraham is scheduled to return to the air on “The Ingraham Angle” Monday night.

Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who rallied supporters at the March For Our Lives demonstration last month in Washington, didn’t say whether he accepted the offer to attend UC Irvine. He didn’t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.Senate Environment and Public Works Committee

Andrew Wheeler sat comfortably in his chair last November, his hands rarely visible above the wooden table facing the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. This was his first confirmation hearing as President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the second-highest-ranking person at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Familiar faces looked back at him on the Senate panel ― his former boss, two Republicans and one Democrat for whom he held fundraisers in his former career as a coal lobbyist. He responded to questions in calm and fluent legalese, at times closing his eyes as if reciting from memory. His glass of water remained half full for the entire two-hour affair.

At the same time, sitting to his right, Kathleen Hartnett-White, the former Texas regulator and avowed fossil fuel champion nominated to lead the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, flamed out as she blinked, stammered and stuttered through basic science questions. Videos of her cringeworthy performance went viral. Democrats drummed up enough concern over her qualifications that they sent her nomination back to the White House in December. The president defiantly re-nominated her a month later, before finally abandoning her in February.

Wheeler, on the other hand, is poised to be confirmed this week as the EPA’s deputy administrator, putting him next in line to lead the agency if embattled Administrator Scott Pruitt is pushed out the door. The tale of two nominations underscores what environmentalists see as the limitations of Democrats’ opposition to the Trump administration’s radical deregulatory agenda. Wheeler, like Harnett-White, brazenly disputed the science behind climate change at his confirmation hearing, but did so in the sort of ambiguous, couched legal language gleaned from decades as a Beltway insider. The substantially similar nominees diverged in style at a time when liberals are increasingly worried about preserving Washington norms.

Democrats have expended political capital to upend nominees like Hartnett-White ― repeatedly highlighting her past statements crediting coal with abolishing slavery and suggesting increased carbon dioxide emissions were good for the planet ― and Michael Dourson, Pruitt’s pick for the chemical safety division, whose consultancy InsideClimate News described in 2014 as the “one-stop science shop” favored by the chemical and tobacco industries seeking affirmative research.

Senate Environment and Public Works Committee

But Wheeler faced much less scrutiny from Democrats. As a result, the man who could become the nation’s next EPA administrator at a time of historic environmental turmoil and the increasing politicization of science sailed through his nomination process.

“There is the appearance that Democrats have only given lip service to opposing Wheeler,” Frank O’Donnell, president of the environmental group Clean Air Watch, told HuffPost. “Where is the outrage? Isn’t Democratic reticence something of a scandal itself?”

Wheeler is even expected to get some Democratic support. On Friday, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-S.D.), who did not take stances on Dourson or Hartnett-White but voted to approve Pruitt last year, told HuffPost she planned to confirm Wheeler. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) ― who opposed Dourson despite being the only other Democrat to confirm to Pruitt ― said Monday he, too, would vote for Wheeler. He did not indicate his support for Hartnett-White.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) ― who, besides being the only Republican to vote against Pruitt, opposed Dourson and criticized Hartnett-White ― did not respond to requests for comment.

Wheeler’s confirmation vote comes nearly two weeks after pressure began growing for Pruitt to resign or be fired over accusations of corruption and taxpayer waste. Trump has defended Pruitt’s extravagant travel spending and a sweetheart deal to rent a room well below market rate in a luxury condo owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist. But four Republican members of Congress and dozens of Democrats and environmental groups are calling for his departure as conservative groups circle the wagons with a campaign to save the administrator.

While Wheeler might be less combative than Pruitt, he could prove more effective. Pruitt arrived in Washington last year after spending six years as Oklahoma’s attorney general, making his reputation on the national stage by suing the EPA to block climate regulations. Before that, he was a state senator for eight years.

Wheeler, by contrast, is a consummate Washington insider who knows the agency he’s joining. He spent four years as a staffer in the EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He later served as a general counsel to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and as an aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). After that, Wheeler remained a fixture on Capitol Hill as a lobbyist, though from 2009 to 2017, his contributions went exclusively to Republicans. Until mid-2017, Wheeler lobbied for Murray Energy, the mining giant owned by coal magnate and Trump whisperer Bob Murray. In March 2017, when Murray met with Energy Secretary Rick Perry to request a bailout for the coal industry at a secret summit, Wheeler was pictured sitting one seat away from him.

Environmental groups have seized on Wheeler’s history as a lobbyist to drum up opposition ahead of this week’s vote. The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters urged their members this month to call their senators to demand they reject Wheeler’s nomination. The groups highlighted a February report in The Intercept that revealed Wheeler had hosted fundraisers for Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) five months before his formal nomination and two months before his first White House interview for the job. The EPA said he also hosted a fundraiser for Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, in December 2016. The groups hoped to draw parallels between the fundraisers and Pruitt’s housing arrangement, which precipitated his ongoing ethics storm.

“Where is the outrage? Isn’t Democratic reticence something of a scandal itself?” - Frank O'Donnell, Clean Air Watch

“The last thing the Senate should do is enable the dangerously corrupt Scott Pruitt any further by rushing through his hand-picked successor,” John Coequyt, Sierra Club’s senior director of federal policy, said in a statement. “Pruitt is ‘under siege’ for taking favors from fossil fuel lobbyists ― with Andrew Wheeler, he’s simply trying to bring those lobbyists directly into the EPA.”

Wheeler could face significant challenges if he became administrator, as Pruitt’s departure would embolden Democrats, said RL Miller, president of Climate Hawks Vote, a super PAC.

“If Wheeler takes over, then he’s taking over a badly wounded agency where every Dem will be demanding oversight,” she told HuffPost. “I don’t see him as able to get a lot done in the next seven months before midterms. And at that point, he will have real oversight.”

But Wheeler has also faced accusations of abusing his power to target political opponents. In 2005, Wheeler worked with Inhofe to demand tax records from the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials and its sister group, State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, after the nonpartisan groups came out against a controversial greenhouse gas emission bill Inhofe supported. In February, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability and transparency watchdog, told HuffPost the 13-year-old tax probe “raises serious concerns as to Wheeler’s judgment.”

While Democrats largely let Wheeler’s nomination proceed unimpeded, the nominee also received comparatively less media scrutiny, according to Lisa Hymas, director of the climate and energy program at the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America.

“Journalists, as well as other people in Washington, should be paying a lot more attention to sub-top level cabinet positions ― they wield a lot of power and they’re in a position to take over if Trump summarily fires someone he’s displeased with,” she told HuffPost. “The media has definitely been undercovering the story of Andrew Wheeler, his industry connections and the damage he could do.”

This article has been updated with comments from Miller.If Simon is going down, he’s going down swinging.

“Walking Dead” fans lost their new favorite character this week after Simon’s (Steven Ogg) plans to usurp Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) were sniffed out by the big man himself. Negan basically went “Game of Thrones” on Simon, sentencing him to trial by one-on-one combat. Since Negan has nearly indestructible plot armor, you knew it wasn’t ending well for his second-in-command.

In a scene that’s incredibly hard to watch, Negan ends up strangling Simon to death, but not before our dude managed to sneak in a few good shots on his boss. During an interview with HuffPost on his exit, actor Ogg also threw some punches at the sometimes-toxic fan culture surrounding the show.

A number of “Walking Dead” actors have been the subjects of disturbing online bullying. Josh McDermitt, the actor who plays Eugene, left social media after receiving death threats due to his character’s “evil” turn in the show. Alanna Masterson, aka Tara on the show, experienced a barrage of body-shaming comments on Instagram after she appeared in the Season 7 episode “Swear” shortly after giving birth. Two years later, she’s still asking people to “please” stop harassing her.

A post shared by Alanna (@alannamasterson) on Mar 31, 2018 at 1:13pm PDT

When it comes to the trolls, Ogg isn’t so cordial.

“It makes me fucking sick,” he told HuffPost. “It’s just disgusting.”

Ogg said he’s seen firsthand what social media can do to a person, and he’s tired of it.

“It makes me sick that these trolls and these people can say stuff, because, again, the social anonymity of it is what allows people somehow the right to just say whatever the fuck they want,” he said. “And you know what? If you want to fucking beak off like that, then why don’t you post your name — your full name, not your Twitter name, not your handle, not your bullshit, whatever made-up stuff you do. Print your real name. Print your real phone number. Print your real address. Step up. Don’t just hide behind this anonymity and say whatever you want. That shit pisses me off. ”

“I’ve had personal experiences, and I’ve been through stuff,” Ogg added. “But again, it does affect you, but you have to quickly go, it’s bottom feeders, right? It’s catfish. It’s people that are eating the fucking shit out of the hippo tank, and that’s how you’re spending your time? It’s sad.”

The actor explains a “better man” would just say, “Oh, it’s sad. These people are just pathetic,” but sometimes he can’t help getting upset.

“That’s why Alanna’s post was so beautiful, because fuck off. Why are you harassing people?” he said. “Go fucking do something productive with your life.”

Ogg noted that he has a “love and hate” relationship with social media overall. (We’re probably safe assuming it’s more of the latter.) He does run his Instagram account, but he says he left Facebook after the 2016 presidential election and only “dabbles” on Twitter. According to him, he has “enough shit” going on in his head without online comments further polluting it.

Ogg recently saw his co-star McDermitt perform in a play in New York and remarked on how different he is since he left social media.

“He’s happier and in a better place than ever now,” Ogg said, adding that “his energy, and I made the point of saying this to him, is different.”

Now, as clear-cut as Simon’s strangling was, “Walking Dead” actors never really die. Sure, they can be snuffed out on the show, but with Comic-Cons and other fan events, actors are constantly called back to make appearances and greeted by masses of fans bigger than any zombie herd. Ogg will likely be hearing from “Walking Dead” fans, on- and offline, for some time.

Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. When there’s respect, Ogg said the fandom can be a deeply rewarding experience:

There’s people that haven’t left their home in five months or that have anxiety attacks or depression, and you talk to them. Shit, I have super crazy anxiety. I get super depressed, and we’re all human. Man, woman, transgender, black, white, whatever all these fucking labels are we got flying around. You punch anyone in the nose, and we’re all gonna bleed, so people are at these [events], man, I wanna share what I have to share. I’m not better than you because I’m on the show. I’m just lucky in a sense, and I work at my job, and I got this but, man, you connect with people. It’s an emotional experience, and you realize that you can make a difference to people, so how beautiful is that? And they make a difference to me, these people saying, ‘This is the best day of my life.’ OK, I don’t have to understand that any more than I have to understand why someone paints their fucking face for a sports event, but it doesn’t mean that I don’t appreciate what they have to offer.

But when there isn’t respect, well, Ogg’s got two words for you:Blake Lively, Tammy Reynolds and Ryan Reynolds. ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images

Who wouldn’t want to adopt Ryan Reynolds?

Unfortunately, you no longer can, because he has some new parents: celebrity power couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.

Last week, Reynolds attended the premiere of Krasinski’s new film “A Quiet Place,” which also stars Blunt, with wife Blake Lively and real-life mom Tammy Reynolds.

On Sunday, the “Deadpool” actor tweeted his love for the film and announced the big news.

Two EPA officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told the outlet that a March email chain between the agency’s human resources team and Sarah Greenwalt, one of the aides who received a $56,765 pay bump, is causing a stir as it makes its way around the office amid the Inspector General’s probe into Pruitt’s conduct.

The email chain reportedly shows Greenwalt writing to the HR department to confirm her raise was being processed. She “definitively stated that Pruitt approves and was supportive of her getting a raise,” one of the sources told The Atlantic.

The alleged exchange is the latest suggestion that Pruitt knew about and supported the staggering raises, despite his claims to the contrary after news of the pay bumps became public.

Last week, two EPA officials and a White House staffer told The Washington Post that Pruitt had instructed other agency officials to carry out the raises for both Greenwalt and his other longtime aide Millan Hupp, who was given a $28,130 bump.

A day before the Post report, Pruitt had claimed to Fox News’ Ed Henry that he had no clue about the raises.

“I found out this yesterday and I corrected the action, and we are in the process of finding out how it took place and correcting that going forward,” Pruitt said after attempting to dodge the question several times.Rapper Cardi B confirmed she is pregnant with her first child during a performance on “Saturday Night Live” over the weekend.

In lieu of an official announcement, the rapper wore a white, custom Christian Siriano gown that revealed her baby bump. Shortly after her performance, she posted photos on Instagram thanking fans and celebrities like Rihanna and 50 Cent for their support.

“The love I’m receiving is overwhelming😩! I can’t thank you enough for always finding the time to share your support!! Thank you a million times @badgalriri,” the rapper wrote, reposting a picture from Rihanna.

A post shared by Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Apr 8, 2018 at 2:03pm PDT

Cardi later posted an Instagram story ― now deleted ― that explained why she wanted to keep the pregnancy news under wraps for as long as possible.

“This is why i did not wanted to say nothing,” Cardi wrote in the post, which appeared aimed at people criticizing her pregnancy. “People be so thirsty to scrutinize and try to destroy something that [is] suppose to be a blessing.”

Cardi is due the first week of July, according to TMZ. Her fiancé, rapper Offset, has children from previous relationships.

Cardi B (real name Belcalis Almanzar) and Offset (real name Kiari Kendrell Cephus) first collaborated on a song together in 2016, and reportedly began dating in February 2017. They got engaged in October, when Offset proposed onstage.

Reports of the “Bodak Yellow” rapper’s pregnancy first surfaced in February, when TMZ reported that members of Cardi B’s inner circle were telling staff at a nightclub she was expecting.

But Cardi B denied she was pregnant.

“No bitch I’m just getting fat,” she said in response to a fan’s comment on Instagram. “Let me fat in peace.”

Pack your bags, because chances are you’re about to be hit with an unstoppable wave of wanderlust. The experts at Lonely Planet have used their own brand of travel witchery to pull together the 10 best under-the-radar destinations in Europe for 2018.

This year’s list takes direct aim at the problem of overtourism, or mass tourism, which devastates locals in communities like Reykjavik, Iceland and Florence, Italy. Some cities are even considering visitor caps per day to curb the problem.

Topping Lonely Planet’s 2018 list for underrated European destinations is the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy, which is often overlooked in favor of more popular regions like Tuscany, Campania and The Veneto.

This is Lonely Planet’s sixth iteration of the wanderlust-inspiring list, which rounds up Europe’s hottest up-and-coming countries, regions and cities. This year’s list is meant to inspire travelers to visit lesser-known gems across the continent while encouraging more responsible tourism, according to Tom Hall, Lonely Planet’s editorial director.

“There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” Hall said. “Our expert writers cross the continent and have uncovered some of Europe’s most outstanding, underrated and overlooked places that are well worth planning a trip around.”

Whether you’re looking for a lesser-known equivalent of Tuscany’s vineyards, or want to spend some one-on-one time with the great outdoors, there’s something on Lonely Planet’s list for everyone.

Trump appeared to directly float the idea of firing special counsel Robert Mueller at the start of his military leadership meeting on Monday, calling the special counsel’s investigation a “disgrace” and defending his firing of former FBI Director James Comey as the “right thing” to do.

“Why don’t I just fire Mueller?” Trump asked in response to a reporter’s question. “Well, I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s really a sad situation ... Many people have said you should fire him. Again, they found nothing, and in finding nothing, that’s a big statement.”

Trump’s comments came shortly after the FBI reportedly raided the office and hotel room of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on Monday afternoon. Agents seized documents relating to a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, as well as emails, tax records and business documents, according to The New York Times.

Cohen’s attorney told the outlet a search warrant was issued after a referral from Mueller, but wasn’t directly related to his investigation.

“The decision by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary,” the lawyer, Stephen Ryan, told NBC in a statement. “It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients.”

The president responded with fury after the raid, calling Mueller’s investigation a “total witch hunt” and a “disgraceful situation” in Monday’s meeting.

On Tuesday morning, he resumed fuming on Twitter.

A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2018

Attorney–client privilege is dead! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2018

Trump also slammed Sessions for his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation last year.

“The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this ... he certainly should have let us know if he was going to recuse himself, and we would have put a different attorney general in,” the president said Monday. “So he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country.”

Trump has repeatedly stated he wouldn’t have appointed Sessions if had known he wouldn’t oversee the Russia investigation and has routinely said the action directly led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) issued a stark warning to Trump in a series of tweets late Monday.

“If [the president] is thinking of using the FBI raid to fire Special Counsel Mueller or otherwise interfere with the chain of command in the Russia probe, we Democrats have one simple message for him: don’t,” Schumer wrote. “Mueller, a Republican, has uncovered a deep & detailed pattern of Russian interference in our elections that led to indictments & guilty pleas. It also led to the Trump admin itself leveling sanctions against Russian individuals, proof that it’s not a so-called ‘witch-hunt.’”

The investigation is critical to the health of our democracy, and must be allowed to continue. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) April 9, 2018Catt Sadler is a woman on a mission.

The E! News co-host resigned in December after she says she found out her male counterpart had been making “close to double” her salary. Now, she’s using her experience to raise awareness of pay inequality ahead of Equal Pay Day on April 10.

Sadler talked with HuffPost, in partnership with Luna Bar, about her “highly unexpected” resignation, what it’s been like to become one of the most public faces of equal pay, and how she’s fighting to make sure fewer women have to go through what she did.

Sadler, who worked at the entertainment network for close to a decade, hasn’t let her job loss slow her down. Instead, she said it has galvanized her into action.

“I’m now really leaning into it because I know of the need for faces and voices and activists doing their part to make a change,” Sadler said of her newfound role. “I feel honored, in a sense. Every choice I’m making and career move that I am engaging in is in line with all of this.”

Sadler said she was overwhelmed by the “massive” support she received after she quit her E! job.

“It really affirmed that it’s not my story it is hundreds of thousands of women’s stories, who are making 80 cents on the dollar compared to what men are making,” she said. “Sometimes it’s worse if you’re a Latina woman or a black woman ― the statistics are even more glaringly bad.”

White women make close to 80 cents for every white man’s dollar, while Latina women make 54 cents, and black women make 63 cents, according to a 2018 report from the American Association of University Women. On average, Asian women make 87 cents to every white man’s dollar.

While equal pay is an important topic, it’s sometimes hard to discuss because so many factors contribute to pay inequality. Race, ethnicity, geography, age and privilege are components that can make the pay gap convoluted and complex.

To simplify the comparison, Sadler said there’s one tool women in all industries can use today to combat pay inequality.

“The thing that stands out the most to me is transparency. I feel like it’s been so incredibly taboo, it’s the one thing that is not talked about,” she said. “People walk around and nobody knows who’s making what or why. You look at the sports industry and everybody knows what Tom Brady’s making, right? What you make has been this dark little secret. I’m a living-breathing example of that, I just had no idea.”

“What you make has been this dark little secret. I’m a living-breathing example of that, I just had no idea.” - Catt Sadler

Sadler pointed to the recent coverage of pay disparity between Hollywood stars in big films like “All The Money In The World” and Netflix’s “The Crown.”

“I like what I see so far just in the last year of more and more news stories and things that are hitting the media and the companies that are at least responding to that,” she said. “I think companies are going to start responding in ways that they haven’t been pressured to in the past, and that’s huge. ... With more and more responses to what’s happening, I think we’ll be left with change.”

Another piece of the puzzle is men. Male allies are integral in the fight, Sadler said.

“I’d like to hear from more guys, we’re all on the same team at the end of the day,” said Sadler, who noted she’s raising two boys of her own. “You know you look back at red carpet season even a little bit, and a lot of women were finally having this platform to use their voices and that was wonderful. But I would’ve liked to have heard from more men. I would’ve liked that question pointed at the guys. Because, again, we’re all in this together. I would ask men to continue to speak up and if they’re not already, please start.”

Although structural changes are needed to close the pay gap, Sadler said women’s livelihoods are “ultimately up to us.”

“I’m a journalist. I’m educated. I read a lot. But I wasn’t even aware until it happened to me,” Sadler said of the pay gap. “So I think it’s important for everybody, regardless of race or gender ― the guys too ― to invest enough to really become aware. Because at the end of the day, when women make more money, everybody ― society as a whole ― benefits.”Comedian John Mulaney is jealous of “Call Me By Your Name” actor Timothée Chalamet.

In fact, Mulaney devotes a part of his stand-up routine in the Netflix special “Seth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity” to gripe about his wife’s crush on the 22-year-old — or, as Mulaney called him, “The Boy.”

In the routine, part of which appears below, Mulaney talks about how proud he was to learn he was an inch taller than the Oscar-nominated Chalamet, and how he tried to lord that fact over his wife.

Spoiler alert: She wasn’t impressed.

Mulaney, 35, previously mentioned his wife’s crush on Chalamet when he and fellow comedian Nick Kroll co-hosted the Independent Spirit Awards in February.

“You know who’s in love with Timothée Chalamet?” he asked. “My wife, and it hurts my feelings.”

As the segment below shows, Mulaney and Kroll then ribbed the young actor for coming to the event in a shirt that looked like something a gas station employee would wear.

Chalamet referenced the clip when a Twitter user asked him what he thought of Mulaney’s stand-up routine.

yes I️ watched it from the gas station — Timothée Chalamet (@RealChalamet) April 8, 2018

Chalamet’s cool response earned a tweet from Mulaney himself.

Chalamet, I joke ONLY because I am an enormous fan, in awe of your talent, & terrified of my own age and mortality. Also it turns out you are 6’0. Please accept my apology. You’re a good man and we should do the Amazin Race together if you’re free. Im free. https://t.co/oXBoo5Fsjn — John Mulaney (@mulaney) April 8, 2018

Mulaney’s “Amazing Race” reference had at least one person rubbing their palms in anticipation.

AdvertisementKesha puts a queer-inclusive spin on a Janis Joplin hit for “Universal Love,” a new album that reimagines classic love songs for the LGBTQ community.

The singer-songwriter and longtime LGBTQ rights advocate went a step further in the video for “I Need a Woman to Love,” her gender-swapped version of Joplin’s “I Need a Man to Love,” released on Monday. The clip is a compilation of colorful footage that sees Kesha officiating a real-life same-sex wedding at the Bellagio Las Vegas.

The women in the video, Dani and Lindsay, were selected after submitting a heartfelt clip explaining their wish to marry in Vegas. Helping the couple tie the knot, Kesha said, was a “no-brainer.”

Check out the full video below.

“I’ve always been an advocate for equal rights. It’s an issue that is so close to my heart. It is something that is a part of my family, it’s a part of my friends, it’s a part of me,” Kesha explained in a short video posted to Twitter. “When I was approached for this project, I instantly said yes.”

As it turns out, this is Kesha’s third time as a same-sex wedding officiant. The singer, who identifies as bisexual, became an ordained minister in 2012 so she could officiate the 2012 wedding of her pals Monique Morrison and Gretchen Helt in Malibu, California, a year before marriage equality was legally recognized by the state.

In 2015, she presided over the nuptials of her makeup artist, Vittorio Mascecchia, and his longtime boyfriend, Felipe Noquiera.The newest trailer for “Solo: A Star Wars Story” dropped on Sunday, and it takes a line used throughout the franchise and turns it completely around.

“I’ve got a really good feeling about this,” Han Solo says.

The trailer also features a nod to Chewbacca’s age (he’s 190 at the time of this film), shots of a much newer Millennium Falcon in action, and a suave Lando Calrissian declaring, “Everything you’ve heard about me is true.”

“Solo: A Star Wars Story” stars Alden Ehrenreich as Solo, Donald Glover as Lando, and also features Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson and Thandie Newton.For the second time in a week, thieves took off with an ambulance in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The thief apparently took the vehicle for a joy ride on Sunday while paramedics were helping a patient. The ambulance was found crashed and empty a couple of miles away near McArthur Park, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement. Another ambulance was dispatched to help the marooned patient and paramedics.

On Tuesday, while paramedics were transporting a patient into the emergency room of California Hospital Medical Center downtown, a woman climbed into their ambulance and took off. Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol officers pursued her for 40 miles until she pulled over and was arrested.

And on Friday, a separate thief grabbed a police SUV as its occupants were off chasing another suspect. That car thief was later busted.

There appeared to be no connection among the thieves or the crimes.

It’s not uncommon for emergency vehicles to be stolen. But police warn that they can be tricky to drive, and dangerous to drivers, other vehicles and pedestrians for that reason, The Lost Angeles Times reported.

AdvertisementA recent joke on the ABC show “Roseanne” is being criticized as a dig at the network’s highly regarded diverse series “Black-ish” and “Fresh Off the Boat.”

In a scene that ran last Tuesday, Roseanne and Dan Connor (played by Roseanne Barr and John Goodman) talk about what they missed on television after they fell asleep on the couch.

“It’s 11 p.m. We slept from ‘Wheel’ to ‘Kimmel,’” Roseanne says, referring to “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

“We missed all the shows about black and Asian families,” Dan responds ― an apparent reference to “Black-ish” and “Fresh Off the Boat,” which have also run Tuesday nights this season.

“They’re just like us,” Roseanne quips. “There, now you’re all caught up.”

The joke was widely seen as dismissive of the two other shows, which are generally lauded for their representation of voices rarely heard on mainstream television.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, “Roseanne” showrunner Bruce Helford explained that the joke was meant as a commentary on how sitcoms “really want everybody to feel included of all diversities,” which he feels is “kind of a funny thing.”

“When we did the ‘George Lopez’ show, we didn’t want anybody to feel excluded because it was about a Mexican-American family,” Helford said of the 2000s sitcom on which he was an executive producer. “And I don’t think anybody wants to be excluded because it’s [a show about] either a black family or an Asian-American family.”

However, people on social media have not been pleased. They’ve pointed out the value of seeing underrepresented voices on-screen and discussed why the “Roseanne” joke wasn’t a harmless zinger at all. Even restaurateur Eddie Huang, whose memoir loosely inspired “Fresh Off the Boat,” weighed in:

Whats most upsetting about @therealroseanne joke re: @blackishabc and @FreshOffABC is that shes laughing at our condition under the man’s thumb. Networks force reductive black/asian shows, Roseanne has the privilege of being a 🔥 white garbage can. — Eddie Huang (@MrEddieHuang) April 8, 2018

As a fan of Blackish and Fresh Off the Boat, I can say that absolutely no, the point of those shows is not "they're just like us" but that they are dealing with very specific challenges, situations and POVs. This is just a disdainful attempt to silence or disregard other voices. — Ivan (@underthefan113) April 6, 2018

Kelvin Yu, a writer for the animated sitcom “Bob’s Burgers,” laid out why the joke was “belittling” at the least.

Here's why the Roseanne joke about "missing all the shows about Black and Asian families" matters. At the very least, it's reductive and belittling, as if to say those shows are nothing more than "Black" and "Asian" in their existence. 1/9 — Kelvin Yu (@InternetKelvin) April 5, 2018

But the real kicker is when Roseanne says: "They're just like us. There, now you're all caught up." Which implies that the point of any show about a minority family is simply to normalize them. That's it. The stories, the humor, the characters... not important. 2/9 — Kelvin Yu (@InternetKelvin) April 5, 2018

With few shows featuring families of color at all, Yu said that ultimately, the joke perpetuates a dangerously familiar attitude.

Consider what exactly the audience is laughing at. What exactly is the punchline here? I'll tell you what it is: it's an endorsement of dismissiveness and disregard. It's a familiarity and comfort with the culture of objectifying and demeaning people of color. 5/9 — Kelvin Yu (@InternetKelvin) April 5, 2018

Kourtney Kang, a former writer and co-executive producer of “Fresh Off the Boat,” wrote a guest column in The Hollywood Reporter about the sting she felt from Roseanne’s quip. Underneath the “humor,” she noted, is a common message.

“In these jokes, and in the others like these, at the heart of them, whether the joke-teller means it or not, is a divisive spirit,” Kang wrote. “‘Us.’ ‘Them.’ It’s always drawing lines. Separating. Whenever these jokes have been said to me, the thing that is the most hurtful is not the insensitive dullard who said it. There’s always going to be people like that. What hurts the most is when everyone else in the room laughs.”

The joke aired at a time when both diverse sitcoms are facing some obstacles of their own. “Black-ish” creator Kenya Barris is rumored to be looking into an early exit from his ABC contract after experiencing friction with the network. Earlier this year, the network pulled a “Black-ish” episode that dealt with several political and social justice issues, including the right of football players to kneel during the national anthem, Variety reported.

And “Fresh Off the Boat,” the first TV show in more than two decades to feature an Asian-American family, is currently in danger of being canceled. Randall Park, who plays patriarch Louis Huang, recently made a plea to renew the show in a USA Today video.“Black Panther” has officially sailed past “Titanic” to become third in the rankings for America’s top-grossing film of all time.

The Marvel blockbuster overtook James Cameron’s 1997 smash hit on Saturday, when it surpassed $665 million at the domestic box office. It’s now the highest-grossing title at the North American box office after 2015′s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” ($936.7 million), and 2009′s “Avatar” ($760.5 million).

These figures haven’t been adjusted for inflation. Doing that would mean “Gone With The Wind” is the highest-grossing film of all time. But we digress.

“Black Panther” has grossed $1.29 billion worldwide since its release, and people can’t stop showing love for the film. Once news broke that “Panther” had passed “Titanic” at the box office, the praise and snark came rolling in:The FBI raided the office of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen on Monday.

The New York Times reported that investigators are examining records related to a payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, in addition to other unspecified topics.

As part of the raid, agents also reportedly stormed Cohen’s room at the Loews Regency on Park Avenue, where he’d been staying. Agents spent “several hours” combing through the hotel room, per Vanity Fair.

Cohen’s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, confirmed to the Times that the search warrant for the raid originated from a referral by special counsel Robert Mueller. It reportedly isn’t directly related to Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference, however.

“The decision by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary,” Ryan said in a statement to NBC.

“It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients,” he added. “These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.”

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been overseeing Mueller’s investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, approved of having a team other than Mueller’s carry out the action, Bloomberg reports.

The White House has declined to comment to HuffPost. Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. However, Trump called the raid a “disgraceful situation” on Monday afternoon.

Sources familiar with the investigation told The Washington Post that Cohen is being investigated specifically for bank fraud and possible campaign finance violations.

Cohen said he paid Daniels $130,000 days before the 2016 election, reportedly in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement preventing her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. The White House has denied the affair. Last week, Trump said he was unaware of the payment, which has drawn particular scrutiny because it could be seen as a violation of campaign finance laws.

Cohen has been a fiercely loyal adviser to the president. Last September, he told Vanity Fair he’d “take a bullet” for Trump, viewing his role as “the guy who protects the president and the family.”

They have the balls to come here and live off of my money. I pay for their welfare, I pay for their ability to be here. The least they could do, the least they could do is speak English.”But details about any threats to Pruitt are sparse. One supposed threat that was investigated was a postcard to Pruitt with the message: “You ignorant fuck,” according to EPA records. Authorities also investigated two protesters who interrupted a speech by Pruitt.

The EPA said there were “zero records” about death threats in reply to BuzzFeed investigative reporter Jason Leopold’s request for all information.

The Washington Post sought records under the Freedom of Information Act late last year, asking for “copies of all emails, letters, voicemails and other communication in which Administrator Pruitt was threatened with violence or which were otherwise considered to be threatening to the administrator.” The EPA’s answer, dated early December, was “undetermined,” with “no records released.”

The Associated Press reported last week that its “nationwide search of federal and state court records ... found no case where anyone has been arrested or charged with threatening Pruitt.” The EPA did not respond to AP’s request Friday to provide details of “any specific threats or arrests.”

The EPA official in charge of investigating threats ― assistant inspector general for investigations Patrick Sullivan ― would not specify the number of threats that had been logged against Pruitt. But he said in a September interview with E&E News that there were more investigations into threats against Pruitt than for either of his two immediate predecessors.

“Officials launched an investigation after a postcard was sent to Pruitt saying: "You are evil incarnite."”

Sullivan told CNN in November there were “four to five times” more threats against Pruitt than his immediate predecessor, but refused to elaborate.

The EPA requested that Pruitt’s security detail be beefed up soon after he took office. Some $3 million has now been spent on Pruitt’s 20-man round-the-clock protection. In addition, Pruitt’s aides often cite security to justify huge first-class airfare expenses.

The spending is part of a long series of ethical problems plaguing the EPA chief.

Here are some alleged threats against Pruitt that were investigated, according to reports:

― The EPA inspector general in March 2017 investigated a postcard sent to the EPA that said: “Get out while you still can, Scott,” “You ignorant fuck,” and “You are evil incarnite,” according to a report obtained by E&E. EPA investigators discussed the message with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. But they couldn’t identify the author and concluded the message “lacked a clear threat.”

― Another postcard included “an implied threat that contained obscene language,” Sullivan told E&E. “It was not a direct threat.” The U.S. attorney’s office declined to prosecute, and the writer of the message apologized when contacted by federal officials, said Sullivan.

― “Threatening tweets” against Pruitt and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) were investigated in April 2017. The writer told investigators he wrote the “flippant comments” while drinking and watching “The Rachel Maddow Show,” and had no intention of hurting anyone. He apologized, and a U.S. attorney’s office declined to press charges.

― The EPA launched a criminal probe in April 2017 into two female protesters who interrupted a speech by Pruitt. Officials submitted information for misdemeanor charges, but no action was taken.

― The head of the EPA’s Office of Criminal Enforcement told Politico in February that Pruitt’s safety was threatened when people yelled obscenities at him.

Sullivan said investigations had been launched into 40 threats against EPA “personnel and facilities” in 2017, according to E&E. He told NBC a month later the number was 70 investigations.

Three investigations were launched into threats against Pruitt’s predecessor, Gina McCarthy, but none against President Barack Obama’s first EPA chief, Lisa Jackson, according to records. One letter to McCarthy threatened: “We will hurt you and your family.” Sullivan used a version of the same quote as an example of a threat to Pruitt in his interview with CNN.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Díaz wrote an emotional first-person essay for The New Yorker about being sexually assaulted when he was 8 years old.

In the article published on Monday, Díaz describes dodging a question from a fan he met at a book signing who he refers to as “X.” According to Díaz, X confronted the “This Is How You Lose Her” author about the abuse present in his novels and asked if he had experienced it himself.

Díaz wrote that at the time he was wearing a “mask of normalcy” and was “too scared” to answer X, who left the signing disappointed. Díaz said he was haunted by the interaction.

In the essay, Díaz apologizes to X and finally answers the question, despite it being “years too late.” He wrote:

“Yes, it happened to me. I was raped when I was eight years old. By a grownup that I truly trusted. After he raped me, he told me I had to return the next day or I would be ‘in trouble.’ And because I was terrified, and confused, I went back the next day and was raped again. I never told anyone what happened, but today I’m telling you. And anyone else who cares to listen.”

The Dominican-American author, who is also a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also wrote candidly about how the rapes affected his youth, leading to depression and rage. Díaz said the abuse caused him to bite his tongue in his sleep due to nightmares, fall behind in school and attempt suicide.

Later in life, he experienced intimacy problems and had difficulty retaining romantic relationships. It also affected his writing. Díaz cites the rapes as part of the reason for an 11-year gap between his first book, “Drown,” and the novel he won his Pulitzer for, “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.”

“It fucked up my childhood. It fucked up my adolescence. It fucked up my whole life,” he wrote. “More than being Dominican, more than being an immigrant, more, even, than being of African descent, my rape defined me. I spent more energy running from it than I did living.”

Díaz credits hard work in therapy for finally beginning his healing process.Actress Chloë Grace Moretz and rapper Cardi B may seem to have nothing in common ― except cheating allegations surrounding their one-time boyfriends.

“Kick Ass” actress Moretz shared a screenshot of Cardi’s “Be Careful” about an unfaithful partner on Sunday night, hailing her as “the queen.” The song is on the new “Invasion of Privacy” album by the Bronx rapper, who announced over the weekend she’s pregnant.

The day before Moretz’s post, on-again, off-again boyfriend Brooklyn Beckham was spotted kissing Playboy model Lexi Wood at a West Hollywood tattoo parlor. It didn’t take long for fans to do the math.

“You deserve better, girl. Trust me, he will regret in the future,” one fan commented on Moretz’s Instagram. “YOU ARE BETTER WITHOUT HIM.”

“Y’all literally don’t know how, why or when they ended their relationship and whether or not she fell out of love before he did,” another added. “He has every right to kiss anyone (given the consent) even if it’s within a minute they broke up.”

Moretz and Beckham, the son of soccer player David Beckham and Spice Girls singer Victoria, have been linked together since 2014, but have taken breaks in the past.

The actress reluctantly confirmed their relationship in an awkward exchange on “Watch What Happens Live” in September 2016.

“He’s a very good guy. He’s a good person,” Moretz told the podcast’s host, Andy Cohen. “I enjoy hanging out with him.”

After taking some time apart, the two were decidedly back on as of September, and haven’t exactly been shy about their social media PDA since. They’ve laid low in recent weeks, but were photographed kissing in March while celebrating Beckham’s 19th birthday.

“Never Stop Smiling, I Love You, Happy Birthday Brooklyn 🎈♥️,” Moretz captioned a black-and-white photo of him on the big day.

Beckham shared a similarly affectionate post for the actress’ birthday in February, writing, “love you to the moon and back.”

A post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on Feb 13, 2018 at 9:19am PSTA Holocaust survivor says the rise of the American far right under President Donald Trump “feels like 1929 or 1930 Berlin” as Nazis thrived, and “things just go from bad to worse every day,” according to a Newsweek story.

Stephen B. Jacobs, a New York-based architect who designed the Holocaust memorial in Buchenwald, Germany, spoke to the publication ahead of Thursday’s Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Polish-born Jacobs, 79, has lived in America since a few years after being liberated from the Buchenwald concentration camp on April 11, 1945.

Though Jacobs was not yet alive in 1929 or 1930, the Nazi Party’s second largest base of support at that time was in Berlin, after Munich. The party’s Berlin branch was headed by Joseph Goebbels, who later served as minister of propaganda under Adolph Hitler and frequently referred to Jewish people as “negative aspects” who needed to be “eradicated.”

On the growth of the far-right movement and white nationalism in America, Jacobs said, “There’s a real problem growing.”

“Things that couldn’t be said five years ago, four years ago, three years ago — couldn’t be said in public — are now normal discourse,” he said. “It’s totally unacceptable.”

Jacobs terms Trump an “enabler’ of far-right rhetoric,” citing his first-hand knowledge of the president.

“I’m involved with New York real estate, I know this man personally,” he said. “Trump is an enabler. Trump has no ideas. Trump is out for himself. He’s a sick, very disturbed individual.”

The septuagenarian also said he couldn’t quite call Trump a fascist because “you’ve got to know what fascism is” and he doesn’t believe the president “has the mental power to even understand it.”

“We thought our country had changed. In fact, it didn’t. We were operating on a misconception,” Jacobs said.

People thought, ”‘My god, we elected a black president in the United States! Look how far we’ve come!’ We haven’t.”

AdvertisementApple cofounder Steve Wozniak is ditching Facebook.

“Users provide every detail of their life to Facebook and ... Facebook makes a lot of advertising money off this,” Wozniak told USA Today via email. “The profits are all based on the user’s info, but the users get none of the profits back.”

He also told the newspaper that he had deactivated his account, but did not delete it to keep control over his “SteveWoz” screen name.

“I don’t want someone else grabbing it, even another Steve Wozniak,” he said.

Before deactivating the account, Wozniak posted a goodbye message.

“It’s brought me more negatives than positives,” he wrote.

Wozniak is the latest public figure to ditch the social network after a whistleblower revealed that the personal data of millions of users had been improperly shared with a third party.

Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk not only quit Facebook, he also pulled the pages for Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity.

Brian Acton, a cofounder of WhatsApp, urged people to delete Facebook, which bought his company for $19 billion in 2014.

A number of celebrities have left Facebook as well, including comedians Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey.

“We must encourage more oversight by the owners of these social media platforms,” Carrey told CNBC in February, saying he was also dumping his stock in the company. “This easy access has to be more responsibly handled. What we need now are activist investors to send a message that responsible oversight is needed. What the world needs now is capitalism with a conscience.”
