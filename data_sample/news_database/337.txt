Chew on this: A man in China decides he needs to verify if a smartphone battery is legit ― so he bites it?!?!?

It’s a decision that literally blew up in his face, as the now-viral video above demonstrates.

Security camera footage captured Jan. 19 at a store in Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, shows the unidentified man biting into the iPhone battery, presumedly to check its authenticity.

The move quickly proves to be a mistake, as the battery explodes. Amazingly, the man wasn’t seriously hurt in the blast.

Since then, the wisdom in chomping down on a toxic lithium-ion battery has been the subject of some debate.

Taiwan News noted that it’s common for people in China to test the authenticity of gold by biting it, which led Apple Insider to speculate the man somehow thought he could test the authenticity of the battery using the same technique.

Gizmodo rightfully noted that iPhone batteries don’t have much gold in them, but they do contain a lot of toxic items that no one should ingest.

On the rare occasions when a phone explodes, it’s often because the “positive” and “negative” battery plates have become joined, such as if the battery was pierced by a metal object, according to TeamKnowHow.com.

The website points out that lithium-ion batteries, though considered very safe, can explode if they’re overcharged.The fiancee of George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year, said there’s a lot the public doesn’t know yet.

“There’s a lot to come,” Simona Mangiante told The Washington Post. “He was the first one to break a hole on all of this.”

She didn’t give details, but said Papadopoulos would be remembered as the John Dean of the Russia scandal.

Dean was White House counsel for President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal, and ultimately cooperated with prosecutors.

Papadopoulos served as a foreign policy adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. However, after news broke that he was cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators, Trump dismissed him as a “low level volunteer” who had “proven to be a liar.”

Mangiante disputed that in her interview with the Post.

“I know what it means as a young person to do all the efforts you do to build your career and be dismissed as a coffee boy,” she said.

The newspaper reported that Papadopoulos and Mangiante met online last spring and became engaged in September.

In between came Papadopoulos’ July arrest by the FBI.

AdvertisementPENANG, Malaysia – The buzz of a single mosquito flying around Oo Boon Siew’s living room is enough to make his family jump in terror. It wasn’t so long ago that these tiny insects disrupted their tranquil life and nearly killed Oo.

Once a well-travelled education consultant, Oo now lives on the Malaysian island of Penang with his wife and son. His joints frequently swell and ache, a physical reminder of the events that brought him to the edge of death.

Over the course of just a few weeks in 2009, Oo fell victim to a staggering sequence of viruses. First, he was infected with the flu-like dengue fever, fairly common in this part of the world. Then he caught the less common chikungunya, which is similar to and often confused with dengue but can cause disfigurement and disabling joint pain that persists for years. Finally, he caught a more severe strain of dengue and nearly died.

There is no cure for dengue or chikungunya, and both spread via the same two species of mosquito that carry the Zika virus.

Though Oo’s experience was unusual, it illustrates how these mosquito-borne diseases spread on the backs of urbanization, globalization and climate change. Such illnesses, which have expanded across the world increasingly in the past decade, are making inroads into Europe and the Americas, raising fears among experts that outbreaks could become more severe.

The legacy of Oo’s illnesses are still evident in his family’s home. The family always keeps two large cans of insecticide at hand. Oo’s son, Adrian, even decided to research chikungunya for his doctorate.

And then there are the memories.

When Oo first fell ill with dengue, his temperature was so high that he stayed in the hospital for a week. After a couple more weeks, he was sick again ― they thought it was related to the dengue, but his joints were swollen and his eyes hurt. When his temperature spiked, he went back to the hospital and tested positive for chikungunya, which was then sweeping through his neighborhood.

“My hands hurt so much that I couldn’t hold a spoon,” Oo said of his chikungunya. “I couldn’t hold a cup.”

He recovered quickly after the first week of chikungunya, but only weeks later a third mosquito bite delivered a dangerous form of dengue. Oo had never felt so sick. Doctors told him he’d need blood transfusions to keep him strong while the virus raged inside him.

That last fight was the toughest. But at least he recovered. Others have not been so lucky.

As extreme weather events like massive floods and storms become more common, conditions grow more favorable for mosquitoes to breed, and more mosquitoes mean more of the diseases they carry. But some scientists warn it would be simplistic to blame climate change alone for the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases. Instead, they point to a variety of interconnected factors that allow mosquitoes to thrive, including the effects that human activities can have on ecosystems, such as rapid urban construction, deforestation, mass migration and political and economic instability.

Scientists are also concerned that cases of chikungunya, dengue and Zika are being under-reported. Some infected people may have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Nevertheless, these diseases are suddenly more visible than they’ve been in the past.

Dengue is one the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the world, and the World Health Organization says there may be as many as 390 million new cases each year.

The human Zika virus infection, initially endemic in equatorial Africa and Asia, has also expanded its geographical range. In 2007 it emerged in the Pacific region and the Americas as a more serious infection than previously reported.

Also in 2007, chikungunya transmission was reported for the first time in Europe: 197 cases in the Emilia Romagna region of northern Italy. The disease had mostly occurred in Africa, the Americas, the Indian subcontinent and wide areas of Asia. Last year, the WHO reported outbreaks in Italy and France.

In 2013 the disease re-appeared in the Caribbean after 200 years. Since then, local transmission has been identified in 45 countries or territories throughout the Americas, with more than 1.7 million suspected cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization.

Chikungunya went undetected for seven years in Malaysia between 1999 and 2006, which led to speculation it had been eliminated. But it then re-emerged in a reported outbreak in the country’s north, reaching 13,759 reported cases by 2009. The disease now returns in regular outbreaks. Last year, a team of researchers from the University of Malaya (which included Adrian Oo) reported 269 cases, mostly in the north.

Oo Boon Siew is a living testament to the resurgence of chikungunya in his homeland: He holds out his hands, the knuckles swollen even after eight years. He feels pain in his joints about once a month. It’s sometimes worse during the rainy season.

“My son, Adrian, forbids me to complain now that he studies it,” Oo said of the disease. “He explained that for some people it is much worse.”

Adrian, now 25, was taking his high school exams when his father became sick. Those months left such an impression that he decided to study medicine and specifically to research chikungunya.

Chikungunya is more often found in rural areas of Malaysia, but the area where the Oo family lives could hardly be called rural. The picturesque island of Penang has experienced an explosion of new construction in recent years. Building sites now scar a landscape previously thick with forests. This growth benefits businesses and tourists, but also disease-carrying mosquitoes, which thrive in urban environments with numerous construction sites.

Floods are also more common now in Penang, helping to fuel the insect problem.

Oo says he’s never been sick like he was in 2009. “That’s when they started building all around the area where I live, and stagnant water from building sites was a breeding camp for mosquitoes,” he said.

Adrian now forbids his parents from going on runs in the park during the rainy season.

“My wife and I used to go very often. But now there’s no discussion, Adrian feels it’s too dangerous,” said Oo.

Around the world, disease-carrying mosquitoes are developing resistances to the most common insecticides, including those used to fumigate buildings when an outbreak occurs, according to Dr. Low Van Lun, a senior lecturer on tropical diseases at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.

Recent studies have looked at genetically modifying mosquitoes and releasing sterilized males. “But some are afraid it will affect the ecosystem, killing frogs for example, while the long-term consequences are unpredictable and we could be left with only very strong mosquitoes and the consequences of the bite are unknown,” Dr Low said.

For now, Oo is the only one in his family who can laugh at the sight of a mosquito. People who have already had chikungunya or strains of dengue are likely to develop immunities, so he probably won’t get those diseases again. His wife and son are still vulnerable, however.

“They are terrified, but I had everything already, so I’m the only one who’s not afraid,” he said.

Naomi Parker Fraley was 20 years old when she and her younger sister, Ada, went to work at the Naval Air Station in Alameda, California, following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor.

They were tasked with drilling and patching airplane wings and riveting, The New York Times reported. A photographer touring the station snapped a photo of Fraley wearing a red-and-white polka-dot bandana as she worked a vertical turret lathe, and the image was published in newspapers around the country.

The photograph reportedly caught the attention of Miller, who portrayed a flexing, bandana-clad woman in his now-iconic poster.

For years, the woman in the photo was thought to be Geraldine Hoff Doyle, who worked as a metal presser in a Michigan plant during the war.

When Fraley attended a reunion at the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park in 2009, she saw a copy of the photo captioned with Doyle’s name.

“I couldn’t believe it, because it was me in the photo, but there was somebody else’s name in the caption,” she told People magazine in 2016. “I was amazed.”

Scholar James J. Kimble, an associate professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, had also been researching “Rosie’s” true identity and zeroed in on Fraley. He published his findings in a 2016 article in the journal Rhetoric and Public Affairs.

“There is no question that she is the ‘lathe woman’ in the photograph,” Kimble told The New York Times.

Fraley and her sister were among millions of American women who entered the workforce during World War II, filling gaps in the labor force left by men who had gone off to fight. These women fulfilled a range of instrumental tasks, including producing planes and munitions, serving on ration boards, volunteering for the American Red Cross and driving trucks.

A Senate resolution last year designated March 21, 2017 as National Rosie the Riveter Day to honor their efforts.

After her stint at the naval air station, Fraley went on to waitress at a restaurant in Palm Springs and later got married and started a family. Her Facebook page proudly displayed an image of the “Rosie” poster, Fraley smiling and flexing her arm beside it.Neil Diamond, one of the top-selling solo acts of all time, is leaving the stage.

Diamond announced on Monday that he has Parkinson’s disease, which makes it difficult for him to travel and perform.

“It is with great reluctance and disappointment that I announce my retirement from concert touring,” he said in a statement.

Diamond assured fans that they haven’t heard the last from the “Solitary Man” just yet.

“I plan to remain active in writing, recording and other projects for a long time to come,” he vowed.

The disclosure was made just before Diamond’s 77th birthday on Wednesday, and two weeks after it was announced he would receive a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award this summer.

Diamond recorded a string of widely known songs, including his three Billboard No. 1 hits: “Cracklin’ Rose” in 1970, “Song Sung Blue” in 1972 and “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers,” performed with Barbra Streisand, in 1978. Ten other Diamond tunes cracked the Billboard Top 10 including “Sweet Caroline,” “I Am, I Said,” “Heartlight,” “Cherry, Cherry,” “America” and “Girl, You’ll Be A Woman Soon.”

Diamond’s songs have been performed by others as well, with “I’m A Believer” topping the Billboard charts for The Monkees in 1966-67 and “Red Red Wine” hitting the top spot for UB40 in 1983.

Despite his success, Diamond said songwriting never came easily for him.

“You would think that after all these years of writing I would have learnt to do it quickly and gracefully and easily, but it doesn’t seem to work out that way,” he told The Telegraph in 2014. “Every song is different so it doesn’t help me very much to have had years of experience.”

Diamond admitted that he doesn’t actually like the process of writing a new song:

“No, I hate it. I hate it. But all right, nobody told me it was gonna be easy. And so what? I’m a ditch-digger when I’m writing songs. My back hurts? Who cares? I gotta get that ditch dug deep and strong and it’s gotta serve its purpose. There are no short cuts. There are only long cuts. That’s what it is. But I’ve been doing it a long time now. I can’t find another way to make a living.”

Diamond’s Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award caps a career filled with honors. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984 and received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2011.

“Everybody sings to Neil Diamond, no matter how many drinks they’ve had,” President Barack Obama said.

Diamond was also inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

“He was known as the Jewish Elvis Presley,” said Paul Simon, who inducted him. “In fact, in many synagogues across the country, Elvis was considered a bogus Neil Diamond.”

Diamond has kept up an aggressive touring schedule over the years, often selling out large arenas, and was planning to tour Australia and New Zealand in March. Those dates have now been canceled.

Diamond concluded his statement with a reference to “Sweet Caroline.”Actress Constance Wu refuses to bow down to Asian stereotypes.

The “Fresh Off The Boat” star made an impassioned speech at Saturday’s Women’s March in Los Angeles, where she encouraged women to fight fetishization and stereotypes about Asians and opened up about her own negative experiences with men.

““I march today for Asian-American women who have been ignored, or judged or fetishized or expected to be a certain way to fulfill a certain idea of what a sweet girl should be.””

“I march today for Asian-American women who have been ignored, or judged or fetishized or expected to be a certain way to fulfill a certain idea of what a sweet girl should be,” Wu said in her speech. “To that, I say you can be anyone you want to be.”

A Facebook dating app “Are You Interested” released a study in 2013 showing that white, black and Latino men all showed a greater preference toward Asian women. Asian fetishes are typically rooted in the racist stereotypes that Asian women are docile and willing to comply without argument. That stereotype has been immortalized in movies such as “The Barbarian and The Geisha” and “Full Metal Jacket.”

Wu’s speech touched on those problematic stereotypes and pushed for better portrayals of Asians in media.

“That’s why we created the Time’s Up movement for equality and representation across all cultures, background, sexual orientations and abilities ― so that you can feel safe being whoever you want to be,” Wu told the crowd.

Wu told The New York Times in 2016 that her steady work on “Fresh Off The Boat” has given her the privilege to shift her focus “from self-interest to Asian-American interests.” The actress has used her platform to push for modern characterizations of Asians and to bring attention to the differences in the Asian-American experience.The Inn At Lost Creek -- Mountain Village, Colorado

AdvertisementWe have a pretty dysfunctional relationship with the planet. We lap up its resources to provide us what we need or crave, yet many people feel disconnected from the natural world.

It’s this disconnect that Canadian conservationist photojournalist Neil Ever Osborne wants to address. He has spent the last 15 years traveling to some of the world’s most untouched places ― in countries from Canada to Ecuador ― to capture images of a natural world desperately in need of protection.

His aim is to make the environment more accessible by pulling out a common thread in all his pictures: the idea of a quest to find a home, a place to exist and thrive.

“There is lots of doom and gloom surrounding the conversation about the environment,” Osborne said, “but there are still some special places left. My hope is that these images ... a road slashed through a forest, a venerable grizzly bear in its sanctuary, depict our shared yet threatened home with honesty and optimism.”

Keep scrolling to see some of his images and commentary.

“Plastic is so omnipresent in our oceans that our beaches become littered with it after it washes up on shore. As a sea turtle stops to rest during her journey back to sea after nesting, she lies on a plastic bottle, a sign of our polluted and sick home.”

2. A road slices through a forest in British Columbia, Canada

“Our home is divided and fragmented, and as a consequence nature is disconnected. As humanity becomes more and more disconnected with nature we lose the interest in protecting what protects us.”

3. Macaws in Ecuador

“High above one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet, blue and yellow macaws soar above the canopy of Yasuni National Park, Ecuador. Impending pressure from oil and gas threaten the bird’s home, a treasure in the Ecuadorian Amazon, leaving us to question how humanity will manage the last great stands of towering forests.”

The House passed the deal later on Monday, and President Donald Trump signed the bill that same evening, effectively ending the shutdown.

Senators voted 81-18 for a three-week funding measure to reopen the government, with many Democrats saying they felt encouraged by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) assurance over the weekend that the Senate would proceed to an immigration bill soon.

Democrats insisted they weren’t caving, even though they didn’t get what they wanted: an immediate vote on protections for undocumented young people often called Dreamers. But the deal gave them a way out of what could have been a politically damaging shutdown. The promise of a vote on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, although it could be reneged on, is something Democrats didn’t have before. It’s the first time Democrats received a firm deadline for a vote on an immigration bill. And if McConnell doesn’t follow through, Democrats will be able to use this promise to vote against the next spending bill and pin the blame on Republicans.

If McConnell keeps his word, he’ll put Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in a tough spot. There is a DACA bill currently working its way through the House that would deliver on a number of conservative immigration priorities, but it has no chance in the Senate.

If senators are able to pass their own bill, while simultaneously demonstrating that the House bill doesn’t have the votes to pass in their chamber, Ryan will be left with the choice of either putting the Senate bill up for a vote and angering conservatives or holding strong. If he holds strong and doesn’t put the Senate-passed measure up for a vote, he could risk another shutdown and strengthen the Democrats’ argument that another government closure is the fault of Republican obstructionism.

“I don’t think I can guarantee a House outcome but I think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill ― the odds go up in the House,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told HuffPost.

For now, Democrats were happy to end a government shutdown, fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, and functionally not give up any of their leverage.

Although CHIP had bipartisan support, Congress had failed to renew it. Part of the reason is that there were disagreements over how to pay for it, with some GOP proposals undercutting Obamacare in the process.

McConnell reiterated Monday morning that he would move to vote on an immigration bill if the two sides can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open.

“It would be my intention to take up legislation here in the Senate that would address DACA, border security, and related issues as well as disaster relief, defense funding, health care, and other important matters,” McConnell said. “It would be my strong preference for the Senate to consider a proposal that can actually be signed into law, a bipartisan, bicameral group is already negotiating, and I look forward to completion of its work.”

Some Democrats took McConnell’s remarks as a step toward their preferred solution. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said it represented “a path forward that is enormously smoother.”

“I believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,” independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters Monday. “I think he’s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally, particularly this morning ― which was a stronger statement than last night ― it’d be very difficult for him to try to find a way out of meeting that commitment.”

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), however, was not convinced by McConnell’s assurances that he would hold a vote on an immigration bill in the future.

“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” Harris said.

The federal government has been shut down since early Saturday because the Senate didn’t approve a deal on the four-week spending bill needed to keep it open. Forty-four Democrats and four Republicans voted against that bill, with many saying they wouldn’t support anything that didn’t help the 700,000 undocumented young people Trump put at risk of losing deportation protections when he ended DACA. Other lawmakers who voted “no” said short-term spending bills are a bad way to operate the government.

Immigrant rights groups have been urging Democrats to demand Dreamer relief as part of must-pass spending bills since Trump rescinded DACA. Their logic ― based on years of experience ― is that a standalone bill to help Dreamers will languish if it’s not attached to another measure because Republican leaders won’t give it a vote, even if it has the support to pass.

McConnell’s promise convinced some Democrats to switch their vote. But he wasn’t able to make any guarantees about the House, as Ryan previously promised the conservative Freedom Caucus he would not hold immigration votes without support from a majority of the Republican conference.

Trump could also throw the entire deal into disarray. He rejected an offer from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Friday to fund a border wall ― something Democrats have said they would not accept ― in exchange for Dreamer protections, according to Schumer. Since the shutdown, White House officials have said they would not negotiate on immigration issues.

In a speech on the Senate floor announcing that his caucus would vote to move forward, Schumer said he hadn’t spoken with Trump since their Friday meeting at the White House ― before the government shut down. “The great deal-making president sat on the sidelines,” he said.

Dreamer activists called on Democrats earlier Monday to not settle for McConnell’s promise to hold a vote. If they lose DACA ― as an estimated 122 Dreamers already are each day ― they will lose work permits and could be deported.

“Promises won’t protect anyone from deportation because delay means deportations for us,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for the Dreamer-led group United We Dream, said on a call with reporters ahead of the vote.

The Democratic senators who voted against the measure were: Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Patrick Leahy (Vt.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Robert Menendez (N.J.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Chris Murphy (Conn.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).

On the Republican side, Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.) also voted against it.

E! News’ Giuliana Rancic brought up the Time’s Up movement that has dominated the Golden Globes and noted Brie’s support of it. Rancic then said because the movement is so heavily dependent on transparency, she wanted to know Brie’s thoughts on the allegations against Franco.

“I think that above all, what we’ve always said is it remains vital that anyone that feels victimized should and does have the right to speak out and come forward. I obviously support my family,” Brie said.

“Not everything that has been reported is fully accurate, so I think we’re waiting to get all the information. But of course now is the time for listening and that’s what we’re all trying to do.”

News (@enews) January 21, 2018

The 35-year-old actress is married to Dave Franco, younger brother of James Franco. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times reported that five women came forward with accusations of inappropriate or sexually exploitative behavior against the elder Franco.

Franco was accused by four actresses who were students in his acting classes and a filmmaker who considered him a mentor. Two former students say he “stormed off” a movie set when no women would undress unnecessarily for a scene while another said that Franco made it clear that his female students could only further their careers “if we were to perform sexual acts or take off our shirts.” Filmmaker Violet Paley told the LA Times she was pressured into performing oral sex on Franco.

“I feel there was an abuse of power, and there was a culture of exploiting non-celebrity women, and a culture of women being replaceable,” said one accuser.

Christopher Polk via Getty ImagesA 24-year-old appointed to a top position in the White House drug policy office has come under scrutiny in recent days for his scanty résumé and lack of qualifications.

A new Washington Post report reveals that one of Taylor Weyeneth’s few previous jobs ended ignominiously. Weyeneth was “let go” from a New York law firm in 2015 because he didn’t show up to work, the paper reports.

Weyeneth was appointed last year as deputy chief of staff of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, or ONDCP, which coordinates federal drug-control efforts, and questions have recently been raised about his fitness for the role.

Prior to his work for the Trump administration, the only job he’d held since graduating from college in 2016 was working on President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, the Post reported earlier this month. As a high schooler, Weyeneth worked for a family firm that processed health products; and as an undergraduate, he had a job as a legal assistant at the New York law firm O’Dwyer & Bernstien.

The Post’s new exposé over the weekend reported that Weyeneth had fudged details in the résumé he submitted to the government, including the length of time he’d spent at the law firm and as the vice president of his college fraternity.

Weyeneth was “discharged” from O’Dwyer & Bernstien for failing to come to work, a partner at the firm, Brian O’Dwyer, told the paper. He “just didn’t show,” O’Dwyer said.

Weyeneth has been reassigned to “administrative work,” following questions about his background, the Post reported, although he continues to hold the title of deputy chief of staff. A replacement as the office second-in-command is being sought, the paper said.

ONDCP didn’t immediately answer HuffPost’s request for comment.

The reports about Weyeneth have emerged as the opioid epidemic, which Trump declared a public health emergency in October, continues to escalate. Politico reported this month that “virtually nothing of consequence has been done” by the White House to address the crisis, despite Trump’s promises to tackle the “scourge of addiction.”

In fact, the Trump administration is allegedly planning to slash the ONDCP budget by 95 percent, Politico reported.

Last week, 10 Democratic senators signed a letter excoriating Trump for hiring Weyeneth, and for his failure to adequately tackle the opioid crisis.

“You have claimed that the opioid epidemic is a top priority for your administration, but the personnel you have staffing these key agencies ― and the lack of nominees to head them ― is cause for deep concern,” said the lawmakers, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “This crisis knows no bounds, and we are committed to working across party lines with anyone who is serious about addressing this devastating epidemic.”

As the Associated Press notes, ONDCP has no permanent director.Authenticity is certainly paying off for Gus Kenworthy.

The 26-year-old freeskier secured a spot on the men’s slopestyle Olympic team Sunday, making him one of two openly gay men competing for the U.S. at the Winter Games for the first time in history. (Figure skater Adam Rippon is the other.)

The news came just two days after Kenworthy was named a brand ambassador for Head & Shoulders shampoo. The company showed the first television commercial from its “Shoulders of Greatness” campaign starring the Olympian on Jan. 19.

Though the ad shows Kenworthy hitting the slopes, it celebrates the history-making aspect of his achievement and his role as an LGBTQ rights advocate above all else. “My shoulders carry more than my country’s pride,” he says in the clip, hoisting a rainbow flag. “They carry my community’s pride, my family’s pride, and pride in myself.”

The significance of appearing before a rainbow flag in a nationally televised ad isn’t lost on the athlete, who said the campaign “resonated” with his journey.

“Before coming out, I was carrying so much pressure that I put on myself,” Kenworthy, who first opened up about his sexuality in a 2015 interview with ESPN magazine after competing at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, a year prior, said in a statement. “It wasn’t until I made the decision to come out that I was able to release that weight off my shoulders and find the confidence to be myself, which allowed me to perform my best.”

He shared his excitement with fans on Twitter and Instagram.

nothing has made me feel more PRIDE than getting to wave a rainbow flag in a national TV commercial! #ShouldersOfGreatness https://t.co/aL7kfvm2Lf — Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) January 19, 2018

John Brownlee, Head & Shoulders’ brand director, praised Kenworthy as a worthy inspiration for athletes and would-be Olympians.

“He has pushed through personal and social barriers to compete at the highest level … and at his personal best,” Brownlee said in a statement. “We are so excited to be on this journey with him at the upcoming Olympic Winter Games, and we know he will inspire others to shoulder their own greatness, no matter what obstacles they face.”

In addition to the commercial, Kenworthy will star in a new Complex video series that “dives deeper into how he’s been able to shoulder the compounding pressures of being a successful athlete” and explores his coming out journey.

No doubt Kenworthy’s accomplishments put him in a unique position when it comes to influencing the global conversation on queer acceptance. Go Gus!“How many brands are doing things like this? Not many,” Khan told Vogue UK last week upon the initial announcement. “They’re literally putting a girl in a headscarf ― whose hair you can’t see ― in a hair campaign. Because what they’re really valuing through the campaign is the voices that we have.”

Khan also told BBC’s Newsbeat that the latest hair campaign was “a platform for diverse voices and women who don’t fit the very narrow mould of beauty.”

Once the news broke that she would no longer be part of L’Oréal advertising, people on Twitter came to Khan’s defense. They argued that she shouldn’t have to step down over her political opinions and that her departure for holding non-mainstream views would appear to defeat the original purpose of including her.“Dawson’s Creek” turned 20 on Saturday, and while series creator Kevin Williamson says he has no regrets about the show, there’s at least one thing he would have done differently if he were making the teen drama today.

Specifically, Williamson told the Hollywood Reporter he wouldn’t include the student-teacher sexual relationship between Pacey Witter, the character played by Joshua Jackson, and, Tamara Jacobs, played by Leann Hunley.

“If I was writing the show today I probably would not have it in the story,” he said.

The relationship presented some challenges for Jamie Kellner, who was the president of The WB network at that time, Williamson said.

Kellner “didn’t say we couldn’t do it but he was the father figure who would come in and ask, ‘How long is this storyline going to last?’” Williamson said. “We told him six episodes and he responded: ‘OK, that’d be a good thing.’”Last season on “Last Week Tonight,” Oliver tackled the outrageous Equifax data breach , the eye-opening world of corporate consolidation and the painfully misunderstood field of forensic science .

His show’s fifth season arrives Feb. 18. Based on the new trailer above, he expects 2018 to edge even closer to the “Mad Max” reality we’re all secretly preparing for ― but in a way that won’t alarm the children.A K-pop star was born this weekend, and he happens to be gay.

The singer Holland released his first single, “Neverland,” on Sunday to near-unanimous praise from fans and critics. The video for the R&B-tinged ballad, which can be viewed above, shows the singer canoodling with a male love interest on the beach and in a living room. The clip concludes with a tender kiss between the two men.

By addressing his sexuality directly in “Neverland,” Holland sets a new standard as an openly gay male K-pop singer. He may not be the Korean music scene’s first openly queer artist ― singer MRSHLL came out as gay last year, while another singer, Harisu, identifies as transgender. But his video still breaks fresh ground in a genre that continues to lack substantial LGBTQ representation.

Fans around the world were clearly moved by “Neverland,” in spite of the fact that the video received a 19+ rating in Korea because of the same-sex kiss.

Congratulations on "Neverland," @HOLLAND_vvv. From the music to the MV, everything about this release is K-pop at its finest, it just happens to focus around a same-sex relationship. I hope this inspires others. You have my full support: https://t.co/0eMiWthZzN #HollandDebutDay — Jeff Benjamin (@Jeff__Benjamin) January 21, 2018

I admire Holland for his bravery and courage. It takes a lot of guts to be an open gay in a country which is closed minded when it concerns the LGBT+ community. I hope the people of Korea open up their mind to this #HollandDebutDay pic.twitter.com/AXTrTGoybN — . (@ultchanyeolpark) January 21, 2018

John Peery self-identifies as a few things: he’s a straight white male, an actor who goes by the stage name “John Pizza” and, perhaps most importantly, a “RuPaul’s Drag Race” super fan. He and his girlfriend, Candace Thompson, watch the show at viewing parties hosted by Syndicated, their local watering hole in Brooklyn, each week.

“Porkchop is a hometown hero,” he told me at the bar, recalling one of the most famous drag queens from the show’s first season, who hails from Peery’s hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina. “If they were playing the hockey game when we walked in at 7:30, I can guarantee you we wouldn’t still be standing here right now.”

In its tenth season, the reality TV show in which drag queens compete to win $100,000 appears to be going mainstream. After moving from the Logo network to VH1 last year, when it broke viewership records and quickly became the highest-rated original program in its competitive time slot, the show has grown from having a cult-like following into a full-blown pop culture phenomenon, with viewers from all walks of life becoming invested in the queens and their personal journeys.

“Even if some people aren’t here to watch the show, they’re still catching and picking up things about a world they once knew nothing about,” Thompson, who identifies as queer, added. “The language, the culture…it’s making important progress.”

Syndicated is just one of countless venues across New York City and the rest of the country that’s beginning to take notice of “Drag Race.” Gay bars, however, have been hosting weekly viewing parties for years, where guests drink RuPaul-themed cocktails and watch the drama unfold on projector screens, often followed by raucous, live drag shows.

Now, bars and clubs that don’t cater exclusively to the LGBT community have started organizing similar weekly events, inviting straight fans to watch the competition side-by-side with the folks whose art form is responsible for the show’s commercial success.

“Drag Race” viewing parties at non-LGBTQ venues provide an educational opportunity for mainstream society to learn more about queer culture, according to Ariel Italic, a drag queen and member of the nightlife entertainment trio, The Nobodies. Each week, Ariel spends three hours applying makeup and preparing for her hosting gig at Brooklyn Bazaar, where she said a “decidedly mixed crowd” seeks out an immersive experience while watching the show.

“I think for a straight audience who is trying to figure the show out, having queer fans around can be a good way to get insight into how to interpret what’s happening on the screen,” Ariel told me. “Like, rather than having to ask questions, you can watch where everyone else is laughing or booing or cheering, and you can hear what sort of slang from the show they use in casual conversation and what doesn’t make it from the show into the real world. It gives context.”

Fans pour into the Brooklyn Bazaar’s vintage grand ballroom just before “Drag Race” begins at 8:00 p.m., finding their place among a sea of blue and green lawn chairs under fringed chandeliers, with glasses of red wine and draft beer in hand.

Ariel and The Nobodies remain busy throughout the entire night, conducting a game of bingo that correlates with the ongoing episode, cracking jokes and performing lip syncs during the commercial breaks. Straight couples and groups of straight friends often wander into the parties “to see what all the fuss is about,” Ariel said.

“Drag is a way to push people to look at the walls they’ve put up around different parts of gender or sexuality or beauty or whatever else,” she continued. “I hope that as more people get used to drag as a light-hearted, comedic medium full of sparkles and death drops, it can pave a way to the appreciation of the more intellectual and political aspects of drag. There’s a lot of smarts behind the spectacle.”

Mainstream pop culture isn’t the only thing to potentially benefit from the show’s continued prominence. Jee Song, director of events at the Museum of Sex in Manhattan, says ticket sales have been “steadily climbing” since the venue first decided to begin hosting viewing parties last year, describing the success of the weekly event as a “pleasant surprise.”

The Museum of Sex offers a “Drag Race” viewing experience in a club-like atmosphere. A DJ plays top 40 music during commercials as drag queens, fans and party-goers socialize over RuPaul-themed Smirnoff cocktails. When the show returns from a commercial break, everyone temporarily shuts the party down and immediately turns their attention to RuPaul.

Like most other viewing parties, the setting isn’t the typical cliche one thinks of when hearing the term “safe space,” since there isn’t much political correctness about “Drag Race” or the comedy employed by many queens in each episode. Still, the environment is one which allows for wide-ranging conversations to take place, and for straight people to ask questions to LGBT viewers about queer culture — so long as those questions “come from a place of genuine interest,” as Ariel Italic stressed. Song said the museum wanted to create an event surrounding “Drag Race” promoting “positive interactions” between the show’s fans of varying backgrounds and sexual orientations.

“We wanted to create a community where there is no judgement,” Song said about the museum’s decision to host “Drag Race” viewing parties. “It’s like magic: everyone enjoys it ... It seems to be this key to opening up a lot of different doors, and having it all come together in a melting-pot kind of way.”

“‘Drag Race’ taps into the psyche that life can be fun, it can be joyous, and it can be celebrated, no matter who you are,” she added.There are “Avengers: Infinity War” spoilers below. Obviously.

Aw, snap!

Thanos’ deadly finger snap at the end of “Avengers: Infinity War” caused a number of fan-favorite Marvel characters to crumble into ash before our very eyes.

But given the conceit ― Thanos destroyed half the life in the universe with that single snap ― many were left wondering: What happened to everyone off screen?

In an interview with HuffPost on Friday, directors Joe and Anthony Russo revealed the fates of various Marvel characters we didn’t see in “Infinity War.” Did they turn into dust? Are they safe? Are their statuses too spoilery to even talk about?

The brothers prefaced their responses by saying that they would need to censor themselves when it came to certain Avengers and their associates. But without further ado, here are the off-screen characters who died and survived in “Infinity War”:

Howard the Duck (Seth Green)

Status: He’s safe.

Director comments: “He survived,” said Joe.

Thoughts: Howard made appearances in both “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, and it looks like he’s going to have a chance to make it a hat trick in “Guardians 3.”

Jane Foster (Natalie Portman)

Status: Too spoilery.

Director comments: “When we say spoiler, [we mean] potential spoiler,” Anthony clarified after I was a bit shocked they couldn’t comment on Jane.

Thoughts: Whoa, what? Natalie Portman hasn’t been a part of the MCU since “Thor: The Dark World” back in 2013. However, Portman has said she’d be open to returning to the Marvel realm, so maybe a Thor-Jane reunion is on the horizon.

Actor Loki (Matt Damon)

Status: He’s dead.

Director comments: “Did not survive,” said Joe.

Thoughts: Matt Deadman, amirite?

Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)

Status: She’s dead too.

Director comments: “Gone,” said Joe.

Thoughts: Betty Ross was last seen in “Incredible Hulk” (2008), but she was rumored to appear in “Infinity War.” That didn’t happen, and there’s probably not much hope for an “Avengers 4” cameo either since now she’s a pile of dust.

Korg and Miek (Taika Waititi)

Taika Waititi as Korg in "Thor Ragnarok." Marvel and Disney

Status: Too spoilery, but probably still rockin’.

Director comments: “Spoiler,” said Joe.

Thoughts: Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige said there are big plans for “Thor Ragnarok” fan favorites Korg and Miek. We know half of the peeps on the Asgardian ship escaped from Thanos, so it looks this rock guy and that insect/slug thing are going to be around for a while. #SlugLife.

Shuri (Letitia Wright)

Status: Weirdly unknown.

Director comments: “Spoiler,” said Joe.

Thoughts: In interviews, the Russo brothers have mentioned Shuri as a possible replacement for Black Panther, so it doesn’t make sense why they wouldn’t just say she’s OK. But yeah, she’s probably OK.

Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander)

Status: Super dead.

Director comments: “Gone,” said Joe.

Thoughts: Jaimie Alexander wasn’t in “Thor Ragnarok” because of filming obligations for “Blindspot.” The Russos confirmed she won’t be in “Avengers 4” because of obligations to being a mound of ashes.

Ned (Jacob Batalon)

Status: Too spoilery.

Director comments: “Spoiler,” said Joe.

Thoughts: Ned had better be all right. If Peter Parker doesn’t come back, he’s got a whole “Spider-Man” sequel to carry by himself.

Aunt May (Marisa Tomei)

Status: Aunt May is OK.

Director comments: “Safe,” said Anthony.

Thoughts: May probably isn’t going to play a big role, or potentially any role, in “Avengers 4,” but at least we can sleep well knowing she’s not been reduced to powdery residue.

Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o)

Lupita Nyong’o as Nakia in "Black Panther." Marvel and Disney

Status: Unknown, but probably safe because #WakandaForever.

Director comments: When asked why she didn’t appear in “Infinity War,” Joe said, “She’s on missions.” Anthony added, “Yeah, deep undercover.”

Thoughts: We don’t know for sure what happened to Nakia, but the directors said she’s out on missions, so we’re going to accept that and hope for the best.Pink can’t get over that her team in green will make the Super Bowl scene.

The singer, who will be performing the national anthem at Super Bowl LII next month, is doubly thrilled that her Philadelphia Eagles are joining her. The team advanced to the big game Sunday by routing the Minnesota Vikings, 38–7.

“IS THIS FOR REAL?!?!?!” she wrote on Twitter.

The Doylestown, Pennsylvania, native also added some apparent gibberish — but it looked like happy gibberish.

Like the Eagles, Pink keeps winning. Her single “What About Us” is up for a Grammy and her album, “Beautiful Trauma,” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in October and returned to the top 25 for the week of Jan. 20.Democrats insisted they weren’t caving, even though they didn’t get what they wanted: an immediate vote on protections for undocumented young people often called Dreamers. But it gave them a way out of what could have been a politically damaging shutdown. And the promise, although it could be reneged on, is something that they didn’t have before. It’s the first time Democrats received a hard date for a vote on an immigration bill. And if McConnell doesn’t follow through, Democrats will be able to use this promise to vote against the next spending bill and pin the blame on Republicans.“I was just curious and I wanted to learn and I saw all these people around me making music, writing songs and being so free,” Cabello told the Times. “I just wanted to do that and it did not work.”

The artist said she attempted to work on her solo album and remain within the group, but “the other members shut her out instead.”Proclaiming Jerusalem the true capital of the state of Israel, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the U.S. intends to open a new embassy in the city before the end of 2019.

“The United States has chosen fact over fiction,” Pence said during a speech Monday addressing Israel’s Knesset, or parliament.

He reiterated the U.S.’s commitment to “lasting peace” between Israelis and Palestinians, noting that President Donald Trump’s administration won’t take a position on any status issues and reaffirming that it will support a two-state solution as long as both sides can agree. He urged the Palestinian leadership to return to the negotiating table.

“I bring greetings from a leader who has done more to bring our two countries together than any leader in the last 70 years,” Pence said. “Thanks to the president’s leadership, the alliance between our two countries has never been stronger. I am here to convey a simple message from the heart of the American people: America stands with Israel.”

Israeli-Arab members of the Knesset protesting the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital were escorted out after heckling Pence at the start of his speech.

Officials on both sides have floated widely differing timelines since last month’s announcement of the embassy move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he thought it could happen this year. Trump disputed that in an interview with Reuters last week.

“By the end of the year? We’re talking about different scenarios — I mean obviously that would be on a temporary basis,” Trump said. “We’re not really looking at that. That’s no.”

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson estimated that the move was “probably no earlier than three years out, and that’s pretty ambitious.”

Pence didn’t mention whether the State Department plans to construct a new building or move into an existing one, but media reports last week indicated that the U.S. may just retrofit a building the government already owns in West Jerusalem.

Trump officially declared Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December, breaking with decades of U.S. foreign policy. The move was met with protests across the Middle East and Asia. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced that he no longer accepted the U.S. as any kind of mediator in peace talks with Israel.

In response, the U.S. decided to withhold $65 million in aid to Palestinians.Sterling K. Brown has made award show history yet again: He took home the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama on Sunday night, becoming the first black actor to win in the category.

Brown won the SAG Award for his role as Randall in NBC’s “This Is Us,” a role that helped the a make Golden Globes history earlier this month. There, he won Best Actor in a Television Series, Drama, becoming the first black man to win the category in the ceremony’s 75-year history.

These back-to-back historic wins weren’t even the first for Brown. In the fall, Brown was also the first black actor to win the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series since 1998.

Accepting his SAG Award, Brown talked of the blessing it is to “do what you love for a living,” shouted out the acting profession, and thanked his respective families, on and off the screen.

“What an honor it is to be recognized by your peers for a job well done,” he said. “This room is a source of endless inspiration for me. I love all of you. People call us weird and strange; the truth of the matter is everybody’s weird and strange, and we just embrace ourselves for who we are.”

The actor then thanked wife Ryan Michelle Bathe, calling her “the best scene partner a brother has ever had.”

“To my glorious cast of ‘This Is Us,’ you feed me day in, day out,” Brown added.

“You raise the bar. To my white family, which thankfully is nothing like the family from ‘Get Out,’ I love you. To my TV wife, Susan Kelechi Watson, let’s keep on repping for the people. To the two young actors that play Randall, to Lonnie [Chavis] and Niles [Fitch], thank you for making the work so easy and so seamless.”

He also added that, as an actor, “fame won’t sustain you, money won’t sustain you. The love — keep that love alive. It will keep you going.”

Fans and friends on Twitter are loving the Sterling K. Brown moment that we’re all just living in.
