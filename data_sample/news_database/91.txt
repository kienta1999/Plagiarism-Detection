Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has taken aim at U.S. President Donald Trump once again, this time with the help of a clothing design.

On Friday, Fox shared a photograph on Twitter of himself wearing a new Trump-trolling T-shirt:

Thank you for all your support! @centrofox was built on the foundation of empowering leaders to take charge and give back to their communities. Help me continue to spread the message of compassion for others, by getting this apparel at https://t.co/lRhyRIWF1m pic.twitter.com/3lVcGyTLjx — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) April 6, 2018

Its design depicts Trump as a baby who is making a wall from toy bricks. The slogan reads: “Can’t Build A Wall If Your Hands Are Too Small.”

Fox has long criticized Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Fox also shared a link to the Represent.com online clothing store from where the $24.99 T-shirt could be bought until early Saturday. Pullover hoodies and long-sleeve tees featuring the same design were also available.

The products no longer appeared to be available to purchase, as of early Saturday, with the site noting the “campaign has finished.” However, as of April 11, the campaign was open again with a countdown clock indicating it would last only 12 more days.

“This isn’t just about the wall, it’s about ACCEPTANCE, EQUALITY and INCLUSION of all people!” the items’ listings stated. It added that all proceeds would go toward Fox’s Centro Fox Foundation, which it said is “working towards the formation of compassionate leaders for creating a better world.”

Earlier on Friday, Fox warned American farmers that they would be the ones who suffer if Trump renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement and a trade war breaks out between Mexico and the U.S.

“You better speak up, because this guy is taking you to nowhere,” Fox told “Morning Joe.”

This story has been updated to note that the apparel was available for purchase again for a limited time.Bill Maher came out fighting for beleaguered school teachers on Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time,” and he managed to mock President Donald Trump’s two eldest sons in the process.

The comedian acknowledged that he wasn’t the biggest fan of children, and joked that him “sticking up for kids” was like Vice President “Mike Pence fighting for gay adoption.”

But children are “the future,” said Maher, who then broke down why educators in various states are currently protesting for increased public school funding.

“There is a revolt brewing in the teachers lounge these days in schools all across this country, and it’s long overdue,” said Maher. “Teachers are tired of being told of what (former GOP vice presidential candidate) Sarah Palin once said of a teacher, that ‘her reward is in Heaven.’ Maybe, but the rent is due here on Earth.”

Maher proposed that instead of giving teachers guns, the country should give them a living wage and said that “as much as I can’t stand to be around them, I would rather American children be well educated, productive, contributing citizens.”

“As opposed to what they otherwise might become, useless burdens on society,” he added, as a photograph of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. flashed on the screen.

Andrew Wheeler, President Donald Trump’s pick for the Environmental Protection Agency’s No. 2 job, has secured two Democrats’ support ahead of his planned Senate confirmation vote on Monday.

Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), one of just two Democrats who voted for the nomination of now-embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt last year, told HuffPost she plans to approve the former coal lobbyist, who rejects the science behind climate change. If confirmed, Wheeler would be next in line to take over the agency if Pruitt caves to mounting pressure to resign.

“After meeting with Mr. Wheeler and reviewing his record, I’ve decided to support his nomination,” Heitkamp told HuffPost by email Friday evening. “I believe he’ll be open to working on issues important to North Dakota in a pragmatic and fair way, and I’ll hold him accountable to make sure he implements the mission of the EPA in a way that works for my state.”

On Monday, a spokesman for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the other Democrat who had voted for Pruitt’s nomination, said he would also vote to confirm Wheeler. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the only GOP senator to vote against Pruitt last year, did not respond to requests for comment.

“Andrew Wheeler will bring extraordinary credentials to EPA that will greatly assist the agency as we work to implement the president’s agenda,” Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, told HuffPost. “We appreciate Senator Manchin and Senator Heitkamp’s support.”

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted 11-10 along party lines in February to advance Wheeler’s nomination. But the Senate has yet to schedule a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) filed cloture on March 23, and a vote is expected by Monday night.

The vote comes as Pruitt faces more calls to step aside over accusations of corruption and wasting taxpayer money. A flurry of scandals broke last week involving his spending, housing arrangement and imperious management of his agency. Environmental groups, hoping for Pruitt’s resignation, seized an opportunity to tank Wheeler’s nomination, effectively crippling leadership at an agency that has been the speartip of the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda.

The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters called on their members last week to pressure senators to reject Wheeler’s nomination. They highlighted a February report from The Intercept that revealed Wheeler had hosted fundraisers for Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) five months before his formal nomination and two months before his first White House interview for the job. The groups hoped to draw parallels between the fundraisers and the firestorm over Pruitt’s sweetheart deal to rent a $50-a-night room in a luxury condo owned by the wife of a fossil fuel lobbyist with business before the EPA.

Until mid-2017, Wheeler worked as a lobbyist for Murray Energy, the mining giant owned by coal magnate Bob Murray. Murray, a top Trump donor and bombastic political commentator, has wielded staggering influence at the White House. He provided the Trump administration with an “action plan” that called for a federal bailout of coal-fired plants, repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and a challenge to the 2009 EPA “endangerment finding” that determined carbon dioxide pollution poses a risk to public health.

“I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but what’s not completely understood is what the impact is.” - Andrew Wheeler

Democrats hammered Wheeler over his record of working for Murray at a confirmation hearing in November. But they largely glazed over Wheeler’s refusal to accept the overwhelming consensus among scientists that burning fossil fuels are the chief cause of climate change.

“I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but what’s not completely understood is what the impact is,” Wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when confronted with the findings of the federal government’s latest climate report.

Wheeler, who served as an Inhofe aide and counsel to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the mid-2000s, has also faced accusations of abusing his power to target political opponents. In 2005, Wheeler worked with Inhofe to demand tax documents from the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials and its sister group, State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, after the nonpartisan groups opposed a controversial greenhouse gas emission bill Inhofe supported. In February, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability and transparency watchdog, told HuffPost the 13-year-old tax probe “raises serious concerns as to Wheeler’s judgment.”

Pruitt’s future at the agency remains uncertain. Trump has bucked White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s pleas to fire Pruitt, tweeting praise for the administrator and saying he was “under siege” from reporters on Friday. But even if Pruitt remains, he reportedly has ambitions to run for governor or U.S. Senate in his home state of Oklahoma, or take over the Department of Justice if Trump fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Trump denied reports that he was considering Pruitt for the top cop position.) That raises the chances that, at some point, Wheeler could take over the EPA.

“Wheeler has his own record of corruption that must be investigated,” John Coequyt, Sierra Club’s senior director of federal policy, said in a statement. “Anyone who cares about protecting our communities, protecting taxpayers, and trying to maintain a transparent, accountable government will demand new hearings on Andrew Wheeler and demand the EPA start doing its job to protect the public once again.”Fox News host Sean Hannity cranked up his days-long pitched battle with late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel on Friday, calling him a “sick, twisted, creepy, perverted weirdo” on his program.

“Tonight we’re going to pound him with his own words. ... I have just had it with the utter hypocrisy,” Hannity said in vicious 22-minute on-air attack on Kimmel. He also called the comedian “perverted,” “a racist bigot,” “a self-righteous, sanctimonious social justice warrior” and “Harvey Weinstein Jr.” on the program or on Twitter earlier in the day.

“We’re throwing down the gauntlet on this show,” Hannity said, adding later, “It’s going to end when he apologizes to Melania Trump.”

The feud began Wednesday when Hannity blasted Kimmel for joking on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Monday about the first lady’s accent while she read a children’s book at the White House Easter Egg Roll. Hannity ripped Kimmel as a “despicable disgrace” and called him an “ass clown” on Fox.

Kimmel fired back Thursday, blasting Hannity’s hypocrisy, given his support of harsh immigration laws even though the first lady is an immigrant. He called Hannity the “whole ass circus.” He added: “This is the guy who defended the multiply-alleged pedophile Roy Moore, and I’m a despicable disgrace?” What’s really disrespectful to the first lady, said Kimmel, is “cheating on her with a porn star after she has a baby.”

Hannity featured clips Friday from Comedy Central’s “The Man Show,” which ran from 1999 to 2004 and satirized crude male behavior. The program was co-hosted by Kimmel. In one clip, Kimmel asked women on the street to guess what was in his pants and made suggestive comments. Kimmel appeared in another clip in blackface pretending to be former NBA player Karl Malone.

Kimmel took the bashing in stride, laughing off the “pervert” insult from someone “slobbering” over Donald Trump, Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly (Ailes and O’Reilly were ousted from Fox News for sexual harassment), and former

Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama.

Dear @SeanHannity thx for the trip down Man Show memory lane.

Hannity’s on-air attack followed several increasingly heated tweets between the men.

“I’m just excited Sarah finally gets to go to prom,” comedian Michelle Wolf joked to The Daily Beast ― in reference to the news that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would represent the Trump administration at the head table at the April 28 event.

Trump himself will not attend, for the second year in a row.

The White House Correspondents’ Association hosts the annual shindig traditionally frequented by journalists, celebrities and the president. Margaret Talev, the association’s president, confirmed via a tweeted statement on Friday that Trump is planning to skip this year’s event:

Statement on President and WHCA Dinner pic.twitter.com/WiemgnIvcq — WHCA (@whca) April 6, 2018

“The White House has informed us that the president does not plan to participate in this year’s dinner but that he will actively encourage members of the executive branch to attend and join us as we celebrate the First Amendment,” Talev wrote.

Trump has repeatedly attacked the media, and often dubs news outlets that report critically on his administration as “fake news.” In 2011, former President Barack Obama and comedian Seth Meyers both used their speeches to poke fun at then-reality TV personality Trump.

Democrats’ shot at taking control of the U.S. House of Representatives just got slightly better, according to a new analysis of polling data conducted by The Cook Political Report.

Cook announced Friday that it had changed its ratings in 13 congressional districts. In all of the new ratings, Democrats are more likely to either flip a Republican seat or hold onto one controlled by Democrats.

None of the changed ratings show Democrats taking a seat that Cook previously predicted would remain in Republican hands. Instead, they are changes regarding the likelihood that Republicans or Democrats will hold a seat.

For example, the polling numbers cruncher changed its rating for Washington’s 5th Congressional District from “Likely Republican” to the more tenuous “Lean Republican.”

It’s notable that Republicans’ hold on that district, which consists of a rural swath of Eastern Washington state, has slipped even modestly. Republicans undoubtedly do not want to have to spend money defending a seat represented by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-highest-ranking Republican in the House.

What’s more, Washington’s 5th is usually reliably Republican. President Donald Trump won in the district by 13 percentage points.

Cook’s ratings changes are especially remarkable because they coincide with a modest increase in Trump’s approval rating. The percentage of Americans who approve of Trump’s performance ticked up from 38 percent at the beginning of January to 40 percent in April, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average.

And while Democrats maintain a lead of more than 8 percentage points on the generic congressional ballot, it has fallen considerably since late December, when polling showed their edge reaching well into double digits.

The trouble for Republicans is that those are still significant advantages for Democrats. A 40 percent approval rating is quite low for a sitting president less than a year and a half into his tenure.

Add to the mix a historic number of Republican retirements ― 36 so far, according to Cook ― and much higher enthusiasm among Democratic voters, and it is easier to see why Cook continues to view Democrats as “slight favorites for House control.”WASHINGTON ― The federal government on Friday seized Backpage.com as part of a law enforcement crackdown on the classifieds website that had come under fire because of its use as a marketplace for sex work.

A federal grand jury indictment that had been expected to be unsealed on Friday evening remained sealed as of Saturday morning, but an attorney for Michael Lacey ― the former editor of the Phoenix New Times and the founder of Backpage.com ― confirmed to the Arizona Republic that his client was one of those named in the 93-count indictment. FBI officials in Phoenix confirmed earlier on Friday that they had raided Lacey’s home.

The Republic reported that the home of Jim Larkin, the former publisher of New Times, was also the scene of an FBI search. The total number of defendants named in the sealed indictment is not currently public information.

A message on Backpage.com said the website had “been seized as part of an enforcement action by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, with analytical assistance from the Joint Regional Intelligence Center.”

The shutdown of Backpage has already caused a major stir, particularly on Twitter. Many Backpage users and their allies are discussing the financial ramifications of the move, including the loss of funds used to purchase ad space on the site, with more than a few individuals worried about refunds.

Craigslist and Reddit shut down personal ads after the Senate passed a bill that gave sex trafficking victims and prosecutors more power to sue sites that allow sex trafficking ads. One recent paper argued that online adult classified ads helped save lives, tying a drop in female homicides to the creation of Craigslist’s “erotic services” section.

AdvertisementWhen Phoenix called to chat about his new movie on Thursday, I expected the same terse energy he’s now famous for. What would it take to get this stoic oddball to laugh or say something nice, I wondered. As it turned out, it didn’t take much at all. Phoenix was jovial from the jump, even apologizing for our delayed start time. He needed to scarf down some lunch before we chatted, and who can begrudge a person that?

Phoenix is starring in the new movie “You Were Never Really Here,” directed by Scottish mastermind Lynne Ramsay, whose visceral mood pieces (“We Need to Talk About Kevin,” “Morvern Callar,” “Ratcatcher”) have earned her a reputation as one of today’s sharpest filmmakers. Ramsay has found an ideal muse in Phoenix, who also gravitates toward raw character studies (“The Master,” “Her,” “We Own the Night”). Here, he plays a scruffy, taciturn, PTSD-stricken war veteran hired to rescue young girls from sex-trafficking rings and other gritty circumstances. Even for an actor who seems to give his entire body over to roles ― Commodus’ creepy lilt, Johnny Cash’s twitchy arrogance, Freddie Quell’s hunched gait ― “You Were Never Really Here” requires a nimble balance between dogged resolve and emotional vulnerability. You feel it in his movements.

Maybe that’s why Phoenix was so chipper: After taking a couple of years off, he’s working with a director he adores and has three other promising projects on the horizon (“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot,” “Mary Magdalene” and “The Sisters Brothers”). Phoenix and I discussed a smattering of topics, including why he doesn’t think you should call Robert De Niro “Bob,” that Joker movie he’s rumored for and maybe not knowing what Valentine’s Day is.

It seems like you’re doing more press than usual for this movie. Does it feel that way to you, too?

Ummm [laughs]. Let’s see. I have done some things that I haven’t done before, some TV stuff. Yeah, I think I have.

Are you finding yourself warming to the press cycle more this time than you have with previous movies?

[Pause] I don’t know. I don’t know what it is. I’ll tell you what it is. There were a couple of things. I went to Berlin with Gus Van Sant, actually, for [“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot”]. I was with him when he did some interviews, and the way he talked about things seemed nice to me. I think part of it is just that I’ve found the opportunity to have conversations with people instead of doing, like, an interview. And I enjoy that. I guess maybe I like talking to other people about movies.

We like hearing you talk about movies, so we want you to like the conversations that we subject you to.

[Laughs]

When other actors refer to you in interviews, they often call you Joaq. Do a lot of people call you Joaq?

Ummm, I don’t know. How often do you say your friend’s name? You know what I mean? It’s not very often, is it?

Right, I guess that’s true, but I think you have a general sense of what individual people call you, particularly when it’s something other than your given name. But maybe you don’t keep a mental catalog of Joaq versus Joaquin versus whatever else people might call you.

Yeah, I think it’s probably even... yeah. But I don’t like it when people say Bob instead of Robert when they’re talking about De Niro. It drives me crazy. Don’t call him that. You know?

So you call him Robert?

Well, I don’t call him. But if I was referring to him, yes, I would say — I don’t know what I’d say. I’ve actually never thought of it.

But what if Robert De Niro likes being called Bob?

Yes, that’s right. That’s totally up to him. You’re absolutely right. What if I kind of sat him down and said, “Listen, man, I don’t think you should let people call you Bob. I don’t know whether you’re comfortable with this or not, but it makes me uncomfortable, so if you could please put an end to that.”

You really should do that. Robert is a more sophisticated name than Bob. Who wants to be Bob? [Editor’s note: No offense to all the great Bobs out there.]

But you’re right. Maybe he does.

It feels like people who call you Joaq are the ones who really know you. The ones in the inner sanctum get to say Joaq, and the rest of us are just Joaquin.

I mean, really, whatever. Whatever you want.

Does anyone still call you Leaf? [Editor’s note: When Phoenix was a teen actor, he used Leaf as his first name because most of his siblings’ monikers were inspired by nature: River, Rain, Summer and Liberty.]

No. No. That’s been a very long time.

And if they did, you would promptly correct that, I assume.

I mean, it just hasn’t been my name. You know that I was born Joaquin, right?

Yes, I do know that.

But, yeah, it hasn’t been my name, and it’s funny because I was talking to Gus recently about it. I remember when I did “To Die For,” because I’d always been credited as an actor as Leaf, and he was like, “So are you officially changing it?” It just hadn’t even occurred to me because this is my name — I was just reverting to my original name. But I remember that, for other people, it felt like there was a change. But it had been changed for me prior to that for so long.

So you never had a latter-day moment where you thought, “Man, I should have kept Leaf as my professional name”?

I haven’t thought that. Why, is that your suggestion?

No, I like Joaquin. Leaf is a conversation starter, as in, “How did you and/or your parents arrive at the name Leaf?” But I do really like the name Joaquin. That’s a unique name ― not that Leaf isn’t also.

Yeah. It’s not in Central America.

Oh, that makes sense. I spoke to Lynne Ramsay earlier, and she said when you two first discussed the movie you could only understand 50 percent of what she was saying and weren’t quite sure what you were agreeing to.

It’s very fun to think about it that way. But it is true that, when I first spoke to her on the phone, it was difficult to understand everything that she had said.

Having just spoken to her on the phone, I can relate to that, yes.

Yeah. So it was a bit of a struggle, but once you’re with her in person, then you get it.

I assume you at least knew you would potentially get cast in this movie?

Yeah, I read the script before I talked to her. I’m pretty sure that’s what happened, yeah.

I know you haven’t seen the movie and don’t watch your own material. Even having lived and breathed this character, is it hard to do the press cycle because you don’t really know what the finished result looks like?

I don’t know, sometimes we get into talking about certain details and I’ll explain the process for a particular take or scene, and the journalist will go, “What is that?” And I say, “The scene in the movie.” So there are times when I don’t know what take she used. Today we were talking about this scene that, for me, revealed a lot about the character and his relationship with [a hammer that’s essential to the story]. I didn’t know if that was the take that she used or if she used another take, and it turned out that it was that take. So I guess it makes sense in some ways that the take that felt the most meaningful to me, and the one that to me revealed the most about the character, was the one that’s used. But I didn’t really know.

The way this character moves through the streets feels like a dance with the camera, almost like you’re finding your way in and out of cars and buildings in an improvisational style. The camera often sits in unconventional spots, and you’re figuring out the territory of the New York City streets you’re traveling.

Yeah, that is a reflection of the experience. I don’t know that we ever really did any take the same way twice. We might have, and there might be some situations where it’s pretty clear that there’s no other choice but to cross the street here at this moment, but I think that our approach to each moment was to not make any concrete decisions about it in advance. We would talk about different options, different possibilities, but it wasn’t until we got into the space — we would make decisions in the moment, and sometimes there are things I’m reacting to in the moment. There are times when other actors didn’t know what was going to happen because we didn’t know what was going to happen in that moment. And I think I probably like that way of working in general, but I think it was probably really applicable to that character and this experience. Maybe that’s why it worked for us.

Where are you right now? I hear screeching in the background.

Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. I was just doing an interview at Chateau Marmont and there’s a pool and there are kids. Is it terribly distracting to you?

No, no, no, it’s fine. I just wanted to make sure you were somewhere safe. I thought there might be cats howling.

Thanks, I’m safe.

Good. Are you aware of how much the internet loves the photo of Rooney Mara smoking a cigarette on the set of “Mary Magdalene” while you are nailed to the cross?

I am not aware of that.

Have you seen this photo?

I believe that I have seen that photo a long time ago. I think [director Garth Davis] sent it to her. I think.

It’s an amazing photo. I realize you were just in between shots on a scene, so the whole thing is probably very commonplace for you. But can you narrate the photo for me? The imagery of you as Jesus on the cross and her casually smoking a cigarette as Mary Magdalene in the middle of the day is great.

Is it sacrilegious?

In the best possible way, maybe.

[Laughs] Um, well, I don’t know. Honestly I’m not entirely sure, but what I imagine is once I went up I stayed up. So I imagine that — I don’t know. Honestly I don’t know when that happened, so I couldn’t tell you.

Joaquin Phoenix in "Her." Warner Bros.

The distribution rights for that movie are tied up with The Weinstein Co., which filed for bankruptcy. Is that frustrating?

Well, yeah, of course. I mean, yeah. I don’t know when it was going to come out. I don’t know if it would have been by now, anyways. I’m not entirely sure. I usually stay out of that stuff, like when a movie is going to be released and how. I usually don’t pay attention to it, and I thought that that was going to be worked out. We always knew it was going to be released in Europe before, so I don’t know when it’s coming out here.

Tell them to hurry. I want to see it. I want to ask about something you said a year ago. I know you’re being asked in just about every interview whether you’re going to play the Joker, and I’m not going to ask that exact question, but I do want to point to something you told Bret Easton Ellis in The New York Times. You said, “Something that’s going to demand six months of my time? I don’t know.” Even beyond actually making the movie, you’d have a grueling press cycle to follow. Are you rethinking your willingness to make those sorts of long-term commitments?

I don’t really know why I said that to him because I don’t really think about movies in terms of, like, the commitment of time. I think I was just trying to be funny or something. When you feel drawn to participate in a film, my feeling is no matter what, under any circumstances, wherever we’re shooting, whatever the hours are, whatever I have to do to be a part of this, I’m willing to do it. I don’t really make decisions on, like, what’s going to be the most comfortable. “What season is it going to be? Am I wearing comfortable clothing?” These are not the considerations, usually. I don’t know what that is. Recently I made a movie that took us four months and another one that was less than five weeks. And they both were fulfilling and difficult in their own way. But I think when you’re drawn to something, it doesn’t really matter the circumstances.

Darren Aronofsky did want you to play Batman once.

I’m sorry, what?

Darren Aronofsky once wanted you to play Batman in an adaptation he described as “Travis Bickle meets ‘The French Connection,’” which actually sounds like an apt description of “You Were Never Really Here.” That was before the superhero craze that we’re inundated with now. Did you and Darren talk about that project?

I feel like this is the first I’m ever hearing of this.

Really? This was before the Christopher Nolan series. As he tells it, Aronofsky pitched Warner Bros. on an unconventional, less heroic Batman. He says he wanted you for the role, but I don’t know if the negotiations got far enough for you to actually join the discussions. The studio rejected the idea because it was too dark, of course.

[Laughs] Yeah, I don’t know about this, but certainly there was no real discussion. And if he mentioned it to me one time, I think that I would have remembered. But I don’t remember that ever happening. It sounds interesting, though.

Yeah, I’d love to see that version of Batman. Had that come to fruition in the late ’90s, and let’s say you still did “Gladiator” in 2000, those two movies together would have really elevated you to a certain celebrity status that you seem to have never been chasing.

Well, thank God it didn’t happen that way then.

Do you see “Gladiator” as a big turning point as far as your fame is concerned?

I mean, certainly it was. It was the most successful movie that I’ve been in at the time, and maybe still is. [Editor’s note: “Signs” is his most successful movie.] And absolutely it changed my career, but also, as an actor, working with Ridley Scott, I learned a lot making that movie. It is an important film for me as an actor. That’s really all I know about. I understand that it was successful and people still talk about that movie, but really, as an actor, it had an impact on me.

Did you and Mark Walhberg ever have actual conversations about what it would have been like for the two of you to star in “Brokeback Mountain”?

No.

Are you aware that you were attached to that role at some point, given you aren’t aware of the Batman thing?

No, I wasn’t.

The internet would beg to differ.

Oh, really? No, I was never attached to that role, and I didn’t know that Mark was in consideration for it either. But I met on that movie — I met with Ang Lee, but I didn’t get the job.

OK, gotcha, but you were out there somewhere in terms of the casting process.

Oh, yeah, I don’t think there was an actor of my generation that was working that didn’t want to make that movie. I certainly wanted to be in that film, but it didn’t work out.

So do you really not know what Valentine’s Day is? What does Rooney think of that?

You’d have to ask her. But I think I was just trying to have some laughs with Will Ferrell. [Editor’s note: A representative for Rooney Mara did not respond to our request for comment.]

Are you a Garry Marshall fan?

Uhhhh. Oh! Sure. Yeah, Garry’s amazing. He made those movies, right?

Yeah, “Valentine’s Day,” “New Year’s Eve,” “Mother’s Day.”

Right, right, right. This feels like Teen Beat. It feels like it’s 1985 and we’re doing Teen Beat asking me about Valentine’s Day [laughs].

Do you have fond memories of the Teen Beat interview days?

I don’t think I was ever — I remember being aware of Teen Beat, but I don’t think I ever did any interviews for Teen Beat. But for some reason I remember C. Thomas Howell looking awesome in a hat or some shit.

That’s amazing. I’ll wear that as a badge of honor.Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warns of the growing risk of worldwide fascism emboldened by Donald Trump’s “scorn” for democracy in a scathing New York Times op-ed.

The essay set off a furious debate on Twitter.

“Fascism — and the tendencies that lead toward fascism — pose a more serious threat now than at any time since the end of World War II,” Albright writes in the op-ed, titled “Will We Stop Trump Before It’s Too Late?” She decries mounting nativist and extreme right-wing movements around the globe, along with the growing threat of despotism. A key enabler, she argues, is America’s unleashed president.

“The possibility that fascism will be accorded a fresh chance to strut around the world stage is enhanced by the volatile presidency of Donald Trump,” Albright warns.

“Instead of standing up for the values of a free society, Mr. Trump’s oft-vented scorn for democracy’s building blocks has strengthened the hands of dictators. No longer need they fear United States criticism regarding human rights or civil liberties. On the contrary, they can and do point to Mr. Trump’s own words to justify their repressive actions,” she adds.

Albright blasts Trump’s withdrawal from historic, positive international coalitions, his philosophy of every nation for itself, and his disdain for civil discourse, equality, human rights and democratic institutions.

Trump has “attacked the judiciary, ridiculed the media, defended torture, condoned police brutality, urged supporters to rough up hecklers and ... equated mere policy disagreements with treason,” she writes. “He libels immigrants and the countries from which they come. His words are ... calculated to exacerbate religious, social and racial divisions.”

What can be done? Albright urges defending the truth in the press, recognizing that no one is above the law and building a reenergized populace working for democracy.

“America at its best is a place where people from a multitude of backgrounds work together to safeguard the rights and enrich the lives of all,” she concludes. “No politician, not even one in the Oval Office, should be allowed to tarnish that dream.”

Twitter exploded in debate over the op-ed, pitting those taking Albright’s warning to heart against fervent Trump supporters. Here’s a sampling:

Powerful, sobering piece. Storm clouds, warning signs, and a call to action: Defend the truth, uphold the law, energize the electorate and the democratic process.

3.Exposing extent of Obamas corruption — Cody A Johnson (@CodyAJohnson) April 6, 2018Bollywood actor Salman Khan arriving at a Jodhpur court on April 5, 2018. Stringer . / Reuters

Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was sentenced Thursday to five years in prison for poaching a protected species of Indian antelope — marking a dramatic development in a highly publicized case that has spanned almost 20 years.

Khan, among the most recognizable Bollywood film stars and one of the world’s highest-paid actors, was first arrested in 1998 after he was accused of illegally hunting two blackbucks while filming in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. He was convicted of the crime and sentenced to a five-year jail term in 2006. A high court suspended his sentence a week later and eventually acquitted the actor of all charges.

In 2016, however, the Rajasthan government appealed the acquittal. The case then languished in court again until March, when the most recent trial began.

Khan, who has denied the poaching allegations, spent a night in Jodhpur Central Jail on Thursday, reported Inda’s NDTV. Khan’s attorney said the high court would be hearing the 52-year-old actor’s bail request on Friday morning.

Khan would be appealing the decision, the attorney added, noting that the verdict had come as a “surprise.”

Vikram Singh, a police officer at the Jodhpur jail, told NDTV that Khan had been provided with “four blankets” and would be sleeping on the floor during his time at the prison.

Indian media outlets shared photographs of Khan being booked into the jail.

Khan, described as one of Bollywood’s most notorious “bad boys,” is no stranger to legal troubles.

In 2015, he was sentenced to five years in prison for killing a homeless man and injuring four other people in a hit-and-run accident in Mumbai. He was immediately granted bail and served no time behind bars before a high court threw out all charges a few months later, citing a lack of evidence. At the time, the acquittal raised questions about whether celebrities like Khan were being treated preferentially by the Indian justice system.

Khan’s ex-girlfriend, Bollywood actress and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai, famously accused the actor of domestic abuse in the early 2000s. Her parents reportedly lodged a police complaint against the actor for harassing their daughter after the couple broke up. Khan has denied the allegations.

Despite this indecorous record, however, Khan’s popularity and film career have only continued to blossom over the years. Forbes estimated that Khan made $37 million in 2017, making him the ninth-highest paid actor in the world and the second-highest paid actor in India (Bollywood’s Shah Rukh Khan was ranked eighth on the Forbes list).

Observers have even suggested that Khan’s “bad boy” reputation has boosted fans’ adulation of him.

“Khan’s bad boy image has sustained him from the beginning of his career,” Anna Vetticad, an Indian film industry journalist, told The Guardian this week. “The frequent reports of drunken misbehavior in public, indiscipline at work and girlfriend abuse, along with the hit-and-run and poaching cases that finally landed him in court, have contributed greatly to fan enthusiasm for him.”

To his fans, Khan “is a golden-hearted man-child whose charitable trust is reason enough to forgive him for what they consider mere human failings,” she added.

In a scathing commentary on Thursday, HuffPost India’s Bollywood editor Ankur Pathak suggested that Khan’s recent sentence would similarly have no negative effect on the actor’s career.

“A conviction and a spell in prison are unlikely to make the slightest dent in Brand Salman,” Pathak wrote. “Tragically, the controversies that put Khan on the wrong side of the law have a seemingly opposite effect on the hundreds of thousands of [his] fans, who determinedly stand by the superstar despite his misdemeanors.”

Indeed, as news of Khan’s recent sentencing made international headlines, the hashtags #WeLoveYouSalmanKhan and #IStandBySalman began trending on India’s social media platforms as fans called for the actor’s prompt release from prison.For many in Myanmar, Facebook is their only source of news and a necessary means of communication. But the site is also rife with misinformation and hate speech. NurPhoto via Getty Images

A group of civil society organizations in Myanmar blamed Facebook for the spread of misinformation that may have put thousands of Rohingya people in danger, saying the company is far from the paragon of moderation its CEO claims it to be.

Earlier this week, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Vox’s Ezra Klein that Facebook’s systems detected two chain letters that spread across the country last year as the military was forcibly and violently removing nearly 700,000 people from the country’s Rakhine State. One of the fake letters warned of an impending attack by Muslim groups and used a racial slur, another warned Muslims that Buddhists were planning violence themselves.

“The Myanmar issues have, I think, gotten a lot of focus inside the company,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, part of a media blitz meant to counter growing outrage over the company’s use of user data. “I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm. Now, in that case, our systems detect that that’s going on. We stop those messages from going through.”

But in the letter sent this week, six groups said that Facebook took more than four days to address the spread of misinformation and that it detected the letters only after the groups alerted the company themselves.

“In your interview, you refer to your detection ‘systems’. We believe your system, in this case, was us ― and we were far from systematic,” the groups wrote. By the time Facebook addressed the concerns, “thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,” had seen the messages, they said.

“This is not quick enough and highlights inherent flaws in your ability to respond to emergencies,” the letter continues. “Your reporting tools, for one, do not provide options for users to flag content as priority. As far as we know, there are no Burmese speaking Facebook staff to whom Myanmar monitors can directly raise such cases.”

The messages, the groups allege, led to at least three violent incidents. Last month, investigators from the United Nations said Facebook had played a “determining role” in the Rohingya crisis.

A Facebook spokesperson said the company didn’t want the site “to be used to spread hatred and incite violence” and apologized for Zuckerberg’s characterization, saying the groups were indeed the first to report the issues.

“We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We should have been faster and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content.”

Facebook said it had added more Burmese-language reviewers to help handle reports in the country.

In some developing countries, including Myanmar, Facebook can provide vital communication networks for many people, and many use the site as their only source of news, according to The New York Times. But the social network has also become rife with misinformation and hate speech, and Facebook does not have an office in the country.

Facebook has been contending with an outpouring of frustration in recent weeks after the fallout over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook has been pummeled with questions over how it handles users’ private data, and Zuckerberg is slated to appear before Congress next week.

Thursday’s letter adds to a growing tide that may force a reckoning at the company, and Zuckerberg himself has said he’d be open to the right kind of government regulation. But the groups who sent the letter said the way the company operates now is not enough and could very well lead to more danger in Myanmar.

“The risk of Facebook content sparking open violence is arguably nowhere higher right now than in Myanmar,” the letter concludes. “If you are serious about making Facebook better, however, we urge you to invest more into moderation ... and ― perhaps most importantly ― we urge you to be more transparent about your processes, progress and the performance of your interventions, so as to enable us to work more effectively together.”

Park became South Korea’s first democratically elected leader to be forced from office last year when the Constitutional Court ordered her out over a scandal that landed the heads of two conglomerates in jail.

The court also fined Park, the daughter of a former military dictator, 18 billion won ($16.9 million) after finding her guilty of charges including bribery, abuse of power and coercion.

“The defendant abused her presidential power entrusted by the people, and as a result, brought massive chaos to the order of state affairs and led to the impeachment of the president, which was unprecedented,” judge Kim Se-yoon said as he handed down the sentence.

Up to 1,000 Park supporters gathered outside the court, holding national flags and signs calling for an end to “political revenge” against her.

The court found Park guilty of colluding with her old friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive about 7 billion won ($6.56 million) each from Lotte Group, a retail giant, and Samsung, the world’s biggest maker of smartphones and semiconductors, while demanding 8.9 billion won from SK, an energy conglomerate.

Most of the money was intended to bankroll non-profit foundations run by Choi’s family and confidants, and to fund the education of Choi’s horse-riding daughter, the court said.

Prosecutors sought a 30-year sentence and a 118.5 billion won ($112 million) fine for Park.

Park, 66, who has been in jail since March 31 last year, has denied wrongdoing and was not present in court.

The judge said Park had shown “no sign of repentance” but had instead tried to shift the blame to Choi and her secretaries.

“We cannot help but sternly hold her accountable,” Kim said.

‘HEARTBREAKING’

Park apologized while in office for seeking help from Choi, who had no policy or political experience, but that was as close as she came to admitting any guilt.

Kang Chul-koo, one of Park’s state-appointed lawyers, said he would discuss with her the possibility of an appeal.

“We tried our utmost but regret the result turned out very bad,” Kang told reporters at the court.

“The truth will be revealed one day.”

The sentence will be a bitter blow for Park, who returned to the presidential palace in 2012 as the country’s first woman leader, more than three decades after she left it following the assassination of her father.

Her ouster from office last year led to a presidential election won by the liberal Moon Jae-in, whose conciliatory stand on North Korea has underpinned a significant warming of ties between the rival neighbors.

Moon’s office said Park’s fate was “heartbreaking” not only for herself but for the country, and added that history that was not remembered would be repeated.

“We will not forget today,” the office said.

Park is the latest former leader of South Korea to run afoul of the law.

Two predecessors, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted in 1996 of mutiny, treason and corruption and sentenced to long prison terms but both received presidential pardons and were freed after a couple of years.

But Moon took office pledging to end the practice of pardoning public and corporate officials convicted of corruption.

WATERSHED?

Park’s friend, Choi, was convicted and jailed for 20 years after a separate trial in February.

The chairman of the Lotte Group, the country’s fifth-largest conglomerate, Shin Dong-bin, was jailed for two years and six months.

Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee was jailed for a similar term on charges of bribery and embezzlement but in a surprise decision in February, an appeals court freed him after a year in detention.

Park’s supporters and opponents reflect divisions in a society still haunted by Cold War antagonism.

Most supporters are older conservatives who remember her father’s authoritarian 18-year rule, beginning in 1961, when their country began its remarkable surge towards becoming an economic power.

Younger, liberal voters, who staged months of protests against Park before her ouster, will be hoping the verdict will be a watershed in efforts by the new government to end the self-serving collusion between political leaders and the powerful conglomerates known as chaebol.

“The ruling will be a lesson for many companies,” said Choi Woon-youl, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party.

“They have to boost transparency and sever the ties of collusion with government. If you have nothing to hide, whether about management or succession, you don’t have to be bullied by the government.”Officials confirmed on Friday that two guinea pigs and a cat belonging to former Russian spy Sergei Skripal are dead after detectives investigating Skripal’s poisoning sealed off access to his home in Salisbury, England.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a public bench in Salisbury in early March, and taken to a hospital in critical condition. Investigators determined that they had been poisoned by a nerve agent and believed that the pair was intentionally targeted.

When a veterinarian was finally allowed access to the property, it was too late for the pets inside, UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told multiple news outlets on Friday. It was not immediately clear how long the pets were in the home unattended or when the vet was permitted to enter.

The two guinea pigs were already dead, apparently from dehydration. The cat, a black Persian named Nash Van Drake, was severely malnourished and in a huge amount of pain, The Sun reported.

“A cat was also found in a distressed state and a decision was taken by a veterinary surgeon to euthanise the animal to alleviate its suffering,” DEFRA told CNN in a statement.

The agency added that it could not say whether there was any evidence the animals had been exposed to the nerve agent that poisoned Skripal, a 66-year-old former colonel with Russia’s military intelligence, and his 33-year-old daughter. Both were in stable condition as of Friday, doctors told The Associated Press.

BBC reporter Dominic Casciani said in a Friday tweet that Skripal’s home had been sealed “for operational safety reasons” shortly after the poisoning was discovered. He added it was not clear “when police knew of the presence of the animals in Mr Skripal’s home or whether anyone considered rescuing them.”

However, a local veterinarian told The Sun in March that he had called police the day after the poisoning was reported, offering to help with the pets. Friends of Skripal also reportedly did not know the whereabouts of the pets. In the same article, The Sun wrote that an unidentified source “close to the family” was under the impression that the pets had been taken away for testing.

A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals expressed grief over the fate of the animals in a statement sent to HuffPost.

“It is very sad to hear that these animals have died in such tragic circumstances,” she said. “However, we appreciate the emergency services were working in extreme and dangerous conditions in an incredibly fast-moving operation in an attempt to keep the public safe.”

Skripal was convicted in Russia of spying for the U.K. in 2006. In 2010, the U.K. granted him refuge. Though the Kremlin has denied being involved in the attack, the U.K. expelled 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the poisoning. More than 20 other countries, including the United States, have followed suit. Moscow, in turn, has also started reciprocally expelling diplomats, including 60 from the U.S.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova publicly brought up Skripal’s pets on Wednesday, asking reporters where the animals were and what their condition was.

“After all, we are talking about living organisms, and if a poisonous agent was used in the house, they must also have been affected,” she said, according to CNN.

The Russian embassy tweeted on Thursday that Skripal had two cats and two guinea pigs. It’s unknown where the second cat is.SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil, April 6 (Reuters) - Brazil’s former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva defied a judge’s order to turn himself in to police on Friday and start serving a 12-year prison sentence for bribery that likely ends his bid to return to the presidency.

Lula remained holed up inside the headquarters of a steelworkers union in metropolitan Sao Paulo with aides and allies after the federal judge’s deadline of 5 p.m. (2000 GMT) to surrender to authorities. However, Lula’s legal team was negotiating his surrender with federal police, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Federal police in Sao Paulo declined to say if they would attempt to forcibly take the former president into custody, a move that could trigger intense clashes with his supporters. A union spokesman said Lula was mulling his options with lawyers.

His legal team, which lost their last-minute appeal to a higher court, argued they had not exhausted procedural appeals and painted the case as an effort to remove Lula from the presidential race he is leading.

Hundreds of supporters filled the street outside the union headquarters, cheering defiant speeches calling the case a political witch hunt. A banner hung from the building showed Lula’s smiling face on an electronic voting machine.

“We are here to show that the workers will resist this attack against democracy,” said Jorge Nazareno, a union leader who said he had met briefly with Lula on Friday morning.

Lula himself had not addressed the crowd nearly 24 hours after arriving at the building, although union leaders said in an statement posted on their website that he would speak to the crowd Friday afternoon.

Many of those in the crowd, including workers, students and land rights activists, camped overnight Thursday in the streets.

The same steelworkers union in Sao Paulo’s industrial suburbs where Lula sought refuge served as the launch pad for his political career nearly four decades ago, when he led nationwide strikes that helped to end Brazil’s 1964-85 military government.

Lula’s everyman style and unvarnished speeches electrified masses long governed by the elite and eventually won him two terms as president, from 2003 to 2011, when he oversaw robust economic growth and falling inequality amid a commodities boom.

He left office with sky-high approval of 83 percent and was called “the most popular politician on Earth” by former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Lula’s downfall has been as stunning as the unprecedented corruption probes that have convulsed Brazil for the last four years, jailing dozens of politicians and business leaders long considered above the law.

THE FALL

Federal Judge Sergio Moro, who has handled the bulk of cases in Brazil’s biggest-ever graft investigation and issued Lula’s prison order, wrote that he should not be handcuffed and would have a special cell in Curitiba, where he stood trial.

Lula was convicted last year for taking bribes from an engineering firm in return for help landing contracts with state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.

Brazil’s Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Lula’s plea to remain free until he exhausts all his appeals, in a case he calls a political witch hunt.

The ruling likely ends his political career and blows October’s election wide open, leaving Brazil’s left without an obvious candidate to regain power following the unpopular current president, Michel Temer.

Under Brazilian electoral law, a candidate is forbidden from running for office for eight years after being found guilty of a crime. Rare exceptions have been made in the past, and the final decision would be made by the top electoral court if and when Lula officially files to be a candidate.

Brazilian financial markets rallied on Thursday after the Supreme Court cleared the way for Lula’s imprisonment, which increased the chances of a market-friendly candidate winning the election, according to analysts and political foes.

Cassio Goncalves, a labor safety specialist at the union headquarters, said Lula’s Workers Party had not considered alternatives in the presidential race.

“We have no other plan,” he said. “Plan A, B and C is Lula, because he is innocent. He will be our president.”
