Donald Glover told Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday that Lando Calrissian was the first toy he ever had, given to him by his father. And now Glover is Lando in “Solo: A Star Wars Story.”

“Solo,” the origin story of beloved “Star Wars” character Han Solo, hits theaters May 25 and Glover is making the rounds to promote the film. He plays Lando Calrissian, the original owner of the Millennium Falcon and eventual friend to Captain Solo.

When he found out he got the part of Lando, Glover reacted like a die-hard fan. He told Kimmel the first thing he did was call his dad, also a huge “Star Wars” fan.CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday gave Conan O’Brien a glowing review of Haiti before the talk show host’s trip there. In a chat on “Conan,” Cooper declared the Caribbean nation “among the richest countries I’ve ever been to.”

O’Brien announced he was visiting Haiti for a “Conan Without Borders” episode to get in President Donald Trump’s face for reportedly calling Haiti a “shithole” (or was it “shithouse”?) during a White House meeting on immigration policy.

Cooper, who visits Haiti often, applauded the comedian’s plan and offered his own travel guide.

“It’s the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, but a country can be poor economically and rich in culture and rich in the strength of the people and rich in so many different ways,” Cooper said. “And Haiti is in that way among the richest countries I’ve ever been to. The Haitian people are incredibly strong, carry themselves with such dignity, and for generations have had governments which have not paid attention to them, which have stolen from them, and yet, whatever adversity they have faced, they faced it head-on.”

Too bad O’Brien couldn’t pack that in his suitcase.

It was Cooper’s impassioned defense of Haiti last week after Trump’s remark that inspired O’Brien’s travel plan. And now, the funnyman is packing his bags. Go get ’em, Conan, and spread some goodwill while you’re there.

Jimmy Kimmel sent a camera crew out on Thursday to ask kids how they thought President Donald Trump had done during his first year in office.

With Trump’s approval rating in the tank, did the youngsters’ reviews match up with those of some of their elders?

Unfortunately for Trump, yes. And then some.Our love for the 1988 cult classic “Heathers” is God. And if you’re also skeptical that the reimagined anthology of the film will be just as great as the original, you need to watch the latest trailer.

The two-minute trailer features old favorites like Shannen Doherty, whom we knew and loved as Heather Duke, dropping wisdom bombs like, “Whatever you do, make sure it matters,” and remade versions of Heather Chandler, Heather McNamara, and Doherty’s original Heather Duke.

But Heather Duke 2.0 is now a character named Heath who identifies at genderqueer, according The Hollywood Reporter.

The Hollywood Reporter noted the change back in August, adding that Heath will be played by Brendan Scannell. We expect the actor will add the same wit and snark to the role Doherty originated ― and then some.Rich Fury via Getty Images Saoirse Ronan, a style icon in the making.

Saoirse Ronan is definitely a style icon in the making.

The 23-year-old, who recently won a Golden Globe for her role in the critically acclaimed “Lady Bird,” has transformed from child actress to a sophisticated starlet, with a wardrobe to match.

Ronan began her career as a fresh-faced preteen, gaining popularity after appearing in “Atonement” alongside Keira Knightley. The actress was nominated for an Oscar for the role. When she arrived at the award ceremony, she made her mark in a stunning (yet age appropriate) emerald green gown.

From there, her red carpet style matured with her. Over the years, Ronan has proven she’s not afraid to rake style risks, whether that means sporting a bright red jumpsuit, mixing prints or playing with different silhouettes.

We can’t wait to see what she wears next as she continues on the award show circuit. But in the meantime, you can check out the actress’ stunning style evolution below:Olympian Aly Raisman addressed serial sexual abuser Larry Nassar in court Friday with a powerful statement, calling the former USA Gymnastics team doctor “pathetic” for complaining about the length of his sentencing hearing and “a monster” for abusing the trust of his young patients.

“Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.”

Raisman joined more than 100 women who have shared victim impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing hearing in Lansing, Michigan, this week, two months after publicly identifying herself as one of the athletes he abused.

Nassar, who faces a sentence of at least 25 years for sexual abuse, delivered a six-page letter to the court on Thursday, saying it had become too difficult for him “mentally” to continue to listen to his victims.

“This isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” county Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded. “There’s no truth in here. It’s delusional.”

Raisman referenced the letter in her statement. “You are pathetic to think any woman would have any sympathy for you,” she said. “You think this is hard for you? Imagine how any of us feels.”

The star gymnast, who competed in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, described how she felt “hearing a knock on the door” as “an innocent teenager in a foreign country” and finding Nassar.

“You made me uncomfortable and I thought you were weird, but I felt guilty because you were a doctor,” Raisman said. She added: “I wouldn’t allow myself to believe the problem was you.”

She said Nassar assured her that his touching, which she described as “inappropriate,” would be helpful, and that he “told on” young women who refused his treatment.

Nassar served as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University until his firing in 2016. More than 140 women have accused him of sexual abuse. He pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in November.

Raisman was joined on Friday by Jordyn Wieber, her teammate on the “Fierce Five” ― the name given to USA gymnasts at the 2012 Olympics. Other members of the Five, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, also have accused Nassar of abuse. Olympic gymnast Simone Biles has spoken out, too.

Wieber’s statement was the first time she spoke publicly about Nassar.

“I’m angry with myself for not recognizing the abuse and that’s something I’m struggling with today,” Wieber said. She explained how the doctor used “grooming techniques,” BuzzFeed noted, to make the young female athletes believe he was their friend.

“I thought that training for the Olympics would be hardest thing I would ever have to do. But the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do is process that I am a victim of Larry Nassar,” Wieber said.

Raisman has spoken out repeatedly about Nassar. In her statement, she again slammed the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics ― which she declared to be “rotting from the inside.” Both groups, she said, were “very quick to capitalize on my success,” while failing to take action against Nassar and issuing “empty” statements.

“Talk is cheap,” Raisman said, calling for an independent investigation into how Nassar was allowed to continue working with young athletes over multiple decades.

Raisman asked the judge to sentence Nassar to the maximum to that he might have time “replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.”Getty/HPMG

This story was not supposed to be a post-mortem examination of Jean-Claude Van Damme’s latest show. But here we are. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Amazon is “cleaning house.” And that means gutting some series ― among those, “Jean-Claude Van Johnson.”

In the Ridley Scott-produced show, Van Damme plays Van Johnson, a caricature version of himself who masks his secret life as a spy with an overblown film career. Having retired, a bored Van Johnson attempts to reconnect with his past love while getting back into the espionage game, poking fun at action movie tropes along the way. From “Bloodsport” to “Timecop,” none of the actor’s films are off limits in the self-aware series, you can be Damme sure.

HuffPost spoke to the 57-year-old Belgian actor and martial artist ahead of Amazon’s decision to cut his series from its roster. Now, with no Season 2 in sight, “Jean-Claude Van Johnson” must end, but Van Damme’s quotes about punching people in the balls, punching snakes in the face and refraining from punching 100 duck-sized horses live on.

Since “Jean-Claude Van Johnson” is technically a parody of your life, I have to ask ― are you a real secret agent?

No, of course not. I was never an agent. But I was with a lot of different personalities all over the world from the Middle East to Russia to Bosnia to Chechnya to Indonesia. And all those people are at the head of countries. I don’t know why they like me. They love sports, they love martial arts, and I was able, because of that, to meet big boys and also meet normal guys. So I’m sure my phone is bugged.

Oh, wow.

Of course. Think about it. When an actor goes left and right around the world like that, they have nothing else to do than to listen. I’m not staying home ... so it’s a nice idea for me to be an actor and a spy in real life.

You make light of yourself in the series, including your famous split and crotch punch. When did you start doing that move?

Oh, the punching in the balls?

Yeah. Punching in the balls.

I mean, in real life it always works. Especially against big people, because I’m a small guy. No, no, but, I mean, in martial arts they have a kick to the temple, to the sternum, under the chin, to the throat, to the testicles. And it hurts ... but they used that in the show because it’s kind of cool.

Remember “Lionheart”? The guy is kicking me, and I block his legs in the air, and I go [makes punching and groaning sound]. In “Jean-Claude Van Johnson,” it’s different. It’s almost like [makes more punching sounds] and the guy goes down slowly.

Mortal Kombat’s Johnny Cage was modeled after you. Did you ever play the game?

You know, the moves and the clothing and everything. I never talked to those guys, but normally they were not supposed to use the name and the face and the lookalike. If I wanted to ... but I will never in my life. I will never sue anybody. It’s against my rules. Even if a guy slapped me in the face. I don’t care. But who cares? “Bloodsport” ― all that stuff in Mortal Kombat came from there.

You left “Predator” for “Bloodsport,” right? What do you think your career would’ve been like if you didn’t leave “Predator”?

One, I was bye-bye because they wanted to start “Bloodsport” just a couple of weeks after “Predator,” but thank God the suit I was trying in “Predator” didn’t work, so they made a new one. Which is true by the way.

[The original predator suit can be seen below.]

But you want to know the story? When I met “Bloodsport” producer Menahem Golan, no matter what I did — I did the split between two legs in between two chairs, I showed my body, I took my shirt off — he said, “My friend, you know you’re not a movie star ... Chuck Norris is a star. You’re just another guy.”

And I said, “Yeah, but Arnold Schwarzenegger likes me. And I’m the heavy in ‘Predator.‘” So he goes, “OK, call Fox.” So he called 21st Century Fox and said, “Is Van Damme playing the Predator?” They said, “Yes, Van Damme is playing.” He goes, “OK, so you get ‘Bloodsport.’” But he didn’t know I was in a costume in “Predator.”

So all this happened. It’s an amazing life.

It’s been about 30 years since “Bloodsport.”

Mark Wahlberg wants to do “Bloodsport 2” ... I don’t know if he’s going to get it, but Mark Wahlberg, when he came from Boston, he came to my house. Knocks on my door. But I was not the guy who opened the door. It was my guy Pepe ― housekeeper, great guy. And he said, “Well, there’s a young man outside. He wants to make a documentary on you, is a big fan of you from ‘Bloodsport.’” And I said, “I don’t have time to make a documentary about ‘Bloodsport.’ It’s not such a good movie. It’s only karate and stuff,” so the guy left.

It was Mark Wahlberg. You can mention that because it’s the truth. He came on Saks Avenue. It was about 25, 30 years ago. He came to my house. He found my house. To show you how hungry he was, he found my house. He rang the bell. That’s why he’s very successful today, I guess.

[A source close to Wahlberg told HuffPost that a sequel to “Bloodsport” was talked about 25 or 30 years ago, but added no further verification of Van Damme’s story.]

You punch a snake in “Hard Target.” Have you ever really punched a snake?

I never punched a snake. But do you remember the scene in “Enter the Dragon,” when Bruce Lee takes a snake out of a bag, and then he takes the head of the snake and smacks the snake ― to excite him ― and then he throws the snake inside? You have to see a movie called “Enter the Dragon.”

Yeah, I’ve seen “Enter the Dragon.”

Lee’s very sexy, and even with the snake it was sexy the way he did it. And then he sends the snake on his enemies. So I didn’t think about that. But you know Tom Pollock, who was at that time the chairman of the Motion Picture Group of Universal Studios? A good friend of mine. Aw, what a great guy. What a great person is Tom Pollock. He said, “Hey, Jean-Claude, I would like you to take a snake and to punch the snake.”

That’s his idea. And I said, “Tom, this will never work. Are you crazy? You want me to punch a snake? It’s gonna get knocked out?” He said, “Listen, Jean-Claude, you’ve got to do me this favor. I feel it’s gonna work.” And guess what? You know those guys, man, they just know shit we don’t know. They know what to do. They have sometimes those amazing moments.

Yeah, that still lives on.

But again and again, I did it very seriously. When I punched the snake, to me, it looked like I was punching the face of a bad boy, so I stayed very serious on the action, and it looked good.

It’s an iconic snake punch.

At the premiere, when I saw here’s the snake coming in on screen, and you see me holding the snake, and the snake gets knocked out, people start to laugh. I go, “That’s it. I’m in trouble here.” But they were laughing in a good way.

Since you’re known for your fight scenes, there’s this popular internet question: What would you rather fight, 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?

If I would like to fight 100 what?

[Publicist jumps in: “Would you rather fight 100 horses that are the size of ducks ― so like tiny little horses, but 100 of them? Or would you rather fight one giant duck that’s the size of a horse? Which would you rather fight?”]

The 100 small horses, because I know nature. You put a duck the size of a horse ― it’s very strong, you know? It will go nuts on the water ― woosh, like beep, beep ― and it will be great. But I don’t think a duck will hurt me because I’m such a cutie guy. It will maybe keep me captive for a couple of years. That’s not good for Amazon and Ridley Scott. But what can I do?

So you’d go with the horses?

I cannot kick a horse. I cannot kick a duck. Maybe I’ll be friends with them, because animals, they never engage a fight. That’s what humans don’t get. Some people get it. We have more good people than strange people in terms of animals. We have to really protect them. It’s very important for our children.

What do you think about all the parodies of the split you did in the Volvo commercial?

It’s crazy. Crazy. Yeah, the split became a new cult. But we gonna find a new move, huh? Something different to come back. I have to find a new move, something completely amazing. I think it’s a cool thing. It will go all over the place. It’s like the “I’ll be back” line of Arnold. But I think that split is more strong though, because it’s an image.

Has there been any talk of “Jean-Claude Van Johnson” Season 2?

Hopefully if it’s good, and the ratings are high, then we may have the chance to do a second season. And if not, it’s destiny. That’s it. It’s nothing complicated about life.

This interview had been edited and condensed for clarity.It would take some time to go public, but our worst fears about Donald Trump died when he urged then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of national security adviser Michael Flynn's associations."I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go," Comey later reported the president as saying. "He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."This followed a Jan. 27 meeting between the two in which Trump told Comey, "I need loyalty. I expect loyalty."That Trump's request occured on Valentine's Day was almost too perfect, as he seemed to apply the same amount of subtly and forbearance to obstructing justice as he does to his love life. Unfortunately for the president, his "when you're a star they let you do it” ethos doesn't really pan out when going toe-to-toe with the FBI.It might seem counterintuitive that the president attempting to derail an investigation into the top levels of his administration would mark the moment our worst fears were alleviated, but the moment made something very clear: The Trump administration may do a lot of damage, but it isn't going to destroy this democracy -- it simply isn't talented enough. It has no creep.This isn't to discount the profound impact Trump and his crew are having on the presidency, the country and our collective faith in institutions, or the potential for more damage yet undone. However when you think back to immediately after Trump's election and some of the fears that were being voiced about his potential impact on our very way of governance, it becomes clear that for all the comparisons to Richard Nixon, this White House can't live up to that administration's calculating deviousness.This White House isn't occupied by a group of Machiavellian operators bending the executive branch to their will, but rather a bunch of buffoons supremely out of their depth, lurching from one thing to the next like a group of rip-roaring drunks playing Pokemon Go.Should this administration implode in a series of indictments and resignations, its criminality won't be placed alongside Nixon's in the pantheon of bad actors, but between the Florida man who tried to disguise himself at night by smearing permanent marker on his face and the bank robber who was arrested after police spotted his L.A. Lights.Trump spends a good amount of his time in Florida, and this day, perhaps more than any other, crystallized the fact that America had elected Florida ManThe ladies of Twitter never fail to brighten our days with their brilliant ― but succinct ― wisdom.

“I’ve always known I’m gay,” Mike Parrow, 34, told Gay Star News. “That was never a question in my mind.”

But growing up in a small town in upstate New York meant he didn’t meet many members of the LGBTQ community.

“The only exposure I saw of any gay culture was extremely effeminate, and that was what was on TV. I’m not like Jack on ‘Will and Grace,’ so I’m not gay,” he said. “So I tried to hide it.”

Parrow said he tried different options in an attempt deny who he is, including gay conversion therapy ― a program based on the idea that gay, lesbian or bisexual people can change their sexual orientation if they pray enough. It has been thoroughly discredited by all major mental health associations, and the American Psychological Association says it can have “serious potential to harm young people” because it attempts to make people believe being gay or bisexual is a personal and moral failure.

But attending a conversion therapy program made Parrow realize he was ready to come out. He discussed his journey on “Good Morning Britain” on Friday.

“It was the first time I heard people had the same feelings that I did,” he said. “Being there, I realized I am gay and that is not going to change. Because one of [conversion therapy’s] premises is that it’s a choice. It’s not a choice. You’re born this way. So right there, that’s a flawed philosophy. … I’m not a doctor and I can’t prove that, but I can tell you why I know [it doesn’t work].”

Parrow said his life has changed for the better since coming out, but acknowledged gay athletes still face struggles.

“There’s no role models for athletes because athletes tend to come out after they retire because of fear, maybe of rejection, fear of different pay, fear of people just not accepting them for who they are,” he said. “I’ve had the opposite. My career got better since I’ve come out because I know who I am.”

Parrow said he wants younger gay athletes to not give up on their dreams.

“I don’t want that 14-year-old to think he’s alone,” he said. “I want that 14-year-old to be successful, to play for the NFL, to play sports. I don’t want them to hold themselves back because of hate.”

“I’ve found that mostly, people are just curious because nobody has ever sat them down, so they have questions,” he added. “Let them ask questions because you need to ask them too.”Seth Meyers had to wash his mouth out with sanitizer after talking about President Donald Trump’s alleged affair with a porn star.

On Thursday’s broadcast of “Late Night,” Meyers mocked Trump for claims that he paid $130,000 in hush money to former adult actress Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels) after they reportedly partook in “textbook generic” sex in 2006.

“So, on top of everything else, we have a president who’s such a genius he’s somehow still paying for porn,” said Meyers.

However, it was one particular aspect of the alleged encounter that saw Meyers reaching for the Purell.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pictured on April 9, 2018. KCNA/Reuters

North Korea has escalated its war of words with the U.S., repeating a threat on Thursday to call off the planned June 12 summit with President Donald Trump and warning that a “nuclear showdown” could instead be on the table.

In a statement published by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, the North’s vice minister of foreign affairs, Choe Son Hui, blamed “reckless” remarks made by top U.S. officials as the reason behind Pyongyang’s second thoughts.

Choe took aim at Vice President Mike Pence in particular, calling him a “political dummy” who’d offended North Korea with his “unbridled and impudent” comments. Pence had warned in a Fox News interview on Monday that Pyongyang could follow the “Libya model” if leader Kim Jong Un “doesn’t make a deal” ― a reference to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who met a brutal end following his decision to denuclearize after negotiations with the U.S.

North Korea has long expressed distaste at comparisons with Libya. Pyongyang has said that its nuclear capabilities are far more advanced than Libya’s ever were ― and has stressed its expectation that it be treated as a nuclear state on equal footing with the U.S. and other nuclear powers.

Choe echoed this scorn in her statement Thursday, saying North Korea has no interest in meeting the same “tragic fate” as the northern African nation.

“I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president,” Choe said, referring to Pence’s Libya comments, according to a Wall Street Journal translation.

“In case the U.S. offends against our goodwill and clings to unlawful and outrageous acts, I will put forward a suggestion to our supreme leadership for reconsidering the [Kim-Trump] summit,” Choe added, saying that it was up to the U.S. to decide whether it wanted to negotiate in a “meeting room or encounter us [in a] nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.”

KCNA: "We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us. Whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision…of the U.S." — Jonathan Cheng (@JChengWSJ) May 24, 2018

Still, North Korea on Thursday invited journalists to witness what appeared to be the demolition of its main nuclear test site. The Associated Press and South Korean media reported several explosions at the secluded Punggye-ri location.

This is the second time in about a week that North Korea has threatened to withdraw from the U.S. summit — deviating starkly from a monthslong trend of warming relations.

Last week, Pyongyang abruptly canceled talks with South Korea and cast doubt on the meeting with Trump after taking issue with recent joint military exercises undertaken by Seoul and Washington.

Kim Kye Gwan, another top North Korean official, said in a statement last Wednesday that Pyongyang would be forced to “reconsider” the Trump meeting if the U.S. insisted on “unilateral nuclear abandonment.”

Criticism of the “Libya model” also came up in Kim’s statement, with the official criticizing White House national security adviser John Bolton for suggesting the U.S. would urge Pyongyang to rapidly dismantle its entire nuclear program as Libya did years ago.

“If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” Kim said.

Trump suggested Tuesday that he’d be open to a phased dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear program ― a departure from his earlier demand for total and immediate denuclearization, reported The New York Times.

Also on Tuesday, Trump, who met with South Korean President Moon Jae In at the White House, said there was a “very substantial chance” that the summit with Kim Jong Un could be postponed.

“We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting,” Trump told reporters, without specifying what those “conditions” would be.

On Wednesday, Trump told Fox News there was a “good chance” that the summit would take place.

U.S. President Trump says of pending summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un that there is a chance it will work out, and a substantial chance it won’t work out, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work out over a period of time, adding that there’s a good chance meeting will be held. pic.twitter.com/2xJnwLhkNZ — Breaking News (@BreakingNews) May 22, 2018

North Korea experts said they still expect the summit to happen, though the journey to get there may be rocky.

“In effect, President Trump is getting a mini-lesson in talking to the North Koreans even before he talks to the North Koreans,” Jung Pak, a Brookings Institution fellow and former CIA analyst, told the Times this week.

Mintaro Oba, a former state department expert on the Koreas, suggested last week that Trump “keep calm and carry on,” and that the North’s threat to cancel is “par for the course.”

“The question is whether they’re willing to go so far as to go through with it, or whether they’re mainly trying to gain some leverage [or] test how much we want the summit,” he wrote on Twitter.The news that President Donald Trump’s supporters are pushing for him to win the Nobel Peace Prize gave “Late Night” host Seth Meyers some food for thought.

“Trump’s attempts at diplomacy with North Korea are a positive development, and if the North and South manage to broker a peace deal with Trump’s help, that would be historic,” the comedian said on Thursday.

“But this is still the same guy who wanted to ban Muslims, called Mexicans rapists, said we should kill the families of terrorists and said he wanted fewer immigrants from Africa and Haiti,” Meyers added.On Thursday’s “Late Late Show,” the host suggested it was only a matter of time before Trump bestowed a childish moniker on White House Chief of Staff John Kelly . Earlier this week, Kelly said Trump’s campaign pledges to curb immigration, including the U.S.-Mexico border wall, were uninformed .

“I can’t believe Trump and his chief of staff are fighting in public like this, but I’ve got to say, what I’m really looking forward to is what nickname Trump is going to use when he eventually attacks General Kelly on Twitter,” said Corden.Allana Harkin, left, and Ashley Nicole Black, right, are currently on an "Apology Race" tour, during which they are apologizing to people on behalf of President Donald Trump. TBS

President Donald Trump’s offenses can come pretty fast. The same can’t be said for his apologies.

So the correspondents from “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” ― Ashley Nicole Black, Allana Harkin, Amy Hoggart and Mike Rubens ― have been scrambling to make up for him. Last Wednesday, they kicked off a two-week “Apology Race” tour in an attempt to apologize to the people or communities Trump has offended.

In theory, the concept is simple. In practice, however, it’s been a bit more challenging.

“Initially, we thought this is going to be really fun, just jumping on trains, planes and automobiles and running around the country,” Harkin told HuffPost. “What we weren’t expecting was how emotional it was going to be.”

“It’s one thing when you read something in the newspaper or see an annoying tweet, and another when you come face to face with somebody who is actually directly impacted by the choices or tweets the president makes and writes,” she said.

“You feel terrible that they’re going through this and you actually can’t do much more,” Harkin said, adding that it’s “kind of upsetting” to apologize “on behalf of somebody that we personally of course do not agree with.”

And not everyone has been willing to accept their apology, she said. Some people want to hear Trump himself say he’s sorry.

Fellow correspondent Black said the tour has been an exercise in “stretching my empathy muscles.”

“The president of the United States, I promise you, has not lost a minute of sleep thinking about that mother who is trying to figure out how to keep her family together,” she told HuffPost. “Comedians are doing this. It’s stupid.”

Black also lightheartedly lamented that Trump had failed to properly offend Oprah Winfrey, whose powerful speech at the Golden Globes led people to speculate that she might be considering a presidential bid.

“He’s offended everyone on Earth, but he managed not to insult Oprah, who is the one person I wanted to meet during this process,” she joked.

“Apology Race” has gone global ― the only two tour stops the team would confirm were Haiti and Puerto Rico ― but Harkin said the correspondents would have been plenty busy saying “sorry” even if they hadn’t strayed far from home.

“There’s so many things we could apologize for, that really in a two-week period we could have stayed in Manhattan,” she said. “Trump actually insults his own country more than he does anybody else. He’s more insulting to the people who live here.”

Field producer Tyler Hall also addressed the breakneck speed with which the president has been offering his commentary and insults.

“On any given day you open [Trump’s] Twitter [page] and scroll past three outrages, four embarrassing mistakes and a solid blatant lie or two,” he said. “What makes it all the worse is that most of America hates this. Most of America didn’t vote for this, yet it keeps being done in our name. I can’t tell you who is winning [the race], but I can say America is losing.”

The “Full Frontal” team will continue apologizing on the president’s behalf until the results air on Jan. 24. You can follow updates about their travels through the @FullFrontalSamB Twitter account.

Check out the trailer here:As more states legalize marijuana, a certain percentage of the population is interested in joining the fun. But if they’re not sure how to purchase pot from a legal dispensary.

A San Diego-based rapper is helping to weed out any concerns.

MC Flow, a medical marijuana user since 2009, has just released “Welcome to the Dispensary,” a hummable how-to that explains the process of purchasing legal cannabis.

Some of her roach clip-riddled rhymes include:

Walls and walls of green buds, jugs full of flower Indicas for the in da couch, sativas for the power Bow to the bud tender cuz he’s paid by the hour As your concierge of cannabis, with OG sour

Flow (real name Abby Dorsey) recorded the video at URBN LEAF, a dispensary in San Diego.

“We tried to reflect the diversity of clients that pass through the shop on any given day,” she said in a release. “It was important to me that we show that the dispensary has something for everyone, and that today’s customer doesn’t usually fit the traditional stoner stereotype.

Whether you’re an old hand with a joint or just weed-curious, the chorus to her song will definitely get stuck in your mind:On Friday, “Jersey Shore” star Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino pleaded guilty to tax fraud in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. He faces up to five years in prison.

His brother, Marc Sorrentino, also pleaded guilty to aiding the preparation of a false and fraudulent tax return. He faces up to three years in prison.

“What the defendants admitted to today, quite simply, is tantamount to stealing money from their fellow taxpayers,” said U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito in a statement.

“All of us are required by law to pay our fair share of taxes. Celebrity status does not provide a free pass from this obligation.”

In 2011, Mike Sorrentino concealed some of his income to avoid paying more in taxes, making smaller cash deposits into bank accounts so they wouldn’t alert the IRS. His brother, on the other hand, gave his accountants false information and underreported his total income and taxable income in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Despite pleading guilty to his crimes on Friday, the “Jersey Shore” star still took the time to post on Instagram about his upcoming appearance in Miami for the “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” reunion show:

The court approved Sorrentino’s request to travel for the show while on probation. His and his brother’s sentencing is set for April 25, when they each face an additional $250,000 fine.

The star’s attorneys, Henry E. Klingeman and Kristen M. Santillo, also gave a statement to ET to say that the TV personality is “sober” and ready to live a “productive, law-abiding life.”

“Today, Michael Sorrentino has come to terms with mistakes he made at a very different and tumultuous time in his life. He deeply regrets his failure to pay his taxes, and has spent the past several years turning his life into something positive. He has been sober for two years, counseled other young people facing life’s stresses, and has built a stable, loving relationship with his girlfriend Lauren Pesce, who stands by his side,” the statement reads.

“The plea terms call for a balance between punishing the wrong committed and conditions that facilitate Mike living a productive, law-abiding life moving forward. Following through on this plea agreement, Michael intends to pay restitution before sentencing. We hope that the Court will consider the totality of the circumstances, including Michael’s minor role in the offense, and impose a fair sentence. In the meantime, he will continue to entertain millions on ‘Jersey Shore’ and thanks everyone who has expressed support.”

Molly Hendrickson of Denver’s ABC affiliate did her best to explain that the event highlighted efforts to boost the bison population, but giggles got the best of her.

“I’m done,” she finally said.

Apparently, Hendrickson never had a chance. “And they thought I could hold it together??” she wrote on Instagram Thursday.A Montreal man pulled a fast one on local police this month when he created a replica of the DeLorean sports car seen in the movie “Back To The Future.”

The 37-year-old reality star announced Friday on her website that the two decided to name their newborn Chicago West. Kanye was raised in Chicago.

Chicago was born Monday at 12:47 a.m. and weighed 7 pounds, 6 ounces, according to Kardashian’s website. According to Khloe Kardashian, Chicago will go by “Chi,” which will be pronounced like “shy.”

I LOOOOOOOOOOVE her name 😍😍😍😍 hey Chi (shy) https://t.co/Ikd0ay3DsO — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 19, 2018

“We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care,” Kardashian wrote in a post Tuesday announcing the birth. “North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.”

The reality star experienced preeclampsia and placenta accreta during her first pregnancies with North and Saint. After doctors advised her it wasn’t safe for her to carry a third child, Kardashian announced she and West were using a surrogate to have another baby.

“The connection with our baby came instantly and it’s as if she was with us the whole time,” Kardashian said in a post describing what it was like welcoming her baby girl into the world.

“Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it’s the easy way out is completely wrong,” she wrote. “People assume it’s better because you don’t have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint.”chicago west sounds like a nbc show that's a ripoff of law & order svu that debuted in the fall of 2007 that came on from 9:30 pm est. that only lasted one season because of bad ratings that returned in 2009 only to be cancelled again the following year“With all due respect, Congressman, unless you have specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to ... make that assertion.

“I wouldn’t work with him again,” Firth, who starred in Allen’s 2014 film “Magic in the Moonlight,” told the Guardian. He spoke up on Thursday, the same day that Farrow gave her first television interview accusing Allen of sexually assaulting her in 1992, when she was 7 years old.

“As a 7-year-old, I would say he touched my private parts,” she told CBS’ Gayle King. “As a 32-year-old, he touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.”

The allegations originally came out in the early 1990s during an acrimonious child custody battle between Allen and then-partner actress Mia Farrow. In 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote about the incident in The New York Times, after Allen received a Golden Globe lifetime achievement award.

Her allegations have received renewed attention amid the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, with several actors responding that they now regret working with Allen and would not have done so had they fully known about Farrow’s story.

But women have disproportionately borne the weight of conversations about sexual misconduct. Firth, for example, is one of the only leading men to speak out about Allen.

In October, actor Griffin Newman, who briefly appears in Allen’s forthcoming movie “A Rainy Day in New York,” said that he regretted his decision to work with the director and that he would donate his salary to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).

- I believe he is guilty.

Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!Carl Higbie, the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service, resigned Thursday after CNN unearthed a litany of offensive and discriminatory remarks he’d made on various radio segments.

Formerly a surrogate for President Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, as well as a former spokesman for the Great America PAC, the retired Navy SEAL was appointed to work in the federal body that oversees volunteer groups like AmeriCorps a mere six months ago.

In the segments, which occurred as recently as 2016, Higbie employs a number of offensive stereotypes about minorities, saying that black people suffer from a “lax of morality” and that they “think that breeding is a form of employment.” He also accused soldiers with PTSD of having a “weak mind.” And he claimed that people should have the right to shoot at immigrants “in the face” if they attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

“Somebody who lives in my condo association that has five kids, and it’s her and her husband with the five kids and the mother, the grandmother of the kids, and they don’t have jobs, they’re there all the time ― I bet you can guess what color they are ― and they have no job,” Higbie said on one episode of “Sound of Freedom,” an internet talk radio show, according to clips discovered by CNN’s KFile.

Higbie also made a number of highly inflammatory comments about gay people and Muslims.

“Rhode Island, land of more liberals, has just OK’ed, gay marriage,” Higbie said in a May 2013 “Sound of Freedom” clip. “Congratuf’in’lations, you suck, Rhode Island. Why would you do that? Go ahead and twist the knife a little, little bit more. I mean, you are breaking the morals, the moral fiber of our country. You know, I don’t like gay people. I just don’t.”

The next month, he said of Muslims: “Go back to your Muslim shithole and go crap in your hands and bang little boys on Thursday nights.” He added: “I just don’t like Muslim people. People always rip me a new one for that. Carl, you’re racist, you can’t, you’re sexist. I’m like Jesus Christ. I just don’t like Muslim people because their ideology sucks.”

Higbie made headlines in November 2016 when he cited the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II― considered a low point in American history― in defending the Trump transition team’s idea to create a registry of Muslim immigrants.

”The president needs to protect America first, and if that means having people that are not protected under our Constitution have some sort of registry so we can understand ― until we can identify the true threat and where it’s coming from ― I support it,” said Higbie.Bad boys, whatcha gonna do when Gabrielle Union comes for you?

NBC has ordered a pilot for a spinoff TV series starring Union that’s inspired by the “Bad Boys” films, trade publications reported Thursday. Deadline first reported the series was in the works in October.

Union appeared in the 2003 “Bad Boys” sequel as undercover DEA operative Sydney “Syd” Barrett alongside leads Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The actress will reprise her role for the TV series, which picks up the buddy-cop mantle of the films with a focus on Syd’s new role as an LAPD detective working with partner Nancy McKenna, whose casting has not been announced.

The series will be executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the “Bad Boys” films.

In “Bad Boys II,” Union’s character Syd was Lawrence’s on-screen sister and Smith’s main love interest, but the network has not announced whether the actors will make appearances in the show.WASHINGTON ― A lot of unglamorous work goes into running the salad bar in the basement of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, from cleaning off the sneeze guards to picking up all the lettuce that senators and their staffers drop during the lunch rush. Immigrants like Raquel Guzman do much of that labor.

Originally from El Salvador, Guzman has worked in the Senate for the last 10 years, scraping by as she and her husband, a janitor at Whole Foods, try to raise four children in suburban Washington. But last week, the 37-year-old learned that as far as the U.S. government is concerned, her services will no longer be needed.

Guzman has been working legally under what’s known as temporary protected status, a program that has allowed nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to remain in the U.S. since 2001, when their native country was rocked by devastating earthquakes. The Trump administration, which has vowed to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration, announced Jan. 8 that it will end the TPS program for Salvadorans next year, meaning people like Guzman will lose their work permits and face deportation.

The U.S. government expects Guzman and her husband to return to a country they haven’t seen in nearly two decades. And if they go, they will have to decide whether to bring their children or leave them behind.

“I have never asked anything of the government,” said Guzman, who came to the U.S. in 2000. Seated at a Senate cafeteria table after a recent shift, she spoke in Spanish through an interpreter and at times wiped tears from her face. “We have just worked the whole time. We’re not doing any harm to anybody.”

The Washington area is home to an estimated 32,000 TPS holders from El Salvador ― the largest such concentration in the nation. Low-wage Salvadorans with TPS protections serve members of Congress and White House officials every day, whether the latter realize it or not. These workers bus the tables at fancy K Street restaurants. They park the cars in expensive garages. They vacuum the downtown office buildings long after dark. And they pick up the mess left behind at the Senate salad bar.

So while the imminent end of TPS has left Salvadorans around the country with wrenching decisions to make, the federal government’s about-face comes with a dose of painful irony for Washington-area workers like Guzman: They’re being given the boot by the political elite for whom they’ve labored many years.

“I have never asked anything of the government. We have just worked the whole time.” - Raquel Guzman

“The whole time I have worked ― day and night,” said Maria Fuentes, another TPS recipient from El Salvador who cleans the tables and floors in the Dirksen cafeteria. Like Guzman, Fuentes has spent a decade picking up after Senate power brokers. She has two grown children who also have been shielded by TPS and will face deportation, she said.

Although there are no official statistics on how many Salvadoran workers with TPS status are employed on federal properties in and around Washington, the number is “significant,” according to Paco Fabian, a spokesman for Good Jobs Nation, a labor group that’s been organizing low-wage workers employed under federal contracts. That makes the U.S. government as much a beneficiary of TPS labor as many a private janitorial company, construction firm or restaurant.

Guzman and Fuentes, who are both members of Good Jobs Nation, said they know other TPS workers inside the Senate buildings as well as at the Supreme Court, just across the street. All of them work for contractors rather than directly for the government, they said.

“If they’re good enough to work in federal buildings, and they’re good enough to serve senators and members of Congress, then they should be good enough to stay in this country,” said Fabian.

Nationwide, Salvadorans make up more than half of the roughly 300,000 immigrants living in the U.S. under TPS. The White House has already said it is also dropping protections for those from Haiti, Sudan and Nicaragua. Within the next year, it will have to decide the fate of immigrants from Honduras. Aside from TPS, the administration has also ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded from deportation young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

The Trump administration notes that TPS protections were never meant to be permanent, and that the earthquakes that plunged El Salvador into chaos happened 17 years ago. But the beneficiaries of the program have put down deep roots in the U.S. after years of working legally ― many of them, like Guzman, raising children who are U.S. citizens and have never set foot in El Salvador.

That country’s leaders say it is not prepared for the return of thousands of TPS holders. El Salvador, which has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, is still a dangerous place for many of those who fled. Fuentes said her husband was murdered in El Salvador in 1993. Guzman said she and several family members left after it became clear that her nephew’s life was in danger.

Guzman and her husband have had agonizing discussions about breaking up their family. If either or both of them are to be deported, should their three children who are U.S. citizens remain in Washington?

Her 6-year-old daughter is worried, she said. “She doesn’t know El Salvador. She doesn’t want to go.”

The Trump administration said it expects Salvadorans with TPS to either secure legal residency or leave the country when their protections expire. Neither Guzman nor Fuentes has one of the most promising routes to parole: a child at least 21 years old who is a citizen and can petition for the parent to stay. Immigration advocates are pressuring Congress to provide TPS recipients like them with new protections, such as eligibility for green cards. So far, there are no signs of a bipartisan fix.

“The whole time I have worked -- day and night.” - Maria Fuentes

Both women suspect they will stay in the U.S. until they are forced out. Their predicament hints at a likely scenario for many who can’t secure legal status in the coming months: to remain and work undocumented under the fear of deportation, rather than split up families and return to a country where their connections have frayed.

Some of those immigrants will inevitably lose their jobs if the companies they work for won’t employ people without work permits. But that doesn’t mean they’ll leave the labor pool, especially when the economy is humming at full employment, said Abel Nunez, director of D.C.’s Central American Resource Center, a legal aid group for immigrants.

“They will lose the ability to be in the formal workforce and go underground,” Nunez said. “They are not leaving. They will have to figure out how to re-engage with the informal work world. They will be more susceptible to abuse and earn lower wages.”

“It’s going to be an incredible disruption of family life and economic activity,” he added.

Salvadorans constitute a significant chunk of Washington’s construction and hospitality workforces. That means with the end of TPS, many employers will have to train new workers to fill the roles of the experienced ones they lay off. Even jobs commonly thought of as “unskilled” still require skills, and someone who has prepped and cleaned the salad bar in the Senate basement for years is probably pretty good at it.Reddit has an entire “Shower Thoughts” subreddit dedicated to “the miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.” In honor of those weird, wonderful and sometimes profound musings, here are 25 of the best posts from the last week:“Dancing With The Stars” pro Cheryl Burke says she stands with the Olympic athletes who this week are delivering victim impact statements at the sentencing hearing for their abuser, former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.

“I’ve been following what has happened with the US women’s gymnastics team and wanted to take a minute to commend these young women for sharing their stories,” Burke, who was molested as a child, wrote on Instagram.

“I too have had to sit in a court room in front of the man who sexually abused me and share my experiences.”

The post was captioned "#MeToo.”

A post shared by Cheryl Burke (@cherylburke) on Jan 18, 2018 at 3:04pm PST

Burke shared her experience as a child victim of sexual abuse in a 2015 TLC documentary, “Breaking the Silence.” She eventually testified against a 60-something neighbor, who cared for her while her mother was working.

“He would cuddle me, he would make me watch pornographic videos. He was kind of like that fatherly figure ― I think he knew my weakness, that I was very insecure,” Burke said in the documentary. “He knew that no one was ever around.”

She added: “He would have me come sit next to him and make him feel comfortable because sometimes he would feel lonely. ... I couldn’t speak up for myself. It was hard for me to say no. In a weird way it was like I didn’t want to hurt him.”

The abuser was caught attempting to molest one of Burke’s friends. Burke was 6 when she testified against him.

The sentencing hearing for Nassar began on Tuesday and may continue into Monday as 105 victims and family members are scheduled to read victim impact statements. Nassar, already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges, faces a minimum of 25 additional years imprisonment in exchange for his guilty plea to molestation charges.

Olympian McKayla Maroney had her statement against Nassar read aloud by Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis on Thursday.

“He abused my trust. He abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away,” Maroney said in the statement.Rapper Offset faces an ongoing social media backlash even after apologizing for homophobic lyrics.

The Migos member was featured on YFN Lucci’s new song “Boss Life,” in which he delivers the line, “Pinky ring crystal clear, 40K spent on a private Lear / 60K solitaire / I cannot vibe with queers.”

The song came out in December, but criticism of the lyrics grew this week. While many LGBTQ people have moved to reclaim the word “queer” in recent years, the way Offset used the word has many people furious.

Look, nobody is asking Offset to enroll in a Queer Theory 101 class, but if you’re going to be working with and deriving your style from the LGBTQ+ community, it’s best to take five minutes and educate yourself on the basics, like what is and is not considered hate speech. — DJBooth (@DJBooth) January 18, 2018

Offset said he was sorry Thursday on Instagram, insisting that he hadn’t intended to offend anyone. His post included a screenshot showing some of the dictionary definitions for “queer” and a lengthy explanation of why he chose the term.

“When I wrote that I was thinking of words that could rhyme with others (here, lear, solitaire, bear),” he wrote. He added that by “queer,” he didn’t “mean someone who’s gay.”

Offset said “queer” just so happened to rhyme with the other words he was using. He claimed that he was actually referring to paparazzi and “lame people who film you, post it and stalk you.”

He also apologized on his Instagram story, saying he loves his fans regardless of race or sexuality.

Some people on Twitter pointed out that Offset’s response focused on alternate uses of the word “queer,” rather than his own lack of sensitivity and the most obvious interpretation of his lyrics.

talking to straight men about homophobia always feels like trying to communicate entirely in wingdings. someone could blatantly say "I don't vibe with queers" and they'll still be like "I don't see... where... he was homophobic...??" — JuanPa (@jpbrammer) January 18, 2018

So I got a question. Did Offset know the dictionary definition of "Queer" before he wrote the verse or did he only knew it because he was under fire? 🤔 — Mrs. Dabney 💖 (@xChuChie) January 18, 2018

This is also not the first time the Migos trio has riled the LGBTQ community.

In a 2017 Rolling Stone interview, Migos member Quavo seemed to condemn openly gay rapper iLoveMakonnen for coming out when he said, “The world is fucked up.”

Following media condemnation, Quavo gave an apology similar to Offset’s, saying that his comment was taken out of context. He claimed that the world’s prejudice, not Makonnen, was the subject of his disdain.

There were also rumors last year that the trio refused to appear with drag queens during a “Saturday Night Live” performance with Katy Perry. The group’s label, Capitol Music, called the accusation “completely false and fabricated” although drag queens there that night said the allegations were true.
