Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee lit up the stage at the Grammy Awards on Sunday with a hot-and-heavy performance of their record-breaking hit “Despacito.”

The Puerto Rican artists’ performance brought the summer heat to New York City’s Madison Square Garden. Dancers twerked to the reggaeton single as the star-studded audience sang along, and the duo received a standing ovation at the end.

The performance also got “Despacito” trending on Twitter. Donnie Wahlberg commented on a clip of him getting down to the song, and others simply expressed excitement that the original version of the single ― that is, the one sans Justin Bieber ― had been performed.Harvey Weinstein arrives at the New York Police Department's 1st Precinct to turn himself in on May 25, 2018.

The best way to watch Harvey Weinstein walk himself into a Manhattan police precinct on Friday morning was via NBC News’ Periscope.

As the former Oscar-winning Hollywood producer and “king of indie film” marched from his black car into the police station, NBC correspondent Craig Melvin began naming some of the 95 women who have come forward with allegations against Weinstein ― Lucia Evans, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong’o, Uma Thurman, Salma Hayek. Reaction icons started floating up the right side of the screen, little hearts of different colors, one after another after another, until they formed a cloud of “likes.”

We, the people of the internet, were engaging in a collective act of schadenfreude, and it was delicious.

Women are so often told to contain our anger, to make it more palatable, less “aggressive,” small enough to contain within the male prerogative. But I’m angry at men like Harvey Weinstein, and there’s nothing palatable about it.

The man who beckoned young women to his hotel rooms for the sole purpose of using them, who hired ex-Mossad agents to track anyone liable to expose him, who had vast resources at his fingertips and used them liberally to try to silence the dozens of women he (allegedly) victimized ― even that man is no longer untouchable.

“One phone call and you’re done.”



“I have eyes and ears everywhere.”



“I’m Harvey Weinstein, you know what I can do.”



Not anymore. https://t.co/j3x8njJZWJ — jodikantor (@jodikantor) May 24, 2018

That man had to walk past reporters as he entered a police station, submitting to the cheap cop pornography of the perp walk. That man looked haggard and tilted his head low to avoid eyes and questions. That man also carried two books with him into the police station, biographies of Big Men in Show Biz — Elia Kazan, and Rodgers and Hammerstein — because he is, after all, exactly the kind of prick who fancies himself both a legend and a victim of a pious mob. That man was charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.

It is still shocking to see powerful men face criminal charges for harming women, and even more shocking to see them convicted. And the process leading up to that ― the public offerings of private pain (hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers …), the scrutiny of that pain, the way it’s picked apart and held up to the light and valued according to how neatly it can be added to a pile of other women’s pain ― is not a pretty one. The rapid rise of the Me Too movement has been exhilarating to witness but also exhausting.

There are few moments of relief when an eternity of systemic abuse is being unpacked and processed. When those moments do present themselves, your instinct is to seize them like a prize. Weinstein is the man behind some of the most recognizable films of my lifetime, but surely the footage many of us will most remember him for is Friday’s walk. A big man in a blue sweater, displayed like any other perp for our delectation, tokens of self-pity and self-regard in the crook of his arm.

As Rose McGowan tweeted Friday morning: “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.”President Donald Trump on Monday personally thanked the man responsible for wrestling a gun from a shooter at a Waffle House in Tennessee last month.

Trump had a phone call with James Shaw Jr., 29, on Monday morning to “commend his heroic actions and quick thinking,” White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said during a daily press briefing.

“Mr. Shaw saved lives when he wrestled a gun from an active shooter who had opened fire,” Shah said.

Shaw has been hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming a man as he shot up a Waffle House restaurant outside Nashville, Tennessee. Four people were killed in the shooting, and two others were injured, but police said Shaw’s actions likely prevented many others from being shot.

Shaw, who has a 4-year-old daughter, has raised over $240,000 for the victims of the Waffle House shooting. He met on Saturday with Never Again activists and survivors of the Parkland, Florida, shooting for what one of the attendees called a “legendary breakfast.”

Tennessee State University, Shaw’s alma mater, held a ceremony this month to honor him and announce the creation of a scholarship in his name. The reluctant hero has insisted that anybody under the same circumstances could do what he did.

“I was just trying to save myself. I did this with no recognition,” he said at the Tennessee State University event. “But it seems like it inspired so many people throughout the world. For that, I am greatly, greatly appreciative. To all of you, thank you.”Rihanna is a melodic goddess who we are fortunate to have walking among us and her Grammy look Sunday night was one more reminder of that.

After skipping the red carpet, Rihanna turned heads when she hit the stage in a high-shine trench coat with Kendrick Lamar to accept the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for their collaboration on “Loyalty.” The award was Rihanna’s ninth Grammy.

The trench, worn as a dress with slouched boots and gloves, made Twitter go wild:

The singer and actress introduced Kesha’s powerful performance by standing in solidarity with the “Time’s Up” initiative, which was created to combat sexual harassment and assault across all industries. Monáe, who has been an outspoken advocate for social justice, showed her support with a “Time’s Up” pin and white rose.

“Tonight I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry,” Monáe told the crowd. “Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers, women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business.”

Monáe asked women and men to work together “as a united music industry” to combat sexual harassment and assault, and to promote fair and safe work environments.

“To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time’s up. We say time’s up for pay inequality. Time’s up for discrimination. Time’s up for harassment of any kind. And time’s up for the abuse of power,” she said. “Because, you see, it’s not just going on in Hollywood. It’s not just going on in Washington. It’s right here in our industry as well. And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us well.”

On Sunday, Baldwin compared Farrow’s allegations to the fake rape claims made against a black man in the novel To Kill a Mockingbird:

1 of the most effective things Dylan Farrow has in her arsenal is the “persistence of emotion.” Like Mayella in TKAM, her tears/exhortations r meant 2 shame u in2 belief in her story.

But I need more than that before I destroy some1, regardless of their fame.

I need a lot more. — ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 28, 2018

If my defense of Woody Allen offends you, it’s real simple.

Unfollow.

Condemn.

Move on. — ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 28, 2018

The defense was odd because racism wasn’t involved in Allen’s case as it was in the book. Also, there was an implication in the book that the woman making the fake rape claim may have been sexually assaulted by her father.

Earlier this month, Baldwin called the “renunciation” of Allen “unfair and sad.” He said Allen was “investigated forensically” and that “no charges were filed.” However, at the time, the state attorney said there was probable cause to charge Allen, but he didn’t want to put Dylan through the pain of a trial, Vanity Fair reported.

Earlier this month, Baldwin defended Allen after Farrow, 32, went public with her sexual assault claims. Farrow said that when she was 7 years old, Allen took her to the attic, instructed her to lie on her stomach and play with a train set while he touched her labia and vulva with his finger.

“I loved my father. I respected him. He was my hero,” Farrow said. “That doesn’t obviously take away from what he did. But it does make the betrayal and the hurt that much more intense.”

AdvertisementJames Gallant, a retired emergency physician who serves pro bono as the medical director of the Hope Life Center in Sterling, Illinois, a crisis pregnancy center, doesn’t offer abortions, and doesn’t want to tell women who visit his facility that they can get them elsewhere. Doing so — which is required under a 2016 state law — would violate Gallant’s religious freedom, he says. Earlier this month the Thomas More Society, a pro-life nonprofit law firm, filed a federal complaint on his behalf with President Donald Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services. In the complaint, the firm claims this requirement flies in the face of federal laws that exempt health care providers from participating in abortions if they claim a religious objection.

But far more than Gallant’s conscience could be at stake. He maintains that federal funding for health and safety net programs for Illinois residents is contingent on the protection of his wall-to-wall conscience rights. Although they have never been applied so broadly, federal conscience protection laws may allow for this radical application, according to legal experts — and it’s up to a bevy of sympathetic bureaucrats Trump has installed at HHS to decide. If Gallant prevails, Illinois could lose federal funding for a whole range of social welfare services, from Medicare and Medicaid to food stamps, welfare, and Head Start — all because one man didn’t want to tell women where they can obtain abortions.

Gallant’s argument is novel. A state’s federal funding for essential health care programs has never been withheld under these laws. Past complaints have simply resulted in narrow settlements exempting the complainants from having to provide whatever services they object to. But Gallant’s complaint asserts that he “cannot, in conscience,” even refer women to providers of abortion procedures. (A spokesman for the Thomas More Society did not respond to interview requests.)

Gallant’s is just one of a rush of similar complaints HHS has received since Trump’s election. Under President Obama, the department received only a handful of complaints citing federal conscience protection laws. These laws include the 1973 Church Amendment, which requires federally funded health care facilities to allow providers to opt out of participating in abortion, sterilization or other procedures to which they have religious or moral objections; the 1996 Coats-Snow Amendment, which extends those protections to medical students and residents; and the 2004 Weldon Amendment, which extends these conscience exemptions related to abortion to a broader range of “health care entities.” Obama’s HHS infuriated conservative lawmakers and activists because — they maintained — it was slow to act on those complaints, or closed investigations without finding violations.

But the complaint procedure, managed by HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, is now controlled by Trump political appointees who want to more vigorously enforce conscience protection laws, and who are actively seeking more complaints. A year ago, Gallant’s complaint would have been a non-starter; now it will receive a sympathetic, if not enthusiastic, hearing.

How we got here

The Illinois law Gallant objects to is an amendment to the Health Care Right of Conscience Act, a 1998 law that exempts health care providers in the state from having to perform abortions or other reproductive health procedures they say violate their consciences. But the law produced some unintended consequences. Some Catholic hospitals refused to provide care to women who were miscarrying even when the patient’s health was at risk and the fetus would not survive. The Illinois legislature, under a Democratic majority, passed the referral requirement in 2016 to protect patients’ timely access to care.

Lorie Chaiten, director of the Reproductive Rights Project at the ACLU of Illinois, called the amendment a big step forward for Illinois women; no longer would they “need to worry that they are being denied medical information based on their health care provider’s religious beliefs.” Under the amended law, objectors like Gallant may still opt out from performing procedures they morally object to; they are simply required to refer the patient to another facility.

Anti-abortion medical doctors, crisis pregnancy centers, and Christian right advocacy groups swiftly condemned the amendment as a fresh attempt to discriminate against them for their religious beliefs. Within days, Alliance Defending Freedom — the legal powerhouse that recently argued Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission before the Supreme Court — filed suit against the amendment, arguing it violated the constitutional rights of doctors and crisis pregnancy centers. In July 2017, both state and federal courts entered preliminary injunctions, barring the state, for now, from enforcing the law.

Now Gallant, and other like-minded doctors, have extended this challenge to HHS — hoping to put much of the federal funding for their states at risk.

Stacking the deck

At HHS, the Office for Civil Rights is charged with enforcing anti-discrimination laws, health privacy laws, and conscience laws, and protecting access to health care for vulnerable groups. Over the past year, Trump has stacked that office with a legion of anti-abortion rights activists who share the belief that the conscience rights of conservative Christians are under siege by laws protecting access to health care for women and trans people ― and that conscience protections should become an OCR priority.

Christian rights activists are still seething over their frustration with how Obama’s OCR handled such complaints. During the final Obama years, the head of the office was Jocelyn Samuels, a seasoned civil rights attorney who had come from the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. She was running the show when three complaints arrived from a group of California churches and other Christian institutions, charging that the State of California had violated the Weldon Amendment when it reminded insurance companies of their obligation under California law to cover abortion procedures. One of the complaints was brought by Casey Mattox and Matthew Bowman, then both attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), together with an attorney from the Life Legal Defense Foundation.

Because the health insurers themselves had no objection to offering the coverage, Samuels found no Weldon violation, and closed the investigation in June 2016.

It was a call to the barricades. Mattox accused the Obama administration of “making a mockery of the law” and vowed that ADF would “continue to defend churches from this clear violation of the First Amendment and federal law and call on Congress to hold HHS accountable.”

Bowman, Mattox’s co-counsel on the case, is now deputy general counsel at HHS, where part of his job is providing legal advice to OCR.

At the helm of Trump’s OCR is Roger Severino, who previously ran the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the conservative Heritage Foundation. At Heritage, Severino wrote frequently in defense of conscience clauses and specifically derided actions taken by Obama’s OCR. He also attacked an Obama-era regulation that protects transgender people from discrimination in health care as a threat to religious conscience. Enforcement of that regulation is now his responsibility at OCR.

After Severino was named to the post in March, 12 Democratic senators, led by Washington’s Patty Murray, wrote to then-HHS Secretary Tom Price, saying they were “deeply troubled” about the decision, citing Severino’s “long history of making bigoted statements toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and attacking women’s access to health care services and reproductive rights.” They charged Severino’s “past statements, writings, and affiliations make him unqualified to lead an office whose purpose is to ensure that ‘people have equal access and opportunities to participate in certain health care and human services programs without unlawful discrimination.’”

But Christian right activists saw Severino’s history as an asset. In their view, the Obama administration had a distorted approach to combating discrimination, focused on protecting women’s reproductive choices and health care access for trans people. Severino now had an opportunity to focus OCR enforcement on what they saw as the real threat: efforts to curtail the religious freedom of health care providers.

When Severino was appointed, Matthew Franck of the Witherspoon Institute, a conservative think tank, told the Catholic News Agency that Severino, “a seasoned champion of religious liberty and the pro-life cause,” was “just the right person to correct the course of HHS’s efforts at enforcing anti-discrimination principles in federal law.” Franck expressed optimism that Severino would restore OCR’s “true mission.”

Bowman has also shown himself to be a dedicated proponent of more vigorous conscience protections. At a panel discussion at the Catholic Information Center just days before the 2016 election, for example, Bowman accused Obama’s OCR of seeking to turn every health care facility in the United States into an abortion clinic. “This is a serious issue about whether health care professionals, whether health care facilities, will be able to practice medicine consistent with their beliefs,” he said. Under “the view, apparently, of the HHS OCR, all women who are pregnant will have to have their babies delivered at abortion clinics. Because there will only be abortion clinics because all Catholic hospitals will be abortion clinics, everyone has to do abortions.”

Once installed, Severino hired staff from leading Christian rights organizations with track records advocating for religious protections for people who oppose abortion and LGBTQ rights. For chief of staff, he hired March Bell, whose previous appointments included serving as staff director and chief counsel for the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, an investigative committee House Republicans launched in 2015 in the wake of the release of deceptive Planned Parenthood videos by the Center for Medical Progress. The committee’s goal, in the words of its chair, Marsha Blackburn, was to guarantee that “not one cent of taxpayer money” goes to “big abortion businesses.” Severino brought on Justin Butterfield as a senior adviser; Butterfield had been senior counsel at First Liberty Institute, an anti-LGBTQ law firm based in Texas who helped prepare a report last fall, provided to President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress, that claimed to document 1,400 religious liberty violations over the past year.

Severino has brought on other conservative activists on a contract basis, including Mandi Ancalle, a veteran activist with a detailed understanding of the Christian right’s wish list for the Trump administration. Ancalle, who went from being general counsel for government affairs at the Family Research Council to being a contract policy advisor at OCR, told the Values Voters Summit in September 2016 that she was “working to generate a comprehensive list” of policy priorities for a potential Trump administration that included reviving a Bush-era conscience rule, rescinded by Obama, that exempted health care workers from treating women, LGBTQ people or others based on religious objections. At the summit, Ancalle reiterated the Christian right’s opposition to Obama-era regulations protecting transgender patients from discrimination in health care, according to a report on the gathering by People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy organization.

The hiring blitz is still underway. OCR is currently seeking an attorney advisor to work on matters concerning “free exercise of religion, conscience protections, and protections against certain kinds of coercion or religious discrimination.” HHS did not respond to a request for comment about OCR hiring.

“Open for business” for the Christian right

The social conservatives Trump hired at HHS’ civil rights office have moved quickly to transform the organization. On Jan. 18, Severino announced the creation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division at OCR. In remarks in the department’s Great Hall to an audience of some 150 HHS staffers and selected guests, Severino took aim at his predecessors and promised an entirely new political culture in the agency.

HHS, Severino told the appreciative audience, “has not always been the best keeper” of religious liberty. But “times are changing,” he said, at the agency and beyond. “We’re institutionalizing a change in the culture of government, beginning with HHS, to never forget that religious freedom is primary freedom, that it is a civil right that deserves complete enforcement and respect.” And he touted how the new division will expand the office’s enforcement of federal laws — particularly the Church and Weldon amendments invoked in Gallant’s complaint.

During the entirety of the Obama years, Severino added, the office received only 10 complaints of conscience violations. But since Trump’s election, he said, OCR has received 34. Among them are two complaints ADF filed last September, one on behalf of doctors like Gallant at crisis pregnancy centers in Illinois, as well as another on behalf of a crisis pregnancy center in Hawaii over a similar law. Both served as models for Gallant’s complaint, piloting the claim that the states were putting their federal funding in jeopardy by adding patient protections to conscience laws. (ADF did not respond to an interview request.)

The flood of complaints appears to be part of a concerted effort to take advantage of Severino’s tenure at OCR: On Jan. 9, the Family Research Council, a national Christian rights advocacy group, put out an action alert to its followers, urging them to file their own complaints with OCR.

“For eight years, former President Obama’s administration turned a blind eye to these injustices, despite numerous federal laws protecting pro-life conscience rights,” wrote David Christensen, the organization’s vice president for governmental affairs. “To stop these injustices, President Trump’s administration needs pro-life Americans who have been directly harmed to file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Civil Rights (OCR).” The email then offered a tutorial on how to file a complaint.

The word is out that the Trump-era OCR is “open for business,” Severino bragged on Jan. 18. He said he was launching the new division because of a “rise of complaints on religious freedom and conscience,” as if the uptick had been spontaneous, and then declared the urgent need for “an institutional force” “to deal with them, and to vindicate peoples’ rights when they have been violated.”

Last week, HHS published a federal notice officially establishing the new division and made public its proposed regulations. The notice describes sweeping powers, beyond the scope of Weldon, Church, and Coats-Snow, to conduct “nationwide enforcements” and to provide “conscience and religious freedom technical assistance” to everyone from federal staff to health care providers, religious organizations, nonprofits, and state and local governments.

The proposed rules appear to be “a direct attack on women and LGBT health,” said Susan Berke Fogel, director of reproductive health at the National Health Law Program, a health care advocacy group. Under these proposals, she said, “it appears that anyone can refuse to do anything remotely related to health care. If these regulations are adopted, the result will be severe disruption in the orderly delivery of health care services, and tremendous damage to people’s lives, dignity, and health.”

Illinois and other states whose funding could be at stake can take some comfort in the fact that OCR isn’t the final arbiter of these complaints. Even if Gallant and the others were to prevail in that office, their cases would likely be litigated in court, Fogel said. But social conservatives are engaged in a pincer move: If a plaintiff like Gallant prevails in court, Fogel said, that could have a “chilling effect” on states that consider laws like Illinois’ that protect access to reproductive health care. If a plaintiff like Gallant loses in court, proponents of conscience exemptions would likely use that as evidence that Church and Weldon are insufficient and that Congress needs to pass a more vigorous law. “I don’t think there is any question that this is politically motivated to push the Congress” to expand federal conscience protections, Fogel said.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has lent his support to one such bill, the Conscience Protection Act, which was introduced in 2016 and reintroduced last year. The measure would give health care providers like Gallant the right to sue for damages, including from a governmental entity, in court. The bill is seen by its proponents as a more robust remedy than the current options: filing a complaint at OCR or seeking a court injunction. It also puts Christians’ grievances on par with those of protected classes, who can already sue over discrimination for damages and attorneys’ fees.

But rather than protect citizens’ freedom of religion, civil rights attorneys argue that Severino’s new division could herald a reversal in civil rights gains. The new division appears to be designed “to prioritize defending the rights of health care professionals to deny care” rather than “focusing on the goals of the civil rights laws to expand access to health coverage and to eliminate barriers for vulnerable people, communities that have been subjected to discrimination over time,” Samuels, Severino’s predecessor, said in an interview.

Yet Severino and his allies portray themselves as the true civil rights heroes. At the Jan. 18 rollout, which took place just days after Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, Severino and others invoked King’s legacy to support their claim that people who oppose abortion or LGBTQ rights on religious grounds are the real victims of discrimination. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca.) one of three Republican lawmakers in attendance, accused the Obama administration of engaging in a “silent refusal to defend our rights” and praised Severino’s new division.

HHS is finally “treating people fairly and with justice,” McCarthy said. “What a difference one year makes.”If you can’t stop thinking about amazing food, exciting excursions and Insta-worthy pics, then you’re probably craving a vacation. Badly. But if tourists, crowds and lines make you anxious, why not take the road less traveled? (You are a trendsetter, after all.) Here, the best destinations, according Lonely Planet, for an off-the-beaten-path vacay.

1. Indonesia

While everyone’s trying to ride elephants in Thailand, you’ll be sprawled out with all the room in the world on a pink-colored beach on Lombok Island (we also hear you should rent a motorbike to get to Tanjung Aan beach, which is especially gorgeous and super secluded), taking a private hike up a volcanic peak in Bali, freaking out over komodo dragons in Flores or exploring the 14th-century Hindu temples of the Sacred Monkey Forest of Ubud.

Travel tip: Fly into Jakarta or Bali by way of Singapore, then take budget flights or local ferries to any of the surrounding 13,000 islands.

2. The Balkans

“Game of Thrones” fans can keep their Dubrovnik. The less-touristed ancient cobblestone village of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the medieval castle of Bran in Romania and the Accursed Mountains of Albania (yes, that’s their real name) feel just as steeped in history as King’s Landing Croatia. Yep, these Eastern European countries on the Balkan Peninsula have all the old-world charm and breathtaking scenery of a fairy-tale, but with fewer tourists than their Western counterparts (no offense, Italy).

Travel tip: Skip the slow-moving trains and commit to the widely used bus system, which connects many of the bigger towns as well as the smaller villages.

3. Taiwan

The tiny island just east of China is largely underrated by travelers, but don’t be fooled: The place is the perfect surf and turf, so to speak, for folks who can’t make up their minds. It’s got the beauty of the lush, green landscape of Yangmingshan National Park to the north, and the serene and placid waters of the more tropical Fulong Beach in the south stand in stark contrast to the cosmopolitan and skyscraper-filled city of Taipei.

Travel tip: Avoid going from June to August during the height of typhoon season. Instead, the best months for travel are October to February.

4. Jordan

Floating in the Dead Sea, exploring the ancient stone ruins of the “Rose City” of Petra and temple ruins of Jerash and riding on camels in the desert oasis of Wadi Rum are not to be missed. But travelers hoping for a more tropical vacay won’t be disappointed by the luxurious seaside resorts of the port town of Aqaba and the world-class snorkeling of the crystal-clear Red Sea.

Travel tip: Head to the world-wonder Petra, the ancient city that’s built into the canyon walls, as early as possible (it opens at 6 a.m.) to avoid the scorching heat of the afternoon.

5. Panama

Cancun and Cabo can keep their spring breakers and crowded beaches. We’ll just be over here learning to surf on Starfish Beach in gorgeous Bocas del Toro; touring the coffee farms, volcanoes and cloud forests of Chiriquí; and exploring the cobblestone plazas and historic cathedrals of the Old City while dining on local fare of empanadas and ceviche.

Travel tip: Try to avoid the extensive rainy season, which can last from April to December.

“Immediately after we got off we were ushered out along with everyone else, and the employees looked very concerned,” she wrote. “Many people had seen Ursula decapitated, including kids who understandably were upset.”

The voice in the clip saying “It’s broken” belonged to her 8-year-old brother, who she said was laughing about it, but other children cried.

“It was a pretty freaky thing to see,” she wrote.

Given the way the figure moves even without its head, it looks like Ursula was right all along: Don’t underestimate the importance of body language.

Ursula wasn’t the only Disney figure to lose its head this weekend. Images shared on social media from Disneyland Paris showed the auctioneer figure from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction also without a head:

So today at Disney, Ursula’s head fell off, AND the auctioneer’s head fell off.

The single’s remix, performed by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and featuring Justin Bieber, nearly became the first mostly Spanish-language song in Grammy history to win either record of the year or song of the year. The song had also been nominated in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category.

But by the end of music’s biggest night, “Despacito” had no more Grammys than it did at the start. The Recording Academy’s shutout of the single revealed just how hollow the often-uttered platitude “music is a universal language” actually is. Here’s why.

By nearly every measure, “Despacito” was the world’s biggest song of 2017. It not only broke nearly every record under the sun, but it finally made clear to the U.S. mainstream market the true power of Latin music on a global stage.

The single began its climb up the charts worldwide when Fonsi and Yankee released the original version in January 2017. It was already a global phenomenon by the time Bieber remixed the hit in April, catapulting it up the U.S. charts.

By the end of the year, “Despacito” had earned a total of 1.322 billion on-demand streams, according to Nielsen Music. Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You,” which won the Grammy for best pop solo performance on Sunday, came in a distant second place with 999.69 million streams.

And “Despacito” has only continued to dominate in 2018. As of Saturday, the track and remix is one of only 18 songs to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry of America ― and it’s the first Latin song ever to do so.

Even at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, the single stood out as the only song to be nominated for both record and song of the year, a first for a foreign-language hit since Los Lobos’ “La Bamba” received both nods 30 years ago. And still, it got snubbed in both categories.

“Despacito” was everywhere in 2017, and that wasn’t just a fad or a fluke. It was an overdue acknowledgement of the growing power that Latin music ― particularly Spanish-language urban music ― has around the world.

All other things being equal, Spanish-language music dominated worldwide in 2017 in a way that mainstream American music failed to. Six of YouTube’s top 10 music videos of the year were Spanish-language hits, and seven were by Latino artists.

On streaming platforms, the popularity of Latin music is undeniable. In December 2016, Spotify told Billboard that it only took two years for the “Baila Reggaetón” playlist to become the platform’s second most popular playlist globally.

“Last year at this time, we had 1.1 million subscribers. Today, we have 3.3 million,” Rocío Guerrero, Spotify’s global head of Latin content programming, told Billboard then. “It was a wake-up call for everyone. Now, Latin is a big priority for the company.”

There’s no debate that “Despacito” is worthy of a Grammy ― in fact, it netted four Latin Grammys in November, including song of the year and record of the year. If it had taken either of those major honors at Sunday night’s ceremony, it would have been the first foreign-language song to win in either category since “Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)” by Domenico Modugno won at the very first Grammy Awards in 1958.

This history of exclusion of foreign-language music from major categories suggests the Recording Academy doesn’t really view music as such a transcendent force. Because if music is really a universal language and it really knows no borders, then why do the Latin Grammys exist? The idea that the world, or even the country, can come together through music right now is crucial, if you ask Fonsi.

“The one thing about music is we can express ourselves through a song and kind of come together,” the Puerto Rican singer told HuffPost on the Grammys red carpet Sunday. “What ‘Despacito’ has done [is] to be able to break the language barrier, in a time when people, you know, they want to build walls and sort of separate and kind of forbid you from speaking your own language or celebrating your culture.”

It’s more important than ever to end the marginalization and segregation of Latin music in the industry ― and the Grammys’ inability to recognize that is devastating.

After the awards show, Rihanna headed out to New York City hotspot 1 OAK with her reported billionaire boyfriend, Hassan Jameel. Jameel is a Saudi heir whose family owns the rights to sell Toyota in Saudi Arabia and certain Middle Eastern countries, according to People.

Rih wore a gorgeous, flowy gold number for the night, which she paired with a gold choker, gold hoops and purple eyeshadow. Jameel opted for a grey sweatshirt and a black jacket.

While speaking at Fleetwood Mac’s MusiCares Person of the Year induction ceremony, Nicks mentioned Petty, who won the honor the previous year. The 69-year-old singer said that after last year’s ceremony, Petty spent a lot of time “talking to me about how important it was to him. And maybe he was talking about it because [he] was ill. He was not well.”

Just prior to the rock icon’s death in October, Petty had embarked on a tour with the Heartbreakers from mid- to late 2017 to commemorate their 40th anniversary as a band. According to Nicks, Petty “fought his way through that tour.”

“He should’ve canceled, and he should’ve just gone home and gone to the hospital. But not Tom. He was gonna go down that river. And so, God bless him, he finished his tour at the Hollywood Bowl. Three shows. And one week later he died — but he got down the river. So Tom, I know you’re standing next to me cause you always have been for so many years.”

Nicks also touched on the tremendous amount of grief she’s felt since Petty’s death, which his family confirmed earlier this month was caused by an accidental drug overdose.Chrissy Teigen and John Legend are expecting a baby boy!

The supermodel announced the exciting news via an Instagram post on Sunday night after the 2018 Grammy Awards.

A gay Mormon who became famous for his mixed-orientation marriage has announced that he’s divorcing his wife and hopes to fall in love with a man.

Mormon blogger Josh Weed was formerly a poster child for mixed-orientation marriages in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which views queer relationships as sinful. But in a blog post published last week, he said he came to realize that he could no longer be married to his partner, Laurel Weed, who is a straight woman.

Together, the pair also apologized to queer Mormons for the way their story “has been used to bully others.”

“We’re sorry for any degree that our existence, and the publicity of our supposedly successful marriage made you feel ‘less than’ as you made your own terribly difficult choices. And we’re sorry if our story made it easier for people in your life to reject you and your difficult path as being wrong,” the Jan. 25 blog read. “If this is you, we want you to know: you were right.”

“You listened to your gut and to God and did a brave, brave thing. Now I’m following your example.”

In 2012, Josh Weed wrote a viral blog post in which he came out as a gay Mormon who was “very happily” married to a straight woman. He wrote that his wife, a childhood friend, knew about his sexual orientation before they were married and that he decided to marry her because he believed in the doctrines of the Mormon church, wanted to have a traditional family and genuinely loved his wife.

The story attracted a flurry of media attention, leading to features on ABC’s “Nightline” and the VH1 reality television show “I’m Married To A...”

Now, he says his former approach toward queer sexuality was a “manifestation of lingering internalized homophobia.” While he believes his marriage was beautiful and he still thinks of his wife as his “very best friend,” the relationship contained an “undercurrent of pain” the pair were not able to see clearly for years, he said.

He also wrote that he had always thought of himself as a “broken straight person” ― someone who was meant to be straight and whom God would one day fix. But he realizes now that viewing himself as “fundamentally broken” has led to overwhelming sadness in his life and at times, to suicidal thoughts, he added.

“The things I talked about in my coming out post in 2012 weren’t false. The joy I felt was real! The love I felt was real, but something in me wanted to die,” he wrote. “It’s the thing that wants to die in all of us when we don’t have hope for attachment to a person we are oriented towards.”

After about 15 years of marriage, the idea of going for decades more without experiencing authentic romantic and sexual attachment was finally too great a burden to bear ― for both of them, the couple said.

In the post, Laurel Weed wrote about how being married to her husband had brought her both immeasurable joy and pain. There was a “void” in their connection, and it wasn’t just about sex, she wrote.

“Platonic love is simply not enough, no matter how much we hoped it was,” she said. “God designed us to need and want romantic attachment.”

A post shared by Josh Weed (@the_weed) on Jan 1, 2016 at 12:06am PST

The pair also wanted to acknowledge how their story had caused pain for others in the queer Mormon community.

When they went public with their story in 2012, Josh Weed said that he and his wife had “very little exposure” to gay people. But not long after their post went viral, they began to receive messages from queer Mormons about how the Weeds’ mixed-orientation marriage had been used as an impossible standard.

Kathy Carlston, a queer Mormon from Syracuse, Utah, told HuffPost she feels the Weeds have often spoken against their story being used as an example for other queer Mormons. Still, she said that didn’t prevent straight Mormons from holding it up as a standard and implying that, “if they can do it, so can you.”

Carlston said she had been publicly out of the closet for about a month when the Weeds’ original blog post went viral in 2012. At least 10 different members of her church sent it to her “as if they had given me the panacea for my gayness,” she said.

“I personally felt insulted and unheard, as none of those who had sent me the link had taken time to ask me what my experience had been like as a queer Mormon,” Carlston said. “Admittedly, the experience at the time was a bit humiliating. I had never found myself to be a lightning rod for folks to unleash their evangelizing before. It showed me a bit of what would lie ahead for me in the church: people who were uninformed or unconcerned about the realities and direness of the queer Mormon experience.”

In November 2015, the Mormon church clarified its approach toward same-sex relationships with a series of policy changes. Mormons in same-sex relationships were declared apostates. The church also resolved that the children of these couples would not be allowed to be baptized until they were 18, at which point they would need to move out of their parents’ home and disavow their parents’ relationship to be considered for membership in the church.

The church made its position on queer sexuality even clearer in 2016, when it updated a web page meant to serve as a resource for gay and lesbian Mormons and their allies. The website emphasized that the church believes it’s OK to be Mormon and gay ― as long as members don’t act out on what the church calls “same-sex attraction.” The page shares the stories of Mormons who identify as gay but have pledged to pursue a life of celibacy or who have committed themselves to mixed-orientation relationships.

“Entering into a mixed-orientation marriage or remaining celibate were held up as the only acceptable goal to achieve throughout my youth and young adult life, and continue to be held up as the standard,” Carlston told HuffPost.

A post shared by Josh Weed (@the_weed) on Oct 2, 2015 at 8:14pm PDT

In his post, Josh Weed wrote that this conservative religious approach toward queer sexuality was both cruel and dangerous. He said the church’s stance can fill queer Mormons with “self-loathing and internalized homophobia.”

“The thing that is most cruel to religious LGBTQIA folks is not the lack of partners, but the lack of hope for a partner—that is the thing that makes them want to die,” he wrote. “Not the loneliness, per se, but the decades and decades before them with no hope of attachment.”

“It is for this reason that comparisons of gay people to simply single people who have not married yet are so woefully lacking in nuance. I once heard the difference between these groups stated this way and it’s always stuck with me: single Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will fall in love with someone tomorrow; gay Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will never fall in love with someone.”

He said that he and his wife have felt that God is calling them to separate from each other and pursue true love. They hope to continue raising their children together. The plan is to acquire a property that will accommodate their family and “the addition of future partners if that time comes.”

He also said that he isn’t sure whether the Mormon church will continue to accept him or allow his two youngest children to be baptized if he ends up in a same-sex relationship. Still, he said he would like to be a part of the church, “though the institution itself might consider me an outsider,” he wrote.

Five years ago, he said, he believed that a gay person could choose to live the life of a straight person. But now he knows that isn’t possible without serious consequences to mental health.

Instead, he said he’s focusing on the things he can choose.

“I can choose to love Lolly with every ounce of love a gay man can have for a woman. And I can choose to find a partner and love him as well, adoring him and attaching to him in the beautiful way I was always intended to.”Potential models wait outside the office of Elite Model Management founder John Casablancas in 1983.

In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina.

The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions.

“He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”

Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]”

It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior.

Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.

“Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.”

Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.

Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.”

Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.

“A Culture Of Compliance”

Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.

Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.

Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.

“The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.”

(Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)

But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said.

Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.

At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men.

Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16.

Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were.

“I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”

Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”

Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”

John Casablancas, who died in 2013, was rumored to have slept with countless young women he represented, including a 14-year-old. (At 51, he married a 17-year-old model.) Here he is pictured with a group of his agency's models at an unspecified event in 1984. Time LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images

“Statutory Rape Is In Front Of My Face”

Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.

“As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.”

Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.

“When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.”

“There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.”

Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.”

Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.”

“I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.”

“The Culture Was: You Did What You Were Told”

Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.

“It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.”

Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room.

Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.”

Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.

“When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.”

Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance.

Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.”

The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.”

Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct.

“They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”

In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.

Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer.

“The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.”

“I’m Sick To My Stomach That I Was Part Of This Poison”

Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.”

“We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.”

Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost.

However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.”

As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”

Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.”

“I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.”

Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”

Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career.

“I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said.

Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world.

Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures.

But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.”

There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.”

Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.

“If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.”
