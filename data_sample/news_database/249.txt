The Miami Heat’s Dwyane Wade fired off at Laura Ingraham on Friday morning after she spewed vitriol at NBA players LeBron James and Kevin Durant, telling them they should “shut up and dribble” after the duo posted a video about Trump.

“They use to try and hide.. now the president has given everyone the courage to live their truths,” Wade tweeted.

“The Ingraham Angle” host went on a tear on Wednesday night over the latest episode of “Uninterrupted,” in which James said Trump doesn’t “give a fuck about the people.”

Ingraham called James’ take “R-rated” and “barely intelligible,” going so far as to insult him for trying to leave high school a year early to enter the NBA. (James actually ended up graduating from high school and joining the league afterward.)

“I’m numb to this commentary like ... must they run their mouths like that?”, Ingraham said.

She went on:

Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids. This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it’s always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball. Oh, and LeBron and Kevin? You’re great players, but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So, keep the political commentary to yourself. Or as someone once said, ‘shut up and dribble.’

(Of course, as one person on Twitter noted, no one voted for Ingraham either.)

James has been a frequent critic of Trump, calling him a “bum” on social media. But Ingraham learned you can’t assail one of the country’s most beloved athletes over his education without expecting some backlash.

Many people on social media criticized Ingraham’s comments, with some calling her out for racism:

This Laura Ingraham stuff really has me bothered. However you feel about LeBron James the player, he is an American success story and has given more back to kids and a city than any of us could ever imagine. Shame on you @IngrahamAngle — Steven Spector (@StevenSpector10) February 16, 2018

“Must they run their mouths like that?” @IngrahamAngle asked in her segment centered around calling @KingJames an uppity idiot.

Couple of things here.



a) This is racist as hell.



b) Trump is a D-list celebrity. So the idea that celebrities + athletes can't be political is disingenuous at best.



c) Has she ever heard Trump speak?



d) Laura Ingraham is trash. https://t.co/OmIJleEzZM — Anthony De Rosa 🗽 (@Anthony) February 16, 2018

The hate seething from Laura Ingraham over black men having opinions is really something else. We are living in a world now where you are not allowed to be critical of the president or a nationally televised state media host will run an entire segment on you. https://t.co/BcNpqhNeqb — Isaac Saul (@Ike_Saul) February 16, 2018

Your friendly reminder that while LeBron James might be an athlete, he's still an American. He has a Congressman, two Senators, and a President. He's eligible to vote, and he has just as much of a right to talk about politics as Laura Ingraham does. https://t.co/4dk5uPzSnb — Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) February 16, 2018

One of the most epic takedowns of Ingraham came from a recent Super Bowl LII winner, the Philadelphia Eagles’ Chris Long:

I’ll be replying to my own tweet with a collage of your network allowing political commentary from a few folks. https://t.co/WUGl1WQSLE — Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 16, 2018

I’m sure the network she works for has interviewed a bunch of athletes, just couldn’t find the screenshots quickly. The point is, what’s the prerequisite for who can talk politics? So, Fox News folks who agree with Laura... you okay with these segments? — Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 16, 2018

And if you reply “stick to sports,” you should probably tune of out Fox News because they’ve got karate guys talking climate change on there. (Which I’m cool with... it’s his right.) Unless it’s just about you needing to feel like you’ve got control of athletes like Lebron. — Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 16, 2018

Wade coming to James’ defense is no surprise, since the two are close friends. James congratulated Wade last week on Instagram for signing with the Miami Heat again.

In a statement sent via a Fox spokesperson, Ingraham said her remarks had no “racial intent” and she has been criticizing celebrities for speaking about politics for years.

In 2003, I wrote a New York Times bestseller called ‘Shut Up & Sing,’ in which I criticized celebrities like the Dixie Chicks & Barbra Streisand who were trashing then-President George W. Bush. I have used a variation of that title for more than 15 years to respond to performers who sound off on politics. I’ve told Robert DeNiro to ‘Shut Up & Act,’ Jimmy Kimmel to ‘Shut Up & Make Us Laugh,’ and just this week told the San Antonio Spurs’ Gregg Popovich to ‘Shut up & Coach.’ If pro athletes and entertainers want to freelance as political pundits, then they should not be surprised when they’re called out for insulting politicians. There was no racial intent in my remarks - false, defamatory charges of racism are a transparent attempt to immunize entertainment and sports elites from scrutiny and criticism.

This story has been updated with a statement from Ingraham.The 38-year-old actor and his wife, Lauren Parsekian, welcomed a daughter on Tuesday, Feb. 6, according to People. The couple named their baby girl Story Annabelle Paul.

The actor and co-founder of the Kind Campaign both shared pictures of Story on their Instagram accounts over the past week.

Parsekian posted a photo of her husband holding their daughter and captioned it, “I have never loved you more than I do right now. We are so lucky to be your girls forever.”

“There are no words that will ever be able to explain what just happened to my heart,” she wrote in another photo.

The pair has been married since 2013, and announced that they were expecting a child in September 2017.

“Hey everyone. Look what I did,” Paul said in his sweet announcement. “Words can’t express how excited I am that this little one has entered our lives. Just thought it was time I would share this beautiful news with all of you.”The 2018 Winter Games in Pyongchang, South Korea, is making the fight against sexual assault a higher priority than ever before at the games, unveiling four support centers providing resources for victims in a myriad of languages.

The centers stem from a recommendation following the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro that each Olympic Games create ways to safeguard workers and spectators, the International Olympic Committee told HuffPost in a statement.

Pyeongchang’s Organizing Committee decided to create spaces, mainly in spectator areas that are near police outposts. These centers cater to the Olympics workforce and ticket holders ― groups that have been reportedly subjected to sexual violence during past Olympics.

For athletes, medical clinics are equipped with a team of 10 psychologists and psychiatrists prepared to respond to any complaints of abuse, Susan Greinig, the IOC’s safeguarding officer, said at a news conference last week.

Jeon Won Hee, who has been manning one of the four centers, called the initiative “symbolic.”

“This is very meaningful, but the more important thing is knowing that sexual violence can occur anywhere at any time,” she told NBC News.

Gangwon-do, the province that includes Pyeongchang, provided funding for the centers, Mic reported. They’re open eight hours a day, with a phone hotline available in 13 languages at night.

“If something happens, we want to provide emergency counseling, medical and legal support,” said Kwon Eun-jin, head of women’s welfare for the province.

The IOC committed to enhancing gender equality in 2017, undertaking a comprehensive review across the organization. Based on the findings, a pilot program aiming to establish a balanced portrayal of both genders is underway in Pyeongchang, the organization said.

Greinig said the IOC has been working to prevent harassment and abuse for several years. For the Rio Olympics, she noted, the IOC implemented hotlines for reporting abuse and launched a safeguarding program in which an officer was available to field complaints.

The fact that sexual activity goes hand in hand with high-stakes athletic competition is no secret. U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon, for example, openly commented on the condom selection in Pyongchang over the weekend.

But the Olympics brings together people from different cultures who hold various perspectives on appropriate behavior, said Kristen Dieffenbach, associate professor of athletic coaching education at West Virginia University and an executive board member for the Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

Some “make a big deal of young girls, there’s an enthusiastic party culture,” Diffenbach noted. “There are teams that stay away from the Olympic Village for that reason. It’s very analogous to the first week of college, or spring break week.”

Sexual violence has affected Olympic athletes for years. Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor, was sentenced to prison this month for sexually abusing hundreds of young athletes, including Olympic medalists.

“Sport’s an odd place fraught with some of the nuances of abuse,” Dieffenbach said. “You have a whole realm of issues related to just the power dynamic and what constitutes abuse, is it screaming at an athlete, pushing them to be their best? There are a lot of people who would debate where that line is.”

Yet the reckoning that has held abusers to account has only taken off in recent months, propelled by the #MeToo movement.The New York Post, which endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2016, is now urging him to take action on gun control after the mass shooting at a Florida high school.

In a front-page editorial, the Post editorial board writes:

“Mr. President, this is your moment. You can keep your promises to the kids and the parents and honor your offer to do ‘whatever we can do.’ Prove how much you truly want to curb the carnage — and refuse to play hostage to the extremists on either side of these issues.”

The newspaper notes that Trump has “credibility” among gun owners after campaigning to protect Second Amendment rights and earning the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.

“But just as a lifelong anti-Communist Richard Nixon went to China as president, Trump can use that credibility to push common-sense legislation and regulations that can have some effect,” the Post said.

The newspaper pointed to four specific actions Trump can push for: restoring the federal assault-weapon ban, raising the age to buy firearms, banning bump stocks and killing the proposed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would force states to recognize concealed weapon permits from other jurisdictions.

The editorial is significant in more ways than one: The paper is owned by News Corp., which is controlled by Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch is a longtime Trump confidant who, the New York Times reported in December, still speaks with the president at least once a week.

The Times also notes that the Post is one of Trump’s favorite newspapers.Ashley Iaconetti, Lesley Murphy and Clare Crawley on "The Bachelor Winter Games." ABC

Watching “The Bachelor Winter Games” requires a real time commitment from even Bachelor Nation’s most ardent members.

Since the show only runs for two weeks ― to coincide with the 2018 Winter Olympics ― viewers are expected to consume three nights of “Bachelor”-related content each week. But according to “Winter Games” cast member Michael Garofola, there was a lot of plot that got left on the cutting room floor.

Michael stopped by the “Here To Make Friends” podcast to share the inside scoop on house dynamics, love interests we didn’t see, and more. Here’s what we learned:

1. The very international cast talked a lot about politics in the house.

“It was definitely a pervasive topic in the house, even though it’s obviously not being shown,” said Michael. “When this show was filming, the big story is all the Roy Moore stuff is going on. That was also when Trump tweeted basically admitting to obstructing justice... So these things are all being discussed and we were like, ‘Ah, they’re gonna cut all this out.’... [But] it’s relevant, it’s topical. We were, at one point, sitting around the island in the kitchen and there was a big talk with everyone, and basically they denoted me to be the speaker on behalf of apologizing for the United States and explaining what was going on. I jokingly tweeted this, but feel like my role there was to improve United States diplomatic relations with our foreign allies.”

2. The “Bachelor” anthem was written by the high-school girl who sang it!

“That was a local high school student who wrote the song herself. They did not give it to her,” said Michael. “Chris Harrison introduced her [at the opening ceremonies] ... I think her mission was to write something funny and cheesy.”

Ben Higgins and Luke Pell on "The Bachelor Winter Games." ABC

3. Some of the contestants weren’t initially told the competition would include real Olympic sports.

“When I was asked to do this show, I was like, ‘Look, it’s been a while since I’ve gone skiing, it’s been a while since I’ve gone ice skating,’” said Michael. “They said, ‘Oh, Michael G., don’t worry. We don’t wanna get sued by the Olympics! We’re not gonna do real winter sports. We can’t do that. We’re gonna do like, snowball fights and who can build a snowman fastest.’”

Welp.

4. Michael had some potential love interests that never went anywhere, so they got cut.

On Jenny, from Finland: “I was sort of talking to Jenny. Nothing really developed there. She spoke English very well but she was very insecure and self-conscious about her ability to speak English ... She had some difficulty and I think that ultimately for me, if I’m gonna date someone long-distance from Helsinki I need that to be like, ‘Wow, I’ve never found this kind of feeling before.’ Jenny is lovely but I think we were trying and then it just didn’t happen. There was no making out.”

On Lesley, from the USA: ”I love Lesley and Dean together. I love both of them individually as well. But look, I’ve known Lesley for a while ― she was on the [“Bachelor”] season before mine [of “The Bachelorette”].... She and I had a couple really great conversations, and then she hit it off with Dean. There was an undeniable chemistry there.”

The vigil occurred just one day after a deadly school shooting left 17 people ― primarily children ― dead. On Wednesday, a gunman stormed into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and began firing seemingly indiscriminately, killing and wounding dozens. Police captured the suspect, a 19-year-old former student.

Students embraced one another in heartbreak at the vigil, sobbing as they listened to speakers and found solace in each other.

But the same children learning to deal with an unspeakable horror didn’t mince words about how this tragedy could have been prevented: gun control.

“No more guns! No more guns!” a sea of chants began at one point, led by students as furious as they were heartbroken.

Arianna Ali, a 17-year-old junior, heard the gunshots and screams of her fellow classmates. She and other students first thought it may have been a fire, she said.

“We started running to the auditorium, and that’s when I heard the gunshots and the screaming,” Ali told HuffPost. “My class just scattered. Me and my best friend ran into my English teacher’s class and hid in the corner for about 35 minutes, but it felt like hours.”

When asked what could have prevented the tragedy, Ali didn’t hesitate.

“Stricter gun laws,” she said. “Especially in Florida, because we have the most relaxed laws.”

Parents and students alike have called for President Donald Trump to enact better gun control laws, but so far, Trump has only managed to disparage the mentally ill and seemingly place blame on students for not knowing the shooter “was a big problem.” He’s made no mention of guns.

So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2018

Speakers at the vigil included Chicago Cubs player Anthony Rizzo, who graduated from the high school.

“Look, I’m a baseball player, but I’m also an American,” Rizzo said. “I’m a Floridian. I’m a Parklander for life. And while I don’t have all the answers, I know that something has to change before this is visited on another community and another community and another community.”

Patricia Jacomini, 42, said she escaped from Brazil with her children five years ago after her father was murdered due to violence. Her two daughters and son lost friends in Wednesday’s shooting, she said.

“My daughter, she was all night trying to contact [her friend] since yesterday afternoon,” Jacomini told HuffPost. “And now she found out he was dead.”

Her daughter sat by her side, quietly crying. She declined to be interviewed.

What could have prevented this tragedy?

“Gun control, absolutely” Jacomini said. “It’s unbelievable that a 19-year-old was able to purchase this type of gun.”

Ali, the 17-year-old, said she didn’t sleep the previous night. Eventually, she crawled into bed with her mother.

“I didn’t sleep either,” Ali’s mother, Donna, said with a sad laugh.Sarah Huckabee Sanders received a spoof grilling from Seth Meyers on Tuesday’s broadcast of “Late Night.” And, of course, the White House press secretary was surprisingly candid in her responses to the comedian’s questions.

For the comedy-edited bit, Sanders revealed how she thought the history books would remember President Donald Trump’s administration and what she believes the future of the country looks like.

“This cannot be a political issue,” she added. “We have to be practical. I support the Second Amendment but we have to have smart gun safety laws.”

“We cannot tolerate a society and live in a country with any level of pride when our babies are being slaughtered,” Harris said.

Several politicians have called for swift action in the wake of the school shooting.

Advertisement"Single Atom in an Ion Trap," by David Nadlinger. David Nadlinger/University of Oxford/EPSRC

An Oxford University student who captured an image of a single atom has won a top science photography prize.

David Nadlinger captured the winning photo of an atom suspended between electric fields using a standard digital single-lens reflex camera, the council that organized the U.K. photography competition announced on Monday.

“The idea of being able to see a single atom with the naked eye had struck me as a wonderfully direct and visceral bridge between the miniscule quantum world and our macroscopic reality,” Nadlinger said according to an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council press release.

“A back-of-the-envelope calculation showed the numbers to be on my side, and when I set off to the lab with camera and tripods one quiet Sunday afternoon, I was rewarded with this particular picture of a small, pale blue dot,” he added.

Nadlinger, a Ph.D. student in physics, traps atoms as part of his research on quantum computing at Oxford’s Clarendon Laboratory. Atoms are incredibly small, but he used a few tricks to make the atom visible to the human eye in a photograph.

A close-up of David Nadlinger's photo of a strontium atom. David Nadlinger/University of Oxford/EPSRC

The researcher first turned the atom of strontium, the 38th element on the periodic table, into an ion ― an atom with a positive or negative net electric charge. Nadlinger then used currents that four needle-shaped electrodes emitted to isolate and suspend the ion. He illuminated it with a blue-violet colored laser and took the photo through the window of a vacuum chamber, using an exposure time of 30 seconds.

The pale dot that Nadlinger captured is not the true size of the strontium atom, however. The atom is actually re-emitting the light from the lasers to create a glow that is hundreds of times wider than its radius.

“I think people are ... surprised by how big the atom looks here,” Nadlinger told LiveScience. “I hope I’m not undoing 100 years of science education with this photo — atoms actually are unbelievably small!”Olympic freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy playfully celebrated breaking his thumb during a practice on Wednesday, saying it will prevent him from shaking hands with Vice President Mike Pence.

“Silver linings!” the Olympian wrote in a tweet on Thursday.

Broke my thumb yesterday in practice. It won't stop me from competing (obvi) but it does prevent me from shaking Pence's hand so... Silver linings! Will be giving my teammates (and literally everyone else) an enthusiastic "thumbs up!" of encouragement the rest of the trip. pic.twitter.com/XylPPGAq9P — Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) February 15, 2018

Kenworthy has made it no secret that he’s not a big fan of the vice president, who has been open in his opposition to LGBTQ rights.

The skier, who is gay, said he believed Pence was a “strange choice” to lead the U.S. delegation at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

“To have somebody leading the delegation that [has] directly attacked the LGBTQ community ... just seems like a bad fit,” he said on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” earlier this month. “I feel like the Olympics is all about inclusion and people coming together, and it seems like it’s not really doing that.”

Kenworthy, along with figure skater Adam Rippon, are the only two openly gay men competing for the U.S. at the Winter Games.

Rippon has also spoken out about Pence’s anti-gay stance, as well as the vice president’s efforts to extend an olive branch to the queer athlete.

“You mean Mike Pence, the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy?” Rippon told USA Today in January, referring to a dangerous and medically bogus treatment Pence once suggested could help people change their sexual behavior. “I’m not buying it.”

Rippon made waves earlier this month by declining to meet with Pence before the opening ceremonies, though he said he’d be willing to talk with him after the Olympics concluded.

Kenworthy might have found himself in a similarly awkward position of having to either refuse to shake hands with Pence ― who in 2006 said marriage equality would lead to “societal collapse” ― or act publicly cordial toward a man who doesn’t believe he should have the same rights as his straight teammates.

AdvertisementMikaela Shiffrin, hoping to make history as the first skier to win back-to-back Olympic golds, finished fourth in the women’s slalom on Friday.

Following frustrating delays and her gold medal run in the giant slalom on Thursday, Shiffrin was seen throwing up just before entering the gate for her first run. She told NBC at the bottom of the hill that the sickness came on suddenly and “felt more like a virus-kind of puking, less about nerves.”

The norovirus has been been whipping its way across the Pyeongchang Olympic Games, felling staff and volunteers, with 244 reported cases as of Thursday. The Swiss team confirmed Friday that two of its skiers had contracted the virus, becoming the first athletes to be affected at the Games.

It’s rare for Shiffrin to miss the podium entirely. Slalom is considered her best event and the competition she won gold in at the 2014 Sochi Games. NBC News reported that since Sochi, she had made the podium 34 times in world events, missing it only a handful of times.By Russell Frank, Pennsylvania State University for The Conversation

Media portrayals of mass murderers may do more harm than good. Atstock Productions/Shutterstock.com

The lead story on The New York Times homepage provided the overview of the latest massacre at an American school: “17 Killed at Florida School; Toll May Climb.”

A “sidebar,” or secondary story, also on the homepage, bore this headline: “Here’s What We Know About the Suspect.”

In a similar vein, the Washington Post ran a story with the headline, “Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz: Guns, depression and a life in trouble.”

The stories tell of a troubled kid who liked weapons, threatened classmates and was cruel to animals. They also feature photos of the suspect: an extreme closeup in the Washington Post, and in The New York Times a screenshot from his Instagram account that shows him brandishing a gun.

There’s no question that we humans are deeply curious about those who commit crimes. Our literary tradition, from the myths and tales of the ancient world, to Shakespeare, to Dostoevsky, to the latest police procedural on Netflix, indicates that we have always been fascinated by “the criminal mind,” which is, after all, not so different from our own minds. But, as a former reporter and editor who studies the media and who teaches journalism ethics, I ask the question: Can stoking this fascination cause harm?

Obsession with deviance

Who among us, after all, has not at least fantasized about inflicting bodily harm on an enemy or taking what did not belong to us? At least two considerations constrain us: law and custom. The threat of punishment and the moral injunctions against crimes against persons and property are such compelling reasons to stick to the straight and narrow that we marvel at those who stray.

So the journalistic impulse to learn what we can about a mass murderer by interviewing acquaintances and combing through his social media accounts is understandable. The question that arises with every mass shooting is whether these instant illustrated profiles of the killers do more harm than good.

Might all that attention inspire a similarly deranged person to commit a “copycat” crime? Might the photos in particular, especially the ones that include weaponry, further glamorize the killer as a figure worthy of emulation?

“Attention is attention and this is the ultimate attention-getting,” the principal of a West Paducah, Kentucky, high school told The New York Times after shootings at his school in 1997 and at a school in Springfield, Oregon, six months later. “I mean, getting your picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek. That is going out in a blaze of glory.”

The most compelling anecdotal evidence of a copycat effect may have come from the 26-year-old who killed 10 students at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015.

Incentive to kill?

In a blog post about the television journalist who killed two of his former colleagues in Virginia earlier that year, he wrote, “I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.”

Writing in The Atlantic in 2012, sociologist Zeynep Tufekci argued that the news media ought to tone down coverage of shooting sprees in the same way it modulated its coverage of suicides when it was feared that such deaths had become “contagious” in the 1980s. Among Tufekci’s recommendations: Avoid specifying the killer’s choice of weapons, avoid quoting his writings or utterances, delay releasing the suspect’s name and, to not add to the traumatizing of victims and their loved ones, resist the urge to interview victims and loved ones.

A further argument, in my view, against the snap profile is that it plays into the hands of those who resist any attempts at gun control by focusing on the incident as primarily the expression of a mental health problem rather than a gun availability problem.

Killer profiles

When it comes to mass shootings, defenders of reporting on the suspect’s background note that evidence of a “copycat” effect is scant: Though we seem to lurch from one such tragedy to the next, there are in fact too few of them and the human mind is too unknowable to be able to draw a clear causal connection from news coverage of any one crime to the commission of subsequent crimes.

Indeed, proponents argue that such coverage might actually prevent future carnage. The profile comprises a set of warning signs that we would do well to heed if we are ever confronted with similar hints of a propensity to violence and cruelty.

Tufekci acknowledged the public’s interest in mass shootings and that such incidents are likely to have more than one cause. “But it’s important to recognize,” she wrote, “that sensational news coverage is, increasingly, part of the mix of events that contributes to these rampages.”

As far back as the Columbine shootings in 1999, mental health professionals have been urging journalists to focus less on the perpetrators of shooting rampages and more on the victims. Judging from the coverage of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, that advice is still going largely unheeded.It’s hard to believe it, but the 10th season of cult hit reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” is right around the corner.

VH1 announced Friday that we can expect the next season of the massively successful drag institution on Thursday, March 22 ― and each episode will be a whopping 90 minutes long.

Not only that, but VH1 is bringing back “Drag Race” aftershow “Untucked,” which will air immediately following each episode.

That’s two hours of “Drag Race” every single week.

“To celebrate a decade of Drag Race we’ve pulled out all the stops. The queens, the challenges and the shenanigans are off the mother-tucking charts,” executive producer and two-time Emmy Award-winning host RuPaul said in a press release. “And I’m thrilled that Untucked is back on VH1. ’Cause, henny, if you ain’t watching Untucked, you’re only getting half the story. Okurrr?”

It’s hard to believe that it’s been a decade since “Drag Race” first hit the airwaves on gay television network Logo and blossomed into the cultural force that it is today.

AdvertisementNearly 26 years after it went off the air, “The Golden Girls” is remembered for its one-liners, ’80s fashion duds and, of course, cheesecake indulgences.

What many fans forget, however, is that the series had a remarkably progressive outlook on LGBTQ rights for its time, with nods to the AIDS crisis, coming out and even same-sex marriage.

In the first installment of his new “Culture Cruise” series, Seattle-based writer Matt Baume breaks down two of the show’s most forward-thinking episodes, 1988′s “Scared Straight” and 1991′s “Sister of the Bride.” Both episodes featured Clayton Hollingsworth (played by Monte Markham), the gay “baby brother” of Blanche (Rue McClanahan). Clayton not only opened up about his sexuality on the show, but also announced his plans to marry his boyfriend.

Baume told HuffPost that, together, the two episodes “did something amazing.”

“Not only did they teach America how to be a friend to gay people, they also introduced millions of viewers to topics like coming out and gay marriage while also slipping in a message of queer empowerment,” he said. “Over the course of these two episodes, we have a household of little old ladies helping a man come out, then welcoming him and his husband, and then promising to work on acceptance in the future.”

Americans who oppose LGBTQ rights, he added, would be well-served by taking a few cues from Dorothy, Blanche, Sophia and Rose.John Mayer dropped the video for his new song “New Light” on Thursday, and it’s pretty much the opposite of the slick, overproduced videos that most artists release.

Mayer cracked on Twitter that he made it with “with a company that usually does birthday and Bar Mitzvah videos.”

The result is an intentionally awkward mix of Mayer and cheesy stock footage including Times Square, Paris, the Egyptian pyramids and... well... stuff like this:

Shepherd, better known as Steph Shep, was Kim’s assistant turned COO of Kardashian West Brands before the two parted ways in 2018. She began working for Kim in 2013 and often appeared on the family’s E! show and social media profiles over the years. She eventually accumulated 1 million Instagram followers and earned a profile about her job on Refinery29.

In the article, Shepherd opened up about what it was like to work for Kim in the early days, saying she did everything from scheduling and laundry to booking travel and putting together a baby stroller. From there, she worked her way up to managing Kim’s team and working on her Kimoji launch, and she was by Kim’s side after the robbery in Paris in 2016.

If you ask Kris, 62, to describe an average day you’ll quickly learn that for her, it doesn’t exist. She gave HuffPost the rundown of her day in New York City after the Met Gala.

It was filled with phoners, meetings, recording “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” throughout the day, glam, picking up daughters at various hotels, multiple outfit changes with Tommy Hilfiger, attending the Business of Fashion dinner, then racing to the airport at midnight to hop on Kylie and Travis Scott’s plane.

Kris’ unique needs (and schedule) mean she needs someone on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, ready to work at a breakneck speed and have “scheduling down on a very high level,” she said.

“It’s nonstop. Every day is different, you never know what to expect and you have to be ready to pivot on a dime,” she added.

In addition to being trustworthy, discreet, flexible and ready to work at all hours of the day, you also have to remember a key Kardashian rule if you’re going to be a personal assistant: Don’t be fucking rude (or shady).Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney announced on Friday that he is running for the U.S. Senate seat being left vacant by retiring Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (R).

“Given all that America faces, we feel that this is the right time for me to serve our state and our country,” he said in a video posted on Twitter.

A win for the former Massachusetts governor could be a major blow to President Donald Trump, as Romney spoke out against Trump both during the 2016 election and after the president hesitated to condemn white supremacists last summer. He bashed Trump as a “phony” and “a fraud” in March 2016 and said he couldn’t vote for him.

Reports that Romney would run for the seat began circulating in September, when rumors arose that Hatch ― the longest-serving Senate Republican and one of Trump’s fiercest advocates ― was planning to retire at the end of his term. Hatch officially announced his retirement in early January. That same day, the location associated with Romney’s Twitter account was changed from Massachusetts to Holladay, Utah, where he owns a home.

Romney, who in 2012 became the first-ever Mormon to secure a major-party presidential nomination, is slated to be the front-runner in the November Senate race. Unlike Hatch, who has fallen out of favor with Utah voters, Romney is immensely popular with the state’s Mormon base. A Salt Lake Tribune poll in October found that 44 percent of respondents wanted Romney to run for Hatch’s seat.

In the hours after Hatch’s retirement announcement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would not say whether Trump would back Romney.

In addition to speaking out against Trump, Romney was also one of the few Republican lawmakers to make an unequivocal statement against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexually assaulting and harassing teen girls when he was in his 30s. Moore, who had Trump’s enthusiastic support, ultimately lost to Democratic candidate Doug Jones.Rep. Claudia Tenney with Sen.

A Republican House member seems a bit confused why the public is still discussing the domestic abuse allegations that forced White House staff secretary Rob Porter from his job last week.

“I’m not saying he’s innocent, but I’m saying we don’t know,” Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) said Wednesday during an interview on upstate New York radio station WUTQ. “He could be the worst guy in the world, but now we’re getting into prosecution, as far as I know. I guess there was an issue about ― maybe the FBI knew about it ― but really, is this what we’re talking about at this point?”

She added: “Once they found out about it, they let the guy go. Why are we still talking about it?”

Porter resigned from the White House on Feb. 7 after both his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical, verbal and emotional abuse. He has denied the allegations.

Porter hasn’t been charged with any criminal offense. That, Tenney said repeatedly, means the accusations most likely are fake.

“There might be an element of truth to [the allegations], but why wasn’t this guy prosecuted before if these things were happening?” she asked.

“Has this guy committed a crime? Has anyone prosecuted him for his alleged abuse against the past wives?”

“Once they found out about it, they let the guy go. Why are we still talking about it?” - Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY)

One of the radio hosts pointed out that because the abuse allegations affected Porter’s ability to get high-level security clearance, he was susceptible to blackmail. Tenney quickly dismissed that issue, saying domestic abuse is not a “crime of character.”

“Blackmail and domestic situations don’t really line up. They’re not crimes of character,” she said. “They’re character, but they’re not dishonesty. To me ... just because somebody has been accused of these things ― and even if they’re true ― that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be dishonest and commit blackmail.”

Tenney blamed Republican Party reluctance to embrace Trump’s presidency as a reason he may have made a rushed decision to employ Porter.

“When you don’t have anyone supporting you that’s part of the structure, you’ve got to find people that aren’t always the best and you find that out later because you literally just need someone to do the job,” Tenney said.

“Obviously the issue of sexual assault or any of those things, anything like that is very serious, but we’re also getting into the minutiae of what’s going on with the White House,” Tenney said.

“There are so many things happening with this White House, people coming and going, and new people.”

Listen to Tenney’s full interview below.

Tenney cited her experience as a divorce lawyer in casting doubt on the accusations by both of Porter’s ex-wives.

“I’ve had divorce cases where terrible abuse is going on and the person doesn’t do anything about it, usually it’s the wife, sometimes it’s the husband,” she said. “But in cases like this, I’ve seen cases where somebody hurts themselves and they go in and blame their ex-husband. Or their ex-husband to be. The person wasn’t even there.”

President Donald Trump and his administration have been criticized for how the White House handled the accusations. Trump and other aides continued to defend Porter, even after he resigned.

Meredith Kelly, communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized Tenney’s comments on Friday as “shameful and frankly disgusting.”

“Survivors of domestic abuse have a hard enough time coming forward without Members of Congress casting doubt on their stories,” Kelly said in a press release. “Tenney’s disturbing smear of two women confronting their abuser shows why she needs to be replaced.”

Tenney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has been arguing against what he calls a “knee-jerk” political response to mass shootings for years.

MSNBC’s Chris Hayes presented a video mashup Thursday of the times Ryan has argued against “taking away” America’s gun rights.

Ryan has presented an almost identical speech again and again — and again. He repeated it Thursday after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17. “We don’t just knee-jerk before we even have all of the facts and the data,” Ryan said in an interview with Indiana radio station WIBC

“If that sounds familiar, it is because it is,” Hayes said.

Roll tape. Ryan used the “knee-jerk” argument after the California mass shooting in San Bernardino in 2015 that claimed 14 lives, and after the shooting at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon the same year, which killed nine.

One thing Ryan did express concern about is mental illness. Last year, Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed into law, a measure that rescinded barriers to gun ownership for the mentally ill.

Ryan received $177,000 in contributions from the National Rifle Association in the 2016 campaign cycle.While you've all been talking about #GunReformNow , the @NRA is taking a well deserved break... and @JordanKlepper has a very clear message for them and the politicians they support. pic.twitter.com/TOwUSJBaeb

Vincent Zhou, the youngest member of Team USA, just pulled off something never before seen in Olympics figure skating.

The 17-year-old landed a quad lutz in the men’s short program on Friday.

“I was trying to remember to breathe,” he said after his performance, according to USA Today. “My entire life ran through my head.”Spain scooped up its first Winter Olympics medal since 1992 on Thursday.

And Regino Hernández Martín’s bronze in the men’s snowboard cross event was enough to send Eurosport commentator José Manuel Hernández Tallada into a mini-meltdown:

The sportscaster couldn’t contain his excitement about his countryman’s historic performance in video that his Eurosport colleague Fernando Ruiz shared online (see above).

As the race reached its thrilling conclusion, Hernández Tallada jumped up and down and punched the air inside the studio where he was watching a livestream of the games. The video has since gone viral.

Prior to Hernández Martín’s medal-winning run, Spain last ascended the podium at a Winter Olympics some 26 years ago in Albertville, France, when Blanca Fernández Ochoa secured the third spot in the women’s Alpine skiing event.U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon nailed his routine in the men’s short program at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Friday, landing four jumps.

It was a solid performance by one of the breakout stars of the Games, and when he was asked by a reporter after his routine exactly why he’d been skating so well the past few days, he fired back with the fierce wit he has quickly come to be known by.

“You’re 28 years old, skating the best you ever have in your life. How do you explain that to people?” the skater was asked by NBC’s Andrea Joyce.

“I can’t explain witchcraft,” Rippon, with tongue in cheek, replied.

While he didn’t land in the top three during Friday’s event, Rippon has already taken home a medal. He won a bronze earlier this week in the figure skating team competition and has been a media darling both on and off the ice. He’s spoken about his battle with an eating disorder, shared his opinions on the Olympic condoms and bonded with actress Reese Witherspoon.

Social media lit up after Rippon’s witchy retort.

In a bid to break down what the lawmakers really meant, “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” responded on Thursday by sharing a “GOP Mass Shooting Response Translator” on Twitter:Jamaica’s women’s bobsled team will have a sled to compete with during the Winter Olympics.

After reports surfaced Wednesday that the team’s driving coach quit and threatened to take the sled with her just days before the athletes were set to compete, the Jamaican beer brand offered to purchase “a new ride.”

WASHINGTON ― Law enforcement officials in Florida have reportedly not yet found ties between the Parkland school shooting suspect and the white supremacist paramilitary group Republic of Florida, despite claims from the group’s leader. Those claims were widely circulated by news outlets on Thursday.

As of Thursday evening, it was seemingly too soon to say what might have motivated Nikolas Cruz, 19, to allegedly shoot at least 17 people to death at his former high school. It was likewise too soon to say whether Cruz held any white supremacist views. So far, though, the evidence linking him to this specific white supremacist group is thin. (We will update this story if that changes.)

Jordan Jereb, an ROF leader, told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday that Cruz participated in training exercises with the group, but that the group hadn’t ordered Cruz to carry out the school shooting. Multiple media outlets, including HuffPost, picked up the ADL’s report and repeated the claim that Cruz was an ROF member. In several reports, Jereb, an obscure white nationalist figure, was the sole source.

“We are still doing some work, but we have no known ties between the ROF, Jordan Jereb or the Broward shooter,” a Leon County Sheriff’s Office spokesman told the Tallahassee Democrat. The sheriff’s office has arrested Jereb at least four times since January 2014 and has been monitoring ROF’s membership, The Associated Press reported.

By Thursday evening, Jereb appeared to be backing down from his claim.

“There was a misunderstanding because we have MULTIPLE people named Nicholas in ROF,” a user named @JordanJereb posted on Gab, a social media platform popular among fascists and racists. “Are you really going to blame ME for the lying jew media? We know they are liars. Fuck em,” the user wrote. (HuffPost messaged the user, who had posted about ROF months before Wednesday’s shooting, but was not immediately able to confirm his identity.)

HuffPost has not found evidence that Cruz was affiliated with ROF — or that he had even interacted with anyone in the group. Jereb did not respond to repeated requests for proof of Cruz’s involvement with ROF. Cruz’s Facebook and Instagram were taken down after the shooting. On one of his since-deleted Instagram profiles, Cruz’s Twitter avatar wore a “Make America Great Again” hat and he shared pictures of an assortment of guns and knives.

The FBI and the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the shooting, declined to comment.

The existing reporting on the supposed ties between Jereb and Cruz is inconsistent. Jereb told the Miami Herald he has never personally met Cruz. But ABC reported that three former classmates of Cruz identified him as part of the ROF. The former classmates claimed that Cruz was “often seen with Jereb.” Jereb’s last address listed in public records is in Tallahassee, 430 miles from where the shooting took place. ABC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how it verified the identities of Cruz’s former classmates.

A spokesman for the ADL, which first reported the supposed tie between the ROF and Cruz, told HuffPost on Thursday that “it is for law enforcement to 100% confirm that he was a part of this group.”

“Given what we found today and the timing of the case, there is no doubt the information raises a red flag and should be investigated further,” the spokesman said.

As reports of Cruz’s supposed link to ROF appeared in the media, members of an “alt-right” white supremacist forum claimed the entire story was an attention-grab by Jereb, or possibly a hoax aimed at tricking media outlets into pushing a false narrative.

Jereb already comes across as a caricature of a Florida white nationalist, and he has been seeking attention for his views for years. “Jereb was a weird character even in the extremist underworld to which he so badly wanted to belong,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, wrote in 2014. Most white supremacists avoid the SPLC, but Jereb “wanted desperately to be mentioned in these pages,” the group wrote. “He flooded us with pleas for attention.”

The SPLC has not been able to confirm any ties between Cruz and ROF, Heidi Beirich, the director of the group’s intelligence project, told HuffPost. “It may seem odd that Jereb would bring attention to his group by claiming a connection to Cruz, but Jereb has always been somewhat of a publicity seeker,” Beirich said.

In 2016, Jereb was arrested for allegedly threatening a high-ranking staffer of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R). The Tallahassee Democrat reported at the time that Jereb was “known to ride a bike through neighborhoods wearing para-military garb. He has filmed numerous run-ins with law enforcement.”

On Thursday afternoon, members of The Right Stuff, a white supremacist forum, claimed that the story of Cruz being tied to ROF was false. “Started out as an inside joke until Jordan Jereb literally told the media that it was true and that he was affiliated with a school shooter,” a TRS user posting under the name “Jordan Fash” wrote.

Fash posted screenshots of an ABC reporter messaging a user named “Ethan” on Instagram asking for information about Cruz. Ethan told the reporter that Cruz was an ROF member. “It was common knowledge he did rallies with ROF, I frequently saw him conversing with Jordan Jereb in person,” the user said.

The ABC reporter declined to comment. ABC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how it reported its story.

It didn’t take long for other far-right extremists to latch onto a possible reporting flub as a way to attack the entirety of the mainstream media. Cameron Padgett, the campus fixer for Richard Spencer’s college speaking engagements, tweeted that the media “will do anything to smear white people.”

In his quotes to the media, Jereb elevated anti-feminist and anti-Semitic views, and claimed that Cruz “probably used that training [with ROF] to do what he did.”

There tends to be an information vacuum after a mass shooting, and trolls and propagandists often take advantage of the confusion in order to promote their own interests. After the shooting at a Texas church last year, right-wing conspiracy theorists were quick to claim that their political enemies — everyone from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to anti-fascist protesters — were somehow connected to the shooter. Trolls will also routinely claim that Sam Hyde, a real-life comedian, is behind a mass shooting before the real shooter has been identified. In the immediate aftermath of a shooting, it’s easy for false information to spread rapidly.

In 1999, Bill White, a former leader of the National Socialist Movement, injected himself into the conversation surrounding the Columbine High School massacre by suggesting that shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold might have visited White’s extremist website before the rampage. White, who identified as an anarchist at the time, managed to garner national attention for his obscure website, which urged kids to build bombs, blow up schools and slaughter football players.Just finished the Aerials, I’ve noticed a whole bunch of comments about my remarks re the Chinese.
