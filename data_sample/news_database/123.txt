Jimmy O. Yang has made a name for himself on comedy series “Silicon Valley,” portraying the awkward and notoriously douche-y, heavily accented app developer Jian-Yang, who’s also a Chinese immigrant.

Yang is not a notoriously douche-y, heavily accented app developer in real life. He is, however, an immigrant from Hong Kong who’s no stranger to the painfully uncomfortable moments that come with assimilating to American culture.

The 30-year-old, who came to the U.S. when he was a teen, still remembers the confusion he experienced during those formative years. On top of carving a space for himself in a new world, Yang says he constantly walked the line between working toward his own hopes and dreams ― a very American idea ― and pleasing his parents ― an ever-important pillar of Chinese culture.

His complex mish-mash of identity is documented in his new comedic book “How to American: An Immigrant’s Guide to Disappointing Your Parents,” which was released earlier this month. As the political debate over immigration policy roars on under the Trump administration, Yang says his book attempts to “humanize” the immigrant experience. It’s the good, the bad, and the awkward moments of a new American that every human being can relate to.

Yang sat down with HuffPost to chat about his own immigrant experience, Asian masculinity, and the untold impact that one movie, “Ninja Assassin,” had for Asian men.

Your book is entitled “How To American,” so at what point did you feel that you had successfully “Americaned?” When did you feel you could claim the American identity as your own?

I think when I joined my fourth fantasy football league, I thought, “I know what’s going on now.” [Laughs] Really, the big moment was when I went against my parents’ will. Up until that moment I felt, in a way, very Asian ― doing something that I deep down didn’t want to do just to please my parents because it was a real job to them and to Chinese culture. When I quit my internship and started doing standup to pursue my dreams and do that full time ― I feel like that’s when I “Americaned.”

Your book includes these very Chinese references ― like the tiny stool that people sit on while preparing vegetables ― that Asian-Americans never really see in books. It’s something so specific and insider-y. Why do you feel it was important for you to weave these elements into your story?

Everybody talks about that stool! I think one of the reasons I wanted to write this book is there isn’t a lot of this material out there. I wanted people to relate. When I went to my grandpa’s house, where everything was Asian inside but the outside world was very American, it was very confusing. You feel lost. You feel like you’re the only one going through it because you don’t see a lot of that representation anywhere else. An American family can look at a TV show like “Everybody Loves Raymond” and go, “Oh, my dad does that too!” We didn’t have that. We have more and more of that now, but still it’s on the surface. ...

I want this book to be not just relatable to immigrant people and Chinese kids, but also tell a really honest, first-person, point-of-view story of an immigrant assimilating to this country. Immigration is in the media and the news right now and people talk about it in a partisan way, a political way. And that’s just not really a reference for most Americans of a real immigrant story, so I think it’s important to share that with them. I just want this book to show a real experience and then they can come up with a more informed opinion on immigration. ... I want to humanize the process of immigration ― in an honest, easy-to-read humorous way.

No matter how long we Asians are in the U.S., or even if we’re born here, we’re often just seen as Asian immigrants in the eyes of many non-Asians. But as Constance Wu, who’s in “Crazy Rich Asians” with you, pointed out, there’s a distinction between the Asian experience and the Asian-American experience. When you first immigrated here, did you notice the contrast?

...We all go through the same experience to some degree. When I became an American citizen, nothing’s changed because I’m still Asian. Nobody’s going to look at me as an American before an Asian person ― at least for now. If I go to Italy, or even Japan, nobody’s going to look at me and say, “Look, it’s an American person! Look at his cool passport! Rocky Balboa!” and give me a high five. ... But when I first came here, one of the things that was most painful was not just that I would go up to a group of white kids or black kids and they didn’t accept me because I didn’t speak English well enough, it was when I went up to other Asian kids who were born here and they shunned me even more. They themselves don’t want to get made fun of and be associated as a foreign person as I am. I understand it, especially when you’re a kid you just wanna be normal and fit in ― why would you want to be a foreign kid? But that’s tough.

Even in Hollywood, in acting in general, there’s this discussion of character representations and ethnic representations. I know some actors who will not even audition for a role with an Asian accent. I empathize with that but I completely disagree with that because that’s the same kid who didn’t want to hang out with me in high school or middle school ― that Asian-American kid who didn’t want to hang out with the foreign kid because they think it makes them look bad. I understand the whole constant foreigner stereotype but for me it’s important to portray immigrant characters like Jian-Yang and Danny Meng with humanity. It’s maybe a better thought to change the perception of an accent than to avoid it all together. I take offense [when people don’t go for parts with accents] ― it’s like saying, “I’m better than my immigrant brother with an accent.”

I wanted to get into the character of Jian-Yang. In the Asian-American community, he is divisive. Some, including one media watchdog, have labeled him a trope or a collection of stereotypes. Do you feel there’s any truth to that? Or do you think there’s much more to Jian-Yang?

Jian-Yang at the end of the day is a foreign guy like I was. First of all, I play the accent really real. A lot is taken from my mother, and a lot is taken from my uncles and relatives back home in Shanghai. It’s not just a shitty impression of a Cantonese Bruce Lee accent, it’s a very specific Mandarin accent. And then the character itself, maybe in the beginning when he only had a few words, few lines, [he was a trope], but I never tried to play him as a stereotype at all. This is me ― a lot of stuff was a parallel to my own life. Like on the first day of school, when I heard the pledge of allegiance and I just followed along because I didn’t know what was going on. Jian-Yang does that quite a bit ... you’ve got to find the right motivation, the right parallels.

I think as the character develops, he becomes a much more three-dimensional character. Beyond just the accent, he’s just kinda an asshole now and he’s funny. ... I get where [the criticism’s] coming from but is it warranted? I don’t know. For me, I always play these characters as if they’re just a version of myself 15 years ago.

Look, to be honest, when certain movies like “Ninja Assassin” came out, that had a sexy, sexy Asian man with a six-pack, that made some people think, “Maybe I should go out there and date an Asian dude.” And that did pretty good for us in a way of representation. But if you look at it, any TV show, let’s just talk about white people ― there’s a whole gamut of white people. ... They’re all different people but when Thomas [Middleditch] is playing a nerdy character, does he take shit for it? No, because there are a million other white people who play good-looking characters or whatever.

I think people get sensitive, and I get it because there’s just not enough representation. So I somehow carry a lot of weight. I’m not a good-looking guy in general. What are you going to tell me? Don’t represent me on TV because I don’t look like Chow Young Fat? Like fuck you, dude! I’m just a quirky, funny dude. Are you saying a fat, geeky Asian dude can’t represent you on TV? Fuck you, that’s who he is, and he could be a good actor.

Really at the end of the day, certain movies like “Crazy Rich Asians” ― I think that’s gonna be huge because that’s the one movie that shows a whole gamut of people. Me and Ken [Jeong] are both in that movie and we’re really comfortable just being the funny guys. Then you have other people who play the good-looking guys. And you have tall, short, fat, whatever. We can just be ourselves.

I’d like to touch on masculinity. There’s a debate in the Asian-American community over whether Asian-American feminists are supporting Asian men enough? Do you think they are? Do you think that should even be part of their responsibility?

Go fuck whoever you want! I think everyone should support Asian men and men of all kinds. But is your preference white dudes because you grew up watching Brad Pitt? I can’t blame you, I grew up watching Jennifer Aniston, too.

Look, I think representation is extremely important but people have their preferences. You can’t tell someone, “You need to go date an Asian guy!!!” Go ahead, date whoever you want. At the end of the day, representation forms people’s opinions a lot of the time.

Girls had the pickings out there for Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Mark Wahlberg ― those guys spoke to them in their teenage years. We just don’t have that many choices for Asians. There just aren’t that many of us out there. Hopefully we can all kinda be part of that mainstream society and be part of people’s psyche coming up in the future.

In your time as an actor, has there been a shift in how people have seen Asian men?

Let’s talk about my life in general ― I swear ever since “Ninja Assassin” came out, I got laid a little more [laughs]. Seriously! That’s why i’m saying [representation] is super important. But I’m sorry if I’m not super fucking good looking!

Maybe kids growing up now, after they watch “Crazy Rich Asians”, they can say what I said ― I got laid so much more after “Crazy Rich Asians”! Or K-pop! These things that make Asians look good.

... At the end of the day, Ken Jeong, Bobby Lee, myself, we might not be the hunky dudes but I’d like to think that we help in that equation too by helping Asians be more normal on your TV screen and be funny. Once again, I apologize I’m not good looking. I apologize I look like a geek with glasses in real life. And I apologize to the people who say I’m making Asians look bad. But also, fuck ’em.

We’re all looking forward to “Crazy Rich Asians.” We obviously don’t get a ton of films with an all-Asian cast. Do you feel a lot of pressure for this film to succeed?

I want it to succeed badly. There’s nothing more that I want than for this film to succeed. But do I feel pressure? As an actor you’re kinda numb to everything. For every movie you shoot, you can’t expect an Oscar.

The camaraderie we built shooting this movie ― it made me so proud to be Asian even just making this movie. We have all the most beautiful, the most talented and funny Asians coming from all over the world for this movie.Jaden Smith loves skirting convention. That may be why dresses and skirts are a part of his wardrobe.

Although some might think the 19-year-old entertainer’s gender-fluid style is a phase, that’s not the case if a recent tweet is any indication.

“If I Wanna Wear A Dress, Then I Will, And That Will Set The New Wave,” Smith wrote in a Sunday tweet that has been liked more than 23,700 times since he posted it.

The former “Karate Kid” star has been rocking gender non-conforming outfits since at least 2015 when he took ”Hunger Games” actress Amandla Stenberg to her prom wearing a black suit jacket and a white skirt.

Smith’s dad, actor Will Smith, admires his son’s willingness to stay true to himself.

“Jaden is 100 percent fearless, he will do anything. So as a parent it’s scary, it’s really terrifying — but he is completely willing to live and die by his own artistic decisions and he just doesn’t concern himself with what people think,” the actor said, according to Hello Magazine.

Model Winnie Harlow is sure as hell not a “vitiligo sufferer.”

The 23-year-old Canadian model made her message clear in a Tuesday Instagram post blasting British tabloid the Evening Standard for describing her as a “vitiligo sufferer.”

“I’m not a ‘Vitiligo Sufferer.’ I’m not a ‘Vitiligo model.’ I am Winnie. I am a model. And I happen to have Vitiligo,” Harlow wrote in the caption.

Harlow has the skin condition vitiligo, which causes the loss of skin color in blotches. She burst onto the modeling scene in 2014 as a finalist on the show “America’s Next Top Model.”

“Stop putting these titles on me or anyone else. I AM NOT SUFFERING!” Harlow continued. “If anything I’m SUCCEEDING at showing people that their differences don’t make them WHO they are! All our differences are apart of who we are but they don’t define us! I’m sick of every headline ending in ‘Vitiligo Sufferer’ or ‘Suffers from Vitiligo.’ Do you see me suffering?”

A post shared by ♔Winnie Harlow♔ (@winnieharlow) on Mar 26, 2018 at 4:00pm PDT

The young model has made it clear she’s very comfortable in her own skin, but wishes people would stop defining her as her skin condition. In a 2016 interview with Elle Canada, she explained that she wants to be known for more than just her vitiligo.

“I’m very sick of talking about my skin,” she said. “I am literally just a human. I have the same brain as you; there’s a skeleton under my skin just like yours. It’s not that serious.”

She said that she’s just “living life,” adding: “And if that inspires you, I’m proud, but I’m not going to put pressure on myself to be the best person in the world and tell everyone I have vitiligo. If you want to know about it, you can do your research. Either way, I’m not in the dictionary under ‘vitiligo.’”

Well said, Winnie.ORLANDO, Fla. — Noor Salman looked up as the prosecutor directed the jury’s attention to a copy of her 2011 marriage certificate. There, on the screen, was her looping signature, right next to Omar Mateen’s. Proof she wed a killer.

The 31-year-old widow shivered and hiked a purple blanket up to her neck, glancing over at her team of defense attorneys for reassurance. They often soothed her in court with physical touch, squeezing her shoulder or patting her arm. Her fear was palpable.

Later, Salman watched herself on the same screen, testing perfumes at Victoria’s Secret. In the security camera footage shown to the jury, she sniffed a paper strip, then passed it to her husband for his thoughts. He must have agreed; they left with a shiny pink bag.

Three days after that shopping trip, Mateen slaughtered 49 people inside Pulse nightclub in Orlando. In calls with police from the scene, he declared allegiance to ISIS and said he acted to avenge U.S. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. At the time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen was killed during the attack.

While her husband was committing mass murder, Salman was in her pajamas, asleep in their home in Fort Pierce, Florida. Seven months later, she was charged with aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to the FBI. Prosecutors claimed that Salman helped her husband scout potential locations for the attack, created a cover story for him and participated in unusual spending.

The seemingly ordinary excursion to a mall store was now center stage in a federal terrorism trial. In the days leading up to the shooting, Mateen spent thousands of dollars on Salman, buying her clothes and jewelry, including a diamond ring. Prosecutors suggested she got the gifts in exchange for agreeing to help him carry out his heinous plan.

There was zero evidence that Salman was radicalized herself, they admitted. Instead, they argued that she was content to trade her husband – the sole provider for her and her 3-year-old son – for baubles and designer wear.

Salman, who did not testify in the trial herself, pleaded not guilty, and maintained through her lawyers that she had no knowledge of Mateen’s plans. When he began showering her with presents in the weeks before the massacre, Salman was optimistic about their future, her lawyers said, and believed it was a sign her husband – a brutish, abusive man who only permitted her a $20 allowance each week – was changing.

For the 49 families of the victims, the trial was an opportunity for closure. And yet, they didn’t get to see the man that took their loved one’s lives. Instead, they got his wife.

In courtroom sketches, Salman resembled a Disney princess — oversized eyes, a button nose and lustrous, thick hair. But in person, sitting in the courtroom here in downtown Orlando just two miles from the club where the massacre took place, she was pale with deep, dark circles under her eyes. Her clothes were ill-fitting, she wore no visible makeup, and her hair was pulled back into a simple ponytail.

By the time of the trial, Salman had spent 14 months in jail, mostly in solitude. Each day, she was allowed a single phone call to her son, but that was it. She missed holding him and hugging him, her family said.

During opening statements, Salman’s lawyer said she had been eagerly awaiting her day in court. After her arrest, rumors and speculations about her abounded and settled in like a rot. She drove him to the club that night. She was a member of ISIS. She fled the country after the attack. All were untrue.

Finally, in court, she got to set the record straight.

Perpetrator Or Victim?

Outside the federal courthouse, on a lunch break from the trial, Salman’s cousin was seething. Susan Adieh, didn’t recognize the one-dimensional cliched caricature the prosecution had described, and she didn’t understand why Salman was on trial. The wives of other terrorists and mass killers never faced charges. She wondered if her family’s religion played a role, even though Salman was not religious.

After all, they were Muslim.

Adieh, 59, who owns several convenience stores in Mississippi, has known Salman since she was born. She attended every day of the trial, sitting a few rows behind her, along with Salman’s uncles and other cousins. Salman’s father died in 2012, and her mother, who currently takes care of Salman’s young son in California, couldn’t attend the trial because of health issues. In her absence, Adieh stepped up as a momma bear figure, advocating on behalf of her cousin in interviews with the press.

Susan Clary, the family spokesperson, said that many other relatives wanted to come to support Salman, but they were afraid. As Muslim Americans, they worried about being associated with the terrorism case; their jobs could be at stake.

In court, Adieh nodded along with Salman’s defense attorneys when they made a point she liked and scowled when the prosecutors said something she found objectionable. Mostly, she looked at the back of Salman’s head. A few times, Salman turned around to flash Adieh a quick, nervous wave and a tight smile before her face returned to its standard sober expression.

As a child, Adieh said, Salman would let other kids take her toys rather than start a fight.

“She has no toughness in her,” she said. “She has a good heart. That’s her problem.”

Immediately after the Pulse shooting, Adieh flew to Florida to be with Salman. With approval from the FBI, Adieh brought Salman and her son back home to Mississippi. For four months, she cared for her traumatized cousin. Salman, an American-born daughter of Palestinian immigrants, struggled with the enormity of the destruction her husband had caused — 49 lives snuffed out in an instant — and worried how she and her son would survive in his infamous shadow, her cousin said.

While Salman was married to Mateen, she didn’t visit or talk much to her family. They said he discouraged it. But in Mississippi, she slowly told them everything. Mateen was violently abusive, she said: He beat her and forced her to have sex against her will. He controlled what money she spent, and even dictated what she was allowed to eat.

Salman, a housewife with a young child, had few options. She didn’t have money of her own, as she wasn’t employed. She didn’t have a driver’s license, and had to ask Mateen for a ride when she wanted to go to the supermarket or run an errand at the post office. She lacked a support system in Florida outside Mateen’s family, since most of her family was in California.

“I asked her, ‘Why didn’t you call me?’” Adieh recalled, a pained expression crossing her face. “She was too afraid,” she said. Salman had told her that Mateen threatened to kill her and take away her son.

The abuse that Salman said she survived was all-too familiar to Sitora Yusufiy, Mateen’s first wife. She told HuffPost that during her short marriage to Mateen in 2009, he hit her, confiscated her paychecks, and told her when she could and could not leave the house. He would resort to violence without a thought.

“Living with him, I know the situation she was in,” she said, referring to Salman. “I know she had no rights, and no knowledge of what he was doing. He would lie to me and hide many things behind my back.”

Had Yusufiy stayed married to Mateen, “that could very easily have been me,” she said.

After Salman was arrested and taken into custody, Jacquelyn Campbell, a nurse and leading expert on domestic violence in the U.S, evaluated her at the request of Salman’s defense attorneys. Campbell is known for developing a tool used to determine if an abused woman is at risk of being killed by her intimate partner.

Based on Salman’s responses to questions, she was in the “extreme danger range” during her marriage to Mateen – the highest possible level. Salman wrote in the assessment that Mateen strangled her, beat her while she was pregnant, and controlled most of her daily activities.

To the question “Do you believe he is capable of killing you?” Salman replied, “yes.”

The Evidence

It was a typical Saturday night for Salman on June 11, 2016. Her husband told her he was going out with his friend Nemo, and said he’d be home later.

After he left, her mother-in-law called, inviting them to come to the mosque for dinner. Salman didn’t want to go; it was hot and she didn’t want to have to wear the hijab, she complained to a friend in a call at the time. She texted Mateen, asking him to tell his mom they weren’t coming.

“If ur mom calls say nimo invited you out and noor wants to stay home,” she wrote, misspelling Mateen’s friend’s nickname. This text would later be used as evidence for the crime of aiding and abetting. The prosecution said what she wrote was a cover story that Salman concocted to help her husband avoid suspicion from his parents.

But for Salman, she just wanted to have a quiet night with her son, according to the defense. She took him to Applebee’s for dinner and then to Walmart to pick up a Father’s Day present for Mateen. At home, after she put her son to sleep, she browsed for leather biker jackets on her phone and waited for her husband to come home.

He never did.

By 2:40 a.m., she tried calling, but there was no answer. Then she texted Mateen: “Habibi, where are you?” she wrote, using an Arabic term of endearment. She tried him again two hours later, reminding him that he had work in the morning.

Mateen wrote back at 4:28 a.m., asking her if she’d heard what happened. At that moment, he was holed up in a bathroom with hostages. Several minutes later, he would Google “how to remove bullet lodged in barrel?” His rifle had jammed. Within the hour he’d be dead, shot by the police.

“???” she answered. “What happened? !” She tried to call again, but he didn’t pick up.

Just minutes after she sent her husband that text, police were at her door, ordering her out of the house. She picked up her son and came outside. The police didn’t tell her why they were there; they asked her to wait in the back of a squad car while they searched her home. Then, she was whisked to the FBI headquarters in Fort Pierce for questioning.

She would spend the next 11 hours with law enforcement, without a lawyer.

FBI agents were immediately suspicious of her. She was strangely calm and passive, they testified, not asking a lot of questions about her predicament. The agents put her and her son in a large conference room, and assigned a female FBI agent to play with the child while Salman was questioned. After serving them McDonald’s hotcakes and hash browns for breakfast, FBI agents notified her that her husband was dead.

Her reaction to that news concerned them, too, they said. One agent claimed Salman didn’t cry, although another agent recalled her crying for five minutes straight, a contradiction that was never explained. Prosecutors described her as “staged and rehearsed.”

After hearing how Salman behaved at FBI headquarters that night, Campbell, the domestic violence expert, said it was not that unusual. Abuse victims, under pressure, often develop a flat affect and come off as disengaged. It’s a survival mechanism, she explained.

“When you are terrified of someone, you try not to be reactive to anything or let any of your feelings show,” she said. “You just try to obey and do whatever you think will please that person, or at least make them not hurt you.”

For hours and hours, FBI agents interrogated her, choosing not to film or record any of her statements. When asked in court about why the FBI did not record the interview of a potential suspect in a high-profile terrorist case, an agent said, “I honestly never thought about it. It never crossed my mind.”

At some point, getting nowhere with Salman, the FBI brought in a polygraph examiner and sent her son home with a relative.

On the stand, Special Agent Ricardo Enriquez described his interrogation of Salman. He falsely told her that he was sent by then-FBI Director James Comey, to impress upon her the gravity of the situation, he said. He asked her to sign a consent to be polygraphed, though he never used it. Instead, he just talked to her.

He asked her a series of questions about her husband and what she might have known about the attack. She told him she knew nothing, but over the next four and a half hours, Enriquez kept insisting that she knew more than she was letting on. He said that if she lied during the interview, he didn’t know what would happen to her son.

Salman was exhausted, having barely slept the night before – and in shock, her family and lawyers said. By the time she left FBI headquarters late in the afternoon, she had allegedly confessed to knowing about her husband’s plans.

Her statement, which was handwritten by Enriquez because she was too nervous to do it herself, claimed she knew Mateen was headed to Pulse that night to commit an attack, that she’d seen him look at the club’s website, and that they’d cased Pulse together the week before, driving around the venue slowly with the windows down.

“That’s what she said, and that’s what I wrote down,” Enriquez said.

But much of what she confessed to was impossible. Salman had never been in the vicinity of Pulse, according to cell phone and GPS data. Neither had Mateen. And none of their computers or phones showed a record of accessing Pulse’s website. The claims were simply untrue.

The defense said there was no way Salman knew where Mateen was headed that night because he didn’t know himself.

Pulse wasn’t actually Mateen’s intended target that night. He first drove to Disney Springs, a hub of shops and restaurants at Disney World, and found security to be tight. He then Googled “downtown orlando nightclubs” and appeared to pick the gay club at random. Despite initial speculation based on the location of the shooting, investigators found nothing to suggest he was motivated by homophobia.

But why would an innocent person confess to something she didn’t do?

Bruce Frumkin, a forensic psychologist who evaluated Salman with a series of personality tests, explained to the jury that people with certain traits – like mental illness, low intelligence and high rates of suggestibility ― may end up saying what the police want to hear. People who’ve been interviewed for long periods of time or have been deprived of sleep are particularly vulnerable to making false statements under pressure, he said.

In his professional opinion, Salman was “at much higher risk than the average person” to give a false confession, because of her extremely suggestible and submissive personality, and her low average IQ of 84, he testified.

Waiting To Find Out Her Fate

Inside the courtroom, Salman clutched a small resin guardian angel in her hand. It was too small to be seen by the jury or the judge. When testimony was painful to listen to, she squeezed it. The angel helped to ground her, her family spokesperson said.

Much of the presented evidence was graphic and stomach-churning. Salman could hardly watch as they played the video of the actual slaughter. There was her husband on the screen, mowing down all those innocent people. She turned her head away and cried, balling tissues in her fist.

For six days, Salman listened as prosecutors picked apart her life, depicting her as manipulative, materialistic and cruel. After prosecutors rested their case, they dropped a bombshell: Mateen’s father was an FBI informant up until the massacre, they said, and was under criminal investigation himself.

Upon learning this, Salman’s lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Paul Byron to toss the case, arguing that their entire defense strategy would have been different if they had known. He denied the request.

The defense’s case took just a day and a half. Salman’s lawyers called her friends and family to the stand to tell the jury what kind of person she was. One friend began crying when she saw Salman. She described how Salman helped her when she was struggling to care for an infant and study for school at the same time.

“She would offer to help me clean or cook, or give the bottle so I could concentrate on my studies,” she said. When asked if Salman was peaceful, she agreed vehemently.

“Nothing harmful would come out of her,” she added.

The defense also called two female witnesses who said they had romantic relationships with Mateen while he was married to Salman. He was a liar, her lawyers said, and he kept up a secret life. Why on earth would he tell his wife of his plans to commit terror?

On the very last day of trial, over 80 domestic violence and civil rights groups released a statement in support of Salman, saying the prosecution against her was “rooted in gendered Islamophobia and patriarchy.”

“She is being prosecuted under the guise of guilt by association as a Muslim woman married to a Muslim man who committed mass violence,” they wrote.

But whether the jury saw it that way is yet to be determined. They began deliberations on Wednesday afternoon. Salman faces up to life in prison if convicted.

Her family said the truth came out in the trial, and they have faith in the jury.

In closing arguments, Salman’s lawyer rejected the government’s depiction of Salman as diabolical and greedy, arguing that she didn’t know what her husband was planning, and she certainly didn’t help.

She was a “devoted mother. Not a monster,” her lawyer said.

She just married one.

AdvertisementCustomers at some 5,000 Walmart locations around the United States will no longer see Cosmopolitan magazine among the publications for purchase in the check-out line.

That’s because the retail giant decided to remove the magazine so customers would not be exposed to its “sexually exploitative” content, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation said in a press release on Tuesday.

“This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture, and NCOSE is proud to work with a major corporation like Walmart to combat sexually exploitative influences in our society,” said NCOSE executive director Dawn Hawkins.

The conservative organization, formerly known as Morality in Media, has been targeting Cosmopolitan magazine for some time ― long before the Me Too movement came about. NCOSE has even named its fight against the magazine “a longtime priority.”

NCOSE argues that the magazine “relentlessly glamorizes things like public, anal, group, and violent sex to its young female readership” and that minors should be protected from such material. The content, NCOSE argues, goes against the organization’s mission is to “defend human dignity and to oppose sexual exploitation.”

“We are grateful for Walmart’s cooperation and for Walmart leadership’s recognition that corporations must do their part to change #MeToo culture,” Hawkins added.

In a statement to Newsweek, Walmart said the store would still carry Cosmopolitan, but just not locate issues in the checkout aisles. “While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard,” the statement said.

Yet critics were quick to point out how removing the magazine in the name of the Me Too movement seemed misguided, counterproductive and opportunistic.

“The real world took another step toward its slow and sure conversion to The Handmaid’s Tale this week,” Vogue.com’s Michelle Ruiz wrote.

“I’m embarrassed for Hawkins because she just broadcasted to the entire country that she is a woman who has no idea what #MeToo means. ICYMI: #MeToo is about unwanted sex and sexual attention, sexual assault, and harassment. While Cosmopolitan is a magazine and a brand best known for its sex tips (including my personal favorite, a suggestion to ring a donut on a guy’s penis)—it is all about consensual adult sex.”

More people piled on with criticism over Twitter.

Pulling a magazine that empowers women to talk about sex in a healthy and positive way is counter-productive. Not only does Cosmo publish articles about sex & relationships, it also discusses politics, health, news and so much more. Don't de-emphasize that important work, Walmart https://t.co/0iucxipd4U — Amanda McKelvey (@ammckelvey) March 27, 2018

The argument that hiding Cosmo from Walmart shoppers will foster a “culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood” is absolutely infuriating. Sexuality ≠ exploitation https://t.co/3kUG9czzUL — Ashley Spencer (@AshleyySpencer) March 27, 2018

Walmart using #MeToo as an excuse to stop selling Cosmopolitan in checkout lines is pretty ridiculous. Censoring frank information about sex feeds into rape culture by denying girls knowledge about their sexuality and choices they can make for themselves.https://t.co/gyPllZ7QFV pic.twitter.com/YiwQQF0Vd7 — Alex Berg (@itsalexberg) March 28, 2018

A reminder that Walmart is being sued (again) by female employees for gender discrimination— women are routinely paid less than men. But sure, Cosmo — Mariya Karimjee (@M_Karimjee) March 28, 2018

Other retailers have moved to relocate or block Cosmo’s racy covers in the past, though they didn’t invoke the Me Too movement while doing so. In 2000, supermarket giant Kroger installed blinders on some of the magazine’s covers in 2,200 stores.

The magazine did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment, but did provide a statement to Buzzfeed about the publication’s success in serving female readers.WASHINGTON ― After a year of Donald Trump’s complaints that a criminal investigation into his presidential campaign is nothing more than a “witch hunt,” it turns out that special counsel Robert Mueller may have, in fact, found a Russian witch.

In the final months before the 2016 election, top Trump campaign aide Rick Gates was in contact with a former member of Russian military intelligence whose background he knew about, according to a new court filing by Mueller’s office.

“Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agents assisting the Special Counsel’s Office assess that Person A has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016,” states a sentencing memo in the case of Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who pleaded guilty to lying to federal prosecutors earlier this year.

The White House press office did not respond to HuffPost queries about the memo in light of Trump’s repeated questioning of the legitimacy of Mueller’s investigation. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did offer the standard White House blanket denial that Trump or his campaign had done anything wrong.

“There was no collusion and we’re confident in that,” Sanders said.

Trump has called Mueller’s probe a “hoax” and a “witch hunt” dozens of times since taking office 14 months ago. Of late, he has taken to writing “witch hunt” in all capital letters for emphasis.

“The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!” he tweeted on March 17.

Two days later, he tweeted, “A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!”

The new document, filed late Tuesday, is the most recent tidbit to emerge from Mueller’s closely guarded investigation, which so far has produced five guilty pleas and indictments of 14 others ― including 13 Russians who worked to help elect Trump as well as the former chairman of Trump’s campaign, Paul Manafort.

Gates was Trump’s deputy campaign chairman and later the campaign’s liaison to the Republican National Committee.

Manafort and Gates were also business partners in efforts to help pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, and their indictments accused them of money laundering in that work. Gates has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with Mueller, while Manafort has vowed to fight the charges.

“Person A” is not identified in the court filing, but the description reportedly appears to match Konstantin Kilimnik, who managed a Kiev lobbying office for Gates and Manafort.

Last summer, according to The New York Times, John Dowd, who was then the president’s main personal lawyer on the Mueller investigation, discussed the idea of giving pardons to Manafort and to retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser. Flynn has also pleaded guilty in the Russia probe, for making false statements to investigators. Pardons could make it harder for Mueller to gather evidence against Trump personally ― but could make it easier for Mueller to prove obstruction of justice.

Dowd denied the pardon story in a brief phone interview with HuffPost on Wednesday. “I didn’t have discussions,” he said, before hanging up.

At Wednesday’s press briefing, Sanders referred all questions about any pardon discussions to a statement from Ty Cobb, the lawyer handling the Mueller probe for the White House. His statement also denied that there had been any talk of pardons.

The U.S. intelligence community concluded during the 2016 campaign that not only was Russia interfering in the U.S. election, but it was actively trying to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The FBI began its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians well before Election Day. Control of the investigation was shifted to Mueller after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Soon after, the president told NBC News as well as senior Russian officials visiting the Oval Office that he had done so because of the investigation.There was a literal wild goose chase in Tennessee earlier this week when a man trying to intimidate one of the birds got run off instead.

Hank Russell filmed himself calling the bird out as it blocked his path.

“You’re hissing at me. You think you’re all big and bad,” he said in the video. “I will put you in a deep fryer.”

Russell told ViralHog he was just trying to pass the big bird.

“I was trying to go to the restroom and the lady said there was a vicious goose blocking the way,” he told ViralHog. “So I figured I would challenge him to get to the restroom.”

The challenge backfired.

“He pecked the back of my head with his beak and I lost the fight,” he said.

A humbled Russell seems to have learned his lesson.

Geese can be very territorial, especially when their nest is nearby, as was the case in this incident.Dear Leader McConnell and Senator Schumer:

We write to express our deep disappointment that the Senate has failed to enact meaningful reforms to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. We urge you to bring before the full Senate legislation that would update and strengthen the procedures available to survivors of sexual harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces.

Everyone deserves to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination. In November, with your leadership, the Senate took an important first step in the effort to end harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces with the passage of S. Res. 330, which requires anti-harassment and discrimination training for all Senators and staff at least once each Congress. While this training requirement was a significant step to address workplace harassment, there was broad, bipartisan agreement at that time that more had to be done to support survivors.

Although the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) implemented meaningful reforms when it became law in 1995, it continues to require survivors to endure an antiquated dispute resolution process, including a month-long counseling session, forced mediation and a 30-day “cooling off” period before a victim can make a decision whether to pursue justice in a courtroom or continue with administrative procedures. The time has come to rewrite the CAA to provide a more equitable process that supports survivors of harassment and discrimination.

The Senate’s inaction stands in stark contrast to the bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives that led to the passage of bipartisan CAA reform legislation in February. The House bill includes a number of important provisions, such as eliminating waiting periods before a victim can take their case to court, increased transparency for awards and settlements, and a requirement that Members of the Senate and House pay for an award or settlement stemming from a case of sexual harassment or discrimination that they personally commit.

When the Senate considers CAA reform legislation, we will also have the ability to address an inequity that now exists between House and Senate staff. The House of Representatives passed H. Res. 724 that provides House staff who are survivors of harassment or discrimination access to free legal representation. Senate staff who face similar harassment or discrimination must pay personally for legal representation or represent themselves through complicated legal proceedings. Therefore, the Senate must act quickly to provide Senate staff with the same resources as their House colleagues.

Inaction is unacceptable when a survey shows that four out of 10 women congressional staffers believe that sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill and one out of six women in the same survey responded that they have been the survivors of sexual harassment. Survivors who have bravely come forward to share their stories have brought to light just how widespread harassment and discrimination continue to be throughout Capitol Hill. No longer can we allow the perpetrators of these crimes to hide behind a 23-year-old law. It’s time to rewrite the Congressional Accountability Act and update the process through which survivors seek justice.Rachel Dolezal reportedly received over $80,000 while receiving food assistance and child care assistance from Washington state’s Department of Social and Health Services. Stephanie Keith / Reuters

Rachel Dolezal, the former president of NAACP’s Spokane, Washington, chapter who was outed as a white woman pretending to be black, is facing felony charges of welfare fraud, perjury and false verification for public assistance.

NBC News affiliate KHQ-TV was the first to report on the charges made this week against Dolezal. KREM 2, a CBS news affiliate, later confirmed the charges with the Spokane County prosecutor’s office. If convicted, Dolezal could face up to 15 years in prison.

Dolezal came to national attention in 2015 after her family revealed she’d been presenting herself as a black woman for years, even though they said she was born white. At the time, Dolezal was president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP and worked as a part-time instructor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University.

The revelation forced Dolezal to resign from the NAACP. She also stopped teaching at EWU. In 2016, Dolezal, a mother of three, officially changed her name to Nkechi Diallo, though she still uses her former name on her art website and social media pages.

Washington state’s Department of Social and Health Services began investigating Dolezal in March 2017 after learning that Dolezal, who was receiving public assistance from the department, had published a book.

The investigator found that Dolezal’s book publisher typically offers contracts that include payments of $10,000 to $20,000 ― but a review of her records revealed that she’d only reported an income of $300 per month in the form of gifts from friends, according to court documents published by KHQ-TV.

The Spokane County prosecutor’s office accused Dolezal of being overpaid a total of $8,847 for food assistance and child care assistance from the state’s Department of Social and Health Services between Aug. 1, 2015, and Nov. 30, 2017.

During that period, according to the investigation, an estimated $83,924.96 had been deposited into Dolezal’s bank account in monthly installments.

Despite the controversy surrounding her racial fabrication, Dolezal still identifies as a black woman. She wrote about her experience in an autobiography, In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World, and was featured in a Netflix documentary this year.

Critics have taken particular exception to Dolezal’s widespread media exposure in light of the ongoing racial injustices that black Americans experience day-to-day.Victor Polster won acclaim at Cannes for his starring role in Belgium's "Girl." Stephane Mahe / Reuters

CANNES, France (Reuters) - “Girl,” a film about a transgender teenage girl’s quest to become a professional ballerina, won the Queer Palme award on Friday, selected as the best from a bumper field of movies with an LGBT theme playing at the Cannes Film Festival.

The Belgian movie was warmly received, with Variety saluting “a stunning debut for both director Lukas Dhont and star Victor Polster.”

Polster, a cisgender boy and trained ballet dancer, won the prize for best performance in the Un Certain Regard section of the festival, a separate competition from the main Palme d’Or race.

The jury for the Queer Palme — an unofficial prize that was set up in 2010 — makes its choice from a shortlist of all the films showing in the festival’s various categories that touch on LGBT themes.

This year there were 16 films in the running, twice the average, according to the competition’s founder, Franck Finance-Madureira, who said there was not just a large quantity of LGBT films, but also more sophisticated depictions of gay life than is often the case.

“We’ve got a thriller, a love story, a teen portrait, but the LGBT content is not central, it’s one of the elements,” he told Reuters.

Among the Queer Palme contenders were Yann Gonzalez’s “Knife + Heart,” about a gay porn producer played by Vanessa Paradis, and “Rafiki,” a love story between two women and the festival’s first Kenyan entry, which has been banned at home.

Five years ago, French lesbian drama “Blue is the Warmest Color” won the Palme d’Or — the top official prize at the festival — handing a symbolic victory to gay rights campaigners in France, which was reeling from a divisive debate about same-sex marriage.

Since then, Hollywood has produced box office successes including “Moonlight” and “Call Me By Your Name,” proving gay films can attract mainstream audiences.

But Cyril Legann, who works for Optimale, a distributor specializing in LGBT cinema, said the movie industry still overlooked gay films that were not blockbusters, preventing them getting a wide release.

“No one’s going to say ‘oh another straight film’ but there are cinemas who say ‘oh another gay story,’” he said.

“We’re a long way from equality on that front.”

The Cannes Film Festival concluded on May 19.Mike Kliebert with Sally the alligator at his baby's gender reveal party. Melody Kliebert

A Louisiana couple decided to announce the sex of their unborn baby in a pretty jaw-dropping way.

Grandmother-to-be Melody Kliebert posted a video to Facebook on Sunday featuring her son, Mike Kliebert — an alligator wrangler and trainer who runs Kliebert’s Turtle and Alligator Farm in Hammond and goes by the name “T-Mike, the Gator King.”

The video shows Mike Kliebert holding an alligator’s mouth shut on a lawn, surrounded by friends and family gathered for a gender reveal party.

“First thing that came to my mind when my girlfriend and I decided to have a gender reveal party were alligators,” Kliebert, whose father and grandfather were both also alligator handlers, told HuffPost. “They’re a big part of our family, so why not incorporate them into our reveal?”

At one point in the video, Kliebert places a watermelon into the gator’s mouth. The reptile snaps her jaw shut and a blue liquid comes gushing out of her mouth, indicating that Kliebert’s baby is going to be a boy.

“We have a few gators who like to eat fruit, so I figured fruit was great —let’s get a watermelon, drill a hole in it, add some Jell-O to it, and throw it in the gator’s mouth? Let her bust it open, no big deal, you know?” Kliebert explained. “And what better way to do it than having an alligator that is 61 years old that my grandfather hatched in 1957?”

Kliebert said the gator in the video is named Sally and “she’s our movie gator.” She’s appeared in commercials and the TV show “American Horror Story,” and she recently filmed a scene for upcoming movie “Louisiana Caviar.” Kliebert says Sally responds to her name and that she received “a big piece of chicken” as a reward for helping in the gender reveal.

“Sally’s not just a gator, she’s not just a pet, she’s part of our family,” he said.

The viral video has more than 5 million views on Facebook. It ultimately made its way onto other social media platforms, like Twitter, where many people expressed concern for the animal’s well-being.

A Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries spokesman said what happened in the video didn’t appear to harm Sally, but the department doesn’t exactly support bringing an alligator to a party.

“It wasn’t harmful to the animal,” the spokesman told HuffPost. “But we discourage and don’t condone anyone using an animal as exhibition piece.”

He added, “Also, it is not wise to have a dangerous animal in such a demonstration so close to humans, especially children.”

Kliebert said he had prepared for numerous scenarios in which things could have gone wrong.

“I know gators better than I know the back of my hand,” he said, noting that Sally had opportunities to hurt him in the video, but didn’t.

He added that there were “a dozen other gator handlers on the scene, most of my family are gator handlers.”

Those handlers include his pregnant girlfriend, Rebecca Miller, who has been a gator handler for four years, and his 9-year-old son, Blaze.WASHINGTON ― The Supreme Court seemed hesitant to move quickly to strike down a Maryland congressional district based on a novel legal theory that claims partisan gerrymandering can violate the First Amendment.

Oral arguments for Benisek v. Lamone took place Wednesday in the case that centers around a challenge from Republican voters living in Maryland’s 6th Congressional District. They claim that Democrats intentionally discriminated against them in 2011 based on their support for GOP candidates when they redrew the state’s congressional map and flipped their reliably Republican district to a Democratic one.

A majority of the justices on the court appeared to believe that what Maryland Democrats did in 2011 was intentional and problematic. But the court has acknowledged that some partisanship in redistricting is acceptable ― it’s just never said how much is too much.

During oral arguments, the justices pressed Michael Kimberly, the lawyer representing the Republicans, on what kind of political consideration lawmakers could take into account when they were drawing districts.

Kimberly suggested that the state should have to show there was a compelling governmental interest when it took political beliefs into account for redistricting.

But the justices, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, wanted to know under exactly which circumstances a state could use partisan affiliation when it drew new electoral districts. Justice Samuel Alito hinted that he believed the test suggested by Kimberly was too broad and wouldn’t leave any room for lawmakers to take partisan consideration into account at all.

Kimberly struggled to explain how lawmakers could justify intentionally taking partisan considerations into account when redistricting, saying that it would be acceptable if a certain number of voters from one party had to be moved as a consequence for redrawing other districts.

Steven Sullivan, the Maryland solicitor general, argued that the plaintiffs in the case had failed to offer a manageable standard for the court to deal with gerrymandering. Instead of intentionally discriminating against Republican voters in the 6th Congressional District, Sullivan argued that Democrats had created a competitive district.

Court watchers are closely looking at Justice Anthony Kennedy as the key swing vote in the case. He asked Kimberly why it wouldn’t be disruptive for the Supreme Court to step in now and send the case back to a lower court when 2018 elections were around the corner. He also asked Kimberly if lawmakers could draw maps that advantaged their party whether, over time, the number of their registered voters had outpaced that of the opposition party. Kimberly indicated that there could be a compelling government interest in creating districts that were more competitive.

Kennedy also pressed Sullivan to explain why the state’s congressional map, which is enacted as a piece of legislation, was any different than a constitutional provision that explicitly said the government would favor Democrats over Republicans in redistricting. While Sullivan conceded that such a provision would be unconstitutional, he said that the Maryland redistricting plan was different because it was more complex and did not have explicit discrimination written into it. Kennedy asked Sullivan if he was arguing that viewpoint discrimination was only acceptable when the lawmakers behind it hid the evidence.

The exchange between Sullivan and Kennedy underscores the deep discomfort the justices have with partisan gerrymandering and their struggle to figure out what exactly to do about it. The court is trying to determine if a manageable standard for evaluating partisan gerrymandering exists, and if so, what it might look like.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Kimberly if he could apply other tests to his case to try and figure out when partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Justice Stephen Breyer suggested that the court relist the Maryland case and two other cases dealing with partisan gerrymandering this term to have a clear debate about all of the merits and flaws of the several standards different parties have offered to the court to figure out how to deal with the problem. Breyer at one point said that the court needed to figure out a standard to limit extreme partisan gerrymandering, but one that would spare the Supreme Court from being required to hear an excessive number of partisan gerrymandering cases.

At one point in the hearing, Kagan suggested that the court didn’t have to set a constitutional standard in dealing with the Maryland case because there was clear evidence of intent to increase Democrats’ chances of winning. (Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), who oversaw the redistricting process, said in a deposition that he felt he had a duty to help Democrats win.) “However much [partisan intent] you think is too much, this case is too much,” Kagan said, prompting laughter in the court room.

But Breyer urged the court not to pass up its unique opportunity to take on partisan gerrymandering. The Maryland case, in addition to the other cases from Wisconsin and North Carolina in the current term, offered such clear examples of intentional gerrymandering that the court was unlikely to see again because lawmakers and mapmakers would be more careful in the future. Advances in computer technology, Breyer said, would mean that partisan gerrymandering would only get worse during the next cycle of redistricting unless the court stepped in.

Those who do gerrymandering, Breyer said, “are not stupid.”By Sara Chodosh

Pixabay The optimal distance to sit from a stranger for five hours at a time

The thing about planes is that pretty much everyone wants to get off them as soon as they get on. To deplane is to rejoin a world where you can get up from your seat whenever you want, gulp non-recirculated air, and enjoy more than precisely 10 peanuts at a time. But perhaps the worst thing about air travel — worse than the overpriced snacks and jet-engine noise — is the fact that you’re crammed into a confined space and forced to interact with the other people inside it for hours on end.

Planes make us reckon with the fact that humans are gross, virus-carrying, disease-burdened flesh sacs. You can avoid someone coughing in the grocery store, but you can’t escape inhaling the same recirculated air as the man in 14B who sounds like he’s dislodging part of his lung.

And that’s why scientists study disease transmission on aircraft. Three billion people fly every year, and studies have shown that several serious illnesses have hitched rides to areas they never could have reached otherwise. The SARS virus jumped from Hanoi to Paris in just 14 hours and 50 minutes. H1N1 influenza hopped from L.A. to Auckland and Birmingham in under 10. These transmissions would never have been possible without air travel.

But recent research suggests these may be the exceptions that prove the rule. You actually have to be quite close to a sick passenger to catch their disease yourself, depending on how much movement there is during the flight, and most of the surfaces inside an aircraft are surprisingly clean. That’s according to a new study in the journal PNAS, anyway.

“If you are seated further away than a meter from an infected passenger, you are unlikely to get infected during flight,” says Howard Weiss, a mathematics professor at Georgia Tech and one of the lead authors on the paper. Weiss works on modeling disease transmission and collaborated with Boeing, which helped fund the study, to figure out how pathogens might travel on planes.

Archives New Zealand The New Zealand Department of Health wants you to stay home.

To make a model like that, though, you have to actually catch people in the act of spreading viruses. So that’s exactly what they did. The team from Emory and Georgia Tech flew on 10 total flights between Atlanta and the West Coast, recording literally every interaction the passengers had with each other. Close physical proximity is how many diseases spread, so any contact between flight attendants or seat mates is an opportunity to disseminate a virus. And wow, are there a lot of interactions — though not a lot of coughing.

“What most surprised me was that on 10 flights, eight during flu season, only one of 1,500 passengers on 10 flights was coughing,” says Weiss. Which is probably a good thing, since he says the other thing that surprised him was the sheer number of interactions: 5,000 on a four-hour flight.

Despite all those points of contact, their mathematical model shows that a sick patient would only be likely to spread illness to people in their own row and one row in front and behind them. Consider this the sneeze splash zone, if you will. Outside of that immediate proximity, it seems passengers are pretty much safe. The researchers even swabbed many of the hard surfaces inside the plane — bathroom door handles, seat belt buckles, and tray tables — all of which came back negative for a panel of 18 respiratory viruses. This either means that either not many sick people were flying on those particular days, or airlines are preternaturally good at disinfecting. No word yet on how clean the fabric seats are.

It also seems to show that the air filtration systems in airplanes are actually pretty good. The recirculated air may be unpleasant, but it is sent through a HEPA filter, which removes 99.9 percent of all particulates in the air — it’s what hospitals use in operating rooms and ICUs. Circulating air also stays in a pretty small area, roughly every couple of rows, so any errant viruses probably get trapped in one little air loop.

James Vaughn The era of actually enjoyable air travel.

And now comes the point in the story where we note that these results can’t be extrapolated to every flight. These were transcontinental American flights, so it won’t necessarily apply to larger or smaller planes with shorter or longer flight times. It also doesn’t apply to all viruses—measles, for example, is a particularly tiny virus that stays airborne for long periods of time. And of course, while this study did the best it could with the data it had, 10 flights is still a pretty small number. It’s possible that, on average, planes are far dirtier (or carry far sicker passengers). As is always the case in science, we’ll need more data to be sure.

Here’s what we do know: being around lots of people, especially while doing something stressful like traveling, makes you more likely to get sick. Weiss’ advice, even after observing so few coughing fits and viruses in the field, is to practice good hygiene and to keep your hands away from your face. Planes aside, we should all probably be washing our hands more. “I suspect that many people do not understand the importance of good hand hygiene,” notes Weiss. And he’s right. Many of us don’t even realize how we get sick: sharing a water glass with a sneezy friend isn’t dangerous because you might drink their backwash, but because you’re liable to touch your face not long after touching the glass (the average person touches their face about 3.5 times every hour) which means you’ll get their virus or bacteria right into your vulnerable mucus membranes.

Pathogens love the moist, warm environment inside your nose and lungs, and your hands are the vehicle that gets them there. Don’t let the viruses win: wash your hands. And maybe just don’t go on airplanes? They’re awful anyway, even if they aren’t germ-infested.
