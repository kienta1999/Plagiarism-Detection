Iraq War veteran and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) hit back at the conservative Red State blog for using a particularly awful phrase in an article attacking her support of Miguel Perez Jr., a veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan but was still deported to Mexico.

Last week, Duckworth, a Black Hawk helicopter pilot who received the Purple Heart for her service in Iraq, appealed to the Department of Homeland Security to review Perez’s deportation case, arguing that deporting him would be a “shocking betrayal” of a veteran who fought for the United States.

“Unfortunately, Duckworth really doesn’t have a leg to stand on in making this argument,” the article read ― a highly insulting attack on the senator, who lost both her legs fighting in Iraq when her helicopter was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade.

The senator, known for her sharp-witted Twitter responses, sent quite the comeback.

“Thanks for noticing, Red State, but you’re wrong. I actually have two legs. They’re made of titanium, and they don’t buckle.”

She then launched into a discussion about supporting veterans when they return from war, oftentimes with mental health issues like PTSD.

Perez, who was diagnosed with PTSD, served seven years for a felony drug conviction in 2008. His lawyer said his citizenship application was denied because of the felony charge.

Many Veterans who suffer from PTSD struggle with addiction and land in legal jeopardy. It’s easy to pay lip service to supporting our troops and Veterans until they come home with complicated and often invisible wounds that they will carry for the rest of their lives — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) March 28, 2018

You don’t truly support our Veterans if you’re not willing to acknowledge and support them through the ugly havoc war can wreak on their lives — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) March 28, 2018You’re getting more value than usual with your Hulu subscription in April.

The service’s most popular show right now, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” returns for Season 2 on April 25. The horrific yet delightful series about an American family trying to keep their spirits up as The Man keeps knocking them down is well worth the watch. It’s both critic-pleasing (with Emmy wins) and crowd-pleasing, despite its strange penchant for using pop songs to soundtrack atrocities.

Multiple noteworthy movies also join Hulu this month, including many on April 1. So, you don’t have long to wait for new things to watch.

The Robert De Niro-starring classic “Taxi Driver” is one such movie joining on the first of the month. “Man In The Moon,” “50/50,” “Spaceballs” and Donald Glover’s “Mystery Team” are all great. And then there’s movies like “You Don’t Mess With the Zohan” and the Justin Long-starring “Accepted,” if you’re into that.

A few reality show episodes also join, including “House Hunters,” “Flip or Flop” and “Property Brothers.” Every few months I Google whether “Property” is those handsome brothers’ last name, and I’m always disappointed (it’s not).

April 30White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that last week’s fatal police shooting of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old, unarmed black man is a “local matter and something we feel should be left up to the local authorities.”

Reporter April Ryan asked Sanders during her daily briefing what President Donald Trump had to say about Clark’s death and Tuesday’s announcement that the Louisiana attorney general would not charge two white police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Alton Sterling, a black man in Baton Rouge. Sanders called the incidents “terrible.”

“We want to make sure all law enforcement is carrying out the letter of the law,” Sanders elaborated. “The president is very supportive of law enforcement. But at the same time, in these specific cases and specific instances, those will be left up to local authorities to make that determination and is not something for the federal government to weigh into.”

The American Urban Radio Networks correspondent pressed further. Ryan said the mother of Eric Garner, the black man who died in 2014 after repeating “I can’t breathe” while being restrained by a New York City police officer, is still seeking an indictment and asked whether the president has asked for one or knows what is happening in the case. Sanders again said it was a “local matter.”

The city of Sacramento has been in turmoil since Clark’s death on March 18. Protesters gathered at Sacramento City Hall on Tuesday to plead for justice and chant, “No justice, no peace.” Clark was shot 20 times by police officers in his grandparents’ backyard. The officers claimed they believed he was armed, though Clark had only a cellphone in his hand.

“We want to find ways to bring the country together ― certainly not looking for any place of division,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday.

Sanders was also asked whether the president feels the need to do something to address the concerns of African-American mothers fearing for their children’s lives. The press secretary drew a hard line, saying race is not part of the equation.

“I think we should do every single thing we can every single day to protect the people of this country,” Sanders said. “I think the president ― whether they’re black, white, Hispanic, male or female, rich or poor ― we look for ways to protect the individuals in this country, particularly children.”For a guy who likes to accuse media outlets of pushing fake news, Donald Trump Jr. doesn’t really like facts or accuracy.

On Wednesday, the BBC posted the following tweet to promote a story about presidential physician Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, President Donald Trump’s pick for the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

Trump picks his doctor to replace Shulkin as veterans secretary https://t.co/wXZkhipmT2 — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) March 28, 2018

The VA position was left open after the Wednesday firing of David Shulkin, who’d held the job since January 2017. President Trump tweeted that he was nominating the “highly respected” Jackson in Shulkin’s place.

For some reason, Junior claimed the headline was misleading ― even though it was accurate. Jackson served as Trump’s physician before being nominated for the VA gig.

You mean ADMIRAL Ronny Jackson who BTW was also Obama’s doctor? Just so we are clear and eliminate any of what your conveniently misleading headline suggests. https://t.co/xqxKsuqupe — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 28, 2018

Luckily, many Twitter users were there to help Junior understand he was making a big deal about nothing.

... there’s literally nothing misleading about that headline — Christie (@Christie_D22) March 28, 2018

Guess you didn’t read the article huh Donny? Not really anything wrong with a headline stating a fact, you know. It’s a fairly standard core idea for proper journalism. — Joel Birch (@JoelDTD) March 28, 2018

How is it misleading? They spoke the truth, something you very rarely do.... — Jimbo (@jimmybuh) March 29, 2018

Didn’t realize personal doctors without management experience were qualified to oversee an agency that employs nearly 400,000 people. No one is saying he’s not an outstanding physician but this role is out of his league. Kinda like you and Aubrey O’Day. — Mike Rundle (@flyosity) March 28, 2018

One man pointed out that, yes, Jackson was also Barack Obama’s physician during some of his time in office, but the former president never offered him a job running a huge governmental agency.

Um, Obama didn't nominate him, your Daddy did. Can I get a sweet gig too if I say he's taller and weighs less than he actually does? — Bret L🖖🏻nsway (@BretLonsway) March 28, 2018

One person also reminded Trump Jr. that Jackson has no experience running huge government agencies at all.

Yeah, that one...the one who has no experience as an administrator of anything, let alone the second largest bureaucracy in the U.S. government. Not good for veterans, only good for your father. Bad for the country. You are and will always remain a knee-jerk moron. — Jennifer Davis (@daviscafe116) March 28, 2018

Some tried to explain what the word “misleading” really means.

Misleading would be like someone saying that they met with the Russians to discuss adopting Russian children, but discussing a completely different subject. — Henry Marquard (@hdm2001) March 28, 2018

Others wondered if Trump Jr. should talk to Jackson about his tendency to post simplistic tweets.Despite not being named Chris, actor Jake Gyllenhaal is a famous white guy with a jawline, so it was only a matter of time before he ended up in a superhero movie.

While he’s resisted the allure of tights and a cape for years, reports are now circulating that the Oscar nominee is in talks to star as the villain in the already announced sequel to “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” according to Variety.

Gyllenhaal will reportedly play Mysterio, a big bad who’s been a pain in Spidey’s side throughout comic book history. His most well-known alter-ego is Quentin Beck, a special effects expert turned supervillain who manipulates reality to disarm his foes.

While the fate of everybody’s favorite web slinger was left up in the air after the events of “Avengers: Infinity War,” we know he’ll live another day in the next film in the franchise alongside Zendaya, Marisa Tomei and Michael Keaton as Vulture.

Jon Watts will also return as director with Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley writing the script.

Gyllenhaal has flirted with the superhero universe once before, as he was close to replacing the original Spider-Man, aka Toby Maguire, after the actor’s injury on the set of “Seabiscuit.” Alas, it was not meant to be and Maguire returned for two more sequels and Gyllenhaal went on star in “Brokeback Mountain.”

But don’t let his serious dramatic pedigree fool you. Gyllenhaal has always been a fan of the genre, even as his tastes have skewed further away from blockbuster fare.Leslie, 2018

“Don't judge a book by its cover, because you never know what a person has been through. Prior to being homeless, I worked for the attorney general. I had good jobs. I started working at 12 years old. But the drugs ... I ran into a guy with fast money, and didn't have to work, everything was provided. So I was exposed to the drug life, and got caught up in the life I was exposed to. Crack is so powerful, you get that high that one time, and you never get it again. So you're chasing that high. It was rough being out on the streets, because you never knew who you were going to bump into. For 11 years, I drank every day and smoked every day. I thought I was going to die on the streets. But God said no. And he gave me a second chance at life. I've been clean for 27 years. I got my children back, I went to school. Got my first master's. I'm working on my second master's, to get my [master's in social work]. I'm currently working with homeless men. I have a population of 177 men and I have the daunting task of making sure they have housing and that they are treated with dignity. Every now and then, I have to give myself a refresher course. Because you can become numb to the pain, numb to the way some people are living, and then I have to remind myself, Leslie, you used to be a homeless woman, too, so if there was hope for you, there's hope for them.” -- Leslie, 2018Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent have welcomed a son, Oskar Brent-Berkus, via a surrogate.

The “Nate & Jeremiah by Design” hosts confirmed the news on Instagram Thursday.

“We have waited for you, we already love you, and we as a family stand on the shoulders of so many people who have made it possible for families like ours to continue to grow,” Berkus wrote alongside an adorable black-and-white photo of his daughter, Poppy, touching her new brother’s little toes.

Brent shared a similar image on his Instagram along with a heartfelt message of his own.

“Hand in hand our family is basking in the phenomenon of it all. We love you little Oskar,” he wrote. “How thankful we are. How beautiful it all is.”

The interior designers, who married in 2014, revealed that they were expanding their family on Valentine’s Day with a heartfelt video of their daughter, now 3, making the announcement at their home in Los Angeles.

In an interview with People this month, Berkus opted not to reveal the design details of Oskar’s nursery ― “I’m Jewish, so I have a superstition against it,” he joked ― but said that Poppy was looking forward to becoming a big sister.

“She’s very happy,” he said. “She’s a very sweet girl and she’s very maternal, which is interesting. She’s also very clear on what her brother is allowed to play with and what he isn’t, and what she’s willing to help out with. So we’ll see how that pans out!”"Philadelphia" is coming to Amazon in April. Philadelphia

You probably won’t be spending a ton of time bingeing shows on Amazon this April, since all the highlights joining the service are movies.

The Academy Award-winning film “Philadelphia” joins, which is especially pertinent for younger readers who may not have realized that Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington starred in an excellent movie together (not that I’m personally admitting anything here).

A couple of small ― but critically acclaimed ― movies from 2017 also join, including stand-outs “The Florida Project” and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer.”

If you need a show in your life and only have an Amazon subscription, you could watch “Storage Wars: Northern Treasures,” I guess. Or “All Or Nothing: Dallas Cowboys” ― but that team has been bad for a while, so you already know it ends up with nothing. Maybe just stick with the movies.

ArrivalsFor these two generations of queer women, the concept of “family” isn’t defined by race, sexuality or gender.

Kali Villarosa and her mother, Vickie Steller, sit down for a candid chat about their unique family structure, as well as the future of feminism and LGBTQ rights, for a new video produced by GLAAD to mark Women’s History Month. Villarosa references multiple “mothers” throughout the video, while her biological father is a gay Latino man.

Steller’s former partner, who is Villarosa’s biological mother, is black. Her wife is white.

“It’s always been important to us to be super authentic and true to ourselves and present that part of ourselves publicly,” Steller says in the video. “So it was always very important for us from the time you guys were born to raise you guys to feel really positive and proud about who you were, about who your family was.”

A member of GLAAD’s Campus Ambassador program, Villarosa adds, “I have all these historical figures I can honor ― all these very strong queer women who have come before me. But I also have the very strong queer women right in front of me.”

Clare Kenny, GLAAD’s campaign manager in charge of youth engagement, told HuffPost that the video was part of the LGBTQ rights organization’s aim to honor families like Steller and Villarosa’s “who have long represented the brilliance, beauty and potential of a family that is truly accepting.”

“It is vital for audiences, particularly young queer women, to see themselves — and the trailblazers that came before them,” Kenny said.Lauren Hogg, a teen survivor of last month’s mass shooting at a Florida high school, is accusing a Fox News host of cyberbullying.

Laura Ingraham of the “Ingraham Angle” on Wednesday mocked Hogg’s brother, David Hogg, also a survivor of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, which left 17 dead.

David Hogg has since become a vocal proponent of gun control, and has been attacked from the right for it.

Ingraham said the high school senior “whined” about getting rejected by four colleges:

David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.) https://t.co/wflA4hWHXY — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 28, 2018

Lauren Hogg defended her brother:

How low are your ratings @IngrahamAngle that you have to start attacking my brother’s grades to get attention? If you ask me, he is more articulate than you and has far better character. Man, that’s real low even for you. Coming from a 14 year old, please grow up. #NeverAgain https://t.co/CgUVeGRfxP — Lauren Hogg (@lauren_hoggs) March 28, 2018

Her brother called for a boycott of Ingraham’s show on Wednesday evening:

Soooo @IngrahamAngle what are your biggest advertisers ... Asking for a friend. #BoycottIngramAdverts — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 29, 2018

Lauren Hogg also called on first lady Melania Trump, who has vowed to fight cyberbullying, to speak out.

Lauren Hogg, who lost four friends in the mass shooting, made a similar comment last month, when Donald Trump Jr. “liked” two tweets promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about her brother.

“You say that your mission as first lady is to stop cyber bullying,” she tweeted to Melania Trump. “Don’t you think it would have been smart to have a convo with your stepson @ DonaldJTrumpJr before he liked a post about a false conspiracy theory which ... put a target on my back?”Samantha Bee dove deep into the issues that Puerto Rico continues to face more than six months after Hurricane Maria in a “Full Frontal” special on Wednesday.

“If this happened in Connecticut, it would be front page news every day,” Bee said at the start of the show, citing how 103,000 people on the U.S. territory are still without power.

In the hourlong special, the comedian and her team dissected the ongoing fallout from the September 2017 natural disaster in the hope it would “make America give a damn about Puerto Rico” again.

At one point, “X-Files” star David Duchovny reprised his Fox Mulder character to investigate conspiracy theories as to why FEMA had failed the Caribbean island in the wake of the devastating storm.

“After the hurricanes, FEMA did their usual mediocre job in Florida and Texas,” said Duchovny. “But in Puerto Rico they did way worse. Why? How? Who’s FEMA really working for?”

Check out the intro above, and the 11 further segments below:In a perplexing decision earlier this month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency decided it will no longer take climate change into account as it plans ahead for the future.

If that leaves you with some serious concerns, you’re not alone. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) has some too. On Thursday, Ellison sent a letter to FEMA Administrator Brock Long with some pointed questions seeking clarification.

Of particular note is FEMA’s recently released 2018-2022 “Strategic Plan.” The document is crafted to prepare the nation for future catastrophic disasters; in its latest iteration, it omits any reference to climate change. That stands in contrast to the 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, which identified climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk ― and urged we take action.

Rep. Ellison called the change “inexplicable,” especially considering the plan’s stated goals include ensuring society is provided with the necessary information to prepare for future disasters. This goal is consistent with FEMA’s overall vision of building “a prepared and resilient nation.”

“The nation can neither be prepared for nor resilient in the face of climate-induced disasters if government leaders ignore the scientific information related to climate change and its risks,” the representative’s letter reads.

“It is puzzling to understand how FEMA could meet the emerging challenges of 21st century disasters while ignoring the mounting evidence of the link between climate change and weather events,” Rep. Ellison continued. “Last year’s Climate Science Special Report, part of the National Climate Assessment, found that natural disasters intensified by global warming will become more frequent and problematic as temperatures rise.”

2017 was the costliest, most damaging year on record for weather and climate-related disasters in the U.S., with a total bill of $306 billion. That figure is expected to rise as the climate shifts further.

FEMA defended its decision to exclude climate change from the planning document earlier this month, emphasizing it’s focused more on the effects of storms than their causes. While omitting climate change, the agency did, however, identify several causes of rising damage, including “rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience.”

Rep. Ellison’s letter concludes with a series of questions seeking more information on FEMA’s decision ― and who had a say in it. The questions include:

“What analysis, if any, was used to conclude that climate change and global warming are not strategic risks worthy of inclusion in the FEMA Strategic Plan?” “Were any individuals from the White House or the Executive Office of the President involved in this decision?” “Which outside organizations or individuals did you meet with prior to making this decision?” “Did FEMA consult with any scientists or climate experts when making this decision?” “Do you believe there is a link between human activity, the changing climate, and extreme weather events?”The National Rifle Association has launched a heated offensive in the weeks since the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Warning of the “freedom-hating left” impinging on Americans’ “fundamental rights” and spreading conspiracy theories about teenagers who survived the mass shooting, the gun group ramped up efforts to raise money, recruit members and drum up support for its agenda.

The strategy appears to be working.

Donations to the group spiked in the aftermath of the school shooting, in which a former student armed with an assault-style rifle killed 17 people. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA received “twice as much money from nearly five times as many donors” in the week after the shooting, compared with the week before.

Donations to the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, which contributes money to political campaigns for NRA-friendly candidates, tripled in February from the month earlier, reported CNN.

The Center for Responsive Politics noted it’s unclear what caused the surge. It said factors may have included the NRA’s recent outreach efforts and comments by President Donald Trump after the shooting suggesting he may take a tougher stance on gun control (Trump later flip-flopped on the issue).

The Chicago Tribune reported last week that the NRA “aggressively increased” its advertising on Facebook in the weeks after the Parkland attack. The paper, citing data from tech company Pathmatics, reported that the NRA’s average daily spending on Facebook advertising had been $11,300 in the 24 days before the shooting. The group paused its ads in the four days immediately after the slaughter, but then r esumed advertising ― increasing average daily spending on Facebook ads to $47,300 in the succeeding 24 days.

NRA social media pages have boosted membership and donation-drive messages since Parkland. On Saturday ― hours before the March For Our Lives in Washington, organized by Stoneman Douglas survivors ― an NRA post on Facebook urged people to join the group to “stand and fight for our kids’ safety.”

“Today’s protests aren’t spontaneous,” the NRA wrote on Facebook, referring to the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators demanding gun reforms. “Gun-hating billionaires and Hollywood elites are manipulating and exploiting children as part of their plan to DESTROY the Second Amendment and strip us of our right to defend ourselves and our loved ones.”

The post directed people to the NRA website, which urged them to “join NRA’s March for Freedom.” Visitors were given an option to pay for a membership.

Screenshot/NRA

In the six weeks prior to Parkland, the NRA posted just one message about donations or membership on its Facebook page. In the six weeks since, it has published 11 such posts.

Recent posts strike a similar tone. “The freedom-hating left wants to take away your fundamental right to self-defense,” read one from mid-March, boasting an “EXCLUSIVE RENEWAL OFFER” for existing NRA members.

“Never in our lives have we seen more dangerous and reckless attacks from those who despise our freedoms,” said another, promising a “FREE gift” for those who renewed their membership. “We need YOU fighting with us more than ever!”

The regular price of a one-year NRA membership is $40. According to a 2015 report by the nonprofit A-Mark Foundation, about half of NRA’s total revenue comes from membership dues.

It’s unclear how many new members have joined the NRA or renewed their membership since the Parkland attack.The message at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington this weekend was clear: Gun violence isn’t just a problem of mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month. Nor is it isolated to the bloodshed that tears through cities on a daily basis, or to other routine shootings often tied to mental health, domestic violence or police intervention.

Gun violence is an all of the above issue.

As speakers took the stage on Saturday ― none of them above the age of 19 ― they offered differing perspectives on the many ways guns affect individuals and communities alike.

This diversity shouldn’t have come as a shock to anyone following the Stoneman Douglas students as they prepared for the event. In the lead-up to the rally, they spoke out about their own privilege and the need to broaden their scope beyond the mass shootings that rarely, but explosively, strike affluent communities like theirs. They met with students from Chicago and Washington to discuss what gun violence looks like to them, and how best to confront it.

The lineup of speakers seemed like proof the Parkland students weren’t just talking the talk. They had worked to make their movement genuinely inclusive, both in terms of race and socioeconomic class, and in its embodiment of the varied experiences of gun violence around the nation.

But now comes the hard part for the March for Our Lives movement. As it evolves beyond activism and into more concrete advocacy, the students face the challenge of crafting an agenda that continues to embrace inclusivity while working toward solutions to tackle gun violence in all of its forms.

“Gun violence is such a local issue,” said Paul John, leader of the New York City chapter of Million Hoodies, a racial justice group. “Whereas some communities may have more of an issue with domestic violence, certain suburbs may have been impacted my mass shootings, others by suicide.”

Each of those problems requires a different set of tools to address. When it comes to urban gun violence in particular, which accounts for a disproportionate share of overall shootings, it can be a challenge to get people outside the affected communities to understand how pervasive and deeply intertwined the issue is with other structural inequities that have long plagued inner-city neighborhoods, John said.

“It’s going to be important for the young Parkland students to realize how complex gun violence really is and take steps toward being more informed as to how gun violence affects communities around the country,” he said.

The March For Our Lives campaign has already identified a number of policy objectives, including universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 style rifle used in Parkland. But to those who have been actively involved in community-based gun violence prevention efforts, prescriptions like these are far from a catch-all.

“We all agree gun laws are a good start, but we really need to look more comprehensively at what it is that causes people to act out violently,” said Miguel Dominguez, director of youth programs at Community Coalition, a social justice nonprofit in Los Angeles.

Lamar Johnson, the violence prevention coordinator for BRAVE (Bold Resistance Against Violence Everywhere), based out of St. Sabina Parish in Chicago, sees it similarly.

“We have legislation and we have tough gun laws, but what we don’t have is investment in our community,” he said.

A decadeslong lack of investment in neighborhoods in Chicago and Los Angeles has helped feed a “culture of violence,” said Johnson. With little funding for schools, businesses and social services, many local kids suffer from a lack of opportunity, which serves as a pipeline into the sorts of criminal activity that often leads to shootings.

Both Community Coalition and BRAVE take a holistic approach to violence prevention, providing outreach to youth to give them the skills and resources they need to resist the traps that can lead them down these roads in the first place.

Youth leaders from both organizations spoke on Saturday to offer a window into the realities they face. Edna Chavez, a 17-year-old from Los Angeles, recalled learning how to “duck from bullets” before she could read. Trevon Bosley, a 19-year-old from Chicago, reminded the crowd that “everyday shootings are everyday problems.” Chavez and Bosley both lost brothers to gun violence.

Johnson said he was happy to see those voices represented at the March for Our Lives, but he noted that initiatives like BRAVE need more than just a larger stage from which to tell their stories.

“People figure they gave us a platform to speak so they did their due diligence, which is like a slap to the face, because giving me a microphone means nothing if you’re not going to give me the funding and the resources for my youth program and violence prevention programs,” said Johnson. “We still have to go back into this crime element we live in every day.”

St. Sabina has seen an uptick in calls from interested donors since Bosley’s speech, said Johnson. But so far, there have been no celebrities or high-dollar donations ― no Oprah, or George and Amal Clooney, who together donated $1 million to the March for Our Lives.

“We’re still pushing for that and we still need that and that’s why we’re trying to publicize it as much as possible to say, it’s not just in Chicago but in all the urban cities across America that have the same issues,” said Johnson.

Johnson added that his BRAVE members have remained in touch with the Parkland students, and that they’ve discussed additional events for the summer, when violence in Chicago and in many cities tends to spike.

The March for Our Lives students will need to continue actively fostering this collaboration if they want to keep their movement truly inclusive, said Amber Goodwin, founder and executive director of Community Justice Reform Coalition, a national advocacy group focused on gun violence prevention. Goodwin said this sort of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.

“Plugging in with groups that are already doing the local work is really important,” she said. “It’s a great way to show partnership, but also to meet people where they’re already at, versus asking people to come to where folks in the gun violence prevention space have been for so long.”

A crucial part of this alliance will involve the Parkland kids simply listening to the concerns of other communities and using their input to inform the movement’s agenda, said Goodwin.

“This has to be an intersectional issue.” - Amber Goodwin, Community Justice Reform Coalition

Policies can have different effects and connotations for different groups of people, and solutions that appeal to some may seem dangerous to others.

That disparity was on display in Parkland this week, where a group of black Stoneman Douglas students spoke out, explaining that the increased police presence at school since the shooting made them uncomfortable. They also said they felt they’d been left out of conversations about the local response to the massacre.

This sort of oversight has cropped up in the national gun violence prevention movement as well, said Goodwin, who previously worked for the gun control organization launched by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). She said many groups working on the issue been “siloed,” which has meant marginalized communities have sometimes not had “the self-determination and the space” to be able to advocate for their specific needs.

The March for Our Lives was an all-too-rare example of what it looks like when these communities are given that opportunity, said Goodwin. She advised the Stoneman Douglas students to continue reaching out to elected officials and organizations that center communities of color, and to take advantage of existing local partnerships and gun violence prevention programs that have already shown tangible results.

“This has to be an intersectional issue,” said Goodwin. “But it’s not just a matter of saying that things are not diverse and that we need diversity and inclusion; it’s actually going to be dismantling a lot of the systems that have been built.”

That won’t be an easy task, Goodwin admits, which is one reason she believes the young organizers behind March for Our Lives shouldn’t be afraid to lean on adults for their experience and expertise.

“Yes, young people should lead, but we should be thinking about how we do this inter-generationally, where we’re looking at the strategies that have worked for more seasoned organizers,” she said.

But even if the March for Our Lives students do dedicate themselves to building and strengthening these sort of partnerships, many of the obstacles for local gun violence prevention efforts will remain. Getting the necessary resources and support needed for them to succeed is a constant struggle, said Paul of Million Hoodies.

“Many times, the local governments are strapped for funding to implement these strategies ... so being able to bring in private funding and being able to bring in people who are looking to support gun violence prevention organizations on a consistent basis is key,” he said.

With a massive platform, the March for Our Lives organizers may be able to help channel resources toward those initiatives.

Another way the March for Our Lives movement can champion these causes is through the ballot. Organizers made a big push to register voters at the weekend rallies, and the Parkland students have made the November elections a key focal point in the movement.

But activists want young people to know that it’s not just a matter of backing members of Congress who support gun reform. It’s also about mayors, city councilmembers and other local officials who, in some ways, have more direct power to address gun violence in their communities.

Although the Parkland students have a lot of work ahead to ensure that their movement can deliver on the promising vision laid out on Saturday, John is cautiously optimistic that they’ll be able to succeed where others have failed.Megyn Kelly grilled the lawyer representing President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen on Thursday morning over Cohen’s “vulgar and ... arguably threatening comments” as well as the threats he allegedly made against Stormy Daniels.

Lawyer David Schwartz explains to Megyn Kelly that the notoriously combative Michael Cohen has "another side to the story." Twitter

Kelly first brought up an incident from 2015 when Cohen laid into reporter Tim Mak over a Daily Beast story about Ivana Trump accusing her former husband of “violating” her.

“You write a story that has Mr. Trump’s name in it, with the word ‘rape,’ and I’m going to mess your life up,” Cohen told Mak. “For as long as you’re on this frickin’ planet.”

About his client’s rhetoric, lawyer David Schwartz told Kelly: “When your boss is being threatened like that? Everybody should want an employee like this. Who would be so loyal, so loyal to your boss that you would protect that person.”

The “Today” show conversation continued with Schwartz saying that Cohen had never threatened anyone, specifically former adult film star Stormy Daniels; that Cohen “doesn’t do that”; and that if he were going to do that, “he does it to someone’s face.”

Daniels, who took hush money in 2016 to hide an alleged affair with Donald Trump a decade earlier, claims that Cohen ordered a threat against her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011.

Schwartz insisted, “He would never do something like that.”

Kelly fired back that “Michael Cohen does have a history of making vulgar and allegedly or arguably threatening comments.”

“I myself have been on the receiving end of those, as you know,” said Kelly.

She then pointed to one instance, after a 2016 election debate, in which Cohen retweeted a series of threatening messages ― one of which included a call to “gut” Kelly.

“So you’re not Michael’s favorite person,” said Schwartz. “It’s not a love connection, OK, so all right.”

Kelly didn’t like that response. “You make light of it now,” she said, “but I’m telling you, in response to that allegation that I received death threats, I had security guards following me around and that my old boss called Michael Cohen directly to say, ‘If Megyn Kelly gets killed, it’s not going to help your client Donald Trump get elected.’ And Michael Cohen didn’t care.”

Schwartz suggested that Cohen was actually “trying to help.”

“He was trying to help me!?” said Kelly. “He was trying to help me? By suggesting that I should be gutted?”

Schwartz then tried the two-sides-to-every-question approach.

“I don’t accept everything that you’re saying, because he has another side to the story. Maybe one day you guys can talk this out,” he said.

“Because there are two sides to every story,” he added. “It’s not just Megyn’s side of the story. There are other sides.”Janet Jackson kept the hits coming Sunday on the night she became the first black woman to win the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas.

She slayed a medley of her most popular songs ― including “Nasty” and “Throb” ― and gave a powerful speech that pledged solidarity to #MeToo while calling for an end to “loud and harsh” public discourse.

Bruno Mars introduced the 52-year-old pop star by noting the sociopolitical impact of her work and the sheer success of it ― she’s the first woman to record five straight No. 1 albums.

Then Jackson went to work on stage in reportedly her first televised performance since 2009.

The crowd chanted “Ja-net, Ja-net, Ja-net!” as she began her acceptance speech.

“I believe that for all the challenges, for all our challenges, we live at a glorious moment in history,” she said in the clip above. “It’s a moment when at long last women have made it clear that we will no longer be controlled, manipulated or abused. I stand with those women and with those men equally outraged by discrimination who support us in heart and mind.

“This is also a moment when our public discourse is loud and harsh,” she added. “My prayer is that, weary of such noise, we turn back to the source of all calmness. That source — that source is God. Everything we lack, God has in abundance, compassion, sensitivity, patience and a boundless love.”Facebook

Even for someone paying close attention, the Cambridge Analytica scandal can be wildly confusing. Companies turn out to be shell companies turn out to be campaign contractors, and Facebook’s nebulous rules surrounding privacy and third-party data access don’t help clear things up. There have of course been plenty of explainers from people who know what they’re talking about, but who wants to read those?

Because if you actually want to know how much Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal matters, you need to go to the people who care about Facebook the most. You need to go to the moms.

On Sunday, my own mother agreed to give me a rundown of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal as she understands it. This is the conversation that followed, lightly edited for grammar and continuity. Footnotes can be found below.

How long have you been on Facebook?

Wait, are you interviewing a lot of people?

No, just you.

Oh. What’s the name of the post?

Probably “The Cambridge Analytica Scandal, According To My Mom,” or something along those lines.

Oh, OK. Oh! As I was lying in bed this morning I actually remembered more about what I’d seen on TV. Because I think more clearly in the morning, and —

Well, first, tell me how long you’ve been on Facebook.

Since you first graduated high school. Because, remember, I wanted to see pictures of you. That’s why I got on — I think you put me on it, actually. So, like, nine or 10 years?

And how would you identify politically?

I guess... conservative? Well, kind of, middle-of-the-road Republican, whatever you call it.

Right of center?

Yeah, I guess I would be a little bit right of center.

OK, so now, tell me what you think the Cambridge Analytica scandal is.

Well, the main problem, I guess, is that they got permission from different people on Facebook to use their information — I think they used it for targeted ads. Like, this company wanted to use it for targeted ads, so they got permission. I think it was using an app — at least, that’s what I heard on TV. And these people downloaded the app, and they gave permission for Ana ― whatever, Cambridge Analytica — to use their information.¹ Well, Cambridge Analytica not only used their information from Facebook, but they used all their Facebook friends’ information, too. Which they hadn’t gotten permission to do.² So that’s part of the problem. But I’m not sure if that’s illegal or it’s just wrong to do, or... I don’t know if it’s really illegal, but something about that isn’t on the up and up.³ They shouldn’t have done that!

So then they had information not only on however many thousands of people, now they had information on millions of people, and most of them hadn’t given out permission.

So then I guess what’s-his-name, who runs Facebook —

Mark Zuckerberg.

Mark Zuckerberg! Yeah. I heard that when it happened, Facebook found out that they were doing it and told them not to do it anymore. But that’s all they did, was tell them.⁴ So they still did it. And even though they still did it, Facebook didn’t do anything about it. So that’s why they’re in trouble, because they let it go on.

And when you say they took information, what sort of information did they take?

I don’t know. I guess things that they pick up from people on Facebook, like what sites they look at, what they click on that interests them. I guess, also, they took what they talk about on Facebook, like their political interests, their clothing interests. You know, anything so that they can target ads towards those people. And I guess they also thought that Trump had used — or actually, Trump did use some of their information or bought the rights to use some of that information.⁵ Oh! But I heard that even though he’d bought the rights to use it, he had never actually ended up using it.⁶ This is just what I heard.

Heard where?

On TV. Probably Fox News.

Does it concern you that other people could have this information on you?

Like, as far as me? That they might have my information? I guess, only because then I might start getting more advertisements trying to target me, and I hate advertising. I try to get rid of it all. But I haven’t done or written anything that I would care if anyone knew about. I don’t usually write stuff that I don’t want to be out in public, and anything I click on usually isn’t anything controversial.

And who do you think runs Cambridge Analytica?

Oh, I have no idea.

Would it sound right to say that Steve Bannon had been the vice president of Cambridge Analytica?

Oh, you know, actually, I don’t know if it’s from something I read that you wrote or what, but I do remember reading something that said Steve Bannon — or whoever like that — had a part in it. I don’t remember what it was.⁷

Do you know who the Mercers are?

The Mercers? No.⁸

How much money do you think the Trump campaign spent on Cambridge Analytica?

I don’t know, a couple million? I have no idea. I’m guessing in the millions.⁹

And do you know of anything else Cambridge Analytica did that might have been bad?

Besides this thing with Facebook? No, I don’t think so. This is the first time I’ve ever heard of them.

I mean, like, something that might have come out in the past week or so.

No, that’s all I remember.

So you didn’t hear anything recently about them telling a reporter that they use sex workers to blackmail politicians?

I don’t think — have you written anything about that?

Not really.

Yeah, I haven’t heard anything about that.¹⁰

OK, so back to the Facebook stuff, are you hesitant at all to use Facebook now?

No, I don’t really care. Because the only way it affects me, that it bothers me, is if I’m going to start getting all these advertisements coming up when I’m looking at stuff. I don’t like that.

Has this scandal affected your opinion of Donald Trump at all?

No. Because you know what? With Trump, I know he has a lot of faults, a lot of things he does that I don’t think he should do, but the fact that, I think, he’s doing well with the economy so far, that other stuff is just personality stuff. Like the tweeting. I don’t like a lot of the tweets that he does, and stuff like that.

So it doesn’t concern you that a guy who was one of Trump’s closest political advisers, Steve Bannon, was involved with a company that said it bribes and entraps politicians?

No, I mean, first of all, is Steve Bannon still working for him?

No, but he was his chief strategist and ran his campaign.

Yeah, but, you know, it doesn’t bother me because all the politicians have weird, sneaky people working for them. I mean Obama did, too. He went to a church, or he was friends with this — what was he? A preacher? I forgot his name — who did a lot of not nice things. So you know, they all do.¹¹ Personally, I think Washington and the politicians and everyone there and the congressmen and senators, they’re all bad. I think you can’t be a really nice person and be in politics. I think you have to be, kind of, willing to do things that aren’t exactly morally right. You have to be willing to do that to actually be a success politically. I think the nice guys, if they get in, they don’t stay in long, maybe because they see how it is and can’t handle it. But I think most of those politicians are not nice people.

And has your opinion of Mark Zuckerberg changed at all?

Yeah, it probably has changed a little. I used to think I really liked him. I actually used to think, when he first started Facebook, and he was really rich and he wasn’t too much older than you and he was Jewish, I thought, oh, he’d be good for you! I used to think that.

But you don’t anymore?

Well, not now, because I see that he kind of ignored that bad stuff, and he seems to have done some things he shouldn’t have done. So he doesn’t seem like such a sweet, nice person that I thought he was at first. Not that I’d be upset if you married him, because I wouldn’t be!

You know he’s already married?

Anything can happen!

So the Cambridge Analytica scandal affected your opinion of Mark Zuckerberg but not Trump?

No, because my opinion of Trump was already that he wasn’t the greatest guy. Like I knew that he had a lot of faults. But some of the things that he’s good at outweigh that for me. Like, I’m more interested in the economy — I just am. And that, I think, is more important than him doing these stupid tweets and stuff like that. Or even, like, I’m sure he fooled around with those hookers,¹² I’m sure he did, but you know, I’m sure a lot of the politicians did stuff like that. It’s just, you didn’t — I mean, Kennedy did it. But that’s not affecting how he runs the country.

What would it take for you to no longer want to use Facebook?

I guess if my... I don’t know. I like using Facebook because my friends and college friends and high school friends are on there. I mean, you’re not on there as much anymore and neither is Jason,¹³ really. But I like it so I can see what those people are doing, my friends from college and high school and people I know but normally wouldn’t have any contact with if it weren’t for Facebook.

But is there anything you could find out about what they might be doing that would make you want to stop using Facebook, or that would make you feel unsafe on Facebook?

Um... I guess if I found out that they had little webcam cameras in there that I didn’t know about, and every time I looked at Facebook they were watching me — I wouldn’t like that. Then I would probably stop using it.¹⁴

Has your opinion of Steve Bannon changed at all?

I never really liked him. He’s kind of creepy-looking anyway.

That’s judgey of you.

Well, I don’t know. He’s just kind of creepy-looking. Plus, like I said, I’m not far right. A lot of the stuff that he talks about I don’t really agree with. And like Breitbart, Breitbart is way too far right for me. I’m more in the middle.

What’s your main source of news, would you say?

Well, on TV, it’s probably more Fox News. But sometimes when I want to hear the other side, I’ll listen to CNN or MSNBC for a little while. But then they’re both — both sides, Fox News and all those are just so slanted one way or the other, it’s hard to find something that’s just explaining the news.

You should just ask me to explain it.

You’re slanted, too! You always give an opinion. I liked your article about the dolphin, though. I thought that was cute!

Those were all my questions. Is there anything else notable you think you learned from hearing about the scandal?

Well, I already knew that they use your information to give you targeted ads, because I get them all the time if I click on something, and then I start getting all this stuff. Like, I don’t like that, but it doesn’t make me stop using it. Because it’s just an annoyance.

OK, I think that’s it.

Oh! Now that it’s over, what did you think of my answers?

You got more right than I expected, actually! But a lot of it was still extremely wrong.¹⁵

Oh well.

¹ People were under the impression that they were just granting access to “thisisyourdigitallife,” a personality quiz app, and its creator, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University professor who’d been recruited by Cambridge Analytica.

² Under Facebook’s rules, while Kogan was allowed to harvest data from the friends of people who had used the app, he was not allowed to sell it to a third party.

³ At this point, it’s not actually clear whether Cambridge Analytica’s actions were illegal, as far as its use of Facebook data is concerned. If there was lawbreaking involved, it would likely have been due to the fact that Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, as a foreign national, should have recused himself from any involvement with a U.S. political campaign, which he of course did not.

⁴ Technically, in 2015, Facebook also made Cambridge Analytica promise real hard that it’d destroyed the data it was never supposed to have had in the first place. Cambridge Analytica assured Facebook it had done so (although it hadn’t), and Facebook apparently saw no need to check further.

⁵ It wasn’t so much that the Trump campaign bought the rights to use Cambridge Analytica’s data as it was that Cambridge Analytica, a company created by Trump donors and supporters, was working directly with the Trump campaign.

⁶ He definitely did.

⁷ Steve Bannon was indeed the vice president of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to take over the Trump campaign.

⁸ The Mercers, specifically the father-daughter team of Robert and Rebekah Mercer, are conservative, billionaire Trump supporters with deep ties to Bannon. Over the past few years, they’ve funneled $15 million of funding into their pet project, Cambridge Analytica.

¹⁰ Well, they did.

¹¹ She probably means Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Barack Obama’s former pastor and the source of considerable controversy during Obama’s 2008 campaign. Wright didn’t have anything to do with breaking election laws, but he did say a number of egregiously true things, like that America has “more black men in prison than there are in college” and that America is “deeply involved in the importing of drugs, the exporting of guns, and the training of professional killers... We bombed Cambodia, Iraq and Nicaragua, killing women and children while trying to get public opinion turned against Castro and Gaddafi.”

An elementary school teacher has been suspended for discussing a topic related to her sexual orientation in class.

Stacy Bailey, 31, an art teacher at Charlotte Anderson Elementary School in Arlington, Texas, who was previously named “Teacher of the Year 2016,” was suspended with pay after the district received a complaint from a parent that she was discussing an LGBT topic in class.

On Wednesday, The Dallas Morning News published a statement from the Mansfield Independent School District, which read that Bailey “insists that it is her right and that it is age appropriate for her to have ongoing discussions with elementary-age students about her own sexual orientation, the sexual orientation of artists, and their relationships with other gay artists.”

The newspaper added, “Parents have the right to control the conversation with their children, especially as it relates to religion, politics, sex/sexual orientation, etc.,” and that “Ms. Bailey refused to follow administration’s directions regarding age-appropriate conversation with students.”

Yahoo Lifestyle could not reach a representative at Mansfield for comment and did not hear back from Bailey or her lawyer Giana Ortiz for comment.

However, on Tuesday, Ortiz wrote in an email to the Dallas Morning News that the administration’s depiction of events isn’t accurate. “For Stacy, this entire ordeal began when she spoke with the students about her family which, for Stacy, included her wife,” Ortiz said. “The district appears to speak for Stacy when it states that she ‘insists it is her right and that it is age appropriate’ to discuss matters including ongoing discussions about her own sexuality. This is absolutely false. Further, she never received directives to change her behavior — and never refused to follow any directive.”

According to a March 7 story published by the Dallas Morning News in August, Bailey emailed the district to ask that “sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression” be included in the school’s anti-discrimination policy.

“I think it is important that MISD starts movement towards progress now,” Bailey’s email read, according to the news outlet. “We have many LGBTQ teachers, students, and families in this district. We deserve the right to feel protected by our district.”

A few weeks later, Bailey received notice that she was suspended “until an investigation is completed.” She was also told to ”make no contact with students, parents or other staff members.” (The school denied that Bailey’s request was related to her suspension).

On Wednesday, Bailey’s lawyer said the school’s public statement was a violation of the law.” [I’m] shocked by the school district’s decision to speak openly about a personnel matter — Stacy’s administrative leave — in spite of its legal obligations of confidentiality,” Ortiz told the Dallas Morning News. “The district’s actions violate Stacy’s rights under the U.S. Constitution.”

On Tuesday night, the paper reported that three dozen people, including Bailey’s wife, father, and sister appeared at a school board meeting requesting answers regarding Bailey’s suspension. A 9-year-old student also addressed the board, calling Bailey a “role model.”

The Dallas Morning News also published text messages it claims are from Charlotte Anderson principal Sheira Petty who messaged a staffer named Donna about the situation. In response to whether Bailey had done something similar in the past, Petty reportedly replied, “Not to his [sic] extent. She has said she had a girlfriend and she showed a slide show of her friends that included girlfriend. … In talking with HR, it was always determined I was NOT to tell her she can’t say certain things. To my knowledge, she has never gone to this extent.”
