In the decade or so since the onset of the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase has racked up 52 fines and settlements with various agencies of the federal government, totaling $28.8 billion.

It’s an impressive array of infractions: bribing Chinese government officials; violating economic sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan; being complicit in the Bernie Madoff investment scandal; rigging interest rates; manipulating energy markets; alternately ripping off and bribing local governments; retaliating against a whistleblower; deceiving regulators about trading data; and creating a litany of mortgage abuses and related scams involving the sale of bad mortgages to investors. The complete list, compiled by the Good Jobs First nonprofit, includes employment discrimination, accounting violations and unpaid wages, among other abuses large and small.

JPMorgan, which declined to comment for this article, is hardly unique. For many years now, the United States government has treated corporate fraud and abuse as a line-item cost on a balance sheet, not a matter of public trust and accountability.

Which is why Janet Yellen’s final action as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve was so surprising. Late Friday, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to replace four members of its board and barred the bank from further growth “until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.” The decision is rightly being interpreted as a milestone in the central bank’s regulatory oversight of the financial system, a belated government censure for a scandal in which Wells Fargo created millions of bogus accounts for customers over the course of several years.

The Fed could, of course, go further. It has the power to ban individuals from the banking industry for life ― a penalty routinely deployed against tellers who pocket $20 bills from the register. It didn’t invoke that authority or name any specific directors in its order. And if the central bank wants to be consistent about its oversight of big bank abuse, there is no reason to exempt other serial offenders from the crackdown. Wells Fargo’s account scandal is unique, but JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America each have a long, long list of federal fines and settlements to their names in the years since the crash.

But Yellen’s parting shot against Wells Fargo is a significant departure for an institution that simply has not taken serious action against the leaders of rogue banks in the past. As a regulatory agency, the Fed has been just as likely to help big banks wriggle out of rules policing excessive risk as it has been to write them. Yellen was planting a flag. If you can’t police your bank, you shouldn’t be on its board.

Over the past year, the parade of outrages has obscured deeper uncomfortable truths about the pervasiveness of corruption ― legal or otherwise ― in American government. President Donald Trump and his family appear to be openly profiting from his presidency. But this is a cartoon version of recent political history, not a radical break with it.

Throughout the financial crisis and its aftermath, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeatedly railed against what he called “Old Testament justice” as a response to the breakdown on Wall Street (he used variants of the phrase no less than 18 times in his memoir). People who wanted to see bankers held personally accountable for their role in the 2008 collapse ― a calamity fueled by stupidity, carelessness and criminal behavior ― were no more than bloodthirsty rubes, he argued. Clawing back bonuses, firing directors or jailing executives for fraud was no different than putting heads on pikes in response to a bad harvest. It wouldn’t fix a broken system or help people get back to work. Geithner’s perspective was shared by Attorney General Eric Holder, who told Congress that prosecuting top bankers for crimes ― however blatant ― would harm the financial system.

Geithner managed to revive bank liquidity and get a lot of regulations written. But he didn’t actually fix anything. By allowing big banks to function as ongoing engines of fraud amid high unemployment, stagnant wages and the annihilation of middle-class housing wealth (which had profound implications for black families), he and the Obama administration fed twin political and economic problems.

Big banks have continued to behave badly. Yellen wouldn’t have had to punish Wells Fargo if it hadn’t been creating so many fake accounts post-crisis. More important, the anger at Geithner’s governing philosophy fueled enthusiasm for outsider political candidates, many who held hateful ideologies and authoritarian impulses. When democracy doesn’t seem to work, people embrace alternatives.

Trump has made a mockery out of corporate accountability during his time in office. He named a foreclosure fraud kingpin as his treasury secretary and picked Goldman Sachs’ bailout attorney to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. He killed a rule requiring retirement account managers to act in the best interests of their clients, and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, freshly installed at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has scuttled an investigation into the massive consumer data breach at Equifax.WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - The move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, coupled with the killings of dozens of Palestinian protesters on Monday, makes the odds of a U.S.-brokered peace even more remote, analysts said.

“Somewhere between zero and none,” Martin Indyk, a former U.S. special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the Obama administration, said of the chances President Donald Trump might bring the two sides together and broker what he has called the “ultimate deal.”

Israeli troops fatally shot dozens of Palestinian demonstrators on the Gaza border on Monday as the U.S. Embassy formally moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The embassy move fulfilled a Trump campaign promise but infuriated Palestinians and drew criticism that Washington had undercut its own peace efforts.

Palestinian Health Ministry officials said 58 protesters were killed and 2,700 injured by live gunfire, tear gas or other means. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was acting in self-defense against the coastal enclave’s ruling Hamas group.

“It’s hard to see how any Palestinian leader could go back to an American-sponsored peace process” given the embassy move and the Gaza killings, said Khaled Elgindy, a former adviser to the Palestinian leadership now at Washington’s Brookings Institution think tank.

“If and when the administration puts forward a peace plan, it is most likely DOA (dead on arrival),” he added, saying Trump had done nothing to calm matters. “At a minimum, that would require urging the Israelis to stop using lethal force against unarmed protesters.”

BLAMING HAMAS

Rather than calling for restraint by Israel, as both France and Britain did, the United States blamed Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group.

“Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response,” White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters, adding the United States did not believe the opening of the embassy or the latest violence would affect its peace plan.

Hamas denied instigating the violence.

Trump has argued that by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of America’s close ally, he had “taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table” and formalized realities on the ground.

Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move that is not recognized internationally, as its “eternal and indivisible capital.”

Most countries say Jerusalem’s status should be determined in a final peace settlement and that moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal. The Trump administration has said the embassy move does not aim to prejudge Jerusalem’s final borders.

But Senator Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, told Reuters that “most in the region view the U.S.’s position as we’re no longer interested in playing the role to broker peace, and that just compounds a lot of despair and it’s tragic.”

Dan Kurtzer, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Egypt who now teaches at Princeton University, suggested Trump’s administration could regain some credibility among the Palestinians if it were to pledge to open a U.S. embassy in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their capital, when a Palestinian state came into being.

“If he says that, then the U.S. is back in business,” he said. “What is the likelihood of that? ... Pretty meager.”

Washington’s regional allies have publicly expressed dismay about the embassy move, but they share a determination with Washington to thwart what they view as Iran’s expansionism in the region. They also count on the United States for their security.

WIDE SKEPTICISM

“It’s not just that it’s provoked violence or that it’s made the United States look like the biased broker instead of the honest broker,” Indyk said of the embassy move, “but it also has set the process back in a way that all this loose talk about how it’s going to advance peace is ludicrous.”

Trump administration officials have said their peace plan, whose chief architects are the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt, is nearly complete.

“The peace plan will be brought forward at the appropriate time. It can be evaluated on its merits,” said Shah, the White House spokesman.

But it had drawn widespread skepticism even before the latest developments. The Palestinians have boycotted the process since Trump’s Jerusalem announcement in December.

Indyk said the decision “hasn’t advanced peace at all.

“The idea that ... it’s going to convince the Palestinians that now they should come back to the table is a fundamental misrepresentation of what they’ve done,” he added. “They’ve driven the Palestinians away from the table and given them the excuse not to come back.”Actor Richard Dreyfuss, seen in 2017, has been accused of groping fans backstage at a Broadway production in 2004.

Two New York women are accusing actor Richard Dreyfuss of groping them backstage at a 2004 Broadway play, and they’re supporting their story with photos.

Pictures published by the New York Daily News on Tuesday show the 70-year-old “Jaws” actor squeezing one woman’s buttocks, and placing his hands near another woman’s crotch.

The women, only identified as Beth, 48, and Susan, 52, of Long Island, said Dreyfuss gave them a hands-on reception after a performance in “Sly Fox.” They said they followed someone at the theater offering to introduce them to Dreyfuss backstage. Once there, they said, the star’s touching was forceful and came without warning.

“The first thing he did was give me a hug, and he stuck his hand almost in the crack of my butt. He didn’t even give me any warning,” Beth told the Daily News.

Even though the photos show Beth smiling, she said the encounter left her feeling “so uncomfortable. It was such a weird, awkward feeling.”

Susan said Dreyfuss “kissed me without permission. I’m smiling in the photo, but it was a nervous smile. I didn’t know how to react. I was so surprised.”

Friends of the women confirmed to the Daily News that they heard about the events shortly after they occurred.

Both women said they decided to speak out about the bizarre encounter after hearing Dreyfuss deny accusations in November that he exposed himself to a Los Angeles writer in 1987. Dreyfuss admitted to being an “asshole” and an aggressive “flirt,” but denied wrongdoing.Stop what you’re doing! Kendrick Lamar and SZA have just dropped the video for “All the Stars,” the first single off Marvel’s “Black Panther” soundtrack.

The video, which premiered on Tuesday, highlights the glory of African cultures as Kendrick journeys from a literal sea of black hands paving the way for him through scenes of strikingly beautiful black people.

It begins and ends with a galaxy of stars in the shape of the continent that SZA dances in throughout the video. It also showcases dance, vibrant African-print clothing, traditional tribal body paint and royals dripping in gold.

“All the Stars,” directed by Dave Myers and the little homies, glorifies aspects of Africa that are rarely seen in mainstream industries and does so flawlessly.

And fans on Twitter went absolutely wild when the video premiered.

Here’s the first look at our original concept film, #SKYSCRAPER.

THIS SUNDAY during the #SuperBowl you’ll see how far one man will go to protect his wife and children. #SKYSCRAPER SUMMER 2018 pic.twitter.com/IvFGptLb67In 2010, South Korean prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon alleged to her superiors that she was groped by Ahn Tae-geun, South Korea’s former Ministry of Justice prosecutor. No investigation into the allegation took place. Instead, she was criticized and essentially demoted by being transferred to an undesired regional posting in a remote fishing village.

Last week, Seo went public with her allegations, igniting a new stream of South Korean women to participate in the “Me Too” movement.

Female victims across the country united to say that they have not not able to raise their voices in the past because their male sexual harassers tend to be in higher positions than they are. They also note that the culture of Korean society at large suspects and condemns their intentions when they disclose sexual allegations.

However, Seo’s confession has inspired other South Korean women from an array of professions to come forward about their experiences of sexual harassment and assault.

Lee Jae-jeong.

Seo prompted Lee Jae-jeong, assemblywoman for the Democratic Party in South Korea, to disclose for the first time that she was also sexually harassed as a lawyer 13 years ago, but felt unable to speak out.

Lee wrote on Jan. 30 on Facebook, “To stand by Prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon, I wrote and deleted this post a couple of times, still showing my hesitation. This is what I wasn’t able to do when I was a lawyer. This is what I hesitate to do even though I am an assemblywoman.” She included the hashtags #MeToo and #WithYou.

Lee gave an interview on Feb. 2 to “Kim Hyeon-jeong’s News Show” on CBS and discussed the details of her sexual assault. It happened after she passed the bar exam and before she was about to start working for a law firm.

On the show, Lee said, ”[The sexual assaulter] was the president of the law firm that I was about to work for. After it happened, he kept calling me. My refusal was not accepted as refusal by him.”

I was neither the first one nor the last one for him. Even though other female victims clearly indicated their intention of refusal and avoided situations, they were not able to publicize the situation or raise it as an issue. I was a lawyer who bravely stepped up for others’ issues, but I was unable to step up for my own issues because I could vividly picture various disadvantages if I wanted to fight back and expose myself as a victim.

Lee Hyo-kyeong. One

The movement has spurred others to come forward about harassment, including Lee Hyo-kyeong, the provincial assemblywoman for Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council, who posted on Facebook, ″Even I, a woman who is strong-minded, am very commonly sexually harassed. I was called to go to karaoke at 10 p.m., someone called me at 1 a.m. drunk and told me he loved me, I was asked why my hips are so big, and I heard that some guy mentioned my breasts.”

“Six years ago, after a company workshop, I went for dinner and then karaoke with my colleague assemblymen,” she continued, writing that a male colleague approached her while dancing and “suddenly took his pants off.”

“I was embarrassed for a second. I got out of there and headed to my hotel room,” she said. ”Last year, I told my husband what happened six years ago.”

A young woman shows her support with a sign that reads: "Seo's brave #MeToo helped shine on sexual harassment within the police force." One

Women from other sectors are speaking out as well, including Lim Bo-young, a South Korean reporter, who disclosed her experience of sexual harassment by her immediate superior when she worked for the National Police Agency.

Lim recalled that she reported the harassment immediately. The harasser, however, was not disciplined at all. Bo-young took also took to Facebook to share her story:

I read an article that 70% of sexual harassment victims leave their company. I do not regret leaving, but I envy and admire Prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon’s bravery and judgment. From a desire that we will no longer stay silent, I brought up a disgraceful story that I had buried in my mind a long time ago.

The conversation about harassment and assault in professional settings has also resonated with students. Yeon Hak Kang, a graduate student at Hanyang University, disclosed on Facebook that she was determined to quit graduate school after she experienced persistent sexual harassment and molestation from a male lecturer, as well as sexual harassment from her male academic advisor.

She revealed that her academic advisor persistently contacted her, saying some things that crossed student/teacher boundaries, such as “I want to hear your voice” or “Consider me your brother.” Even though she brought up the problem to others, she said she “experienced hair-raising silence and cowardly responses from people around me.”

Yeon stated on Facebook that she changed her mind about leaving school after other women asked her, “Then what about us?”

South Korea’s current conversation around harassment and assault also extends beyond individual stories. Asiana Airlines, for example, is in the spotlight for gender rights issues among flight attendants.

It’s reported that the company’s female flight attendants have been ordered by executives to run to and hug Chairman Park Sam-koo as part of the greeting ceremony when he visits the company once a month.

A person familiar with the situation told Korean newspaper Hankyoreh, “When Chairman Park met female flight attendants, he said without constraint, ‘I came here to get some energy.’ He called the female flight attendants, hugged them for 20-30 minutes, and went to the training center, where flight attendant trainees in their early 20s stay, and spent time there. Asiana Airlines’ response to the newspaper was, ‘Mr. Chairman just encouraged his employees out of his loving heart.’”My 4yo was discussing what's better between Hello Kitty and My Little Pony and I actually had an informed opinion on it.

The Americana roots-rocker and former Drive-By Truckers guitarist isn’t afraid to get political, a move that comes at a time when some critics have questioned Nashville-based music artists for staying quiet on politics ― whether avoiding presidential election talk or keeping mum on gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas last fall.

After the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting in October, in which a gunmen killed 58 people, Isbell tweeted, “What a truly awful thing. It simply shouldn’t be that easy to hurt that many people.”

What a truly awful thing. It simply shouldn't be that easy to hurt that many people. — Jason Isbell (@JasonIsbell) October 2, 2017

The Alabama native, who now calls Nashville home, has also spoken out against President Donald Trump on more than one occasion. “The president is ruled by fear of alienating his base. He’s ‘sticking to the music’ to try and keep racists on his side. It’s horrifying,” he tweeted after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that left one counter-protester dead last August.

And during a visit to “The Daily Show” last June, Isbell opened up about the thought of having to explain Trump’s election win to his infant daughter.

“If she was a couple of years older I would have to be like, ‘OK, honey, here’s what happened today, and this is why your father doesn’t really know anything about human people in this country anymore,’” he told host Trevor Noah. “Because a couple of days ago, I thought I knew them: They’re not gonna let this guy in there, because they know he’s not a good guy.”

Voicing opinions on political and social issues hasn’t seemed to hurt Isbell’s career so far, even though he’s been warned otherwise.

“A lot of people told me when I started getting quote-unquote ‘political’ — as if I hadn’t always been that way — that I was going to alienate some of my audience. But it really just proved to me that there are so many more people out there who are similar to me than I used to believe,” Isbell told HuffPost on the red carpet at the Grammy Awards last month. “So, that was a nice life-affirming thing. Plus, it’s helped the career. People seem to appreciate it when you’re honest with them and when you don’t pander to them.”

Later that day, Isbell went on to win two Grammy Awards: best Americana album for “The Nashville Sound,” and best American roots song for “If We Were Vampires.”

While accepting the honors during the Grammy Awards’ non-televised segment, Isbell took the time to address gender equality ― an area where some have criticized the Grammys for falling short.

“If everyone was given an equal chance, I think the quality of the art would be better. I think the quality of our leadership would be better,” he told HuffPost ahead of his win. “I think the quality of our lives would be better if everybody got an equal chance to speak and be heard … I think all of us would be happier people if we listened to everyone’s ideas.”

“People don’t get treated the same way,” Isbell added. “It’s not just the music business.”

With that in mind, Isbell, who now has four Grammys to his name, is grateful for what he’s been able to achieve in his career thus far.

“There’s definitely a lot of luck involved,” Isbell told HuffPost. “I know a lot of people who make really great music and other kinds of art that don’t get what they deserve. That’s for sure. We ended up at the right place at the right time.”

During a sold-out show on Saturday at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, Isbell stood beside his band, The 400 Unit, looked around the room and thanked fans for their support.In 2008, Katy Perry rocketed onto the global pop music scene by telling the world she kissed a girl and she liked it.

A decade later, Perry says she’d change a few things about her breakout single, “I Kissed a Girl,” noting that the song perpetuates “a couple of stereotypes.”

In the above video for Glamour, the pop songstress checks out fan covers of her biggest hits, including “Firework,” “Unconditionally” and “The One That Got Away.” By the time she gets to an acoustic version of “I Kissed a Girl” by Ramona Rox, however, she offers a renewed take on the song’s message. (Her comments on “I Kissed a Girl” begin around 8:23.)

“I think we’ve really changed, conversationally, in the past 10 years. We’ve come a long way,” she notes. “Bisexuality wasn’t as talked about back then, or any type of fluidity.”

Though Perry had praise for Rox’s “nice vocal texture,” she says she “probably would make an edit” to the song if she were to write it today.

“Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much,” she said. “What’s true for you can evolve.”

In the 10 years since its release, “I Kissed a Girl” has sparked a fair amount of debate among music critics and LGBTQ activists over how to interpret its lyrics. (The fact that another one of Perry’s early singles, “Ur So Gay,” referenced sexuality and gender roles didn’t help.)A golden retriever’s craving for pancakes led to a house fire in Southwick, Massachusetts.

Surveillance video shows the dog walking over to a kitchen stove while its family is away. The animal can be seen getting on its hind legs and scarfing down what were reportedly leftover pancakes still on the stove.

In the process of getting its flapjack fix, the dog accidentally turns on one of the stove burners, causing flames to erupt and the house to fill with smoke.

Luckily for the dog and another golden retriever, the home was connected to a monitored alarm system that alerted responders before the fire could get worse.

The Southwick Fire Department showed up a short time later and put out the fire, saving the dogs and preventing serious damage to the residence.

The department posted the surveillance video on Facebook to remind people with pets or small children to put safety covers on their stoves.

“Jane the Virgin” star Jaime Camil is so not here for the way award shows continue to ignore Latino talent.

The Mexico-born actor, who portrays Rogelio de la Vega on The CW show, spoke to Slate magazine in an interview that was released Friday about Latino representation on television. Camil did not mince words, pointing to how award shows like the Screen Actors Guild Awards overlook Latino actors and actresses.

“I think this ‘minority,’ quote-unquote, is the economic engine of this country, basically,” Camil told Slate. “It’s ridiculous right now … Gina Rodriguez and everybody at the show, we were outraged about the fact that SAG-AFTRA and other award shows didn’t nominate one single Latino in their shows. It is not that we want to get an award for free, like, ‘Oh, the poor Latinos, throw them a little bone. Throw them a little award just for them not to feel ignored.’ No, no, no. Fuck you. It’s not about that.”

Camil pointed out that Rodriguez won a Golden Globe for her role on “Jane the Virgin” in 2015 but was not nominated by other award shows.

“Do you think [Gina] should not be nominated for a SAG-AFTRA award or for a Critics’ Choice or whatever? It’s ridiculous … I mean, ‘Modern Family,’ again, for the 12th year, same nominations? Really? Can’t we move on? Can we look to the other amazing shows that are being created, like ‘One Day at a Time’ with Justina Machado?”

The star also called out Hollywood and the Oscars for being righteous about inclusiveness and diversity while failing to recognize actors and actresses of color. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Oscar nominees failed to include any Latinos or Asians in all four acting categories this year.

Latino actors and actresses have been nominated just 16 times in 90 years of Oscar history, and only six have won. It’s been six years since a Latino actor has even been nominated for an Oscar.

Rodriguez, too, was a vocal critic of the absence of Latino actors and actresses among Oscar nominees.

The Proud Boys is a misogynistic far-right group with members who flirt with and often fully embrace white nationalism.

Vic Berger is a comedy video editor who works for Super Deluxe. He has published a few videos outing Gavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys and co-founder of Vice Media, as a racist oaf.

Then someone showed up outside his door.

The new thing in right-wing goonery, apparently, is house calls.

As Berger tells it, the encounter was brought on by several of his videos of McInnes, one of which is embedded below. In it, McInnes throws up a Nazi salute, says “nigger” over and over and plays with his butt:

The Proud Boys, labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, apparently took offense to the tweeted videos. Days after Berger posted the one above, the self-described “Western chauvinists” went nuclear.

On May 9, a tipster sent Berger an internal document from within the Proud Boys’ network, which called on all members to find Berger’s personal information and threaten him.

“Let’s get the social media profiles, phone numbers and addresses for their bosses, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, boyfriends, friends and get to work,” it reads. “LET’S SHOW THEM THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES!!!”

Less than two weeks later, a man rang the doorbell at Berger’s house in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, the email he’d brushed off as a joke became a very real threat.

“When I answered the door, he seemed nervous, like he wasn’t expecting me. It was the middle of the day, and my wife was home,” Berger told HuffPost. “He said, ‘Are you Vic? Your videos are hurting a lot of people. You’re really hurting the Proud Boys. You need to stop making these videos.’”

Berger, now terrified, turned back and screamed for his wife to call 911. He chased the man to his car and snapped a photo of the license plate:

I was recently made aware that Gavin McInnes sent this message to his followers, The Proud Boys. Today, a Proud Boy drove to my home, rang my doorbell and threatened me and my family. All because I posted edited videos Gavin didn't like. Got his plate # and filed a police report. pic.twitter.com/dsys9Wl6ry — Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) May 22, 2018

Berger reported the encounter to the police. An officer in the town, which Berger asked that we not reveal to protect his safety and privacy, confirmed that a report was filed.

An in-person visit from the Proud Boys was revelatory. Sure, they and other hate groups online have a predilection for threats and doxing ― publishing personal information online as a form of harassment ― but this was an escalation. They were willing to physically intimidate a Twitter user they found disagreeable.

“It was scary as hell,” he said. “I thought this was all just bullshit from the internet, they’ve always harassed me online. But now they’re sending thugs.”

Meanwhile, their dear leader, McInnes, has called on the Proud Boys and other conservatives to commit violence in the past ― and Berger has documented it:

Gavin McInnes calls on the Proud Boys to commit violence. To get to a "4th degree Proud Boy," one must fight for, or be arrested "for the Proud Boy cause." pic.twitter.com/EwOHfd0BsG — Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) May 22, 2018

The man who showed up on Berger’s doorstep appears to be Kenneth Lizardo, 54, a self-proclaimed Proud Boy who lives in Massachusetts. The license plate that Berger snapped in the photo, along with various public records, led us to Lizardo, whose Facebook page is decked out in Proud Boy regalia. Berger confirmed that the guy on the right in the photo below, Lizardo, is the man who showed up at his house:

The man on the right, Kenneth Lizardo, appears to be the person who showed up on the doorstep of Vic Berger. Facebook

Lizardo responded to requests for comment via phone calls and direct messages by blocking us on social media.

The Proud Boys have distanced themselves from the incident, with some accusing Berger of making the whole thing up. But internal communications between McInnes and his followers, sent to HuffPost by a source close to McInnes on the condition that we not quote the material, show McInnes alluding to the incident and saying he thought Berger deserved it.

Berger and his cohorts don’t think this is an isolated incident involving one disgruntled Proud Boy, either. The same day Berger got word that the Proud Boys were coming after him, his friend and fellow videographer, Nathan Bernard, got a similar threat from a man who can be seen in Facebook photos with Lizardo. On Twitter, Proud Boy Vincenzo Molino wanted Bernard to know that he had his address (redacted by HuffPost):

This is a classic intimidation tactic online. In this case, it’s intended to get Bernard and Berger to stop doing their jobs and to not call out racism and fascism when they see it. But both are worried that there’s no recourse for less prominent victims of the harassment mob.

“I happen to have a platform that allows me to make this public, but the Proud Boys are most likely targeting people who do not have a platform,” Berger said. “They should be contributing positively to society instead of targeting and threatening people at their houses and trying to silence free speech.”

Bernard likened the incident to “Pizzagate,” a conspiracy theory that started online and led to a man showing up at a Washington, D.C., restaurant and firing a gun. All you need is one person to take the online guff seriously for things to get scary.JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images

(Reuters) ― Facebook Inc has so far suspended around 200 apps in the first stage of its review into apps that had access to large quantities of user data, in a response to a scandal around political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

The apps were suspended pending a thorough investigation into whether they misused any data, said Ime Archibong, Facebook’s vice president of product partnerships.

Facebook said it has looked into thousands of apps as part of an investigation that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced on March 21.

Zuckerberg had said the social network will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before the company curtailed data access in 2014.

“There is a lot more work to be done to find all the apps that may have misused people’s Facebook data – and it will take time,” Archibong said. “We have large teams of internal and external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as possible.”

Facebook was hit by the privacy scandal in mid-March after media reports that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to build profiles on American voters and influence the 2016 presidential election.

The incident led to backlash from celebrities and resulted in the company losing billions in market value. Zuckerberg apologized for the mistakes his company made and testified before the U.S. lawmakers.

The company, however, regained much of its lost market value after it reported a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users when it announced quarterly results on April 25.

Shares of the company were up 0.4 percent at $187.65 in premarket trading on Monday.

The Japanese researcher behind a new study that links an ingredient found in McDonald’s French fries with a treatment for baldness admits eating the fries will have no effect whatsoever.

Professor Junji Fukuda of Japan’s Yokohama National University said his team was able to mass-prepare thousands of “hair follicle germs” in a form of silicone called dimethylpolysiloxane, Science Daily reports. The researchers were able to transplant the cultured follicles onto mice and see further hair growth.

Currently, most existing lab techniques create only about 50 “germs” at once, according to AFP.

This is a potential breakthrough, as the preparation of hair follicle germs on a large scale has previously been a big obstacle to hair regenerative medicine.

McDonald’s uses dimethylpolysiloxane as an anti-foaming agent in its frying oil for French fries, Chicken McNuggets and Filet O’ Fish sandwiches. The foodie blog GrubStreet notes that some outlets are pushing the notion that eating fries might cure baldness thanks to the connection.

Fukuda says the misinterpretation of the research baffles him.

“I have seen online comments asking, ‘How many fries would I have to eat to grow my hair?’” he told AFP. “I’d feel bad if people think eating something would do that!”Here’s the latest optical illusion taking reddit by storm: Two images, side-by-side, that show what appears to be the same street scene shot from slightly different angles.

It started when local farmer Bruce Grubb called the North East Police to report the presence of a large fearsome cat with stripes on his farm.

“I got the fright of my life,” Grubb told The Scottish Sun.

The creature appeared to be crouched on a ramp in Grubb’s barn.

Officers immediately dispatched several vehicles, including an armed response team to the farm. In addition, police contacted a nearby wildlife park to check if a tiger might have escaped, according to the BBC.

There was a 45-minute standoff before officers realized the tiger in question was just a giant stuffed toy, according to the New York Post.

Inspector George Cordinor told the BBC he was happy at how the responding officers handled the situation, and emphasized that Grubb wasn’t a prankster.

“Our ultimate aim is to protect the public and keep our officers safe when faced with uncertain situations. Until you know exactly what you are dealing with, every option has to be considered,” he said. “We appreciate that it was a false call made with genuine good intent.”

The North East Police had fun with the call on Facebook a few days later, saying “officers had a roaring shift on Saturday night.”

In addition, UK Cop Humour, a Facebook page geared toward British law enforcement, had lots of fun with the incident by posting pictures of people in tiger suits that it claimed could be “negotiators.”Director Quentin Tarantino may have some more explaining to do, a day after he expressed regret over a “Kill Bill” driving stunt that injured star Uma Thurman.

A 2003 radio interview with Howard Stern in which Tarantino downplayed Roman Polanski’s sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl went viral, placing the Oscar winning filmmaker in an uncomfortable spotlight.

“She wanted to have it,” the “The Hateful Eight” creator said of Polanski’s victim in the clip below.

“He didn’t rape a 13-year-old,” Tarantino told Stern. “It was statutory rape. That’s not quite the same thing. ... He had sex with a minor, all right. That’s not rape. To me, when you use the word rape, you’re talking about violent, throwing them down.”

Tarantino added: “Throwing the word ‘rape’ around is like throwing the word ‘racist’ around. It doesn’t apply to everything that people use it for.”

When radio co-host Robin Quivers said the girl didn’t want to have sex, Tarantino countered: “She wanted to have it.”

Quivers pointed out that the girl had been given drugs and alcohol, but Tarantino didn’t waver.

Polanski, director of “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Chinatown,” was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. He pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, but fled the country before sentencing.

Quivers noted that Polanski could have avoided trouble in the first place by staying away from the 13-year-old, who really didn’t have legal standing to say yes or no. “He likes girls,” Tarantino said.

Tarantino conceded that if the victim were his daughter in a similar situation, “I’d beat the hell out of him.” But the victim in the case of Polanski, he said, “was down to party with Roman.”

In an unrelated development Monday, Tarantino told Deadline that having Thurman drive in a “Kill Bill” stunt that resulted in a crash that injured her neck and knees was “the biggest regret of my life.”

In an earlier New York Times piece, Thurman discussed an alleged assault by Harvey Weinstein and the car incident.A Virginia man followed his dreams and it led him right to a six-figure lottery jackpot.

Victor Amole dreamed about the numbers 3-10-17-26-32 and when he woke, he used them in four identical Cash 5 tickets.

“I’ve never had a dream like that before,” the computer programmer told the Virginia Lottery.

The numbers hit, making all four tickets winners of the $100,000 top prize and earning him $400,000 for the Jan. 13 drawing.

Amole plans to invest his winnings.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans’ sweeping attacks on the nation’s premier law enforcement agency appear to be working: Nearly three-quarters of Trump voters ― 74 percent ― say the FBI is biased against the president, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.

Just under one-third of Trump voters say they have even a “fair amount” of trust in the FBI, while 64 percent say they don’t trust the FBI very much or at all.

The majority of Trump voters, 59 percent, strongly disapprove of the FBI’s handling of the Russia investigation, with an additional 20 percent somewhat disapproving of the job the bureau has been doing on the Russia probe.

Trump voters have also largely adopted Trump’s stance on the contents of a controversial Republican-authored memo, declassified by the president, that argues that the FBI and Justice Department acted improperly by getting permission from a court to surveil a former Trump campaign aide with longstanding ties to Russia. The memo makes the disputed claim that high-ranking FBI and Justice Department officials failed to disclose that information cited in their Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application came from a partisan source.

Partisans’ reactions to the memo largely mirror their pre-existing feelings about the bureau itself. Of those Trump voters who’ve heard about the memo, 79 percent think it shows that the FBI did something wrong, and more than 80 percent describe the memo’s contents as accurate.

By contrast, although Hillary Clinton’s voters believe the FBI had a negative impact on her electoral chances, most still say they trust the FBI ― and just 5 percent believe that the FBI is biased against Trump. And among those who’ve heard about the memo, just 16 percent think it’s even somewhat accurate, with only 4 percent believing it shows wrongdoing on the part of the agency.

The two groups are also getting their news about the memo from distinctly different places. A majority of both Clinton and Trump voters who’ve followed the story say that cable TV was among the sources they relied on. But while those Clinton voters tuned in largely to CNN and MSNBC, the Trump voters who watched cable coverage of the story were overwhelmingly likely to say they’d seen it on Fox News.

Fox covered the memo extensively; Sean Hannity, a Fox host, tweeted that the memo was “explosive” and revelatory of an “unprecedented Government abuse of power,” describing the conduct revealed in the memo as “Watergate times a thousand.” And Republican members of Congress lined up to make explosive claims about the memo’s contents ahead of its release.

Now that the memo has been released, just under 70 percent of Americans now say they’ve heard of it, up from less than 60 percent in a previous survey. (Non-voters have largely tuned out the controversy altogether ― just 18 percent say they’ve heard a lot about the memo, and those who’ve heard at least something are relatively split about its accuracy.)

Overall, that leaves 35 percent of Americans who’ve heard about the memo saying that it shows the FBI did something wrong, and another 34 percent that it vindicates the bureau, with the rest unsure.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the former Trump transition team member who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, was the driving force behind the memo. Referring to himself in the third person over the weekend, Trump said the Nunes memo “totally vindicates ‘Trump,’” and on Monday, he called Nunes a “Great American Hero.”

Republicans who appeared on the Sunday shows cautioned that the memo was a separate issue from the probe that special counsel Robert Mueller is running to examine possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election, but some Trump voters haven’t gotten the message. About one-third of Trump voters think that the president should fire Mueller, according to another recent HuffPost/YouGov survey.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 2-4 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.

Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.

The minute-long ad features a clip of King’s “Drum Major Instinct” sermon, which he delivered 50 years ago on Feb. 4, 1968. The audio plays over dramatic shots of athletes training, soldiers reuniting with families and kids learning in classrooms.

“If you want to be important, wonderful. If you want to be recognized, wonderful. If you want to be great, wonderful,” King’s voice says. “But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. That’s a new definition of greatness.”

Just after the words “a new definition of greatness,” a Ram truck comes coursing through mud and water in loving slo-mo, and it becomes clear what this video is actually about.

The ad ends with a still that reads, “Built to serve: Ram.”

People were, understandably, not very happy with the company’s attempt to profit off of one of history’s greatest social justice advocates.

“So that means the King children allowed Dr. King’s voice to be used to sell me a Dodge truck,” author Michael Arceneaux tweeted.

Bernice King, Martin Luther King’s youngest daughter, replied simply: “No.”

No. — Be A King (@BerniceKing) February 5, 2018

In a tweet posted shortly after the ad aired, The King Center clarified that they did not approve the use of King’s sermon for the Ram clip. The King Center is a resource and education center which was established by Coretta Scott King in memoriam of Martin Luther King.

“Neither @TheKingCenter nor @BerniceKing is the entity that approves the use of # MLK’s words or imagery for use in merchandise, entertainment (movies, music, artwork, etc) or advertisement, including tonight’s @Dodge # SuperBowl commercial,” the organization tweeted.

Viewers pointed to the irony of the NFL co-signing an ad that tries to monetize King’s activism while shutting out Colin Kaepernick and his protests of police brutality and systemic racism.

“Black people cant kneel and play football but MLK should be used to sell trucks during the super bowl,” writer and comedian Akilah Hughes tweeted. “Unbelievable.”

Actor John Cusack also expressed his disappointment, tweeting: “Mlk who died striking with workers decrying militarism & imperial war makers ― used to [sell] shiny trucks with marching soldiers ― corporate America nbc nfl should be ashamed.”

Chrysler, the parent company of Ram Trucks, defended its ad in a statement Sunday night, and said it was “honored to have the privilege of working with the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. to celebrate those words during the largest TV viewing event annually.” The automaker added: “Estate representatives were a very important part of the creative process every step of the way.”

Comic, actor and Philadelphia Eagles fan Kevin Hart dropped an accidental f-bomb on the NFL Network shortly after the team won the Super Bowl on Sunday night.

“I’m out,” Hart said after the word was broadcast live.

Network analyst and Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders jokingly ejected Hart from the set as everyone laughed ― and that was only one of the highlights of Hart’s night. Footage from the evening also showed Hart trying to get on the stage during the trophy presentation, only to be blocked by security:

Jackson, 26, had been traveling on Interstate 70 in an Uber about 4 a.m. when he suddenly felt “ill,” Indiana State Police said. His driver, Jeffrey Monroe, 54, pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, and both men stepped out, investigators said.

A pickup driven by Alex Cabrera Gonsales, 37, swerved onto the shoulder and plowed into both men, killing both, police said. Gonsales tried to flee the crash on foot, but didn’t get far before police captured him.

Police said they suspect Gonsales was intoxicated and was driving without a license.

Police released a photograph Sunday showing the car that Monroe and Jackson had been traveling in. Indiana State Police

The Colts shared the news of Jackson’s death on social media, saying the team would “miss him greatly.”

Several of Jackson’s current and former teammates also shared words of grief and shock on their personal Twitter pages.

It is with a heavy heart that we share the loss of one of our own.

Reid, 78, had surgery Monday to remove a tumor from his pancreas at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center. The former senator from Nevada, who served in Congress from 1983 to 2017, is slated for chemotherapy treatment following the surgery.

“His doctors caught the problem early during a routine screening and his surgeons are confident that the surgery was a success and the prognosis for his recovery is good,” the family statement read.

Reid’s family said he is in “good spirits” after the surgery and feels grateful to his team of doctors.

The news of Reid’s diagnosis and surgery was first reported by KLAS-TV reporter George Knapp on Twitter and confirmed by an unnamed source to The Nevada Independent.Justin Timberlake said his Super Bowl tribute to Prince grew out of his admiration for the late singer, who called Minneapolis home.

“I just felt like I wanted do something for this city and something for him that would just be the ultimate homage to what I consider the GOAT of musicians,” Timberlake told Jimmy Fallon on a live “Tonight Show” from Minneapolis after the game.

Fallon, after predictably gushing over his pal’s Super Bowl performance (see a HuffPost review here), eventually asked Timberlake to reveal details about the halftime show at U.S. Bank Stadium. The “Can’t Stop The Feeling” singer performed Prince’s “I Would Die 4 U,” while a projection of Prince was shown. Some people speculated in advance of Timberlake’s show that it would feature a hologram, which sparked controversy because Prince had objected to technology that created the appearance of someone performing with deceased artists. Prince died in 2016 from an opioid overdose.

OK the Prince projection was pretty cool. pic.twitter.com/zfpIuaHjMr — Doha Madani (@DohaMadani) February 5, 2018

As for the projection, Timberlake said he used the original recording of the song and footage from Prince’s film “Purple Rain.”

Fallon and Timberlake avoided discussion of past slights between Timberlake and Prince, perhaps in a bid to end on a positive note.

“He’s always been the pinnacle of musicianship for me,” Timberlake told Fallon.
