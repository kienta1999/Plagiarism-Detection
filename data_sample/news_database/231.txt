MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian curlers Alexander Krushelnitsky and Anastasia Bryzgalova will hand back the Olympic medals they won in Pyeongchang, the Russian news agency TASS reported, citing a Russian curling Federation spokeswoman.

Krushelnitsky, who won bronze in Pyeongchang with his wife Bryzgalova in mixed doubles curling, tested positive for meldonium, a drug that can aid endurance.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Wednesday it would hear a case against Krushelnitsky on Thursday.

TASS quoted Krushelnitsky saying he “formally broke the anti-doping rules” and a spokeswoman for the curling federation said the admission made it certain they would return the medals won.The U.S. women’s Olympic hockey team on Thursday eked out a victory over Canada after a tie score forced the game into a thrilling overtime.

The Canada team had been ahead 2-1 towards the end of the third period when American player Monique Lamoureux-Morando scored on a breakaway.

The game went into a 20-minute overtime, during which no players from either team scored thanks to quick reflexes from Canada goalie Shannon Szabados and U.S. goalie Maddie Rooney. Then, the five round shootout― a first for Olympic women’s hockey, according to the AP― also ended in a tie.

Finally, in the first extra round of shootouts, American Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored one over her Canadian rival, giving the team its the first Olympic gold since the women’s competition debuted in 1998. The Canadian team had won it every year since then.

ESPN’s T.J. Quinn called the competition “one of the greatest games I’ve ever seen, any sport.” You can watch some of the highlights here.

American media predictably had zero chill during the nail-biter game:

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Michelle Gisin won the women’s combined at the Pyeongchang Games on Thursday with American Mikaela Shiffrin taking silver while another Swiss Wendy Holdener won bronze.

Lindsey Vonn, who had led after the downhill section, was the last skiier to compete but did not finish her slalom run leaving the 24-year-old Gisin to take her first Olympic medal. The event was likely Vonn’s last Olympics run.

“It’s sad,” she said on Tuesday after placing third in the women’s alpine downhill final. “This is my last downhill. I wish I could keep going. I have so much fun. I love what I do. My body probably just can’t take another four years.”

Gisin’s victory, with a combined time of two minutes 20.90, nearly a second ahead of pre-race favorite Shiffrin, completed a rare Olympic double for her family.

Gisin’s elder sister Dominique won gold in the downhill in Sochi four years ago.

The result leaves Shiffrin with two medals from these Games after her gold in giant slalom.

Holdener produced the fastest slalom run of the day with 40.23 and held on to bronze with Norwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel struggling in the technical element and then Vonn skiing out early in her effort.Pennsylvania Republicans again asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block Pennsylvania’s new, court-ordered congressional map on Wednesday, marking the latest in a series of attempts to halt a plan that would make congressional elections more competitive in the state by reducing the impact of gerrymandering.

In an emergency application, Pennsylvania House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R) asked the Supreme Court to prevent the new map from going into effect. They say the state Supreme Court overstepped its authority by drawing a new congressional map.

The GOP challenge comes just two days after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a new congressional map for the state to be used in 2018 and 2020 elections. In January, the court said the congressional map in place since 2011, drawn by Republicans, so severely benefited the GOP that it violated the state’s constitution.

The court gave lawmakers three weeks to reach an agreement on a new map, and when the parties couldn’t do so, the court stepped in to draw its own. Several analyses showed the court’s map will make elections more competitive and give Democrats a better chance of winning seats in districts currently held by the Republicans.

In the emergency application, lawyers for Turzai and Scarnati wrote that the court did not give the lawmakers a “meaningful” chance to draw a new map. The timeline was so compressed, they say, that it “ensured that the

court would get to draw the map it wanted, instead of being crafted through the

legislative process.”

“At all stages, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court set this case on a path whereby only it would draw Pennsylvania’s new congressional districts—a task delegated to the “Legislature”—in violation of the Elections Clause,” they wrote.

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

Republicans signaled last week they would challenge the court’s map and have been dragging their feet over complying with court instructions.

Even though the court struck down the 2011 map based solely on the state constitution, Republicans maintain there are federal issues at stake. They say the U.S. Constitution only grants legislatures the ability to draw congressional districts and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court cannot step in to draw its own map.

Some legal observers are skeptical that argument will go anywhere in federal court. Republicans already used the same reasoning before the U.S. Supreme Court in January when asking the high court to step in and block the state court’s order for a new map.

Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who oversees applications from Pennsylvania, denied the request without even referring it to the full court. Court watchers say that was a clear signal the high court was likely to agree with the argument that the state court has the authority to draw its own congressional map. But Drew Crompton, a top aide to Scarnati, said Friday he believes the court might be willing to take another look now that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has actually issued a map.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs accused Turzai and Scarnati of wasting taxpayer money.

“At the risk of repeating ourselves, there was no good argument three weeks ago, and there is no good argument now for the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and undo a final judgment and remedy issued by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,” R. Stanton Jones, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, who helped represent the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Legislative leaders should stop wasting taxpayer funds and accept that Pennsylvania voters will finally get to cast ballots in free and fair congressional elections this year.”

Republicans have tried several maneuvers to try and put off implementing a new map for this year’s midterm elections. They argued that the new plan should be put off until 2020 because implementing a new map would cause confusion this year.

They also unsuccessfully moved to disqualify the vote of a Democratic justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because, as a candidate for the state’s high court, he said he was opposed to gerrymandering. Some Republicans have also called for the impeachment of the five Democrats on the state Supreme Court over their votes against the old congressional map.Pennsylvania Republicans took another stab at blocking a court-ordered congressional map on Thursday by filing a new lawsuit that asks a three-judge federal panel to step in.

The suit comes one day after GOP leaders in the state said they had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block the new map. In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the congressional map that had been in place since 2011, saying it gave Republicans such a considerable advantage over Democrats that it violated the state’s constitution.

The state Supreme Court gave lawmakers and the governor three weeks to agree on a map, and then stepped in to draw its own when the two parties failed to do so.

In their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and in their Thursday suit, Republicans said the state Supreme Court didn’t give them a meaningful chance to come up with a new map and that its decision to draw its own plan was unlawful. They argued only the U.S. Constitution grants legislatures the ability to draw congressional maps, and said they want the federal court to instruct the state to use the 2011 map for congressional elections this year.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that argument earlier this month, when it declined to step in and block the state Supreme Court’s order. Republicans are hoping the courts might be willing to take another look now that the map is in place.

Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said her agency was already working on implementing the court-ordered map and would continue to do so unless otherwise ordered by the courts.

Lawyers representing the 18 voters who got the 2011 map struck down say the officials have no case in federal court because the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map based solely on Pennsylvania’s constitution. In a statement Wednesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs accused Republicans of taking frivolous legal action and wasting taxpayer money.

The Republicans are suing Robert Torres, the acting secretary of the commonwealth, and Jonathan Marks, the commissioner for the bureau of commissions, elections and legislation. Lawyers for Torres and Marks have said they can run elections smoothly and on schedule with the new congressional map, but Republicans say it will cause chaos. Nominating petitions for congressional races are set to go out on Feb. 27, so the Republicans are asking the court to step in immediately.

“Our concerns stem from the attack on the constitution initiated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ― not the design of a map,” Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jacob Corman (R), one of the people who filed the suit on Thursday, said in a statement. “What is at stake here is larger than the makeup of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation.”

“We are unwilling to acquiesce to the court’s attempt to hijack the functions of the legislative and executive branches,” he added.

President Donald Trump also encouraged Republicans to challenge the new congressional map earlier this week.

Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018

The map the court drew is considerably more competitive than the 2011 plan the GOP is fighting for. Under that map, Republicans consistently won 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats ― despite winning around 50 percent of the vote.

Republicans have expressed little interest in getting a new congressional map in place. Senate Majority Leader Joseph Scarnati (R) told the state Supreme Court that he wouldn’t hand over data it had asked for because he believed the court’s decision was unlawful. Republicans also moved to disqualify the vote of a Democratic judge on the court because he expressed opposition to gerrymandering when he was a candidate running for office.A prominent liberal think tank just put out an ambitious new health care proposal.

That doesn’t sound like news, until you consider which think tank it is ― and exactly what it’s proposing.

The think tank is the Center for American Progress, which is based in Washington and has close ties to the Democratic Party establishment. The proposal, which its authors call “Medicare Extra for All,” would create a new public program, based on Medicare, that would be open to anybody.

The proposal, which Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar of The Associated Press first reported Wednesday evening, also calls for automatically enrolling the uninsured, among others, in this new program ― in the hopes of finally achieving universal coverage.

Some will call this plan a single-payer proposal, because it’s easy to imagine, someday, everybody being part of this new version of Medicare. Some will say it’s not a single-payer proposal, because it envisions a permanent, potentially large role for private insurance ― as a provider of highly regulated plans that would function more or less the way private plans for seniors on Medicare operate today.

But whatever the proposal’s label, it’s plainly a more ambitious ― and more progressive ― health plan than the Democratic Party’s most influential thinkers have embraced in the past. And that’s what makes it noteworthy.

It’s a reflection of how far the party’s internal conversation has shifted in the direction of government-run insurance ― even since the 2016 presidential campaign, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a pure single-payer system the cornerstone of his Democratic primary run. It’s also a leading indicator of how Democrats plan to approach health care as they start thinking about the 2020 presidential campaign.

The shift is real ― and an outgrowth of changing circumstances in politics and policy. For most of the last few years, and especially in 2017, Democrats were preoccupied with trying to defend the Affordable Care Act from repeal at the hands of the Republicans.

The architects of the 2010 health care law, including President Barack Obama, understood that it didn’t go far enough ― that it didn’t cover enough people and that it didn’t offer sufficiently good coverage to enough people.

They had hoped to revisit and improve the law, but never had the chance. Instead, they’ve ceded power to President Donald Trump and the Republicans, who, unable to wipe Obamacare off the books, have tried to undermine it instead. Amid that environment, many of the program’s problems have lingered ― and some have gotten worse.

But with the threat of full repeal receding, at least for the moment, Democrats are starting to think about what comes next. And increasingly they are thinking about public insurance as a supplement or substitute for private insurance.

Discussions are underway among wonks and scholars, including a group that the Century Foundation and American Prospect magazine convened last month for a day of intense policy discussion in Washington.

Discussions are also taking place in Congress, where some Democrats have proposed opening up Medicaid to more people, others are talking about doing the same for Medicare and a third of the Democratic caucus endorsed the latest proposal from Sanders ― which would actually eliminate private insurance altogether and give everybody a more generous version of Medicare.

Now comes the Center for American Progress, known for reflecting and shaping the Democratic Party’s consensus, with a proposal that would be among the more ambitious ideas out there ― while still less sweeping than what Sanders has in mind.

CAP’s plan envisions a public insurance program that looks vaguely like Medicare but with a more generous benefit structure. (Medicare doesn’t have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses, for example.) The new program would eventually absorb, through some kind of automatic enrollment, all Americans who have no insurance, are in Medicaid or buy private coverage on their own through HealthCare.gov or directly from insurers.

Employers could continue to offer coverage and, because of the plan’s structure, it’s likely most would ― at least for the short- to medium-term future. But employers would have the option to buy coverage from the new Medicare plan and, critically, individual employees could opt into the new plan even if their employers were offering coverage.

In these respects, CAP’s proposal bears more than a small resemblance to some other plans in circulation ― including one that Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Economic Policy Institute first sketched out in 2007, as well as a scheme that writer Jon Walker put forward in the pages of Shadowproof just a year ago.

“There is a broad consensus within the broad progressive debate that health care is a right and that everybody should have health care,” Neera Tanden, president of CAP, told HuffPost. “And we recognize the virtue of a strong public plan available to all the people.”

The center’s plan has other provisions ― including a call to limit payments to the providers and producers of health care ― that would ultimately raise some of the same questions Sanders plan did during the campaign.

Cutting those payments too dramatically can cause major disruptions in the health care industry, but without those dramatic cuts, any plan can quickly become too expensive.

CAP’s idea does not envision everybody with private insurance giving up their current coverage, as Sanders has proposed, but at least some people would end up losing their existing coverage. If the experience with the Affordable Care Act proved anything, that transformation is frequently a traumatic experience ― for the people who go through it and for the political system as well.

The center’s plan is still just a vague framework, which means it leaves lots of unanswered questions ― starting with the exact financing mechanism. And to conservatives, of course, it would be exactly the wrong way to approach health care ― increasing spending, regulation and taxes, rather than decreasing all three.Emotions ran as high for fans as for members of the U.S. women’s hockey team during their nail-biting Winter Olympics victory over Canada.

USA Hockey Women GOLD! ITS GOLD! — John-Henry Krueger (@Real_JohnHenry) February 22, 2018WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed a new set of criminal charges on Thursday against President Donald Trump’s former campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates that include bank and tax fraud, escalating a legal battle that started last year.

The charges were contained in a 32-count indictment against the two men that was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria.

Manafort and Gates are already facing criminal charges by Mueller’s office in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud the United States and failure to register as foreign agents for political work they did for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party.

They were among the first to be charged, as part of Mueller’s ongoing investigation into whether the Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Trump has denied any collusion took place.

The latest indictment includes allegations of wrongdoing as recently as January 2017 and said Manafort and Gates were desperate for cash when their lobbying business dried up.

The indictment charged they were able to secure more than $20 million in loans by falsely inflating the income of Manafort and his lobbying firm and failing to disclose existing debt.Thandie Newton’s red carpet dress at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday paid homage to black actors who appeared in “Star Wars” before her.

Watch the trailer for “Solo” A Star Wars Story” below:National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday to defend his organization one week after a gunman used an assault-style rifle to kill 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

LaPierre’s message, in short: A lot of things are to blame for school shootings, but guns aren’t among them.

“Their solution is to make you ― all of you ― less free,” he said, in reference to gun control proposals from what he called “elites” in the U.S.

“They want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security, the failure of the family, the failure of America’s school systems and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI,” LaPierre added.

The speech did not appear on the conference’s official schedule as a precaution in the aftermath of last week’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the Washington Examiner reports. But the NRA chief always intended to speak at CPAC ― as he has for each of the last 10 years.

LaPierre attacked imaginary evils rather than defend his group’s hard-line policies, at one point accusing Democrats of wanting to “eradicate all individual freedoms.”

“The elites don’t care not one whit about America’s school system and school children.” - Wayne LaPierre

LaPierre also made a populist appeal by painting people who want common-sense gun control as either out-of-touch elites or socialists. (LaPierre’s base salary exceeds $1 million. He made more than $5 million in 2015, once his bonus was taken into account, according to tax documents cited by the Washington Post.)

“The elites don’t care not one whit about America’s school system and school children,” he said. “If they truly cared, what they would do is they would protect them. For them it’s not a safety issue, it’s a political issue. They care more about control and more of it, their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment and our firearms freedoms so that they can eradicate all individual freedoms.”

He specifically called out a “tidal wave of new European socialist” leaders of the Democratic Party. The crowd booed as he listed off several names, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Christopher Murphy (D-Conn) and Rep.

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - David Wise of the United States retained his ski halfpipe Olympic gold medal after a scintillating final run on Thursday.

After two mediocre efforts, Wise got it right at the third time of asking, scoring 97.20 in the final round to push compatriot Alex Ferreira (96.40) into second place.Two skiers suffered terrifying crashes during the final run of the men’s ski halfpipe event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Thursday.

Kevin Rolland of France, who won bronze in the same event in Sochi, Russia, in 2014, hit the top of the lip of the halfpipe, causing his legs to split wide as he fell backward to the bottom.

Paramedics rushed to the center of the halfpipe to take Rolland off the course on a stretcher, but the athlete got up and skied down the rest of the pipe on his own.

According to The Guardian’s live blog, Rolland was “making a frightening moaning noise in the middle of the pipe that we can only hope is simply out of frustration and not pain.”

“There have been broken ribs, moves from house to house in Aspen, Colorado, time the family spent on food stamps, all in the name of advancing a career that Yater-Wallace hoped might end up at the Winter X Games or the Olympics,” AP’s Pat Graham wrote.

“I hear you,” was number five on the cheat sheet that Trump clutched in his hands:

It’s unclear whether Trump or one of his White House aides wrote the list. But the image did not go unnoticed on Twitter, where folks were quick to criticize the president for needing the reminder at all:A panel of students and teachers who survived the shooting at a Florida high school last week, along with many parents of victims, voiced their frustrations and anger, along with their hopes for gun law reforms, during a town hall hosted by CNN on Wednesday night.

More than 7,000 people gathered at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida, to listen to many of those affected by the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, which left 17 people dead. The tragedy, the 17th school shooting so far in 2018, has prompted a wave of activism in recent days and an outpouring of anger directed at lawmakers who have refused to pass gun control legislation.

Such frustrations were on full display Wednesday as several people asked Florida Sens. Marco Rubio (R) and Bill Nelson (D) what they plan to do now. Ryan Deitsch, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, asked Rubio about Congress’ failure to rein in gun access and why its the students themselves who “have to march on Washington just to save innocent lives.”

“You’re right,” the senator replied. “What you’ve lived through, and what you live through, is not supposed to be a part of your high school experience.”

In a heated exchange, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter, Jamie, was killed last week, demanded Rubio tell him that he would “work with us to do something about guns.”

“Sen. Rubio, my daughter, running down the hallway at Marjory Douglas, was shot with an assault weapon, the weapon of choice,” Guttenberg said. “It is too easy to get. It is a weapon of war. The fact that you can stand here and can’t say that, I’m sorry.”

Ashley Kurth, a teacher who sheltered nearly 70 students during the attack, addressed President Donald Trump’s suggestion earlier that day that educators in schools be armed to help prevent more shooting deaths.

A teacher who sheltered dozens of terrified students during the Florida high school shooting asked why some think it's a good idea that she be armed.



Sen. Marco Rubio responded, "First, I don't support that." https://t.co/DzYzyoXhiF #StudentsStandUp pic.twitter.com/2scIZd7AMz — CNN (@CNN) February 22, 2018

“When I had those hundreds of terrified children that were running at me, my question to that is, am I supposed to get extra training now to serve and protect on top of educate these children?” Kurth asked. “I mean, am I supposed to have a Kevlar vest? Am I supposed to strap it to my leg or put it in my desk? How am I supposed to go on that way?”

Rubio broke with the president and said he didn’t believe teachers should be armed, saying, “Teachers that are armed with a weapon is not something that, quite frankly, I’m comfortable with.”

Another teacher at the school, Diane Wolk-Rogers, defended the actions of the outspoken survivors of the massacre, some of whom have already become subject to derision from conservative commentators.

“Our kids have started a revolution. I’m proud and I’m inspired to be a part of never again,” she said.

“Our kids have started a revolution. I’m proud and I’m inspired to be a part of never again.” - Stoneman Douglas High teacher Diane Wolk-Rogers

The latter half of the town hall grew increasingly tense as students began asking questions of National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch. In response to a question about efforts to make semiautomatic weapons harder to obtain, Loesch said the NRA was against such legislation and said she was standing up for Americans.

But Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, whose police force responded to the Feb. 14 shooting, lambasted the NRA’s role in quashing common-sense gun control legislation.

“You just told this group of people that you are standing up for them,” Israel said, prompting a wave of applause. “You’re not standing up for them until you say, ‘I want less weapons.’”

He continued: “We do need to have some gun control and reform. ... Anybody who says different, I don’t know about other people, but Emma [Gonzalez, a student survivor] and I ― we’re calling BS on that.”

Loesch later noted that the suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, should not have been able to obtain a firearm, even though the gun used in the massacre was purchased legally.

“People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” Loesch said. “People who are dangerous to themselves and other individuals should not be able to obtain a firearm.”

The NRA’s influence came up earlier in the evening after high school student Cameron Kasky directly asked Rubio if he’d continue taking campaign donations from the group after the shooting.

“Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?” Kasky asked, before the senator effectively said still he’d accept future contributions from the group.

“People buy into my agenda ― and I do support the Second Amendment,” Rubio replied.

As survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting capture the nation’s attention with their persistent and powerful calls for sensible gun laws, former first lady Michelle Obama has expressed “total awe” and support for the young activists.

In a tweet Wednesday night about the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman killed 17 people last week, Obama wrote that she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, would be “behind you every step of the way.”

I’m in total awe of the extraordinary students in Florida. Like every movement for progress in our history, gun reform will take unyielding courage and endurance. But @barackobama and I believe in you, we’re proud of you, and we’re behind you every step of the way. — Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) February 22, 2018

Her tweet comes about a week after the former president expressed grief over the shooting massacre and called for “long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want.”

We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 15, 2018

The young survivors of the Parkland shooting have led the calls for tighter gun control regulations since the attack on their school. Students have appeared on national television to urge lawmakers to act; they’ve organized and inspired rallies in Florida, Washington, D.C., and across the nation; they’ve taken on trolls on social media and have stood firm amid a torrent of conspiracy theories aimed at undermining their activism.

As students gathered at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) announced that America’s high school students were “leading a revolution.”An audience of about 7,000 people booed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) multiple times at a CNN town hall on school shootings Wednesday when he refused to say he would stop accepting donations from the National Rifle Association.

High school junior Cameron Kasky, who survived the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High last week in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people died, asked Rubio, “Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?”

Rubio replied that he would continue to take the NRA’s money because “people buy into my agenda ― and I do support the Second Amendment.”

Kasky continued, “So, right now, in the name of 17 people, you cannot ask the NRA to keep their money out of your campaign?”

“There is money on both sides of every issue in America,” Rubio replied, “and where that leaves us in policymaking is to look at the issues and make a decision based on what we think is right.”

Rubio has accepted $3,303,355 in donations so far from the NRA in his political career.

The simple questions were the most devastating during the sometimes heated town hall, called “Stand Up: The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action” “Why do we have to march on Washington just to save innocent lives?” student Ryan Deitsch asked Rubio.

Rubio replied that there would be changes as a result of Deitsch and his classmates’ advocacy.

Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in last week’s shooting, also confronted Rubio. “Look at me and tell me: Guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids in this school this week. And look at me and tell me you accept it and you will work with us to do something about guns,” he said.

Dissatisfied with Rubio’s response, Guttenberg then called the senator and President Donald Trump “pathetically weak.”

Kasky told Rubio it was hard to look at him “without looking down the barrel of an AR-15,” referring to the weapon authorities believe the gunman used in the massacre at Kasky’s school.

He then asked Rubio if he could tell a classmate sitting in the audience if he would live long enough to be able to enlist in the Army.Justin Sullivan via Getty Images

WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The head of a federal agency who has helped U.S. states protect election systems from possible cyber attacks by Russia or others is being removed from his post by Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and the White House.

Matthew Masterson, currently chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and a former Ohio state official, has been passed over for a second four-year term as one of the agency’s four commissioners, according to sources familiar with the matter.

It is up the House speaker to recommend a nominee for the commissioner post that Masterson currently holds, with the president then making a formal nomination.

Masterson has been a popular figure among state election officials, many of whom have praised his expertise and leadership on cyber security issues and expressed chagrin at his pending departure. The agency was created by Congress in 2002 to assist states in complying with federalelection standards.

The action raises fresh questions over the degree to which Republican President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress are taking steps to protect the security of American elections, and some state officials have accused them of doing too little to address the threat.

U.S. voters in November will go to the polls in midterm elections, which American intelligence officials have warned could be targeted by Russia or others seeking to disrupt the process.

There is intense scrutiny of the security of U.S. election systems after a 2016 presidential race in which Russia interfered, according to American intelligence agencies, to try to help Trump win with presidency. Trump in the past has been publicly skeptical about Russian election meddling.

The reason for passing over Masterson and whether the decision originated with Ryan or the White House remained unclear. Some Republicans over the years have sought to eliminate or reduce the agency, arguing that it represents a federal overreach into the role of states in runningelections.

Masterson originally was picked by former Speaker John Boehner, a Republican and fellow Ohioan, and nominated by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, before being confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 2014.

House speakers have discretion to make recommendations for certain federal positions, a Ryan spokeswoman said. She declined to say whether a replacement had been selected for Masterson or whether cyber security would be a priority in filling the post, referring further questions to the White House.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment. Masterson also declined to comment.

Masterson, who already was due to give up his rotating chairmanship this month, is expected to remain a commissioner until his replacement is chosen by Ryan, formally nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.

‘PRETTY REMARKABLE’

Masterson has spent the last year as the commission’s chairman, focusing largely on election cyber security, state election officials said. Twenty-one states experienced probing of their systems by Russian hackers during the 2016 election, according to U.S. officials.

Though a small number of networks were compromised, voting machines were not directly affected and there remains no evidence any vote was altered, according to U.S. officials and securityexperts.

“It is pretty remarkable that in this environment, given the importance of this issue, that the speaker would choose this moment to not reappoint the person doing the most work in this area,” said Judd Choate, Colorado’s election director and the immediate past president of the National Association of State Election Directors.

The commission was formed in the aftermath of the 2000 U.S. presidential election won by Republican George W. Bush that came down to disputed paper ballots cast in Florida. Its responsibilities include maintaining voluntary guidelines for voting systems, including cyber security standards, that most states use when purchasing new voting equipment.

Since the 2016 election, almost all 50 states have taken steps to purchase more secure equipment, expand the use of paper ballots, improve cyber training or seek federal assistance, according to groups that track election security.

U.S. intelligence officials have described the targeting of state election systems as part of a wide-ranging effort by Moscow that also included propaganda efforts and hacking to sow discord during the 2016 campaign, boost Trump and disparage his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office last Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their alleged involvement in a criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper with the 2016 election.

Under law, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House each recommend one commissioner to be nominated by the president to fill the agency’s four spots. The Republican-led House Administration Committee last year passed a measure that would terminate the agency on the grounds that it has outlived its usefulness.“What do you have against teenagers?” the “Late Show” host cracked Wednesday. “First you won’t do anything about guns, now you’re taking away their porn.”Snowboarder Chloe Kim and her pup are coming to a newsstand near you.

A reason for the payment to Cohen was not specified in the federally required financial disclosure that the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) released, The New York Times reported.

The disclosure notes that though Cohen made the payment in 2016, Trump didn’t fully reimburse him for it until 2017.

Cohen has admitted to having paid $130,000 in 2016 to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, who has gone public about a 2006 affair that she claims to have had with Trump. The Wall Street Journal broke the news of the payment in January.

Details over that alleged affair and payments to Clifford have been far from clear.

Trump’s attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, earlier this month told Fox News that Trump reimbursed Cohen $130,000 for the payment to Clifford before the 2016 presidential election. Giuliani’s statement contradicted Trump earlier having said that he had no knowledge about any payment made to Clifford through Cohen.

Trump, one day after Giuliani’s statements, then acknowledged the payment to Cohen but said that it involved a nondisclosure agreement that was meant to “stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair ... despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair.”

Trump’s financial disclosure on Wednesday, which only covers the 2017 calendar year, immediately raised concern among government watchdog groups over its timing.

David J. Apol, the acting director of the OGE, sent a letter to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Wednesday. In the letter, he noted that Trump’s payment to Cohen “should have been reported as a liability on his public financial disclosure report” for the 2016 calendar year, which the president signed in June 2017.

The letter cites a previously requested investigation by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) into whether “the failure to report it was knowing and willful.”

“OGE has determined that the information provided in that note meets the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability under the Ethics in Government Act,” Apol stated.

In a statement responding to Trump’s financial disclosure, Noah Bookbinder, CREW’s executive director, questioned how many other “similar payments” Trump has not disclosed.

“It is good that in the face of overwhelming evidence and public pressure, the president came clean about this liability on this year’s form, but we now have to wonder how many other liabilities for similar payments he has that he still has not disclosed because he has not been publicly called out on them,” Bookbinder said.

The exact figure specified in the financial disclosure is said to be between $100,000 and $250,000.Jimmy Kimmel has absolutely no time for people who peddle conspiracy theories, including Donald Trump Jr.

On Wednesday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” the late-night host tore into people who claim that the survivors of last week’s deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, were really “crisis actors” trying to advance a left-wing agenda. And he took particular aim at President Donald Trump’s eldest son, who liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory about the shooting.

“This is our president’s son doing that,” said Kimmel. “Liking a story that directly defames a student that survived a shooting.”

Kimmel then issued a message to anyone who thinks the teenagers who spoke out in the aftermath of the massacre were actors and “part of some kind of deep state, left-wing conspiracy.”

“I have some bad news for you. You are crazy. You are a crazy person. Your brain is not functioning, and I’m worried about you.”During a heated CNN-hosted town hall event on Wednesday night, National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch told survivors of the Parkland, Florida school shooting that she was “fighting” for them. But Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel was quick to shut her down.

Interrupting Loesch’s response to a question about assault weapons, Israel stressed that she was “not standing up” for survivors of gun violence.

“I understand that you’re standing up for the NRA … but you just told this group of people that you’re standing up for them,” he said. “You are not standing up for them until you say, ‘I want less weapons.’”

The sheriff’s words were met with cheers and a standing ovation.

Loesch was roundly lambasted at the town hall and on social media for various comments she made about gun control, many of which were misleading.

She repeatedly said that 19-year-old school shooter Nikolas Cruz, who legally purchased an AR-15-style assault rifle and other weapons, should not have been able to buy the firearm because he was an “insane monster” and “nuts.”

“People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” Loesch said, echoing a common misconception that mental health issues are a primary cause of gun violence. Her remark also ignores the fact that the NRA has also vocally advocated against gun bans on people with mental illness.

Netizens took to Twitter to challenge her remarks.

Loesch was also roundly criticized on social media for suggesting that “fully-automatic firearms” existed during the time of the founding fathers.

Responding to a comment made by a grieving mother that the Second Amendment was written during a time of “muskets” and not the weapons of today, Loesch responded that “at the time there were fully-automatic firearms that were available, the Belton gun and the Puckle gun.”

Twitter did not hold back their ridicule.

For the British overseas territory of 60,000 people - known for low taxes and stunning pink-sand beaches - this month became the first jurisdiction in the world to reverse a law allowing same-sex marriage.

It was cause for celebration for many church leaders and thousands of Bermudians who gathered outside parliament on the usually sleepy island last year to protest the gay marriage law.

Yet the reversal sparked fears for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights activists that it may reverberate far beyond Bermuda and set a dangerous precedent for a gay rights rollback after years of gains across the Western world.

“This could open the door to undo marriage equality elsewhere,” said Jordan Sousa, founder of Bermuda’s Gay Straight Alliance, one of several local advocacy groups for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, with 1,200-odd members.

Same-sex marriage has become legal in 26 nations since the Netherlands led the way in 2001. Austria and Taiwan are set to join this list following court rulings on the matter in 2017.

So it came as a surprise to many when Bermuda reversed its decision and introduced a new Domestic Partnership Act that let islanders form domestic partnerships but not marry. The government said gay couples who had wed would keep their status.

Only a dozen or so same-sex weddings have taken place in Bermuda or on cruise ships registered in the territory in the nine months since it became legal. It was unclear how many have gay marriages been canceled as a result of the new legislation.

FEELING VULNERABLE

Gibbons and his Canadian husband said they were among those who now felt vulnerable. They plan to move to Canada this year.

“One of the reasons we are leaving is the complete ambiguity of how the rights of same-sex couples will be guaranteed,” Gibbons, 64, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“There is just a feeling that people are against you,” said Gibbons, who won a Supreme Court ruling in 2015 granting same-sex couples the same rights to live and work on Bermuda as heterosexual partners.

Bermudian lawyer Mark Pettingill, who won last year’s marriage equality case in the Supreme Court, has filed a motion to challenge the new domestic partnership law.

Some in the island’s LGBT community are lobbying Britain to intervene, although that appears unlikely to succeed given that Bermuda’s governor approved the law this month.

“This is like saying to Rosa Parks you can sit wherever you like on the bus, and then you tell her she cannot sit in the front two rows,” said Pettingill, a former attorney general of Bermuda, referring to the United States’ civil rights heroine.

Some rights campaigners have decried the influence of church over state in Bermuda where two in three people are Christian.

When René Hill - a Bermudian designer - gave a eulogy for her cousin in 2012, she thought it right to mention his life as an openly gay man but said she was interrupted by the pastor who appealed to the congregation to pray for the dead man’s sins.

Linda Mienzer, a lesbian station duty officer in the police service, said she faced opposition from her family and the church because of her sexuality, and had been called a “demon” by a bishop for wearing a bow tie while attending a service.

“The power of the church has made politicians in Bermuda prostitute themselves for votes at the expense of justice and human rights,” said Tony Brannon, an independent activist for the gay community.

The ruling center-left Progressive Labour Party (PLP), which includes some gay politicians, said its position on same-sex marriage strikes the right balance on the “divisive” issue.

“The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda,” Home Affairs Minister and PLP member Walton Brown, who proposed the new law, said in a statement earlier this month after it was approved.

It restates that marriage must be between a man and a woman while recognizing and protecting the rights of same-sex couples, added Brown, who declined to comment any further on the matter.

He said LGBT tourists were still welcome to visit Bermuda.

But cancellations have been announced by several tourists in letters to the editor of the local newspaper, while visitors and LGBT activists have demanded a tourism boycott on social media.

“Individual travelers can vote with their feet,” said Kevin Dallas, head of the independent Bermuda Tourism Authority.Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim teamed up with Jimmy Fallon to freak out unsuspecting fans on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show.”
