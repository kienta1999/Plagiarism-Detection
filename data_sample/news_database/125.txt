French Jewish groups are demanding protests and action after reports that an elderly Jewish woman was murdered in an alleged anti-Semitic attack in Paris.

Jewish leaders are calling for French politicians and citizens to reaffirm their commitment to fighting anti-Semitism after the killing of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor, last Friday. Some are calling on allies to participate in a silent march on Wednesday in Paris in memory of the grandmother and other recent French victims of anti-Semitism.

“We need more people to feel moved, concerned, and therefore take an active part in this fight,” Simone Rodan-Benzaquen, director of the advocacy group American Jewish Committee (AJC) in Europe, wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost France. “When anti-Semitic violence grows, democracy is at stake.”

Knoll was reportedly stabbed 11 times during the attack inside her Paris apartment on Friday. Her body was partly burned after the attackers tried to set her home on fire, The New York Times reported.

Two men have been arrested in connection to the killing and face preliminary charges of murder with anti-Semitic motives, according to The Associated Press.

The woman’s son, Daniel Knoll, said that his mother had known one of the suspects for a long time and often invited him into her home against the advice of her children.

“My mother had a thirst for knowledge and meeting new people and talking to them and that’s what killed her,” he told the AP.

Some Jewish leaders reflected on the tragic irony of Knoll’s death, which came decades after the woman fled the Holocaust. In 1942, a then-9-year-old Knoll narrowly escaped being deported to a Nazi concentration camp with thousands of other Parisian Jews. Knoll was able to escape the mass arrest, which became known as the Vel d’Hiv roundup, with the help of a family member with Brazilian citizenship, the AP reported. The family fled to Portugal. Knoll returned to her home country after the end of World War II.

Nearly all those who were arrested during the roundup ― more than 13,000 people ― were murdered at Auschwitz.

Francis Kalifat, head of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), an umbrella group for French Jewish organizations, said Knoll was “absolutely massacred.”

“This makes one feel something absolutely terrible,” Kalifat told The New York Times. “She escaped the anti-Semitism of the Nazis, but in the end her destiny followed her because she was killed because of anti-Semitism.”

“The horror of crime and the violence of the murderers are identical and remind us of the negative side of humanity,” Korsia wrote in a tweet.

France’s Jewish communities have grown increasingly concerned about safety in recent years. In 2015, four people were killed during an attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris. Nearly 8,000 French Jews reportedly moved to Israel in the year after this attack.

In 2012, three children and a teacher were murdered outside a Jewish school in Toulouse.

Anti-Semitic violence in France increased by 26 percent in 2017, while criminal damage to Jewish synagogues and cemeteries increased by 22 percent, according to a national study.

This January, a kosher grocery store near Paris was damaged in a suspected arson attack. Weeks later, an 8-year-old boy wearing a Jewish kippa was beaten up in a northern Paris suburb.

Marc Knobel, a historian at CRIF, told The Local France that the deaths of Halimi and Knoll have contributed to a “great feeling of fear and insecurity” in Jewish communities.

“People are extremely shocked and very worried,” he said.

Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo called on Parisians to join Wednesday’s silent march in honor of Knoll. A wide array of French politicians have promised to attend, the AP reported.

In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was appalled by Knoll’s murder and expressed his “absolute determination to fight against anti-Semitism.”

Rodan-Benzaquen, director of AJC Europe, said that while these declarations for politicians help French Jews “feel less lonely,” more needs to be done by French citizens and society at large. She called on all Parisians to march on Wednesday for “our assassinated grandmother.”North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in secret with China’s Xi Jinping this week in Kim’s first trip abroad since assuming power, Chinese state news reported Wednesday.

The news confirms widespread rumors that Kim had unexpectedly traveled to China via an armored train on Monday in his first foreign trip as leader of the North. The 21-car behemoth chugged into Beijing’s central train station, where a military honor guard and a large motorcade of diplomatic vehicles reportedly met it. But senior officials in the U.S., South Korea and China declined to comment on exactly who was thought to be in the carriages.

The news of Kim’s visit was only officially confirmed after the same train left Beijing. Yang Jiech, a leading Chinese diplomat, will brief South Korean officials on Thursday about the meeting, South Korea’s government said.

President Donald Trump said he heard from Xi on Tuesday night.

“His meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!

China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency said Kim made the unofficial visit at Xi’s request, just weeks before the North Korean leader is expected to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and his senior advisers.

The meeting is a new development in the diplomatic saga on the Korean peninsula. Kim met with envoys from South Korea earlier this month, who later said the North Korean government was open to holding talks with the United States.

Chinese media reported that Kim expressed a similar willingness for dialogue during his meeting with Xi.

“The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if south Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace,” Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying in Xinhua News. The outlet also said Kim hoped to “develop friendship” with China following the meeting.

It’s unclear where a summit between Kim and Trump would take place. Until this week, Kim had never crossed North Korean borders. A sitting U.S. president has never traveled to the country.

[HuffPost]More than 2,500 people hit the streets of Starkville, Mississippi, on Saturday for the pride parade that almost wasn’t.

Starkville had been thrust into the national spotlight last month, when the Starkville Board of Aldermen denied a permit to the local LGBTQ advocacy group, Starkville Pride, to host the town’s first-ever pride parade.

Starkville Pride officials then filed a lawsuit against the city after the board’s decision, saying town officials had discriminated against LGBTQ residents and violated free speech rights.

The board of aldermen reversed its decision on March 6, with the town’s mayor, Lynn Spruill ― who had already been in favor of the parade ― casting the deciding vote, allowing plans for the festivities to move ahead.

Saturday’s event was reportedly the largest parade ever in the town, which boasts a population of 25,000 ― possibly a result of the massive amount of attention the initial denial generated, the mayor said.

“I’m so proud of Starkville,” said Spruill. “I saw nothing but good things. When you look ahead of you, all you can see is people marching. And then you look behind you and all you can see is people marching. It’s absolutely wonderful. I haven’t been in something quite so happy and fun and pleasant in a long time.”

For the record this is the largest parade Starkville has ever seen. Here are some pictures to prove that. #StarkvillePride #LGBT pic.twitter.com/XxskZQhNBy — Logan Kirkland (@CaptainKirk_) March 24, 2018

There were some dissenting voices. About a dozen or so members of the Consuming Fire Fellowship, located in Gloster, Mississippi, and known to protest LGBTQ events, reportedly appeared, but the day’s events went smoothly.

One of the event’s co-organizers, Bailey McDaniel, called the turnout “amazing.”

“I’m just so proud,” McDaniel, who is a student at Mississippi State University, told The Dispatch. “I think today set the precedent for all the Pride parades that will come over the years.”A Nevada lawmaker says Capitol Hill is buzzing with a rumor that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will soon resign and be replaced by Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).

But Ryan’s team quickly responded to the speculation, saying there were no plans for the Wisconsin lawmaker to step down anytime soon.

“The rumor mill is that Paul Ryan is getting ready to resign in the next 30 to 60 days and that Steve Scalise will be the new Speaker,” Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) told the website Nevada Newsmakers on Monday. “Now that is interesting because nobody has talked to members [of the House] on how they are going to vote [on new leadership]. Now, maybe they have talked to all of the members but me. I don’t know, so that is the rumor mill from last week.”

Aides for both Ryan and Scalise denied the rumors on Monday evening, and The Washington Post notes that Amodei isn’t among Ryan’s inner circle of advisers.

“The speaker is not resigning,” AshLee Strong, Ryan’s spokeswoman, said in a statement obtained by The Hill.

Laura Fine, Scalise’s spokeswoman, said he “fully supports” Ryan to remain speaker and that the “whole leadership team is focused on working with President Trump to deliver more conservative wins for the country.”

But rumors about Ryan’s departure have swirled for months, and some speculated that he would leave office after Congress pushed through its tax bill in December. Were Ryan to run again, he might face a tough re-election bid in November amid an anticipated Democratic wave in the midterms.

Ryan told Fox News last month that he hadn’t yet decided if he’d run for re-election, but would figure it out in the coming months.

“Look, my wife and I had that conversation in the spring of every election year,” Ryan said about the prospect of another congressional bid. “We haven’t had that yet. We’ll figure it out then.”Family members of Seth Rich, a DNC staffer murdered in Washington D.C. in 2016, have filed two separate lawsuits against Ed Butowsky, and others, claiming that they helped push conspiracy theories about his death.

Ed Butowsky was already facing one lawsuit from the family of Seth Rich ― the slain Democratic National Committee staffer whose death fueled far-right political conspiracy theories that he had leaked thousands of internal DNC emails ― when a second landed at his feet on Tuesday morning.

Aaron Rich, Seth Rich’s brother, sued Butowsky and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the wealthy Texas financial adviser helped create a “defamatory campaign” against him and his late brother. Earlier in March, the brothers’ parents sued Butowsky and Fox News, alleging that they had “intentionally exploited” Seth’s death “through lies, misrepresentations and half-truths.”

“How many family members do they have that want to sue me?” an exasperated Butowsky told HuffPost over the phone on Tuesday afternoon. “I’m waiting for first and second cousins to sue me now.”

Asked to confirm he was speaking on the record, Butowsky exclaimed: “Yes! I want it all out there.”

“How many Riches are there?” Butowsky continued. “I know there are a couple other Riches in Omaha that haven’t sued me yet. So tell them; everyone sue me and get it over with.”

Seth Rich was shot and killed while walking home in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016. Washington police have yet to arrest anyone connected to the case, which they have described as a robbery attempt gone wrong.

Butowsky, a Dallas-based financial consultant who has previously made major donations to Republican candidates, reached out to the Rich family in the wake of the murder with an offer to help finance a private investigation into it. That led to the hiring of Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metro Police Department investigator and Fox News contributor with a history of dabbling in conspiracy theories.

Instead of solving the murder, though, the Rich family has claimed that Butowsky only helped fuel the far-right conspiracy that Seth and Aaron Rich were the true culprits behind the hacking of DNC servers that led to the leak of internal emails and memos before the 2016 elections.

Seth, in the view of these conspiracy peddlers, delivered the emails to WikiLeaks, and was then killed by Democratic Party operatives in order to keep him silent.

Those theories have never had any basis in fact, according to police, the Rich family or American intelligence officials, who issued a report in January 2017 that tied the leaks to Russian hackers.

The Daily Beast reported in March that intelligence officials had also tied Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who has taken credit for the original breach of the DNC’s servers, to the Kremlin itself after he failed to shield his identity with a virtual private networking service.

Butowsky, who called the lawsuit from the Rich family “bullshit” and “one of the dumbest things” he’d ever seen, reacted similarly to news of Aaron’s complaint, which claims that Butowsky, conservative newspaper The Washington Times, and internet activist Matthew Couch and his own right-wing media company falsely tied Aaron to the leaks.

“I’m not sure what these lawsuits are about, or why they’re doing them,” Butowsky said. “All these people are running around talking about some guy named Guccifer 2. I don’t know what a Guccifer is. I really don’t care about any of this. It’s not a part of my life that matters.”

Aaron, the lawsuit states, “has suffered substantial economic harm” and “severe emotional distress” thanks to Butowsky and the other defendants’ “campaign of defamation.”

But despite Aaron’s agonies and the lack of evidence supporting the conspiracy theories around Seth’s murder, Butowsky continued to insist that the Rich parents had admitted their son’s involvement when he first spoke to them.

“Just tell the darn truth and be honest with this country with what you know and what you said, and let’s move on,” Butowsky said. “They’ve made up this fallacious story, calling me a political operative. What the hell is a political operative? Am I James Bond or something?”

Butowsky and the other named defendants “are entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to spread vicious lies about an innocent man,” Aaron’s attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. “Those who defame and harass decent American citizens in an effort to advance their personal financial and partisan gain will be held accountable in court.” A spokesperson for the Rich family declined to respond to Butowsky.

Butowsky issued his own threat to a family that has said they only pursued legal action “to help prevent this kind of malicious and reckless behavior in the future so that others can be spared the hell the Riches have had to endure.”More than 40 children were among the dozens killed in a blaze that ravaged a Siberian shopping center Sunday. Heartbreaking reports of the youngsters’ final moments suggest many were trapped in a cinema where they’d gone to enjoy a screening of a kids movie. Many of them called family members to ask for help or say goodbye as the blaze encroached.

One child penned a final message on social media: “We are burning,” wrote 13-year-old Maria Moroz. “I love you all. This is perhaps farewell.”

The fire reportedly started on the fourth floor of the “Winter Cherry” shopping center in Kemerovo, Russia, at around 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.

According to Vladimir Chernov, a deputy governor of the region, the blaze originated in the children’s play area in the mall. The cause of the fire remains unknown, though Chernov suggested a child may have used a lighter to ignite the foam filler of a trampoline in the play area, according to The New York Times.

Video shared online by Russian news outlets showed thick smoke rapidly filling the fourth floor as the fire began to spread.

Russian authorities confirmed Monday that emergency exits at the shopping center had been blocked and the fire alarm system had been switched off, corroborating eyewitness accounts.

Harrowing videos posted on social media showed desperate people jumping from windows to escape the fire. An 11-year-old boy was among those who jumped.

Russia’s Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the child had survived but was in “serious condition.” He lost his parents and a younger sister in the fire, Skvortsova said.

At least 64 people died in the inferno, described as one of the worst fire disasters in modern Russian history. Interfax news agency said Monday that at least 41 of those killed were children. Earlier reports said an entire fifth grade class and their teacher had perished in the blaze.

The aunt of one of the fifth-graders said her niece, 11-year-old Viktoria, had called her just minutes after the fire began.

“She said that everything was in flames, and that the doors were blocked in the cinema. She said she couldn’t escape and couldn’t breathe,” Yevgeniya Oganesyan told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. “I told her: Vika, take off your clothes and bring them to your nose, breathe through your clothes. She told me, ‘Tell Mummy that I loved her. Tell everyone that I loved them.’”

Other families recounted similarly agonizing calls.

Alexander Lillevyali told independent news outlet Meduza that his daughters had called him from the movie theater saying the room was filling with smoke but they couldn’t escape because the doors were locked.

Lillevyali said he’d accompanied his three young daughters into the theater and had placed them in their seats with boxes of popcorn. He’d then gone downstairs to wait for their movie to finish when he received their desperate call.

“As I was running up the stairs, somebody handed me a wet rag, and I used it to cover my nose,” Lillevyali said of his attempt to rescue his children. “When I reached the fourth floor, I broke a window to send the draft upwards. Then I collapsed. I started crawling, but I realized at this point that I’d lost all strength.”

One of his daughters “kept calling me and calling me,” he continued, speaking through tears. “I just shouted into the phone that she needed to try to get out of the theater, but there was nothing I could do. In front of me, it was already flames.”

Igor Vostrikov said he also lost his three young children in the fire. His wife and sister had also perished, he said ― all of them had been in the cinema when the fire broke out.

“[My wife] Lena called from there,” Vostrikov told Komsomolskaya Pravda. “She screamed, ‘Help us, rescue us, we’ve been locked up.’”

Russian authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the fire and said they would punish anyone found guilty of negligence. Several people involved in the mall’s operation, including the building’s owner, have reportedly been detained for questioning.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the scene of the blaze Monday and blamed “criminal negligence” for the tragedy.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Authorities have arrested a man suspected of sending package bombs to U.S. military sites in the Washington area as well as White House and CIA mail offices, two law enforcement officials said on Tuesday.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation was expected to disclose the arrest on Tuesday, one source said, without giving more details.

A second source said the man was arrested in Seattle early on Tuesday and was expected to appear in court the same day.

The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information during an investigation.

More than six suspicious packages were found at government installations in the Washington area on Monday, one of the sources said. Similar packages were found at mail processing facilities for the Central Intelligence Agency and White House, the source said.

Authorities have already said publicly that packages were found at Fort McNair in the District of Columbia and Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Virginia, both U.S. Army installations.

NBC News said another was found at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, a Navy and Air Force facility, in the U.S. capital on Tuesday. The suspect sent 12 packages in all, and investigators expected more to arrive on Tuesday, it said.

The package delivered to Fort McNair prompted officials to evacuate the building. An Army bomb squad confirmed that the package had tested positive for explosive residue and determined a fuse was attached, a base spokesman has said.

A Fort Belvoir spokesman said its package had been rendered safe.

The incident occurred the same month as Austin, Texas, was left on edge by a bombing spree that killed two people before the accused bomber blew himself up as police closed in.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the annual health conference in Tel Aviv on March 27, 2018.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the leader was taken to hospital on Tuesday for tests following an illness.

“The prime minister is suffering from a high fever and is coughing,” a spokesman for the 68-year-old Netanyahu, said in a text message.

Netanyahu’s personal physician believes the prime minister had not fully recovered from an illness two weeks ago and therefore decided he should undergo further tests at hospital, the spokesman said.TONIGHT: Trevor has full coverage of the #MarchForOurLives, including stunning advice from an 8pm-curfew-in-human-form, Rick Santorum. pic.twitter.com/qSSWFYaLOI — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) March 27, 2018

Santorum, a former GOP senator from Pennsylvania, suggested on CNN Sunday that students should take “CPR classes” instead of pushing for gun control and demanding changes in the law.

Michael Allen Haag, of Boulder, was arrested Thursday night after his plane, Frontier Airlines flight 9864, landed in Charleston, South Carolina.

He has been charged with a felony count of interfering with a flight crew and a misdemeanor charge of indecent exposure, according to the Charleston Post & Courier.

An FBI affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun states that Haag was drinking double vodka and tonics during the flight.

Assigned a middle seat, Haag allegedly told a woman sitting next to him he was going to meet up with an old girlfriend in South Carolina and was “physically excited.”

The woman told authorities Haag asked her lots of personal questions and kept staring at her chest and legs.

At some point, Haag allegedly started touching a woman seated on the other side of him, prompting her to yell “stop touching me” and summon a flight attendant.

Haag was then moved to a seat in the last row, which he shared with a third woman, identified by Denver station KDVR as Emily.

She told the station flight attendants told her she “might want to get up just in case he tries to touch you.”

When Emily took out her phone to snap a picture of the man to show her girlfriends, things got gross.

“While I have my phone out trying to take a discreet photo, he starts to pee and urinate on the seat in front of him,” she said.

CBS Denver posted a photo that allegedly shows Haag urinating in his seat and hitting the back of the seat in front of him.

“And I scream, he’s f***ing peeing. He’s peeing. Oh my god. And the flight attendant doesn’t even acknowledge him at first. Acknowledges me and says you need to calm down and stop cursing,” she told KDVR.

For all her trouble, Emily says the airline only offered to waive her bag fees and give her a $200 voucher.

“I think they handled it extremely poorly,” she told the station. “Someone should have sat with him.”

Frontier Airlines did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, but airline spokesman Richard Oliver released a statement after the incident to CBS Denver.

“The safety and security of our passengers is our top priority at Frontier,” he said. “We have been made aware of this situation and are working with the appropriate authorities.”

Haag was booked Friday at the Charleston County jail but released on his own recognizance later in the day, according to the Post & Courier.

If convicted, he could spend 20 years behind bars.As national attention around the death of Stephon Clark grows, his family is demanding to know why Sacramento police shot and killed the young unarmed black man.

“They didn’t have to kill him like that,” his grandmother Sequita Thompson said in an emotional speech on Monday. “They didn’t have to shoot him this many times. Why didn’t you just shoot him in the arm, shoot him in the leg, send the dogs, send a Taser. Why? Why? Y’all didn’t have to do that.”

She begged to “please give us justice.”

The city’s mayor Darrell Steinberg also weighed in, saying that Clark’s death was “plain wrong.”

“It’s wrong because a 22-year-old man should not die in that way,” he added.

Clark was a father of 2. Facebook

Clark, a father of two, died after two officers shot at him 20 times. The officers later said they thought he was armed with a gun, which turned out to be just a cellphone.

Body camera footage released last week shows the officers trailing Clark through his neighborhood until he reached his home.

“Hey, show me your hands!” one of the officers yelled. “Gun! Gun, gun, gun!”

Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Clark’s family, said Monday that they’re planning an independent autopsy.

“No family should have to endure this pain and suffering as they try to seek answers for an execution of their loved one who is only holding a cell phone,” he said.

Kardashian and Kanye West once spent four days editing a photo from their wedding album before posting it, so it’s not unthinkable that Kardashian would alter something. The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star typically calls out pictures that aren’t edited.

She responded to haters with a Snapchat video of her appearance on the set and a “F*ckYoPhotoShop #CorsetLife” comment.In the 1991 “Roseanne” episode “A Bitter Pill to Swallow,” Becky Conner opens up to her mom about getting more serious with her boyfriend and wanting to go on the pill.

“Just in case we decide to, that it’s time for me to get some birth control,” Becky (Lecy Goranson) tells Roseanne (Roseanne Barr), before asking if she’d take her to the gynecologist.

That episode still resonates today.

“I can’t tell you many people have said to me that they’ve watched that with their mother, or they watched that with their daughter and they had to talk about it,” Goranson told HuffPost at Build Series Monday. “It was there. It was alive. And it was awkward. Because there’s the humor involved, it almost is like, the door’s open. We can do this.”

Birth control was just one of the many progressive topics “Roseanne” tackled during its nine-season run from 1988-1997. The ABC comedy also featured storylines involving gay relationships and abortion ― all while portraying the realities of a working-class family in the Midwest.

On Tuesday, “Roseanne” will return for a 10th season ― two decades after the show went off the air. The main cast is back, including Goranson and Barr, along with John Goodman as Dan, Laurie Metcalf as Jackie, Sara Gilbert as Darlene, Michael Fishman as D.J., and Sarah Chalke, who played Becky in later seasons. The Conners remain rooted in a working-class household ― one that still faces financial issues and job struggles. It’s real. It’s raw. It’s America. It’s a slice of life we don’t get to see on TV too often.

“Maybe it’s not glamorous to depict the working class, for some people. I think America is a lot about glitz and glamour and waving the dollar bill in front of people,” Goranson said. “I think that at the core, there is a great deal of suffering in this country and a great deal of strife and there’s a lot of voices that aren’t being recognized and aren’t being heard.”

Goranson added that Barr, who executive produces the series alongside Gilbert, wanted to continue to show those real-life struggles on the show.

“I know that for Roseanne, the person, that that really is what what’s most important ― is to depict the working class. And that’s what drives the show. And that’s what drives her. It’s her passion.”

ABC

A lot of attention has been placed on the first episode of the new season because of its mentions of President Donald Trump, who’s at the heart of a riff between Roseanne and her sister Jackie. In one scene, Roseanne explains why she voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Roseanne: He talked about jobs, Jackie. He said he would shake things up. I mean, this might come as a complete shock to you, but we almost lost our house, the way things are going. Jackie: Have you looked at the news? Because now things are worse. Roseanne: Not on the real news.

Goranson noted that although Trump is mentioned in the first episode, he’s not a constant throughout the entire season. Rather, U.S. politics are there to establish a divide in the family.

“We really wanted to put that out there and say, ‘This is what’s happening in people’s families. There’s a lot of division.’ How do we get past that division on a personal level? And I think what’s really unfortunate that a lot of people just hear ‘Roseanne/Trump’ and they just go with it. And they can go wherever they want with that instead of thinking about all the nuance that really is happening on the show,” Goranson said. “One thing about all the characters on the show is that we really all do have arcs. No one stays in the same place, just like in life.”

Roseanne’s character arc will definitely will be one to watch this season.

“You kind of see her deal with some of the issues that maybe you would think a Trump supporter would have a stance on. But then she transforms,” Goranson said. “I really think that it’s well handled … I would just encourage anyone who, when they hear ‘Roseanne, Trump supporter,’ that it’s really not propaganda.

Meanwhile, Goranson couldn’t be happier to act alongside her cast members after all of these years, especially with someone like Goodman, who plays her dad on the show.

“He’s just what you want him to be,” she said. “Everyone loves him. He’s a lovable person. He’s also very introverted. And he’s also the cool alpha guy, too, who is the funny guy and the one you want to hang out with. He’s also like the best friend. He is so happy to be back on the show ... And you think everything that he’s done, all the movies, all the big things that he’s done that he wouldn’t be this excited. But we all feel that way because we love to work together. It really is a unique situation for us actors that we have each other. We’re definitely a bunch of misfits.”

Those bunch of misfits are eager for fans to see the new episodes or “Roseanne.” There’s already talk about another season.

“ABC has to see how we do. I don’t know what they do behind the scenes, but I can say that we all want there to be a second season,” Goranson said. “We’re all really excited for that, should it happen. So, we’re crossing our fingers.”“Weird Al” Yankovic briefly traded his accordion for a guitar at the Apollo Theater in New York on Friday night.

BLANDING, Utah — Passionate proponents and ardent critics of Bears Ears National Monument filed into a school gymnasium here Monday evening for the first of two public scoping meetings that the federal government is holding to receive input on how the Trump administration should manage what remains of the protected Utah site.

Some called on the bureaus tasked with overseeing the new monument to establish a management plan for the original boundary, arguing the entire archaeologically rich landscape deserves increased protections. Others urged officials to ensure monument lands remain open for grazing, off-road vehicles and other activities. And several questioned if the administration wasn’t getting ahead of itself by moving forward with land-use planning amid numerous legal challenges.

Monday’s event in Blanding comes nearly four months after President Donald Trump gutted the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, reducing it to just over 200,000 acres. He described the monument, designated by President Barack Obama in the final weeks of his presidency, as a massive federal land grab that “threatened” local economies and Utahns’ way of life. The new monument is divided into two disconnected sites, named Shash Jaa and Indian Creek, and includes two small satellite units around well-known archaeological sites.

Ernie Washee, a resident of Blanding and a member of the Navajo Nation, dismissed the meeting a “big charade.”

“They call it a planning process, but the decision has already been made,” he said. His wife, Rebecca Stoneman-Washee, called the recent rollback “tragic” and said the administration shouldn’t do anything until the numerous legal challenges play out in court.

Named after a pair of buttes, Bears Ears is home to more than 100,000 Native American archaeological and cultural sites and is considered sacred to many tribes. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition — a group of five Native American tribes that petitioned for the area to be given monument status — is among the parties now suing the Trump administration over its recent decision.

Monument supporters aren’t the only ones disappointed with the final outcome.

For Zeb Dalton, a cattle rancher from Blanding, 85 percent wasn’t enough. He said he appreciates what Trump did — “It’s better,” he said — but hoped the monument would be rescinded altogether.

Dalton, who has grazing permits both within the original and new monument boundary, argues the designation does nothing to protect archaeological sites and said he worries the management plan will limit his ability to ranch on the lands, despite the fact that the Obama-era declaration clearly stated that ranching can continue. He said he can’t understand how one person — the president — could have the power to single handedly designate such a large area of land.

“If they want to do this, they ought to put it through Congress,” he said.

Representatives of the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service stressed to participants that the meetings were the beginning of a long process to draft and ultimately implement a management plan, and that their comments were important and would be considered.

It’s understandable why some might be skeptical.

Following a months-long review of 27 national monuments, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that Trump shrink or otherwise weaken protections for 10, including Bears Ears and nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante. In his final report to the White House, Zinke acknowledged that the vast majority of the 2.8 million public comments received by the Interior Department as part of the review favored maintaining the current size of all monuments, but cast them off as part of “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.”

Leslie Lamont, who attended Monday’s meeting from Carbondale, Colorado, said it’s been frustrating to watch all the input and work that went into having the monument designated be sidelined by Trump’s unprecedented and sweeping cut.

“I feel that a process occurred and it never got off the ground,” she said. “It was just chopped off.”

Lloyd Nielson, of Blanding, said he’s not for or against the monument. Rather, he finds the designation “pointless,” as he said it created more work for the Bureau of Land Management at a time with resources and federal funding are stretched thin.

“There’s no right answer,” he said. “It’s just stupid.”“With free ads for our services running on Grindr, we’ve been able to target users in our community and raise awareness for our center and HIV testing services,” said Adrian Shanker, founder and executive director of Allentown’s Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center in a press release.

In a clip “Jimmy Kimmel Live” posted Tuesday while the show takes a break, Kimmel spoke with a Dallas woman who revealed she was visiting Los Angeles on her “divorce trip” after a 48-hour marriage.

“Forty-eight hours?” Kimmel said. “No! You don’t get a trip for that.”

With the host’s encouragement in the off-air exchange, the woman explained she was on her honeymoon and discovered her new husband was cheating.

“I’m sorry that happened but, you know what? Better 48 hours than four years,” Kimmel said. To which the woman responded, “Amen.”

There’s a lot more to the story, and some pretty good lines thrown in by Kimmel ― a funny guy who stays light on his feet even when he isn’t on live TV.The frontman of Eagles of Death Metal, the U.S. rock band that was performing in a Paris theater in 2015 when it was hit by a terrorist attack, has publicly slammed the teens behind last weekend’s March For Our Lives protest.

Jesse Hughes called the survivors of last month’s mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school “vile abusers of the dead,” and claimed they were “exploiting” the deaths of their fellow students with their demonstrations and media appearances.

“When the truth don’t line up with your bullshit narrative just hold your breath and stamp your feet and refused to except it,” Hughes wrote in a series of typo-riddled posts on Instagram. Although the posts were eventually deleted, they were preserved in a number of places.

“It might be funny if it wasn’t so pathetic and disgusting,” he wrote.

Eagles of Death Metal were performing at the Bataclan theater in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, when Islamic State militants launched a series of attacks. By the end of the night, the militants had killed 130 people, including 89 at the Bataclan, and wounded hundreds more throughout the city.

Referring to the attack, Hughes wrote:

“As the survivor of a mass shooting I can tell you from first-hand experience that all of you protesting and taking days off from school insult the memory of those who were killed and abuse and insult me and every other lover of liberty by your every action.....Long Live Rock’n’Roll..... and may everyone [sic] of these disgusting vile abusers of the dead live as long as possible so they can have the maximum amount of time to endure their shame....and be Cursed....”

Hughes also posted an image of shooting survivor Emma González that was doctored to look like she was tearing up the Constitution. He called her “the awful face of treason” and a “survivor of nothing.” In the original animation, González ripped up a gun-target poster typically seen at shooting ranges.

After Hughes’ posts were deleted, no new statements appeared. However, the band’s official Facebook page quickly filled with posts from one-time fans who say they’re done with the group.

Hughes is no stranger to controversy. Just months after the Paris attacks, he denounced France’s tough gun control laws.

“Did your French gun control stop a single fucking person from dying at the Bataclan? And if anyone can answer yes, I’d like to hear it because I don’t think so,” he said at the time.

In 2016, Hughes suggested that some of the security guards at the theater were complicit in the attacks because they hadn’t come to work that day.

“It seems rather obvious that they had a reason not to show up,” he told Fox Business.Movie star Sean Penn turned in a laid back, yet unforgettable, interview on Monday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.”

“You’ve inherited a little of the Ambien I had to take to get to sleep after a red-eye last night,” the actor told host Stephen Colbert.

Penn then proceeded to light up two cigarettes while discussing why he doesn’t enjoy acting anymore and the creative process behind his new dystopian novel, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff.

At one point, Colbert did lightly reprimand Penn for smoking. But Penn quipped it was “job security for oncologists.”

Penn ended by praising the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting survivors who responded to the massacre by organizing last weekend’s “March for Our Lives.”

“Within days of that not only are they stating their case with incredible sobriety and articulate words but in such an inclusionary way,” said Penn. “You feel like there are reasonable people who have been on the other side of this conversation who are gonna listen to these kids.”

AdvertisementDutch brewer Heineken acknowledged it “missed the mark” with a new commercial that Chance the Rapper criticized as “terribly racist,” and pulled the spot from TV and YouTube.

The Heineken Light ad shows a bartender sliding a bottle along a bar, past multiple black people, to a fair-skinned woman as the tagline, “Sometimes, lighter is better,” flashes onto the screen.

“While we feel the ad is referencing our Heineken Light beer, we missed the mark, are taking the feedback to heart and will use this to influence future campaigns,” a Heineken spokesperson told Newsweek, touting the company’s history of diverse marketing. The ad has been pulled from television and YouTube, reports NBC News.

Chance the Rapper on Sunday called attention to the ad.

“I think some companies are purposely putting out noticeably racist ads so they can get more views,” Chance tweeted.

I think some companies are purposely putting out noticably racist ads so they can get more views. And that shit racist/bogus so I guess I shouldn’t help by posting about it. But 😂 I gotta just say tho. The “sometimes lighter is better” Hienekin commercial is terribly racist omg — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) March 26, 2018

The Chicago musician said he wasn’t calling for a boycott of the beer, but was “just noticing how often it happens.”

Chance said on Twitter Monday that he wanted to point out that many marketers “willfully” create racist advertising “so we overreact and tweet about it, and you write an article and tweet, and we all say their brand name 50 times.”

You missed the entire point, I was pointing out that alot of these marketing agencies are doing willfully so we overreact and tweet about it, and you write an article and tweet, and we all say their brand name 50 times.

Actress Gabrielle Union also chimed in:WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday presented a lengthy list of grievances against the Iranian government and vowed to forge a new, better nuclear agreement — but he offered few details on how the United States would accomplish that goal without support from European allies, Russia or China.

“The bet that the [2015 Iran nuclear deal] would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East and indeed for the entire world,” Pompeo said during his first major speech in his new role, promising that the new deal would address not only the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program but also its ballistic missile program, its interventions in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, and its repressive treatment of its own people.

“We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hezbollah proxies operating around the world and crush them,” Pompeo added, referring to the Lebanese armed group that is Iran’s chief ally in the region. “Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.”

The original deal ― negotiated between Iran, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia ― focused only on Iran’s nuclear program, and some of its provisions would expire 10 to 15 years after it took effect. State Department officials had described Pompeo’s speech as an opportunity for the secretary to present a diplomatic roadmap to achieving a better deal with Iran two weeks after President Donald Trump announced plans to violate the international nuclear agreement by pulling out.

But the secretary offered few clues about how Washington might convince Tehran to sign on to a tougher accord. Pompeo’s chief proposal ― fresh sanctions that would force the Iranians to negotiate ― depends on cooperation from Russia, China and Europe, which, unlike the U.S., do significant business with Iran. Obama administration officials spent years building a sanctions framework with those governments before attempting the nuclear diplomacy.

Pompeo repeatedly blasted President Barack Obama’s team as naive and even once suggested they actually sought to help the Iranian government. But it’s unclear how the Trump administration believes it will prove more successful than its predecessor in bringing aboard other international powers. Since Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the deal, the other countries involved in it have scrambled to ensure that Iran continues receiving economic benefits so that it will continue upholding its end of the deal, which they say is essential to global security.

“Pompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran.” - Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department official at the Brookings Institution.

The Trump administration’s contradictory approach to Iran ― exemplified in Pompeo’s speech by his saying Tehran negotiated in bad faith and simultaneously arguing Trump wants to create a grand bargain with it ― has convinced partner governments they need to develop their own policies without looking for leadership from the U.S.

The EU, the closest American partner in diplomacy with Iran, has been unusually blunt in recent days. “Looking at latest decisions of @realDonaldTrump someone could even think: with friends like that who needs enemies,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, tweeted last week.

Pompeo attempted to downplay the rift. “From my conversations with Europeans friends, I know that they broadly share these same views, of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community,” he said.

Hours after Pompeo’s remarks, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal.

“There is no alternative to the JCPOA,” Mogherini said in a statement, referring to the Iran deal’s official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “Secretary Pompeo’s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the JCPOA has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence Iran’s conduct in areas outside the scope of JCPOA.”

Pompeo — like hawkish national security adviser John Bolton — has warned that the Trump administration would be willing to punish European businesses dealing with Iran.

The Europeans have already been burned by the U.S. Over the past several months, the State Department’s director of policy planning, Brian Hook, led negotiations with U.S. allies aimed at creating parallel agreements to supplement the 2015 nuclear accord, part of an effort to entice Trump to stay in the deal. State Department officials say they were close to reaching an agreement — but Trump seemed to have not even known about the effort.

During his speech on Monday, Pompeo specifically referenced cooperating with the few American partner governments who praised Trump’s Iran deal decision: Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Some of them and other pro-U.S. nations like Qatar have supported the Trump administration’s anti-Iran actions since the announcement on the deal, including placing new sanctions on Iran-linked figures and entities.

But it’s unclear how far Gulf countries will go to pressure the Islamic Republic, particularly if Europe, Russia and China try to sustain significant international economic activity with Iran. The UAE and Qatar have their own strong economic ties to Iran, and officials around the region are wary of sparking fresh tensions between the few remaining stable governments there.

Pompeo tried to justify his case by repeatedly referencing the plight of ordinary people: Iranians themselves, Middle Easterners at risk from Iranian-backed Houthi and Hamas militants and Syrians suffering because of Iran’s support for the brutal Assad regime. (In Trump-era style, he both spoke of Syrians as victims and then repeated the misleading populist argument that Syrian refugees flowing into Europe include many terrorists.)

Yet so far, the effects of Trump’s decision are hitting the individuals Pompeo mentioned the hardest ― making it more difficult for Iranians to buy vital goods and for U.S. officials to use diplomacy to help the American prisoners held in Iran.

Tensions between the U.S. and Iran will likely only grow in the months ahead as hard-liners there gain power by pushing the narrative that the West cannot be trusted and the Trump administration continues to try and look tough.

Experts who watched Pompeo’s speech called his demands unrealistic and some predicted that when Iran inevitably fails to meet them, the U.S. will use it as justification for military intervention.

“Pompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran,” tweeted Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department official during the George W. Bush administration.“I think everybody would agree this is turmoil, chaos, confusion.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump seems to be having difficulty finding lawyers to represent him in the widening probe of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Last week, Trump’s lead attorney for the special counsel investigation, John Dowd, tendered his resignation, prompting a White House search that has yet to yield a suitable replacement. At least six lawyers in the last week have turned down an offer to represent the president.

Lawyers and legal experts say it’s not hard to see why: Lawyers could place themselves at great risk by working for a client with a reputation for impulsiveness and an inability to heed advice, who tends to undercut legal strategy with haphazard public statements and an itchy Twitter finger and who, as a result, may not be worth the publicity and likely future business associated with representing a president of the United States.

“One of the things you always wonder about when you’re asked to replace another lawyer is ‘Why?’” said George Clark, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney specializing in legal ethics.

Clark noted that many lawyers endure guilty or ethically challenged clients ― the right to legal counsel being something attorneys strive to uphold ― but erratic clients are a whole different can of worms. Refusing to take advice from counsel, for example, is a common reason why lawyers drop clients.

Trump’s difficulties with staffing his legal team come as special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is said to be entering a critical phase. While the president has publicly embraced the prospect of sitting down for an interview with the special counsel’s team, Trump’s lawyers have been divided on the subject. Dowd reportedly opposed it, and his departure clears a path to begin preparations for an interview.

Trump has, in recent days, also escalated his attacks against the Russia probe, leading many to speculate that Mueller’s job itself could be in peril. Last week, the president ignored cautioning from his counsel and lashed out at Mueller by name for the first time.

Further complicating the search for lawyers is that representing Trump could present a conflict of interest, since the existing clients of high-profile and seasoned litigators may already be connected to individuals under investigation. Attorneys Joe diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, for example, were ultimately unable to represent the president as was previously announced, due to conflicts of interest with the case.

Robert Rizzi, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who also teaches government ethics at Harvard Law School, declined to be interviewed for this story. But he too said there was a “good chance” he had represented or worked with many of the involved parties. Rizzi was one of a number of lawyers at prominent firms with large political practices who declined to comment to HuffPost for that reason.

“One of the things you always wonder about when you’re asked to replace another lawyer is ‘Why?’” - George Clark, a Washington-based attorney specializing in legal ethics

Potential candidates for Trump’s legal team are likely dissuaded by other factors, too ― such as the seemingly unending upheaval in the White House and among the Cabinet agencies.

“I think everybody would agree this is turmoil, chaos, confusion. It’s not good for anything,” Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration and who recently declined White House entreaties to join Trump’s legal team, said Monday during an interview on MSNBC. “We always believe that there should be an orderly process, and of course government is not clean or orderly ever, but this seems to be beyond normal.”

Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University, said that representing Trump in the Mueller probe could also threaten one’s professional reputation and may even put one in legal jeopardy.

Shugerman pointed to a recent episode involving Dowd and the circumstances surrounding the firing of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. In December, Dowd claimed he drafted a tweet for the president’s Twitter account that said: “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.” The tweet seemed to indicate that Trump was aware that Flynn had lied to the FBI before firing him, an admission that could bolster a possible obstruction of justice case against the president.

Dowd’s explanation for why he ― and not the president ― had authored the tweet may have exposed him to questions from the special counsel, as well.President Donald Trump is struggling to find lawyers to join his legal team.

John Dowd, lead attorney for the president in the Russia probe, resigned last week. Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush, reportedly rejected an offer to join the team. Up to six other lawyers have also reportedly turned down Trump over the past week.

“I think everybody would agree this is turmoil, it’s chaos, it’s confusion, it’s not good for anything,” Olson said on MSNBC on Monday. “We always believe that there should be an orderly process, and of course, government is not clean or orderly ever. But this seems to be beyond normal.”

On Twitter, people had some thoughts about why Trump was having such a hard time finding a lawyer ― and offered a few suggestions as to who he could hire:
