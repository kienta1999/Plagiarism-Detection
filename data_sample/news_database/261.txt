The woman also alleged that Greitens forced her to the ground and coerced her into having oral sex, according to a Missouri House special investigative committee’s report released last month.

While Gardner’s office dropped the charge on Monday, it also asked the judge to assign a special prosecutor to refile the charge in order to take the case to trial.

“The court’s order leaves the Circuit Attorney no adequate means of proceeding with this trial. Therefore, the court has left the Circuit Attorney with no other legal option than to dismiss and refile this matter,” Gardner’s office released in a statement after the charge was dropped.

Gardner told HuffPost in a statement that she is not surprised by the “continued theatrics” by Greitens’ legal team.

“I knew when I began investigating the Governor that his high-priced defense team would use whatever means possible to attack my team and me in court and through the media,” Gardner told HuffPost. “How did I know? Twice Governor Greitens’ team of attorneys came to my office and threatened my staff and me with the continued barrage of insults and accusations if we continued to pursue charges against the Governor.”

The circuit attorney said that the actions of Greitens’ defense attorneys didn’t worry her and that there was not “one shred of evidence” that the private investigator assisting her office, William Don Tisaby, committed any illegal actions.

“Often times, powerful people use whatever financial means available to stop prosecutors from seeking the truth,” Gardner told HuffPost in a statement. “This is not the first time (nor will it be the last) in American history when an elected official was under investigation and they attacked the investigation itself to redirect the focus from their client to something else.”Classic television show reunions really are all that, especially when they bring together stars from Nickelodeon fans’ favorite ’90s comedy sketch shows.

Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell ― who starred in their own ’90s sketch show “Kenan & Kel” ― recently reunited with their “All That” co-stars Lori Beth Denberg and Josh Server for an appearance on “Wild ’n Out.” The MTV series’ host and creator, Nick Cannon, was also once an “All That” cast member.

Mitchell posted several photos and a video of the reunion via Instagram.

WASHINGTON ― Asked about President Donald Trump’s assertion that the FBI’s reputation is “in tatters,” the man Trump picked to head the bureau said Tuesday that he encourages FBI employees to ignore “the noise” on social media and on television.

“There’s no shortage of opinions about our agency,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in response to a question from Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. “My experience has been that every office I go to, every division I go to, has patriots: people who could do anything else with their careers, but choose to work for the FBI because they believe in serving others.”

Wray noted that he’s received reassuringly positive feedback from state and local law enforcement, from the private sector and from communities served by the bureau.

“I’m a big believer in the idea that the FBI speaks through its work, through its cases, though the victims it protects,” Wray said. “I encourage our folks not to get too hung up on what I consider to be the noise on TV and in social media.”

The director said that he’d seen no evidence of inherent political bias in the bureau and that he thinks the bureau’s employees can weather the storm.

“Our people are very mission-focused,” Wray said. “I like to think that our folks are pretty sturdy.”

Trump nominated Wray as head of the FBI after he fired then-Director James Comey last spring. Earlier this month, the bureau publicly stated that a Republican-authored memo that Trump and his supporters were using to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election had “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”

Republican confidence in the FBI has dropped significantly as Trump has been able to convince many of his supporters that the bureau is biased against him, despite the fact that the bureau’s public handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation ahead of the 2016 election actually boosted Trump’s candidacy.It’s that time of year again. Time for dogs of all shapes and sizes to take center stage at the 142nd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and people’s love of dogs proved to be one of the few things that can bring out the best in Twitter.

Some people are going to get political, though, no matter what. One user posted, “Luckily, no dogs took a knee during the National Anthem before the #WestminsterDogShow.” An obvious reference to NFL players kneeling in protest during the National Anthem before games.

Another posted, “Damn it! The Russian Wolfhound won the Hound Group at #westminsterdogshow. These Russian hackers have taken over everything.”

The NFL Network’s Andrew Siciliano may have had the best idea ever, tweeting, “I wish we could combine tonight’s two big television events. I want skiing dogs. #PeyongChang2018 #westminsterdogshow”

Then there was the lighthearted shade thrown at Philadelphia Eagles fans. In a reply to another tweet, a user wrote, “NYC greased up all of the light poles outside of #madisonsquaregarden in anticipation of the German Shepherd win #westminsterdogshow.” For those not in the know, the Philadelphia Police Department greased light poles before both the NFC championship game and the Super Bowl to keep Eagles fans from climbing on them. It didn’t work.

No matter what happens with the dogs, the Best in Show already seems pretty obvious. One Twitter user pulled off the impossible.

The Microsoft Corp. co-founder didn’t use those exact words, but that was nevertheless the message he made clear Tuesday in an interview with Axios ahead of the release of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s annual letter.

Gates told the outlet he “absolutely” sees examples of monopolistic tech companies overstepping their bounds right now, thereby inviting the same type of protracted, damaging legal battle he faced in the late 1990s as the CEO of Microsoft.

“The tech companies have to be ... careful that they’re not trying to think their view is more important than the government’s view,” Gates warned, or that they’re “advocating things that would prevent government from being able to, under appropriate review, perform the type of functions that we’ve come to count on.”

The “view that even a clear mass-murdering criminal’s communication should never be available to the government” strikes him as problematic, Gates said, an apparent reference to Apple’s refusal to unlock the iPhone of one of the shooters in the December 2015 massacre in San Bernardino, California.

He also questioned tech companies’ “enthusiasm about making financial transactions anonymous and invisible.”

The problem isn’t that the companies are unable to police themselves, Gates said, it’s that they don’t want to. “There’s no question of ability; it’s the question of willingness,” he said.

In a possible sign of things to come, EU regulators hit Google’s parent company Alphabet with a $2.7 billion fine last year for violating antitrust rules, in the first of three investigations into the company’s monopolistic practices. (Alphabet has since filed an appeal.)

Facebook has also been hit with a number of lawsuits in Europe, where it’s been accused of violating users’ privacy and enabling a surge in hate speech, which is illegal in Germany.

And back home, representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were rebuked at committee hearings in Congress last year for failing to take action to stem Russian meddling in the 2016 election.“Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,” Trump tweeted, in an apparent reference to Porter. He added, “There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?”

Trump himself has been accused of sexual misconduct ― ranging from sexual harassment to assault and rape ― by 21 women.

In the last six months, dozens of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), and Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) are just a few of many politicians to have announced their resignations in the face of sexual misconduct allegations.

In November, over 200 female employees who have worked in U.S. national security signed an open letter urging their community to “reduce the incidences of sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace.”

Last week, Congress voted unanimously to explicitly ban sexual relationships between lawmakers and staffers in an effort to curb sexual harassment in the workplace. The legislation also approved the creation of an office providing legal support to staffers reporting sexual harassment, and authorized a separate bill requiring lawmakers who agree to sexual harassment settlements to pay out of their own pockets.American snowboarding prodigy Chloe Kim has taken the gold medal in the women’s snowboard halfpipe at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, topping the field with a phenomenal 98.25 score in the final, while fellow American Arielle Gold took the bronze.

Kim, the 17-year-old Californian, served up the near-perfect score on her last of three runs in the daytime final on Tuesday, a mark that none of the 11 other competitors could match. She is the youngest ever gold medalist in the halfpipe event.

Even though Kim’s winning score came in her final run, she had secured the gold with her first score of 93. Her second run failed to impress, getting a 41 from judges, but her flawless third effort clinched her top position in what is her first Winter Olympics.

Chloe Kim has thrown down the HAMMER with her first run. #WinterOlympics https://t.co/D65Nuoyydu pic.twitter.com/r6UJ7df38X — NBC Olympics (@NBCOlympics) February 13, 2018

Kim, a four-time X Games gold medalist, was joined by fellow U.S. snowboarders Kelly Clark and Maddie Mastro in the final, who placed fourth and 12th, respectively.

Gold, who had missed the 2014 Sochi Games due to injury, took bronze with a top score of 85.85.

Kim’s elation following her 93.75 run was obvious.

But if she was nervous while waiting between her runs, she didn’t show it. Just minutes before her third and final run, Kim’s mind was not on the halfpipe but on her stomach.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― Domestic abuse victims often worry their experiences won’t be taken as seriously if the offender is powerful or well-liked professionally.

By defending Rob Porter, the now former White House staff secretary accused of physically abusing his two ex-wives, and emphasizing that he was very good at his job, President Donald Trump and Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, are sending victims a signal that those fears are justified. (Porter has denied the allegations.)

“To have an [alleged domestic violence] offender at the White House, what do you think that says to every cop, every advocate, every prosecutor, every victim — especially every victim who turns on the TV and sees a man who reportedly put his hands on a woman’s neck, standing side-to-side with the president of the United States?” said Mark Wynn, a retired police officer who helped form the largest police domestic violence investigative unit in the United States. “It’s a big deal.”

White House officials were aware of the accusations against Porter for months, according to news reports, though there are still questions about the extent to which Kelly knew. Porter was able, nonetheless, to keep his job as staff secretary until last week, when he resigned after the allegations became public. Right away, Trump and Kelly publicly leapt to Porter’s defense.

That response sends a message not just to Porter’s alleged victims but also to other people who are considering reporting abuse.

“Anecdotally, I think most victims don’t feel like they can report, because abusers get away with the abuse,” said Gretchen Shaw, associate director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “This is an example of how they do so — they are elevated, they are protected by the people that brush this issue under the rug, and put their skill and experience ahead of what sounds like incredible violence.”

Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that the administration “takes the issue of domestic violence very seriously” and that Trump’s budget will be “fully funding the Violence Against Women Act.” (Kelly wrote in an email to White House staff that domestic violence “has no place in our society.”)

But Porter is not an isolated incident. White House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned last week following a Washington Post report about his ex-wife’s claims of abuse, including that he put out a lit cigarette on her hand. Sorensen denied the allegations.

The president has also cozied up with other men who have faced serious domestic abuse claims, including his former labor secretary pick, Andrew Puzder (He “hit me in the head pushed his knee into my chest twisted my arm and dragged me​ ​on the floor,” his first wife said). There was also an accusation of domestic violence against former chief strategist Steve Bannon. (Puzder and Bannon have denied the allegations.)

Former Obama administration staffers say that preventing violence against women was a priority for them.

“If the FBI had found credible evidence that an Obama White House staffer had engaged in domestic violence, that staffer would have been shown the door immediately,” said Chris Lu, who served as White House Cabinet secretary during the Obama administration.

In 2012, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum arguing that the federal government “should act as a model in responding to the effects of domestic violence on its workforce.” He directed the government to issue guidance on addressing domestic violence in the federal workplace. That guidance is current, and every agency, including the White House, develops its own policies based on it, Lindsay Haake, a spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management, said in an email.

“It’s a sign that you care about an issue when you apply it to yourself,” Caroline Bettinger-López, the former White House adviser on Violence Against Women in the Obama administration, told HuffPost. “Sending a message that this is not to be tolerated within the workplace, that leadership counts.”

The Trump administration has not continued Bettinger-López’s position, she said. Walters, the Trump White House spokeswoman, did not respond to questions about that position or the White House’s employment policy on domestic violence.

This issue transcends administrations and party, said Bettinger-López, now a law professor at the University of Miami. John Michael Farren, a one-time top attorney for former President George W. Bush, was convicted of attempting to kill his wife. But, “in failing to speak out against domestic violence, Trump has turned the clock back on the progress we’ve made in this country on this important issue,” Lu argued.

“Domestic violence offenders are very talented, they’re very creative, they come in all shapes and forms, bankers, judges, soldiers, construction workers,” Wynn said. But “when they’re discovered by somebody responsible, why would you want to keep them where we couldn’t see them? Why wouldn’t somebody responsible for this person say, ’Wait a minute, you did what to two girlfriends? You can’t work here. We don’t want you.′Maame Biney’s quest for Winter Olympics glory is still alive ― but it took a hit on Tuesday.

The 18-year-old Biney, the first black woman on the U.S. Olympic short-track speedskating team, got off to a slow start in a 500-meter quarterfinal heat in Pyeongchang, South Korea. She finished fourth (44.772 seconds), eliminating her from the event.

In her first-round debut on Saturday, Biney staved off a charge from an opponent to finish second and advance. This time she “got bumped and boxed out,” Yahoo reported, and she couldn’t make up the deficit.

Biney still has the 1,500 meters on Saturday.

Some fans on Twitter offered encouragement.National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden quipped in a tweet Monday that he won government security clearance “faster than half of this White House.”

Snowden, an NSA contractor who leaked thousands of documents exposing the agency’s global electronic eavesdropping, made the comment in a reply to a tweet by journalist Barton Gellman. Gellman, who has written extensively on the government, privacy and security, noted that it’s “highly unusual” for so many in the Trump administration to be still lacking permanent clearance after this much time. Yet they still have access to sensitive information.

I got a security clearance faster than half of this White House. https://t.co/hYYWy6wHIe — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 12, 2018

White House says it’s common for security clearance to take a year.



1. It’s not. Unusual, even for Regular Janes and Joes.



2. It verges on Black Swan territory for top-rankers like Kushner & Porter, who cut the line.



3. *May* mean “never” & bureaucracy doesn’t want to say no. — Barton Gellman (@bartongellman) February 12, 2018

The issue was raised dramatically last week when news emerged that security clearance for White House staff secretary Rob Porter was held up by accusations of domestic violence from both of his ex-wives. Porter quit his White House job last Wednesday. He insists the accusations are unfounded.

The Washington Post reported last week that “dozens” of White House staffers are still waiting for permanent security clearances. Among those is Donald Trump’s son-law-law, Jared Kushner.

Kushner, a top-level adviser to the president, is also apparently a person of interest in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. He also remains an investor in the Kushner family real estate empire, which has international holdings and investors. In addition, he has amended his financial disclosure forms several times to add information that he had previously omitted.

It’s particularly unusual for someone at Kushner’s level in the White House, who should be on a fast track, to wait more than three months for the permanent security clearance he needs, a source told the Post. “That just tells me that somebody’s uncomfortable with the information that they have in his background,” another source explained to the newspaper.

But a lawyer quoted by the Post, Mark Zaid, who represents government workers going through the process, said it’s not necessarily sinister that so many still lack permanent security clearance. He believes that investigations may be slowed by the fact that more people than usual have never before had clearance, and they also may have have complicated financial holdings with international connections. Zaid wrote the same to Gellman in a tweet.

I'm no fan of Trump WH but this isn't highly unusual. There are more ppl than usual who (1) never had clearance before & (2) have extensive & complicated financial backgrounds & foreign connections. Takes longer. I'd love to prove political manipulation but no evidence so far. — Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) February 12, 2018White House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned Friday following allegations of physical and emotional abuse from his ex-wife, Jessica Corbett, making him the second staffer last week to leave President Donald Trump’s administration over domestic violence allegations.

Corbett’s story, first reported by The Washington Post, has been overshadowed by the domestic abuse allegations from two ex-wives of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, as the White House offers convoluted talking points for explaining its handling of the allegations and the larger issue of violence against women.

“He has thrown me into a wall. He has put a cigarette out in my hand,” Corbett told NBC News in an interview that aired Tuesday morning.

Sorensen “made me drive around for hours, wondering where I would go, with no money, to beg people for cash so I could come home,” she continued.

Corbett stressed that she did not seek the spotlight and did not intend to harm Sorensen professionally.

“I wasn’t out to get him. I was not trying to get him denied this job by telling the truth. I do very much believe that he is one of the best and most capable people at what he does professionally,” she said.

According to the Post, Corbett had contacted the paper a week before allegations against Porter became public through reporting by The Daily Mail and The Intercept.

In a statement issued by the White House, Sorensen denied Corbett’s allegations. He claimed to the Post that “in fact, I was the victim of repeated physical violence during our marriage, not her.”

Meanwhile, White House officials have continued to cast doubt on whether they believe accusers in cases of domestic abuse, as well as sexual misconduct. In addition, they have offered shifting explanations on their handling of Porter’s allegations, like confusion over basic facts on what they knew and when.

On Monday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters multiple times that “the president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously,” yet would not say whether Trump believed the accusations.

WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced Tuesday that she would contribute $175,000 to efforts to Democratic groups trying to win back state legislatures and to fight partisan gerrymandering.

In the last speech of the day at the Center for American Progress’ Ideas Conference, where she was joined by many other rumored presidential contenders, Warren pledged the money as part of a multipronged effort to fix a “crisis in our democracy” that she said has been building since long before President Donald Trump took office.

The senior Massachusetts senator identified control of state governments and the congressional redistricting process as key ways to fight Republican efforts to infringe on voting rights. She called on Democrats to root out key GOP-led threats such as “racist” voter-ID laws, early voting restrictions, disenfranchisement of felons and partisan gerrymandering.

“I’m doubling down on the importance of our voters — state by state — and I want to turn up the heat on gerrymandering,” she said, according to the text of her prepared remarks. “I’m sending $175,000 to organizations on the front lines trying to win back our legislatures and fight for fair redistricting.

“Democrats believe in a fair fight, and making sure that districts aren’t drawn to cut out one party or the other is a critical first step,” she continued.

Warren is splitting the cash among several Democratic campaign committees and groups. She is sending $8,000 each to nine Democratic legislature campaigns in states where Democrats hope to pick up seats: Florida, Georgia, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.

She is also contributing $30,000 each to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (a national party arm that helps elect Democratic state lawmakers) and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (a group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder that is devoted to fighting GOP-led partisan redistricting). The remainder of the $175,000 will be split among several nonprofit liberal resistance groups, including Forward Majority, a super PAC devoted to electing Democratic state lawmakers.

Warren went further in her recommendations for restoring public faith in the idea, in support of what she called the fundamental principle that “every vote matters.”

She proposed amending the Constitution to establish “an unquestioned, unassailable, nationally recognized right to vote.” And she would crack down on the influence of special interests through three major reforms: requiring Cabinet members, agency heads and members of Congress to divest themselves of assets that pose a conflict of interest with their policy work; prohibiting presidents and those officials from lobbying after they leave their posts; and barring corporations from providing multimillion-dollar leave packages to executives so they can serve in government.

“Let’s dismantle the broken system that lets rich donors and giant companies undermine democracy by buying their way in Washington,” she declared.

Her $175,000 contribution is the latest in a series of moves by Warren designed to elect Democratic candidates and buttress the depleted party’s presence across the country.

At a March fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, she announced a contribution of $250,000 to the 50 state Democratic parties, as well as a $15,000 donation to the DNC.

The strategy is an implicit attempt to redress Barack Obama’s relative inattention to Democratic Party infrastructure while he was president. He received criticism for creating Organizing for Action, a separate political arm that skeptics believe deprived the party of much-needed attention and resources.

During Obama’s two terms, the party lost some 1,000 state legislative seats, forfeiting control of 27 state legislative chambers. The timing of those losses, which began with the 2010 midterm elections, was especially harmful to the party because it enabled Republicans to draw extraordinarily partisan congressional and legislative district boundaries that entrenched their advantages.

There is now a broad consensus among Democrats that ignoring the importance of state legislatures was a mistake of historic proportions.

However, a clear subtext of Warren’s address is her growing national political profile, including rumored presidential ambitions.

Warren, who has made a name for herself as Wall Street’s toughest foe in Congress, has emerged as a leading small-dollar fundraiser. A large majority of the more than $27 million Warren has raised since 2013 has been in increments of less than $200, according to an April analysis in The Intercept.

Although Warren is running for a second term in November, her use of her considerable campaign largesse to boost the fortunes of her fellow Democrats has fueled speculation that she has national aspirations. In all, she has raised or contributed nearly $15 million for Democratic candidates across the country, including the maximum allowed amount to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this year and last.

Warren has taken a special interest in promoting Democrats with whom she has worked on her signature issue of financial industry regulation. This election cycle, she is backing the Ohio gubernatorial candidacy of Richard Cordray, the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Katie Porter, a former Warren student and consumer law professor now running in California’s 45th Congressional District.“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade pulled no punches on Tuesday when telling White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah the administration “got burned” for hiring a “two-time accused domestic abuser” in reference to former senior aide Rob Porter.

The White House has been in the midst of doing damage control after domestic violence allegations came out against Porter and speechwriting team member David Sorensen last week. Both Porter and Sorensen have since resigned.

“What is going on behind the scenes in terms of FBI background checks that might change the staff this week?” asked Kilmeade, kicking off the conversation pertaining to these allegations.

“Well, again, the FBI background check process is one that, again, the FBI runs and we are a part of it. It is operated throughout the federal government,” Shah said. The deputy press secretary went on to say that the process was also used in previous administrations.

“If any changes need to be made, we’ll look at that, but, you know, this is a process that we trust,” he said.

Kilmeade then grilled Shah: “Raj, did you change anything? You relied upon it and you got burned because you had a two-time accused domestic abuser there at a very sensitive position where perhaps he shouldn’t have been had that been fully exposed. So what changes now?”

Shah responded by citing the administration’s faith in the FBI and the evaluation process. Co-host Steve Doocy then asked Shah about someone knowing about these allegations prior to this month.

“Raj, there is story out that somebody at the FBI told somebody at the White House back in November that this guy was a problem. Do you know who that person might be?” asked Doocy.

Shah said that Porter’s background check investigation wasn’t completed when the allegations of his domestic violence came to light and the White House “is not going to step into the middle of a process and short-circuit it.”

“What we know about Rob Porter specifically, and that’s the incident that everybody is talking about, is that his background check investigation had not been completed yet. It was still in the investigative process and had yet to be adjudicated,” he said. “So prior to an adjudication, the White House is not going to step into the middle of a process and short-circuit it. These investigations are complex. They’re lengthy for a reason. We need to get it right.”

On Wednesday of last week, reports came about alleging that Porter physically abused his two ex-wives, leading to his immediate resignation. Porter has denied the allegations and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly defended Porter in a statement, even imploring him not to resign.

David Toscano (D) led his caucus to vote for an amendment protecting consumers from a form of price gouging at the hands of Virginia's utility monopolies. The Washington Post/Getty Images

RICHMOND, Va. ― It was supposed to be an uneventful Monday evening in Virginia’s House of Delegates ― another moment for lawmakers from both parties to come together in the spirit of bipartisanship to give free rein to the state’s two electric power monopolies, Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian Power.

Instead, six House Republicans joined all 49 Democrats to pass an amendment that placed a serious check on the monopolies’ power mere days after their colleagues in the Senate decided to give them a blank check.

The vote demonstrated the desire of a Democratic caucus that has sometimes been criticized for its coziness with the monopolies to heed the populist appeals of its constituents.

“It’s clear that the grassroots will not stand for business as usual. Now is the time to continue pushing to ensure ... that the regulated do not become the regulators,” said Virginia Del. Sam Rasoul (D), a leading monopoly critic in the House.

For Dominion, which, as the larger of the two utilities and top campaign donor, is sometimes considered the most powerful force in Virginia politics, the defeat was especially humbling.

“I’ve never seen Dominion lobbyists look so sad,” said a senior Democratic aide in the legislature who requested anonymity to speak freely.

If Dominion had had its way, the House would have followed the state Senate’s lead. On Friday, the state’s upper chamber handily passed a bill that would, among other things, permit Dominion and Appalachian to reinvest their over-earnings into renewable energy and grid modernization projects in lieu of providing refunds to their ratepayers.

The vast majority of outside experts, including the office of Virginia’s attorney general and the State Corporation Commission, which oversees the monopolies, maintained that the scheme would enable “double dipping,” or charging ratepayers twice for the same infrastructure investments. Dominion and Appalachian would be allowed to take from the refunds owed to ratepayers ― that’s one dip ― and then still charge them higher rates to finance the same projects ― that’s the second dip.

A bipartisan group of state senators got together to propose an amendment that would have specifically barred the companies from charging ratepayers a second time, but it got shot down by a wide margin. Senate Democratic Leader Dick Saslaw had insisted that Dominion’s assurances were more than enough to go on, so why muck up the bill with a useless clause?

On Monday night, however, Saslaw’s counterpart in the House, Democratic Leader David Toscano, a delegate from Charlottesville, introduced a nearly identical bill barring double-charging.

More important, in his speech Toscano appeared to call the bluff of Dominion’s backers. He challenged opponents of the amendment to explain why, if Dominion claims there would be no double dipping, it would be so bad to pass a provision explicitly ensuring just that?

“If there isn’t a double dip in the bill, passing the amendment will clarify that fact. If there is a double dip in this bill, passing the amendment will fix the problem,” he declared.

Del. Terry Kilgore (R), a recipient of nearly $174,000 in donations from Dominion who introduced the House bill, did his best to shoot down the talking point with a folksy metaphor.

It is not clear exactly what Kilgore meant, but he compared the bill to a car dealer offering a customer a new car for the price of an old one that the customer had returned to the dealership.

“Who’s not going to jump onto that? And that’s basically what we’re doing here,” Kilgore said.

When it came time to vote, Kilgore’s metaphor apparently wasn’t enough. The Republican leaders who control the agenda in the chamber were visibly shocked as the amendment passed, 55 to 41.

That put the majority Republicans in a politically vulnerable spot, since the vote had placed them on the record against a consumer protection amendment.

In an apparent attempt at damage control, Del. Greg Habeeb, a Republican from southwest Virginia, claimed that the Republican lawmakers were merely concerned that the amendment amounted to legislating “on the fly.”

Republican leadership then moved to reconsider the amendment, and all the Republicans voted to pass it in a voice vote.

“This is the first time I’ve seen Dominion lose on the floor. This is a game-changer.” - Democratic Virginia legislative aide

Whether or not Republicans succeed in averting political blowback for the vote, the legislature’s antimonopoly firebrands landed a blow against Dominion that no legislative dealmaking can undo.

“This is the first time I’ve seen Dominion lose on the floor. This is a game-changer,” the Democratic aide said.

The House was going to pass the utility rate bill well before Monday night’s amendment. It’s still expected to pass the legislation when it comes up for a final vote on Tuesday ― perhaps by an even wider margin than it would have otherwise.

And the amended legislation still has its critics, many of whom are unhappy with provisions of the bill that limit the factors the SCC can consider when evaluating the utility companies’ infrastructure projects.

However, as it stands, the amended bill protects ratepayers from the risk of price gouging that consumer advocates considered especially egregious.

Dominion still has plenty of legislative maneuvers it can use to strip the amendment from the bill before it gets to the governor’s desk. The House and Senate bills will likely need to be reconciled in conference committee, another opportunity for backroom pressure.

But in a state swimming in Dominion’s generous campaign contributions, every little setback counts.

What’s more, the state’s House Democrats, 16 of them freshmen, have shown their willingness to publicly break with Virginia’s moderate Democratic governor, Ralph Northam. Northam gave the bill its blessing without the amendment, and a spokesman from his office told The Washington Post that the “double dipping” issue had already been resolved.

Democratic House Leader Toscano voted to advance the original legislation out of the Labor and Commerce Committee without the amendment.

But in the past two weeks, he and other lawmakers received an outpouring of feedback from individual constituents and grassroots groups who were infuriated by the double dipping.

Many of the same local progressive groups that materialized spontaneously in the wake of Donald Trump’s election — and helped flip 15 Virginia House seats in November — took the lead in pressuring lawmakers to oppose any bill that allowed the utilities to double-charge.

One such group, Network NOVA, demanded that lawmakers “#KillTheBill” in online appeals for activists to contact their lawmaker.

A widely circulated meme the group shared focused on “double dipping.”

“When Dominion writes the law: we pay twice, they get richer,” the meme said.

Toscano conducted a SurveyMonkey poll of members of his constituent email list and found widespread opposition to the double-dipping provision, even as a majority still favored the bill as a whole.

The freshman Democrats also played a key role in stoking skepticism about the utility monopolies within the caucus. Virtually all of the new House Democrats campaigned against Dominion’s influence. Thirteen House Democrats even signed a pledge promising to refuse donations from Dominion or Appalachian.

The freshman Democrats “were asking very detailed questions about the technical elements of this bill,” Toscano said.

“It’s one thing to campaign and take positions, it’s another thing to try to govern,” he continued. “And when you have to figure out how to govern, you’ve got to look at the nuances of this bill. And that’s what these freshmen were doing.”

During the day on Monday, Toscano whipped the members of his caucus to vote in unison for the amendment to prevent the double dipping.Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

Most Americans believe that domestic abusers shouldn’t be allowed to work in politics, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, and those who’ve followed stories about former Trump aide Rob Porter largely say that he wasn’t suited to work in the White House.

Americans of all political stripes have little sympathy for Porter, or for others alleged to have committed domestic violence. But there’s a significant intensity gap between the outrage shown by Hillary Clinton’s voters and that demonstrated by the rest of the country — one that often outpaces the gap along gender lines.

A 64 percent majority of the public says that someone credibly accused of domestic abuse should be disqualified from serving in politics, with just 11 percent saying they should not be. Eighty-four percent of Clinton voters say that facing such allegations should be disqualifying, as do 56 percent of Trump voters, and 58 percent of everyone else polled, including non-voters and those who chose a third-party candidate in 2016.

Two-thirds of Americans say they’ve heard at least a little, and 25 percent say they’ve heard a lot in the news about Porter, who resigned as White House staff secretary after his two ex-wives came forward to say he had physically and verbally abused them. One of the women provided photographs of her injuries. Both said they’d reported their allegations to the FBI during a background check on Porter, who didn’t hold a security clearance.

Of Americans who followed the story at all, 51 percent say the allegations against Porter are credible, and just 5 percent that they’re not; the rest are unsure or say they haven’t heard enough to weigh in. A majority, 63 percent, say the allegations against Porter are disqualifying, with just 14 percent saying they aren’t. And a 43 percent plurality say that President Trump and other White House staffers didn’t react strongly enough to the accusations, with 24 percent saying the reaction was about right, and just 8 percent that the administration reacted too strongly. (Clinton voters were the most likely to say they were following the story, which perhaps helps to explain some of the results.)

The White House, which has struggled to offer a clear timeline of when senior staff found out about the allegations, initially defended Porter after the abuse allegations broke. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly described him in a statement as “a man of true integrity and honor,” before releasing a second statement in which he said he was “shocked” by the allegations and that there “is no place for domestic violence in our society.”

In his first comments on Porter’s resignation, President Trump said “it was very sad” to hear the news about Porter, but that “he says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that.”

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018

Among those who’ve followed the story, Clinton voters take the strongest line against Porter and the administration: 82 percent say the accusations against the former staffer are credible, 89 percent that they’re disqualifying, and three-quarters that the White House did not respond strongly enough.

Trump voters, are more tepid in their condemnation, but they aren’t exactly rallying around Porter either. Just 29 percent say the allegations against Porter are credible, but only 5 percent say they are not credible, with the rest declining to offer an opinion. And by a two-to-one margin, 44 percent to 22 percent, they say that Porter shouldn’t be able to hold a job in the Trump administration. Most, however, say they’re comfortable with the way the White House handled the story.

HuffPost

Just over half of all Americans, 51 percent, currently say that President Trump does not respect women, while just 30 percent say that he does. Eighty percent of Trump voters, but just 2 percent of Clinton voters, believe Trump respects women.

There are significant divides over the seriousness of domestic abuse as a national issue. The vast majority of the public, regardless of the gender or whom they voted for, say that it’s at least a somewhat serious problem. But women are 19 points likelier than men to say domestic abuse is a very serious issue, and Democrats are 18 points likelier than Republicans. The gap between Clinton and Trump voters is 36 points, making Clinton voters about twice as likely as Trump voters to say domestic abuse poses a very serious problem.

There are some differences by gender inside each voting bloc, as well. Female Clinton voters are 12 points likelier than male Clinton voters to say domestic abuse is a very serious problem, and female Trump voters are 24 points likelier to say so than are their male counterparts.

Let’s not tiptoe around it: Arie Luyendyk Jr. is not a popular Bachelor. A vocal contingent of fans hoped Peter Kraus, Rachel Lindsay’s runner-up, would have the gig, while many current viewers of the show barely remember Arie, if at all, from his appearance on “The Bachelorette” in 2012. Ratings are down. Arie has struggled to win over viewers.

So, sad as it is to say, there’s something baffling about watching a group of bright, cool women passionately compete for his attention ― and something perversely satisfying about watching one of them decide to put her own dreams first and walk away.

On Monday night, contestant Jacqueline Trumbull pulled a rare move by choosing to remove herself from consideration right before the pivotal hometown dates. (People who eliminate themselves typically do so earlier in the season, once they’ve decided they don’t have any chemistry with the lead.)

Chemistry certainly wasn’t the problem here. Jacqueline is clearly wildly attracted to Arie, and even as she told him she had to go, she couldn’t stop stroking his thigh or pausing to kiss him. Still, she says, she has doubts about whether they would really work ― especially since she has six years of graduate school in clinical psychology ahead of her, while he’s attached to his life in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Though the breakup looked tough, it was a canny move for Jacqueline. She didn’t seem like a frontrunner going into the final few episodes, and was probably headed for a rocky breakup, but she got to have it on her own terms ― and leave on her own schedule.

On HuffPost’s “Here to Make Friends,” we discussed all this and more with “Bachelor” and “Bachelor in Paradise” alum Caila Quinn:

Claire Fallon: [Jacqueline] tells him she’s had these moments of doubt and it makes her feel like she’s not the right person to take to hometowns. She’s not confident enough. And he’s sort of trying to persuade her to stay, which surprised me, because I didn’t see her being one of his top ladies.

Emma Gray: No. I think at the end of the day, they both realized from the last date, Arie definitely realized that their lives are incompatible. But what I took from this is that Arie has not been broken up with very much in his life.

Claire: It’s funny because every relationship we know about, really in detail, he has been broken up with ― like the woman who left him, and Emily.

Emma: That’s true. It just still read to me as though this was a foreign feeling to him or that he, like all of us, he likes to have control, and so the minute someone starts to pull away, you’re like “Wait, wait, wait, no.”

Claire: And that’s the thing, with Bekah M. he had the similar realization that it wasn’t going to work out, and then he gave himself some runway to deescalate his feelings for her without saying goodbye at a moment when he would be acutely upset by it. Then by the time he let her go, he was like, “I’ve thought about it, and I’ve distanced myself from you emotionally because it’s not going to work out.” With Jacqueline, she jumped the gun and―

Emma: She didn’t give him the space to make that decision.

Claire: Which, good for her.

Emma: Good for her! I love when women self-eliminate on this show. It’s extremely satisfying.

Caila Quinn: It’s also extremely hard. You think you’re not in control, but you really are, and it’s kind of representative of all women just not knowing that you can be in control of the situation too.

Claire: You can just remove yourself.

Emma: Especially when I assume you have producers in your ear being like, “Why don’t you give this another chance? Maybe this could work out. Maybe this is your person.” That takes a lot of internal strength to just say, “No, I’m going to go home.”

Claire: And you see why producers would do that, because as soon as she leaves, everyone else is like, “Well maybe I have doubts! Maybe I should leave.” It’s kind of infectious; it’s like how everyone gets divorced in a friend group at the same time. It’s not infectious, but also psychologically it really is.

Emma: Also the whole thing just reminded me of Sharleen. Very much. Where it was like, intellectually, she knew that this was never going to work, but she’s like, “I’m still really attracted to you and I want to make out with you.” And that’s real.

Caila: It was well thought-out. I think it was my favorite moment of the episode. And we just haven’t seen a real conversation of someone thinking through their emotions in the same depth. So, kudos to Jacqueline.

Claire: Yeah, it’s not common that someone has the wherewithal to really be like, “I don’t know what my feelings are. I don’t know if they’re related to the process or if they’re related to this guy.” She really thought it all through.

And Arie’s like, “I really like you, I don’t want this to be over. If you have any doubts, come back to me.” Which, like, we’re going into hometowns! What is he going to do if she comes back and is like, “Fantasy suites, I’m back!”

Emma: Then he’ll get to dump her, Claire, and that’ll be more satisfying for him.

Claire: Exactly. That’s really true.

I just feel like Jacqueline can do so much better.

Emma: Yeah. I also think she’s probably physically and mentally exhausted at this point.

Caila: Yeah, she’ll meet some great guy who will put her first. It’ll be fine.

Emma: And she won’t be tempted to move to Scottsdale and give up her schooling!

Claire: This is just always the weirdest part for me, when someone gets eliminated or leaves themselves, with really good reason, and they’re clearly incompatible, and just to see how much they still pedestal that person. She still thinks he’s so perfect and lovable. And I’m like, you’re going to take a month away from this, and you’re going to look back and be like ... him? But you know, the feelings are real in the moment.

Emma: Did you feel that way, Caila? Looking back?

Caila: I was just really sad, but then when you watch it back, you’re like, “Oh my goodness, his connection is so much stronger with other people ― why didn’t I see this in the first place?” And so I think she’ll look back and be really proud of herself.

For the full discussion on Episode 7, check out the full episode:A local news station in Chicago has apologized for running a graphic that was meant for a “satirical” news piece during its real coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday.

On Saturday, local ABC news station WLS-TV ran a graphic that read “P.F. Chang 2018” alongside an erroneous Olympics logo while covering the political climate surrounding the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Video posted to Mediaite shows that the graphic appeared on air for a few seconds before producers cut away to discuss tensions between South Korea and North Korea.

The Chicago Tribune reported that WLS-TV spokesperson Jayme Nicholas said the graphic was created for a satirical piece that aired on Friday, but it was used by mistake on Saturday morning.

Journalists and viewers ridiculed the screw-up on Twitter.

Taylor Swift fans have bad blood with Karlie Kloss.

The 25-year-old model and onetime Swift squad member was recently spotted dining in West Hollywood with Swift’s mortal enemy, fellow pop star Katy Perry. The two were a part of a larger group, including Vanity Fair writer (and Kloss’ BFF) Derek Blasberg.

Despite Kloss’ status as one of Swift’s close friends (remember that adorable road trip and shared Vogue cover?), being in the inner circle didn’t save Kloss from the wrath of millions of angry fans.

As soon as word (and photographic proof) got out that Perry and Kloss were together, Swifties started flooding Kloss’ Instagram account with rat emojis.

Just look at her Instagram right now:

Some are convinced that Kloss and Swift are no longer good friends. Back in August 2017, Swift apparently left the model’s name off of a shirt she wore in a music video that included all of her former squad members.

A few months later, Kloss Instagrammed and tweeted out a video with the caption “Swish Swish,” an apparent reference to Perry’s response track to Swift’s “Bad Blood.”

Neither Kloss or Swift have commented on the matter, though the model did send out this tweet amid all the dinner date drama:

The whole emoji feud is a bit like Kim Kardashian and TSwift’s “Famous” fight all over again. Back in 2016, Kardashian exposed Swift by releasing a recorded phone call after the singer claimed she didn’t approve Kanye West’s lyrics about her in his song “Famous.”

The reality star leaked Swift and West’s recorded phone call on her Snapchat account, which showed the singer’s conversation with West. Swift’s fans promptly trolled Kardashians social media accounts with rat emojis.

The beauty mogul’s loyal fans retaliated by flooding Swift’s social with snakes ― which eat rats for breakfast. It all came full circle when Swifties used the snakes against Kim K in 2017, after the release of Swift’s single “Look What You Made Me Do,” (which included a LOT of snake references).

It wasn’t just Austrian skier Matthias Mayer who ate snow when he wiped out at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Tuesday.

Mayer, 27, also sent at least one member of the media flying when he crashed out of the slalom leg of the men’s alpine combined downhill event in spectacular style, reports Yahoo.

Adam Rippon and Mirai Nagasu share a special bond. It’s about more than just being Olympians. It’s about more than their first Olympic medals, won this past weekend in the team event in PyeongChang. It’s deeper than that. And the emblems of it are matching tattoos.

In fact, it, and the tattoos, stem from missing out on the Olympics. Four years ago, both Rippon and Nagasu were left off the U.S. figure skating team for the 2014 Sochi Games. Nagasu was overlooked despite a third-place finish at the U.S. Championships.

Rippon remembers watching the Sochi Opening Ceremony a month later at Nagasu’s house, and commiserating over In-N-Out burgers. He told Yahoo Sports that story, as well as the one behind the tattoos, on Tuesday ahead of his individual event later this week.

“We sat on the roof,” he recalls. “And we were just kind of talking, we weren’t even watching the Olympics. We were just kind of crying a little bit, and eating [In-N-Out] double-doubles and animal-style fries.

“We were sitting up there, and we were laying back, we looked up at the sky and the stars, and we had a long talk. I remember telling her, ‘I’m so grateful you’re my friend.’”

Rippon says the moment is “still so poignant in my mind.” He says he told Nagasu, “We’ll be able to get through this.”

At some point, Rippon also proposed the idea of the tattoos.

“After everything that we went through four years ago, I said, ‘I want to have a matching tattoo with you,’” he recalls. “You pick what it is, and I’ll get whatever you want.”

Rippon says they joked about getting the Abercrombie moose. But eventually, Nagasu found a glyph – a circle with lines through it – that means “power.”

Rippon got his on his left thigh, just above his kneecap. Nagasu has hers near her wrist. Both are in white ink, as are the rest of Rippon’s tattoos – he says he has “seven or nine.”

“You can hide them pretty well,” Rippon says. “Not everybody can see them.”

But the two Olympic figure skaters, who are rooming together in PyeongChang, know they’re there, and that’s what matters. “It’s something really personal between me and her,” Rippon says. The tattoos strengthen the bond that was built throughout years of skating – and on Nagasu’s roof.

“There’s been a lot of ups and downs since then,” Rippon says. “To be here now, especially with her of all people, is crazy.It’s now officially illegal to perform so-called gay “conversion therapy” on minors in Maryland.

The Youth Mental Health Protection Act, which Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed into law Tuesday, threatens mental health or child care practitioners with disciplinary action if they are found attempting to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of anyone under the age of 18.

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said the new law makes Maryland “a better place for countless young people.”

“No child should ever be subjected to the abusive practice of so-called ‘conversion therapy,’” he said in a statement. “This dangerous and inhumane form of child abuse has no basis in science and is uniformly rejected by every major mental health and child welfare organization.”

A growing number of Republicans & Democrats alike are recognizing so-called "conversion therapy" for what it really is -- child abuse. Thanks to the many advocates, allies, parents, and survivors who fought to protect LGBTQ youth in Maryland! https://t.co/f2pza6E299 — Chad Griffin (@ChadHGriffin) May 15, 2018

The APA, in particular, criticizes gay conversion therapy, also known as reparative therapy, for offering a “serious potential to harm young people.”

“The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient,” according to the association, which says conversion therapy programs tell participants that “homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction.”
