Actress Allison Mack was charged with sex trafficking on Friday in connection with her alleged involvement in a secret cult in upstate New York.

The FBI arrested Mack in Brooklyn. She was scheduled to appear in federal court Friday, according to NBC New York.

She and Keith Raniere, who was arrested March 25 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, are both charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy.

The charges are in connection with their involvement in NXIVM (“Nexium”), a group started by Raniere that claims its mission is “to raise human awareness, foster an ethical humanitarian civilization, and celebrate what it means to be human.”

Authorities allege that Mack recruited women to join what she claimed was a female mentorship group called Jness.

However, she and Raniere are accused of exploiting the women who joined, both sexually and for their labor, according to BuzzFeed.

Authorities said the 35-year-old Mack was Raniere’s direct “slave” but also acted as “master” to other women in the group.

The members were not only forced to have sex with Raniere but have his initials branded into their pubic region with a cauterizing pen, according to the criminal complaint obtained by the New York Post.

During the branding, Mack allegedly told the women to “feel the pain” and to “think of [their] master,” the paper reported.

Mack allegedly cajoled her victims into posing for naked photos for Raniere, which were also used as blackmail.

In return for serving as Raniere’s pimp, investigators said, Mack received “financial and other benefits” from the cult leader, according to NBC New York.

One victim told investigators that Mack instructed her to meet Raniere in the middle of the night, authorities said. She did as instructed and was blindfolded. The woman told police she was tied to a table and forced to engage in oral sex with an unidentified person, according to the Albany Times-Union.

Mack has been involved with NXIVM for about a decade, after reportedly being recruited by fellow “Smallville” cast member, Kristin Kreuk.

Kreuk said she left the group before the alleged sex slave club began, and she denounced the group on Twitter late last month.

Mack was with the 57-year-old Raniere when he was arrested near Puerto Vallarta, according to the Times-Union.Reddit has an entire “Shower Thoughts” subreddit dedicated to “the miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.” In honor of those weird, wonderful and sometimes profound musings, here are 25 of the best posts from the last week:Tourists walk by the Fearless Girl statue in New York City on April 12, 2017.

The “Fearless Girl” statue, which faces Wall Street’s "Charging Bull” sculpture in lower Manhattan, is slated to be moved by the end of the year.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), in partnership with State Street Global Advisors, the management group that commissioned the statue, announced on Thursday that Fearless Girl will moved from its current location by the Bowling Green park to face the New York Stock Exchange. The move is due to safety concerns and pedestrian traffic, The New York Times reports.

“We are proud to be home to the Fearless Girl. She is a potent symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America ― and she will become a durable part of our city’s civic life,” de Blasio said. “This move to a new location will ensure that her message and impact will continue to be heard, as well as improve access for visitors.”

Fearless Girl, a bronze work sculpted by Kristen Visbal, stands in a narrow spot in a corner of Bowling Green. According to city officials, this creates a safety hazard due to the large number of tourists visiting the spot every day. Other officials expressed concerns that the mix of Fearless Girl, Charging Bull and the volume of pedestrians could attract an attack similar to last year’s in lower Manhattan, when a driver killed eight people.

“I am thrilled Fearless Girl will remain in New York, inspiring global collaboration between genders for better decisions, and an improved environment at every strata of society,” Visbal said in a statement.

De Blasio’s press secretary, Eric Phillips, said that Charging Bull ― a 1989 work by Arturo Di Modica ― will “almost certainly” be moved with Fearless Girl, although there’s no exact timeline.

Fearless Girl was erected in March 2017. Ron O’Hanley, State Street’s CEO, described the work as a call for companies to “increase gender diversity on their boards” and celebrate women leaders in business. However, in October, the Department of Labor alleged that State Street had paid women and black executives less than their white male counterparts. State Street disputed the Labor Department’s findings but agreed to pay a $5 million settlement over the claims.

Critics have accused Fearless Girl of being an empty symbol and an avatar of capitalism rather than of justice, but it’s been a hit with many people and has kicked off conversations about female empowerment in different workspaces.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) says a bill targeting sexual harassment on Capitol Hill is stuck because some senators don't like the idea of having to pay out of pocket if they harass or discriminate against their staff. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Two months ago, it looked like Congress was ready to crack down on its embarrassing problems with sexual harassment.

That’s when the House passed a bill to overhaul the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. Support for the bill was a no-brainer ― it passed unanimously, on a voice vote ― and it made badly needed updates, like banning sexual relationships between members of Congress and their staffers. It also eliminates a requirement that House staffers go through a 30-day counseling and mediation period before filing a workplace complaint.

But the bill has gone nowhere in the Senate since February, and nobody can say when or if similar legislation will move forward. The reason? Some senators don’t like the bill’s requirement that they would have to pay out of pocket if they are found personally liable for harassing or discriminating against employees.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who chairs the rules committee and is involved in negotiations on the bill, said Tuesday that the panel is “trying to come to a conclusion” on the bill.

Asked why it’s been so delayed, he carefully considered his words. “I think anytime you’re dealing with members’ personal liability, you ought to be sure that the members understand what they’re asked to vote on,” he said.

It speaks volumes about the Senate that it’s struggling to pass a bill to make it easier for Capitol Hill victims of sexual harassment or discrimination to file a complaint ― and that it’s because anonymous senators don’t want to have to personally pay for misconduct claims when they are found liable.

The Senate’s inaction comes after a string of lawmakers resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct, including Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) said in January that he won’t seek re-election after a former female aide said he lashed out at her after she rejected his romantic advances. Meehan called the aide his “soul mate.”

Congress clearly needs to deal with this. Four out of 10 female congressional aides believe sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill, according to a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey. The same survey found that 1 in 6 said they had been personally victimized.

Supporters of the Hill harassment bill thought the Senate would just tuck it into last month’s must-pass omnibus spending package and be done with it. But according to two senior Democratic aides familiar with negotiations on that package, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to roll the harassment bill into it unless they stripped out its provision requiring lawmakers to be personally liable.

“He wanted to do that in order to put it into the omnibus,” said one of the aides. “But [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi and [California Democratic Rep. Jackie] Speier objected to the change.”

McConnell spokesman Don Stewart denied that it was McConnell himself who had problems with that provision. He pointed to a statement previously issued by another McConnell spokesman, David Popp, who said, “Sen. McConnell supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.”

It’s unclear who, exactly, is opposed to this provision. But the Senate’s inaction is infuriating lawmakers in both parties who believe this should not be difficult.

“Stop giving us lip service and pass the bill.” - Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

Last month, all 22 female senators of both parties ripped McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for not making the bill a priority. On Thursday, every male Democratic senator ― plus Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who co-authored the Senate’s version of the harassment bill ― wrote to McConnell demanding action on the issue.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), who is the ranking Democrat on the rules committee and involved in negotiations on the bill, expressed optimism that senators would get some version of the bill out the door.

“We are continuing to push on this,” Klobuchar told HuffPost this week. “The letter that we had with all the women senators … I think that was really significant. Let’s just say, it got noticed.”

She said she’s hopeful a bill will be ready “in the next month or two.”

But the longer this bill hangs out there, the less clear it becomes what must-pass bill it can be attached to. And as it gets closer to the November elections, action in the Senate will significantly slow down. That could mean the bill gets delayed even further, or possibly lost in the shuffle of other matters.

Speier, the sponsor of the House bill, said if McConnell truly supports lawmakers paying out of pocket when they harass or discriminate against their staff, it makes no sense why he won’t give her bill a vote now.The attorney representing porn star Stormy Daniels said on Thursday that President Donald Trump may not be in the White House much longer.

“I’m going to make a prediction now,” Michael Avenatti told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace. “I do not think the president will serve out his term. I just don’t.”

Daniels claims to have had an affair with Trump in 2006, something the president has denied.

Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen has admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election as part of a nondisclosure agreement.

The FBI seized material from Cohen last week, setting off a chain of events that Avenatti predicted will be a disaster for Trump.

“This is a very, very serious matter for the president at this point. There’s no question that Michael Cohen knows where many, many bodies are buried,” he said. “They are going to turn him. And when they turn him, the president is going to be in a very, very bad place.”

Avenatti has previously predicted that Cohen will crack under pressure once he’s indicted and turn on Trump.

“I think Michael Cohen is going to fold like a cheap deck of cards on Mr. Trump, and the results are going to be very, very bad,” he warned last week.Rich Polk via Getty Images

Swedish DJ, artist, and producer Tim Bergling, better known as Avicii, has died at the age of 28.

“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” reads a statement from his representatives.

He was found dead in Muscat, Oman, on Friday afternoon local time, the statement said.

“The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.” The statement didn’t give a cause of death.

Avicii was known for hits like “Wake Me Up,” Hey Brother,” and “Levels.” He was nominated for Grammys for Best Dance Recording in 2011 and 2012, for the songs “Levels” and “Sunshine.”

The electronic dance music superstar shockingly announced his retirement from music in 2016 by posting a letter on his website that said he needed to “make the change that I’d been struggling with for a while.”

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Avicii had been dealing with health problems “including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking.” He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.

Avicii told the publication that he felt “happy” and “free” after announcing his retirement.

“I have my private life back and focusing on myself for the first time in a long time,” he said.

“This was obviously the hardest decision of my life so far. But so far it has paid off tremendously in terms of well-being for me. I’m happier than I have been in a very, very long time. Stress-free more than I have been in a very long time. I can’t say I’m never going to have a show again. I just don’t think I’m going to go back to the touring life.”

Avicii was quite philanthropic from a young age, partnering with his manager and executive producer Ash Pournouri in 2011 to create House for Hunger, a charity dedicated to alleviating global hunger. House for Hunger gave $1 million to Feeding America and helped fund Lauren Bush Lauren’s The Feed Foundation, which facilitated the distribution over 2 million school meals throughout Africa.A worksheet given to an eigth Roberto Livar

A charter school network has apologized for an assignment asking students to list the positive and negative aspects of slavery, calling the worksheet a “clear mistake.”

“To be clear, there is no debate about slavery,” Aaron Kindel, superintendent of Great Hearts Texas, said in a statement posted on Facebook Thursday. “It is immoral and a crime against humanity.”

On Wednesday, Roberto Livar posted a photo of a worksheet he said his son, Manu, was asked to complete in his eighth-grade American history class at Great Hearts Monte Vista in San Antonio. The worksheet is titled, “The Life of Slaves: A Balanced View.”

Livar told HuffPost that his son was uneasy about the nature of the assignment and felt compelled to bring it home and show his parents. Livar said he was “pissed” as soon as he saw the worksheet.

“We are fully aware that there is a concerted effort by the far-right nationally to reframe slavery as being ‘not that bad’ and trying to revise the civil war as being about ‘states rights’ and not about slavery,” he told HuffPost in a Facebook message. “We were concerned that this assignment fell in line with that ideology and were naturally concerned, as well as other parents.”

Other families and members of the community upset about the worksheet began sharing Livar’s post, including Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). Castro called the assignment “absolutely unacceptable” in a tweet on Thursday.

Kindel said in his statement that the incident was “limited to one teacher at just one campus,” and that the teacher has been put on leave while Great Hearts “collect[s] all the facts.” He added that Great Hearts will “conduct an audit” of the book that inspired the worksheet to see if it should be permanently replaced.

Livar told HuffPost that Great Hearts staff invited his family and other concerned parents to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the matter, and that Manu was “commended for his action of bringing this to light and was even told he was ‘very brave.’”

However, he noted that his son has been “attacked by many at his school” for supposedly harming its reputation.

Livar, who said he and his family are Mexican-American and identify as Chicano, chalked the whole ordeal up to a lack of diversity at the school among the student body and staff.

He added that he sees what happened as a sign of problems stemming beyond his son’s school.Jim Carrey is keeping his paintbrush busy.

The actor/artist unveiled his latest portrait on Twitter this week, offering two views of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney who’s at the center of a federal investigation.

The text surrounding the image refers to a threat Cohen once made to the media.

“I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting,” he told The Daily Beast in 2015. “You understand me?”

Carrey also posted another image that appears to be Cohen:

Over the past few months, Carrey has been painting not-very-flattering images of people close to Trump and posting them on Twitter. Earlier this week, he took on Fox News host ― and Cohen client ― Sean Hannity:

Carrey previously painted Hannity engaged in a pro wrestling match with Infowars host Alex Jones:

Martha and Bela Karolyi of the infamous Karolyi Ranch, an elite gymnastics training center that’s sent dozens of athletes to the Olympics, have finally broken their silence about former USA Gymnastics team doctor and convicted child molester Larry Nassar.

The two sat down with NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie for a “Dateline” segment set to air this Sunday. Several gymnasts claimed that Nassar, who’s been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment, abused them at the Karolyi Ranch in Hunstville, Texas.

“Any child who was violated by Nassar, it’s a crime and it’s so sad,” Martha Karolyi said, adding that it’s simply “awful.”

This is the first time the couple is speaking out since USA Gymnastics cut ties with the training facility in January. The Karolyi Ranch served as USA Gymnastics’ national team training center since 2001, and was the home for many elite American gymnasts including Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and Simone Biles. All three gymnasts, and several others, say Nassar sexually abused them at the training center.

“I heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this, and the parent couldn’t see,” Martha Karolyi said. “How I could see?”

Some parents did testify during Nassar’s sentencing hearings that they were in the room while the now-disgraced doctor abused their child. Nassar would often position himself in between the parent and child while he sexually abused them. Many also pointed to the institutional giants Nassar worked for, including USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, as the reason many parents blindly trusted him.

Bela Karolyi added his thoughts during the short segment, telling Guthrie: “The whole thing is just like an explosion, a bomb exploding. Boom.”

While it’s still unclear whether the Karolyis knew of Nassar’s abuse, dozens of athletes allege other forms of abuse took place at the ranch including verbal and emotional abuse, and limiting food intake of athletes during arduous training sessions.

National gymnastics champion and Nassar survivor Mattie Larson explained in her January victim impact statement how the isolation of the Karoyli Ranch fostered a culture that enabled a predator like Nassar.

“The complete detachment from the outside world, on top of careless and neglectful adults, made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers and molesters to thrive,” Larson said.

She later called out Martha: “Martha, did you keep Larry around because he was a good doctor? Or did you really keep him around because he let us compete when we were injured and was willing to keep your secrets?”President Donald Trump swiftly defended Tomi Lahren as an “outstanding and respected young woman” after the Fox News contributor said fellow diners at a restaurant pelted her with water and obscenities.

“Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, shortly after Lahren talked about her weekend experience at a Minneapolis restaurant on “Fox and Friends.”

Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2018

Video posted on social media shows Lahren getting heckled by diners at the restaurant, with some calling her a racist and yelling. As Lahren walks away, a woman appears to sling water at her back from a glass of water.

Lahren said the restaurant patrons’ behavior was “not something that I’m not used to,” and admitted it was embarrassing, especially with her mother there.

“You don’t have to like me, you don’t have to agree with my political opinions, but you don’t have the right to throw things at me,” she said. “But again, I’m tough, I can handle it.”

Comedian Kathy Griffin also stuck up for Lahren against those at the restaurant. She tweeted on Tuesday night that she “couldn’t disagree more” with Lahren, but she has a right to her views. “The first amendment is a beautiful thing,” Griffin added.

I couldn’t disagree more with @TomiLahren, but I don’t think it’s cool to resort to physical actions to make your point.

The 83-year-old revealed the encounter, which happened some 25 years ago, in an interview on “The Graham Norton Show,” which aired in the United Kingdom on Friday night.

Berry said she was worried about a trip to the U.S. to perform cookery demonstrations, so she weighed out all the ingredients, flour, sugar, and put them all in little plastic bags in advance, according to the Radio Times.

But when Berry arrived at the unnamed airport, she said, the sniffer dogs made a beeline for her and she was surrounded by uniformed people who arrested her and jailed her and her assistant in separate cells.

When an official asked her if she was going to make money from the packets, she replied, “I do and my fee has already been agreed,’” Berry jokingly added.

Berry has been lovingly dubbed a “national treasure” in the U.K. following her role as a judge on “The Great British Bake Off.” The show in the U.S. is called “The Great British Baking Show” and airs on PBS.

The show was broadcast on the BBC, with Mary Berry judging alongside baker Paul Hollywood, for seven series, from 2010 to 2016. Berry left her role when it moved to rival broadcaster Channel 4 in 2017. She’s now set to launch a new BBC series called “Britain’s Best Home Cook.”

The airline issued the payments after a Tuesday flight from New York City to Dallas was rocked by an engine explosion in midair, killing one passenger. The crippled jet made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.

In a letter accompanying the checks, Southwest said the payment was a goodwill gesture for the ordeal, CNN reported.

“We value you as our customer and hope you will allow us another opportunity to restore your confidence in Southwest as the airline you can count on for your travel needs,” the letter said, according to recipient Kamau Siwatu. “In this spirit, we are sending you a check in the amount of $5,000 to cover any of your immediate financial needs.”

Siwatu was among three aboard the flight to confirm receiving the letter. They also got a $1,000 voucher for travel on Southwest.

The company verified the report, telling HuffPost in an email on Friday: “Ours is a company and culture built on relationships. Many of the Customers on that flight have flown with us before. We can confirm the communication and gesture are authentic and heartfelt.” The airline declined further comment.

Aviation attorneys told USA Today on Thursday that passengers could likely collect millions of dollars in legal damages from Southwest.

Metal fatigue on a fan blade that snapped in the engine is suspected to be the culprit. Broken parts smashed into the fuselage, breaking a window, and a passenger who was partially sucked through the opening died from blunt impact.

Southwest had previously balked at the engine manufacturer’s recommendation for quicker inspections of the fan blades, The Associated Press reported.A bleak new study describes the profound damage that climate change has wreaked on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Rising temperatures in 2016 “cooked” swathes of corals, the scientists found, causing the catastrophic die-off of almost 30 percent of the world’s largest coral reef system.

Global warming has already radically — and possibly permanently — transformed the reef’s ecology, according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature. If action is not taken promptly and comprehensively to curb warming, it could be “game over” for the reef, scientists warned.

“It’s catastrophic,” Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a New South Wales-based climate researcher who was not involved in the new study, told Australia’s ABC News after reviewing the research. “There might have been a glimmer of hope that it wasn’t as bad or might recover faster than we thought. But this paper made the reality very present. The bleaching will forever change the Barrier Reef.”

The extent of the coral die-offs in 2016 — and another severe bleaching event in 2017 — had already been known to scientists, but the new research chronicled specifically how rising temperatures had affected different reef species and the reef’s ecological health at large.

The study’s authors said they were alarmed by their findings.

Though some coral species proved more resilient to rising temperatures, some died much more rapidly than expected.

“The conventional thinking is that after bleaching, corals died slowly of ... starvation. That’s not what we found. We were surprised that about half of the mortality we measured occurred very quickly,” Terry Hughes, the author’s lead author, told The Guardian.

Hughes said some corals, such as branching staghorn corals and table corals, had essentially been “cooked” to death by rising temperatures and had suffered staggering rates of mortality.

“There’s a small number of species that are very robust to heat stress and they’ve survived quite well. On the other hand, the so-called losers [had] mortality rates of 90 percent or more in the worst-affected portion of the reef,” Hughes told ABC News.

With coral bleaching events expected to become ever more frequent as global temperatures rise, populations of these “losers” could struggle to recover and continue to perish en masse. That could prove devastating to reef ecosystems, researchers said.

“Diverse coral communities are needed to have diverse fish and shrimp and crab and worms and all of the other species that live on reefs,” Mark Eakin, one of the study’s authors, told NPR. “So as these events continue into the future, we’re going to see much simpler coral reefs ... and if we don’t take care of the problem of human-caused climate change we’re going to lose a lot of the world’s coral reefs.”

As it stands, the makeup and mix of species of the Great Barrier Reef have already started to change. “That transition is already well underway,” said Hughes.

The study comes as the International Union for Conservation of Nature develops its new Red List of Ecosystems. Hughes said the new research should allow the Great Barrier Reef to be assessed by the IUCN. He said the reef as a whole would likely be classified as “endangered” under the new IUCN framework. This classification could help guide future conservation and governance efforts.South Korean soldiers stand guard at the Demilitarized Zone on April 11. The Korean War has never been formally ended, although an armistice agreement has existed since 1953. Officials have discussed an official peace treaty to change that.

South Korean officials have discussed ways to formally end the Korean War with their counterparts in the United States and North Korea, officials in Seoul confirmed this week.

The move comes amid thawing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and just days ahead of an April 27 meeting between North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and the South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Moon is expected to set the groundwork for Kim to abandon a contentious nuclear weapon program, something the North has said it was open to if certain security guarantees were met.

Diplomats have tried to forge a lasting peace treaty between the two countries for decades. The Korean War has never technically ended since it began in 1950, although a truce, called the Korean Armistice Agreement, was forged in 1953. That led to the creation of the Demilitarized Zone that divided the peninsula in two and effectively ended the conflict.

A permanent peace treaty would replace the armistice and would need to be signed by both Koreas, as well as by the United States and China, who were signatories to the original agreement after backing the two countries during the war.

Chung Eui-yong, the South’s national security adviser, said he had discussed such a treaty with U.S. national security adviser John Bolton ahead of President Donald Trump’s own meeting with Kim, expected to take place sometime in May or June, The New York Times reported.

“We held in-depth discussions on various ways of how to end hostilities and eventually establish a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, how to address the North Korean concerns and how to ensure a bright future for the North if it makes the right choice,” Chung said Wednesday, according to the Times. “Mr. Bolton made it clear to me that he will do his best as an honest broker in successfully implementing President Trump’s peace policy on the Korean Peninsula.”

Chung said he and Bolton had also discussed ways to appease the North’s demands for security and regime survival were the country to come to the negotiating table, according to the Korea JoongAng Daily.

China, a longtime ally of Pyongyang, has already signaled some support for the treaty but has not formally endorsed the idea, the Times reported. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said at a media briefing that the country’s “attitude is open and supportive to any peaceful means to resolve the Korean Peninsula issue through consultations.”

Activity around North Korea’s meeting with South Korea and the U.S. has rapidly picked up in recent days. CIA Director Mike Pompeo secretly met with Kim over the Easter weekend to prepare for talks with the U.S. Trump confirmed the encounter on Twitter this week, saying the meeting “went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed.”

“Denuclearization will be a great thing for the World, but also for North Korea!” he wrote.

Trump has expressed optimism ahead of the talks but has continued with some of his traditional bluster. On Wednesday he vowed to cancel the summit or “respectfully leave” it if the meeting “is not fruitful.”Hip-hop artists Farid Bang and Kollegah perform during the Echo Awards on April 12, 2018.

Mainstream manifestations of anti-Semitism are causing Germans to take a harder look at what is permissible in the name of artistic expression, after a rap duo whose lyrics some have interpreted as denigratory toward Holocaust victims won a major music award.

Farid Bang and Kollegah’s latest album, “Young, Brutal, Good Looking 3,” won an Echo award, Germany’s equivalent of the Grammys, on April 12 for best hip-hop album. Some of the lyrics on the album include the mention of bodies that are “more defined than an Auschwitz prisoner” and the warning that “I’m doing another Holocaust, coming with a Molotov cocktail.”

The two artists have apologized to those, including Holocaust survivor Esther Bejarano, who expressed outrage in the face of the lyrics. Bang said in a Facebook post that “the past cannot be forgotten” and he hopes something positive can emerge from the debate.

The music industry has responded with a series of disavowals.

BMG, the company that distributed the album, announced Thursday that it would donate 100,000 euros (about $124,000) to help fight anti-Semitism in German schools.

“Recent news reports have produced shocking evidence of a new wave of anti-Semitism in German schools,” CEO Hartwig Masuch said in a statement. “BMG is utterly opposed to anti-Semitism. We know our artists and employees are behind us. We want to ensure that something positive emerges from the debate surrounding the ECHO Awards.”

“We emphatically apologize to you and everyone else whose feelings were hurt by this,” Florian Druecke, chairman of Germany’s BVMI music industry association, said in a letter to Holocaust survivor Charlotte Knobloch.

Yet the group also defended its decision to ask the duo to perform during the awards given their popularity, stating that the debate around the lyrics “is an appeal to the industry to pay even more attention in the future and to take a closer look at the contents of the texts of published artists.”

Other artists have even taken a stand against the lyrics. Some Echo winners handed back their awards in protest. Campino, the lead singer of the country’s most prominent punk band, slammed the rappers in his own Echo acceptance speech.

“It crosses the line of acceptability when lyrics include misogynistic, homophobic, right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic insults,” he said.

The debate around the lyrics has pitted those defending self-expression against those decrying the overt and covert forms of anti-Semitism that have cropped up across Germany in recent years.

On Wednesday, German police were investigating an assault on two young men in Berlin wearing kippahs. It comes on the heels of a variety of reports that Jewish children are being bullied in German schools and subjected to name-calling. More than 1,400 anti-Semitic incidents were recorded in Germany in 2017 ― about four per day ― which represents a more than fivefold increase in the last seven years.

The uptick also comes at a time when views seem to be shifting to the right. Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, won enough votes in September to enter the country’s parliament for the first time. And the country’s Interior Ministry has said that the vast majority of anti-Semitic incidents are perpetrated by right-wing extremists.HAVANA (Reuters) ― Cuba’s new president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, began his term on Thursday with a promise to defend the socialist revolution led by the Castro brothers since 1959, giving a strident speech that also emphasized the need to modernize the island’s economy.

A stalwart of the ruling Communist Party, Diaz-Canel was sworn in to replace Raul Castro by the National Assembly in a new chapter for the Caribbean island but one that has been carefully managed and is aimed at preserving the political system.

“The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,” Diaz-Canel told the assembly in his first speech as president.

He delivered a long homage to 86-year-old Raul Castro, calling him the best student of his brother Fidel.

Fidel Castro, who led a band of rebels that overthrew a U.S.-backed dictator and then ruled for decades, handed over power to Raul Castro in 2008 as his health deteriorated. He died in 2016.

Raul Castro will retain considerable clout as he will remain head of the Communist Party until a congress in 2021. Diaz-Canel, 57, said Castro would remain the leader of the revolution and would be involved in major decisions.

He praised him as a fighter and for the reforms he ushered in during his decade as president.

His speech laid out a course for his five-year term, in which he will have to strike a balance between defending Cuba’s socialist system and reforming it enough to satisfy a young generation hungry for better economic conditions.

He confirmed expectations that the transition would not herald sweeping changes to one of the world’s last state-run economies and one-party systems, promising there would be no return to capitalism.

Diaz-Canel, who has risen the ranks of the Communist Party over three decades, said the new period would also be characterized by “modernization of the economic and social model.”

He said there would be no compromise in Cuba’s foreign policy, which is marked by volatile relations with the United States. In a repetition of a long-held stance by Havana, he said he would hold dialogue with anybody who treated Cuba as an equal.

Thursday’s session was held on the 57th anniversary of Cuba’s 1961 defeat of a CIA-backed Cuban exile invasion at the Bay of Pigs, a victory that Havana has long marked as a symbol of its resistance to “imperialist” pressure for change from Washington.

Of the 604 lawmakers present, 603 voted in favor of making Diaz-Canel president, marking a generational shift from the elderly leaders who fought to topple dictator Fulgencio Batista.

Castro listened from the front row of the assembly, rocking back and forth in his chair. At one moment he stood up, arms raised to thunderous applause.

For many Cubans, struggling with economic hardships and frustrated with the government’s emphasis on continuity rather than change, the transition in leader is seen as unlikely to bring much beyond the symbolism of a new leader.

“We always wish the symbolic would translate into real and concrete actions for our lives,” said Jose Jasan Nieves, 30, the editor of an alternative news outlet to the state-run media monopoly. “But this isn’t the case.”

Cubans hope the next government can revive one of the world’s last Soviet-style centrally planned economies, which has failed to improve under Castro’s limited market reforms.

Castro’s time in office will also be remembered for his landmark agreement with former U.S. President Barack Obama to restore long-severed diplomatic ties and seek an end to decades of hostilities between the two countries.

Relations have been strained again under President Donald Trump.Theatre director Serdar Somuncu speaks during a press conference Wednesday after local prosecutors began looking into the theater's offer of free tickets if patrons wear a swastika. FELIX KASTLE via Getty Images

Prosecutors declined to investigate a theater in Germany that’s offering free tickets to patrons who wear swastikas to a satirical play about Hitler’s youth.

Authorities in the southern city of Konstanz determined that the production is protected under artistic expression, rejecting criticism that the offer of free tickets violated German laws banning the production, distribution and display of Nazi symbols. The laws date back to 1945, when Allied forces in power after World War II banned the swastika. Even denying the Holocaust is punishable in Germany.

A representative of the public prosecutor’s office told The New York Times that, although they received many complaints and launched an initial probe, the office declined to investigate further since the situation was “clearly covered” and protected under artistic expression laws.

The theater will go ahead with its production of the farce “Mein Kampf,” written by Hungarian dramatist George Tabori in 1987, as planned on Friday ― Hitler’s birthday. Directed by well-known political satirist Serdar Somuncu, the show “begins with the ticket purchase,” according to the production’s website. Those who pay full price have the option to wear a Star of David “as a sign of solidarity with the victims of National Socialist tyranny.”

Those who opt for a free ticket must wear an armband with a swastika during the performance. The armbands will be given out at the entrance to the auditorium and must be returned after the show.

Daniel Morgenroth, spokesman for the theater, said in an interview that the ticket offer was meant to show the fragility of people’s convictions.

“This artistic impulse seeks to show how easily people are corrupted and can be made to wear the symbol of millionfold suffering for saving a few euros,” Morgenroth said.

“Art, if it wants to be relevant, has to be controversial sometimes,” he added.

Members of the Jewish Community of Konstanz argued the show is misusing Nazi symbols to prompt a political discussion, when such conversations could easily start without using the swastika. Group members also are offended the play is planned for Hitler’s birthday. The group has called for a boycott of the show, and asks that the Nazi symbols be removed and that the director engage in talks with the local Jewish community.

“We don’t believe the play or the theater or Serdar Somuncu are anti-Semitic. We just think what they did was not thought through thoroughly,” Arthur Bondarev, vice chairman of the Jewish Community of Konstanz, said in an interview. ″The people who this play concerns were not involved. Holocaust survivors, or at least the Jewish community, were not involved at all.”

The satire on Hitler’s attempts to make it as a young artist in Vienna has been in production since the late 1980s. No previous presentation of the play has included the use of swastika armbands or Stars of David.

“Now, no one is interested in the play, they are only concentrating on the ticket sale gimmick,” Bondarev said. “The only picture that will live on from the production will be of people wearing swastikas.”

The play occurs as anti-Semitism is growing in Germany and other parts of Europe. “Even though they didn’t intend it, they enhance these anti-Semitic structures when they misuse the symbol in this way,” Bondarev said.

Leaders in post-World War II Germany enacted laws banning Nazism and its corresponding symbols. The country also passed measures to safeguard freedoms that the dictator undermined, particularly artistic expression.

In addition to the well-documented Holocaust that is the hallmark of World War II, the Nazis confiscated roughly 16,000 pieces of what they deemed “degenerate art.” In July 1937, the party hosted two art shows in Munich ― one to exhibit art Hitler found acceptable, and another to show the works he deemed immoral. Many of the “degenerate” works were modern and abstract pieces. Works by Jewish artists were also considered “degenerate,” and many of the pieces from the show were burned.

Today, freedom of artistic expression is highly protected in Germany, while symbols of the Nazi era are strictly prohibited.

Still, critics argue that in spite of the legalities, using Nazi symbols in art is unjustified.UPDATE: April 20: Commonwealth leaders voted Friday to formally make Prince Charles the next head of the group of U.K.-affiliated nations.

Previously:

Queen Elizabeth II for the first time just publicly announced support for her son, Prince Charles, as her successor as leader of the Commonwealth. The role is not hereditary.

“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949,” the monarch said at the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.

“By continuing to treasure and reinvigorate our associations and activities, I believe we will secure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world for those who follow us,” the queen said.

“A world where the Commonwealth’s generosity of spirit can bring its gentle touch of healing and hope to all.”

The queen will continue to lead the Commonwealth, which consists of 53 countries, including former British colonies, until her death. Leaders from member countries will decide on Friday who will succeed the queen.

Earlier this week, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. supports Prince Charles as the next head of the Commonwealth.

“He has been a proud supporter of the Commonwealth for more than four decades and has spoken passionately about the organization’s unique diversity,” May’s spokesperson said, according to Reuters. “Succession is a matter for the Commonwealth as a whole to determine.”

At this week’s meetings in London and Windsor, Commonwealth leaders have discussed such topics as ocean conservation, cybersecurity, and trade, according to BBC.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has a curious relationship with facts. Saul Loeb / Getty Images

WASHINGTON ― White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says it bugs her when people accuse of her lying to the press.

“It certainly bothers me,” she told The New York Times in a Wednesday article. “Because one of the few things you have are your integrity and reputation.”

But Sanders has told lots of lies, and it’s not hard to give examples. PolitiFact cites four times the White House press secretary gave objectively false information.

She said in a November briefing that diversity visa immigrants are not vetted (false). She said in an October briefing that Chicago, which has high rates of gun-related crimes, has the toughest gun laws in the country (pants on fire!). She claimed in July that President Donald Trump has “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence” (false), despite videos showing otherwise. In March 2017 she said “multiple news outlets” reported that when he was president, Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump (false).

Some of the things Sanders has said are laughably untrue.

She insisted this month that the Trump administration is “committed to a free press” ― right after Trump hinted at stripping reporters of their credentials and claimed, once again, that mainstream news outlets critical of his presidency are “fake news.”

In May 2017, she claimed there was not “ever an attempt” to blame Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite a statement that week from then–press secretary Sean Spicer putting the blame squarely on Rosenstein.

In her defense, Sanders’ job sounds bananas. She has to provide accurate information given to her by a president who lies all the time. And in this White House, the level of chaos and turnover has been so high, it’s not hard to imagine that something that may be true in the morning is no longer true by that evening.

“There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying,” Sanders said in the Times piece.

But part of her dishonesty is in her unwillingness to acknowledge when the president has said something that just isn’t true.

When a reporter asked Sanders in October why Trump kept falsely saying that the U.S. is the highest-taxed nation in the world, she gave a hilariously nonsensical answer. In July, when Trump randomly criticized Rosenstein for being from Baltimore, even though he is from Philadelphia, Sanders couldn’t even admit that was wrong. She said Trump was making a “general statement.”

Reporters confronted Sanders earlier this month about why she falsely told them that Trump did not reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for $130,000 in hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels just before the November 2016 election.

“You said, on March 7, ‘There was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he’s denied all of these allegations,’” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the May 3 press briefing. “Were you lying to us at the time, or were you in the dark?”

Sanders said only that Trump still denies the allegations by Daniels.

“I gave you the best information that I had, and I’m going to continue to do my best to do that every single day,” she said.A commercial movie theater opened Wednesday in Saudi Arabia’s capital city of Riyadh ― ending a nearly 40-year ban on public cinemas in the deeply conservative country.

The theater, a converted concert hall, hosted a glitzy, invitation-only screening of the Marvel Studios film “Black Panther” attended by government officials and foreign dignitaries. Members of the general public will be able to purchase tickets on Thursday for Friday showings, according to Reuters.

The U.S.-based AMC Theatres operates the cinema. Earlier this month, the company announced it had signed a deal with the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, to open and operate up to 40 theaters in the country over the next five years.

Government censors will review movies before they’re shown at Saudi theaters. A kissing scene in “Black Panther” was reportedly cut from the film for Wednesday’s screening.

Men and women will generally be allowed to sit together in theaters, The Associated Press reports, though some screenings will be reserved for a male-only crowd. The country’s rules about gender segregation typically split customers into a men-only section and a “family” section reserved for women and their male relatives.

Saudi Arabian public movie theaters began shutting down in the late 1970s after the country adopted ultraconservative Islamic law. Saudi Arabia’s powerful conservative clerics claimed Western movies did not meet their hard-line interpretations of Islam.

The new push for theaters is part of a larger package of economic and social reforms being promoted by the country’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The government hopes the re-introduction of movie theaters will add more than $24 billion to the economy by 2030.

Saudia Arabians have long been able to watch Western television and films on their computers, phones and through satellite television. In recent years, the country has also hosted local film festivals and screenings in makeshift theaters. But in order to watch a movie at a theater with a public crowd, Saudi Arabians would have to travel to nearby countries like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

“This is a historic day for your country,” Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Entertainment, said at the “Black Panther” premiere. “It’s been about 37 years since you’ve been able to watch movies the way movies are meant to be watched in a theater, together on a big screen.”No one would know more about Gwen Stefani than Gwen Stefani herself, right?

Wrong.

On Wednesday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” the singer-songwriter went head-to-head with a superfan in a Stefani-themed quiz.

But the “Hollaback Girl” star somehow came off second-best …Cynthia Nixon broke down why celebrities becoming involved in politics wasn’t always such a bad thing on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.”

The “Sex and the City” star, who is challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo for New York governor in the state’s Democratic primary this year, agreed with host Stephen Colbert that having a former reality TV star in the form of Donald Trump in the Oval Office “is not working out very well.”

But there’s nothing “inherently wrong with celebrity in politics,” said Nixon.

“It gives you a platform, but it’s what you choose to do with that platform,” she added. “Do you choose to give yourself and other 1 percenters a massive tax break that they don’t need? Or do you choose to advocate for important things that need your voice, like LGBTQ equality or women’s health or women’s rights.”President Donald Trump derided California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) on Thursday after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen (right) had thanked Brown for agreeing to deploy National Guard troops to the state's border with Mexico.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump attacked California on Thursday for doing what he and his administration asked it to do: agreeing to deploy state National Guard members to help the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.

The president tweeted that California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) had agreed to send the troops to the border with Mexico “to do nothing.” He was referring to Brown’s commitment on Wednesday to dispatch 400 troops, as ordered by Trump, but with the caveat that they would not conduct immigration enforcement or build a wall. Trump said he wouldn’t fund “Brown’s charade.”

But if Brown’s order constitutes doing “nothing,” Trump would probably be disappointed to hear that National Guard troops being sent to the border by other states are not slated to directly participate in enforcing immigration laws or help build a wall, either.

Government officials told reporters in Washington on Monday that the guard members would be helping CBP in ways that don’t involve direct contact with unauthorized immigrants. They will instead be aiding with aerial surveillance, monitoring cameras, operating and maintaining equipment and other administrative tasks, the officials from CBP, the National Guard and the Department of Defense said.

None would be required to build border wall as of now, the officials said.

The potential deployment in California could be somewhat different. Brown demanded that his state’s troops focus solely on fighting criminal gangs, human trafficking and the smuggling of drugs and firearms. He turned down the administration’s initial terms for deploying the National Guard, Trump administration officials said Monday.

Brown said on Wednesday that the federal government had agreed to fund his plan for the troop deployment, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted her thanks to the governor that evening. She added that the deal’s final details were still being worked out.

Just spoke w @JerryBrownGov about deploying the @USNationalGuard in California. Final details are being worked out but we are looking forward to the support. Thank you Gov Brown! — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) April 19, 2018

The California National Guard’s tasks will include radio communications, operating surveillance cameras, planning, training, intelligence analysis, paralegal assistance and operating motor transport and heavy equipment, a DHS official said Friday. Those are similar to what other states’ National Guards will do to support CBP as of now.

The White House did not clarify whether Trump supported funding for other National Guard troops who won’t be directly involved with immigration enforcement.

Trump’s criticism of Brown and California comes after months of attacks on the state and its lawmakers over immigration. California is home to the nation’s largest population of undocumented immigrants, and has a so-called “sanctuary” law that limits police cooperation with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, although police do turn individuals over to the federal government in certain instances.

The president ordered the border deployment of National Guard troops earlier this month in response to an uptick in apprehensions at the boundary. Many of those arrested have been families and unaccompanied children seeking asylum or other relief in the U.S.If only this comedy disaster movie was real.

James Corden teamed up with “Spice Girl” Victoria Beckham and NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal to parody the cult classic “Sharknado” movie on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Late Show.”

Their spoof trailer for “Shaqnado” sees Corden and Beckham in a bizarre race against time to stop a tornado made of spinning Shaqs.

But do they succeed?
