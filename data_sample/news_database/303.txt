President Donald Trump on Tuesday night pledged to bring down the price of prescription drugs. You should take this pledge as seriously as you take any other policy pledge of his ― which is to say, you shouldn’t take it seriously.

Trump’s promise came about halfway into the State of the Union speech, and it was the most substantive thing he had to say on health care all night. (The Affordable Care Act, which was a primary focus of last year’s joint address to Congress, got barely any mention at all.)

“One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs,” Trump said. “In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.”

Trump is absolutely right that consumers in other countries pay less for their drugs. And, although he didn’t say it, those lower prices are a big reason why, compared with Americans, people in foreign countries are less likely to miss out on recommended care or to have serious financial problems because of medical bills.

But consumers in those other countries face lower prices because those countries have very different health care policies in place. In those countries, everybody (or nearly everybody) has health insurance, and the benefits are, on the whole, more generous.

And in those countries, governments negotiate directly with drugmakers about prices. And “negotiate” means demanding discounts and excluding high-priced drugs, if that’s clinically possible.

Plenty of policymakers, most of them Democrats, would like to adopt similar approaches here, either by bolstering the Affordable Care Act or even replacing it with a European-style system (or at least by giving the federal government the bargaining power European governments have).

This is not at all what Trump has in mind. As a presidential candidate, Trump spoke frequently about universal coverage and bringing down drug prices in no small part because both ideas are popular.

But, as president, Trump has outsourced health care policy to the Republican majority in Congress. The GOP’s agenda consists of repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it (if at all) with a program that offers less-generous benefits. For those who lose insurance, prescription drugs become even more expensive.

As for direct negotiation of drug prices, Republicans want nothing to do with that. (Plenty of Democrats don’t either, by the way.)

There are intellectually defensible arguments for the GOP majority’s view. On the question of negotiation of drug prices in particular, plenty of serious people worry what it would mean for innovation or the availability of expensive but important medications.

And there are other ideas out there ― some supported by Republicans, some supported by Democrats, some supported by both ― with genuine promise for reducing drug prices, at least on the margins. Some involve restructuring the patent system, for example, while others would reexamine the role of intermediary companies that negotiate prices on behalf of health plans. (Dylan Matthews of Vox discussed these in detail the other day.)

But Trump has shown little interest in considering these proposals, let alone turning some of them into an administration priority.

And rather than getting tough with the pharmaceutical industry, as he promised (and still promises) to do, he appointed Alex Azar, a former executive at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Azar, though widely considered capable, is not the person you appoint to run HHS if you’re going to war with Big Pharma.

“Nothing like sweeping action to curb drug prices is under discussion and the industry probably will not view the subjects of the Trump discussions … negatively,” one drug industry analyst told Politico in June.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has repeatedly said, falsely, that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act he signed into law last month is the biggest tax cut in American history.

Fact-checkers have repeatedly said he’s wrong, and yet, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump persisted.

“Just as I promised the American People from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history,” Trump told a joint session of Congress.

On paper, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act costs $1.5 trillion over 10 years, though it will cost about $2 trillion if lawmakers prevent the expiration of individual tax cuts scheduled for 2025. But even if they do that, it still won’t be the biggest cut in history.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which opposed the tax bill because it will widen federal budget deficits, has estimated that for the Trump tax cut to be the biggest ― in terms of its size relative to gross domestic product ― it would need to reduce revenue by $6.8 trillion. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act currently ranks as the eighth biggest by that measure, and fourth biggest according to how many dollars it costs the Treasury.

Trump could maybe claim that by saying “biggest tax cuts and reforms,” he’s not simply lying about the scale of the new tax law. Some of the bigger tax cuts on the list, including two signed into law by former President Barack Obama, simply cut taxes without making changes to the structure of the federal tax code as major as the ones in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to HuffPOst’s request for comment.

While Trump’s tax cut may not be the biggest in history, it’s probably the most divisive. Republicans rushed the bill through Congress without a single Democratic vote. Democratic lawmakers in the California State Legislature are trying to subvert the tax bill’s limit on deductions for state and local taxes, while the Democratic governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are threatening a long-shot lawsuit over the provision.

Trump also touted recent bonuses that several large companies have said they’re giving workers because of the tax bill.

“Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses ― many of them thousands of dollars per worker,” Trump said.

Trump was apparently citing a Republican tally of announcements by more than 200 companies employing approximately that many people, which is about 1.8 percent of the U.S. labor force.

Though the bonus announcements have garnered massive press attention, the payouts so far represent a tiny fraction of the tax savings companies expect from the tax reform. HuffPost’s parent company Verizon, for instance, said it would dole out more than $400 million worth of stock awards to its employees, and stands to save as much as $4 billion in taxes.

The White House previously estimated that corporate tax cuts would eventually boost workers’ earnings by at least $4,000 annually, a figure Trump cited during his speech. The higher pay would come about thanks to increased business investment that makes workers more productive, not bonuses, though most economists think the $4,000 figure is unrealistic.

Trump didn’t repeat past claims that the new tax law would benefit the middle class and not the rich. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has estimated the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers would see the largest percentage increase in after-tax income under the law.

The president capped the tax portion of his speech with a note of optimism, as though he’d fulfilled a campaign promise to make supporters’ wildest dreams come true.

“If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything,” he said.A women’s rights group used the occasion of Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address to bring renewed attention to allegations of sexual assault against the president.

UltraViolet, an organization aimed at fighting sexism in politics, media and pop culture, projected a message onto Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday evening, just hours before the president was scheduled to deliver his remarks.

In its message, the group urged Congress to investigate allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Trump.

“Donald Trump harassed or assaulted twenty women. Congress: Investigate Trump,” the message read.

Twenty-one women have accused the president of sexual misconduct. The allegations range from lewd comments to rape and span more than three decades.

Trump has denied the allegations, and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested in October that all of Trump’s accusers were lying.

In a statement, UltraViolet Chief Campaigns Officer Karin Roland referred to the wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations that have been made against powerful men in multiple industries in recent months, giving rise to the #MeToo movement. She noted the heightened urgency of these claims as survivors have stepped up to share their stories and dozens of men in positions of authority have been held accountable.

Roland argued the same should be true of the president.

“It is impossible for us to tackle the nation’s sexual assault and harassment epidemic when the man who occupies our highest office is facing no accountability for the scores of sexual abuse accusations mounted against him,” Roland said.

The message called attention to allegations of sexual assault against Trump ahead of his State of the Union address. UltraViolet

Several Democratic lawmakers also announced plans to highlight sexual assault at the State of the Union in the days and weeks leading up the address.

A group of lawmakers with the Democratic Women’s Working Group, including Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), said they would wear black to the event in solidarity with victims of sexual harassment and abuse. Some also planned to bring sexual assault survivors or activists as their guests to the address.

“I have never seen such an extraordinary opportunity to change the culture of society in my lifetime,” Speier told HuffPost. “I will use every opportunity to underscore how important it is for us to stay on this issue and clean up the mess that has been impacting women in the workforce for decades.”When rapper Young Dolph says to “get paid,” he actually means it.

The musician handed over $20,000 to two Duke University students fired from their barista jobs for playing Dolph’s song “Get Paid” in a campus coffee shop.

Dolph heard about last week’s firings and flew both ex-baristas to his May 11 performance at Miami’s Rolling Loud festival for a special surprise. Midway through his set, he invited Britni Brown and Kevin Simmons on stage and gifted them with $20,000.

“So check this out, this what we gon’ do. I know for a fact that the VP at that school get money, but he don’t get money like Dolph,” said the rapper.

“So until y’all get a new job, I got $20,000 for y’all right now.”

It’s unclear if he gave each $20,000, or whether that was the total amount of the gift.

Brown and Simmons were working the Joe Van Gogh coffee shop on Duke’s Durham, North Carolina, campus last week when Larry Moneta, the school’s vice president of student affairs, complained that Dolph’s 2016 song was playing in the shop. Neither student specifically selected the song, and said it was on a playlist they picked earlier in the day.

Brown told local news site Indy Week that when Moneta complained, she immediately turned the song off and offered him a free muffin.

Moneta’s complaints reached the director of Duke’s dining services, who told Robbie Roberts, owner of theJoe Van Gogh chain of coffee shops. The students were booted from their jobs on Monday.

News of the firings sparked mass protests on the campus, and word spread to Young Dolph, who mentioned the uproar on Twitter:

Whoever that VP is, he don’t give a dam about nobody but his self... I guess he was trying to teach the students how to be selfish I guess......... smh🤦🏽‍♂️ 👎🏾 — its DOLPHHHHHH! (@YoungDolph) May 9, 2018

After the backlash, both Roberts and Moneta apologized.

“It was never my intent that any of the Joe Van Gogh employees be terminated, said Moneta, according to Newsweek. “I felt and still feel that the choice of music for the venue was inappropriate, but if my actions in any way lead to their dismissal, I apologize and hope that the JVG management consider ways to reinstate their employment with the company.”

Roberts wrote on Joe Van Gogh’s blog that the store “apologizes to our employees, customers and community for how we handled a situation involving our Duke University store.”

“We attempted to understand Duke’s position in this case, but we should have taken a different approach in making personnel decisions. As the owner of the business, I take full responsibility for Joe Van Gogh’s actions. I apologize to all of the people directly involved and those who have been touched or offended, of which there are many. We are taking steps to remedy this matter, but all company personnel issues are private and will remain private. Again, my truly sincere apologies.”

Roberts said on Friday that his coffee shop chain was cutting ties with Duke.

“Effective immediately, I have decided to cut my company’s ties with Duke University. I believe it’s the right thing to do to preserve Joe Van Gogh’s brand independence without conditions,” Roberts said in a statement to the Duke Chronicle.A little more than a year after painting a picture of “American carnage” and “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones,” President Donald Trump has turned a rhetorical corner, taking a dramatic turn toward optimism.

“A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land,” Trump said in his first formal State of the Union address Tuesday night ― which, like most of his predecessors’ speeches, attracted a largely friendly audience. “Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.”

Economically speaking, the mood of the American public is largely keeping step. But there’s little public perception of a rising tide of goodwill about the nation’s political unity or its standing abroad — and even less enthusiasm for Trump himself, whose approval rating remains historically low.

On the economy, nearly 70 percent of Americans say they’re satisfied, a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found, the highest level since the dot-com boom. Most expect the economy to stay the same or further improve. As in previous years, however, a majority also say that the stock market performance is “an indication that corporations and the wealthy are doing better, but not necessarily the economy overall,” that survey found.

And despite their positive economic views, “three in four Americans say the country is divided, six in 10 don’t have much confidence in the U.S. political system and six in 10 say racial tensions have increased,” CBS’ polling team wrote earlier this month.

Just 36 percent of Americans, according to one January poll, think the United States is “mostly winning at the things it tries to do.” That poll found half of the public optimistic about the next three years, down from 56 percent when Trump was inaugurated; Quinnipiac, which asks a similar question, has found that voters’ pessimism about Trump’s presidency has outstripped optimism since last May.

Trump also called for compromise. “Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences,” Trump said Tuesday, “to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.”

“As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home,” Trump said, “we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.”

Americans aren’t so sure of that. Two-thirds think that leaders of other countries “don’t have much respect” for the president, and for the first time in years, a majority now believe the nation is viewed unfavorably in the eyes of the world. They’re right: Global approval of U.S. leadership stands at just 30 percent, down 18 percentage points in a year to its lowest point in the past decade.

One other polling number suggests rising hopefulness: The share of Americans who expect 2018 to be better than 2017 outstrips the share who thought that 2017 would be better than 2016. Unfortunately for Trump, that shift was driven mostly by Democrats ― many of whom say that what they’re looking forward to is the midterms congressional elections.WASHINGTON ― The Justice Department will not retry Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) on corruption-related charges, federal prosecutors indicated Wednesday in a court filing.

Menendez’s trial last year resulted in a hung jury, and a federal judge acquitted the New Jersey Democrat and his friend Salomon Melgen on several charges last week.

“Given the impact of the Court’s Jan. 24 Order on the charges and the evidence admissible in a retrial, the United States has determined that it will not retry the defendants on the remaining charges,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said in a statement.

In a statement sent to HuffPost, Menendez attorney Abbe Lowell said he was “pleased and grateful that the Justice Department made the right decision to end this case.”

“Despite the five years of this ordeal, Senator Menendez never wavered in his innocence and his commitment to the people of New Jersey,” Lowell said. “We were fortunate to be able to assist this honorable man.”

In his speech, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) didn’t bring up global warming, sea-level rise or the surge in global greenhouse gas emissions, which threaten to become worse as the Republican White House ramps up fossil fuel production to unprecedented levels.

The 37-year-old former prosecutor and grandson of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who was assassinated in 1968, lamented the Trump administration’s “all-out war on environmental protection,” made a passing reference to a “coal miner” and lionized Americans with the courage to “wade through floodwaters, battle hurricanes, and brave wildfires and mudslides to save a stranger.”

Yet, like Trump, the Democrat neglected critical milestones in the climate crisis in his speech. Last year marked the world’s second-hottest year on record. The U.S. racked up a record $306 billion in climate-related damages. And fossil fuel emissions hit an all-time high as the rate of carbon dioxide pollution began increasing for the first time in three years.

Drew Hammill, a Democratic spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This comes against the backdrop of Trump dismantling U.S. policies to reduce greenhouse gases and slashing funding for research. The president, who has long mocked scientists’ warnings on climate change, announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, which has been signed by every other nation on Earth. In October, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the federal government’s only major policy to reduce emissions.

In his inaugural State of the Union address, Trump declared an end to a “war on American energy.” He took credit for the boost in fossil fuel exports that began under President Barack Obama, and he celebrated the end of a “war on beautiful, clean coal,” a bizarre statement at odds with the continued closures of coal-fired plants and the high-profile failure of a carbon-capture coal plant last year. The president noted “floods and fires and storms,” but did not mention the overwhelming scientific consensus that a warming planet has made the weather events worse.

The GOP remains the only major political party in the developed world to oppose the widely accepted science behind manmade global warming as a platform issue. Yet Democrats’ criticism has focused more on their opponents’ climate denialism than on policies to drastically curb emissions, leaving the party without any grand vision to address what they routinely call the greatest environmental challenge of a lifetime. A tax on carbon ― the policy proposed by Reagan-era economists and nominally supported by Big Oil ― remains the foremost idea on the table.

“How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?” - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Kennedy’s dynastic roots and impassioned speeches defending health care laws have made him a rising star in the party. While he isn’t known for his environmental stances, he earned a 96 percent lifetime score on the League of Conservation Voters’ ranking.

Even the State of the Union statement issued by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), considered one of the most hawkish Democrats on climate issues, snubbed climate change. He did, however, rail against the Trump administration’s plans to open nearly all federal waters to oil and gas exploration, nothing that the proposal put “the local commercial fishing industry and the Ocean State’s coastal economy in harm’s way.”

By contrast, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pointedly skewered Trump for ignoring climate change.

“How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?” he said in his own rebuttal. “No, Mr. Trump, climate change is not a ‘hoax.’

“It is a reality which is causing devastating harm all over our country and all over the world, and you are dead wrong when you appoint administrators at the EPA and other agencies who are trying to decimate environmental protection rules and slow down the transition to sustainable energy.”WASHINGTON ― Last January, in his first primetime State of the Union-style address to Congress, the newly elected President Donald Trump pledged to launch a “national rebuilding” program the likes of which had not been seen since the days of Dwight Eisenhower. The initiative, he promised, would upgrade the nation’s crumbling infrastructure with new roads, bridges, tunnels and railways, “gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.”

Nearly a year later, after many bitter fights over Obamacare, taxes and immigration, Trump hasn’t made any progress on fulfilling that infrastructure promise. His administration is expected to release its long-delayed proposal in the coming weeks. Based on the details leaked so far, it will likely fall short of the ambitious $1 trillion plan he described on the campaign trail.

“America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?” Trump asked Tuesday in his first State of the Union address to Congress.

Trump also called for “at least 1.5 trillion in investment,” more than he initially proposed, a remark that received tepid applause from Republican lawmakers.

The American Society of Civil Engineers estimated last year that the U.S. needs to invest $4.59 trillion in infrastructure by 2025. Federal spending on new infrastructure, however, has remained flat in recent years. The popular Highway Trust Fund, which helps pay for the nation’s roads, bridges and transit systems, is losing money when adjusted for inflation.

Trump’s latest plan will seek to leverage $200 billion in direct federal spending into an additional $800 billion in infrastructure investment from states, cities, nonprofits and the private sector. The plan puts a greater onus on state and local officials to find additional revenue to fund the projects, which will likely mean allowing more tolls or usage fees to create revenue streams that lure in private investors. The challenge is especially difficult for communities in rural areas ― many of which supported Trump in 2016 ― where fewer people are available to help spread the cost of new infrastructure.

According to a leaked draft of Trump’s infrastructure proposal, 50 percent of the total outlay in federal dollars ― $100 billion ― will be used to encourage “state, local and private investment in core infrastructure by providing incentives in the form of grants.” Rural projects will receive another 25 percent of the total share of funding ― $50 billion ― while the remainder will go to existing loan programs and “transformative projects” like high-speed rail.

The biggest question mark about the proposal is how it is to be financed. Rather than creating new sources of revenue ― like a moderate increase in the gas tax, which is backed by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce but fiercely opposed by Republicans in Congress ― White House infrastructure adviser D.J. Gribbin suggested last week that the administration would support “repurposing” funding from other transportation programs like Amtrak or the Highway Trust Fund.

The Trump administration’s 2018 fiscal year budget proposed deep cuts to the Transportation Department, Amtrak, mass transit and the Army Corps of Engineers’ civil works programs. It would also completely eliminate the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) initiative, a grant program popular among cities and states across the country that was set up by the Obama administration’s 2009 economic stimulus package.

“There are reductions, as you know, in last year’s budget when it comes to Amtrak, when it comes to transit, when it comes to a number of programs,” Gribbin said last week at the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting. “We will propose repurposing those dollars. What we’re not proposing is, you know, eliminating the Highway Trust Fund or eliminating state revolving funds. So the major delivery mechanisms for funding infrastructure should remain in place. We do want to repurpose some dollars.”

Congress will ultimately decide whether to enact the cuts proposed by the White House. But for now, lawmakers face another looming deadline to fund the government by Feb. 8, and they’re expected to do so with another stop-gap measure.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities cautioned on Tuesday that shuffling funds from existing transportation programs to help pay for Trump’s infrastructure plan would amount to a “bait and switch.” The progressive think tank said it would mean financing “a high-profile new initiative with one hand while taking away important funding from infrastructure with the other.”

Moreover, the benefits of new infrastructure development for the country may also be offset by a significant repeal of environmental protections. According to a leaked draft obtained by The Washington Post, the Trump administration is planning on gutting environmental requirements in order to make it easier to construct roads, bridges and pipelines. The move follows Trump’s promises to fix what he has called the “badly broken” process for garnering the permits to build infrastructure.

Democrats and activists see the planned rollback of environmental regulations in the infrastructure plan as part of a broader attack on the environment. The Trump administration has already sought to reverse more than 60 environmental rules, including those relating to flood building standards, bans on pesticides, methane reporting, greenhouse gases, offshore drilling, protections for wild animals, sewage treatment, fracking and train safety, according to an analysis by The New York Times.

“When the administration and its Republican allies in Congress use terms like ‘streamlining’ and ‘permitting reform,’ what they are really saying is that they want to eliminate clean air and water safeguards and cut public participation when important decisions are made,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement. “We can’t let that happen.”

After the president’s State of the Union address ended, lawmakers from both parties expressed concern about how the administration planned to pay for the proposal.

“This is an issue where the details matter,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said. “The total amount of the spend, how it’s paid for, what the elements of the bill are, are critically important.”

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va), a red state Democrat who is up for re-election this year, echoed the sentiment.The USDA rejected a petition from the poultry industry to allow plants to ramp up line speeds. The change could have jeopardized worker safety and caused food safety issues. Brusonja via Getty Images

Apparently not all regulated industries are getting what they want out of the Trump White House.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it was rejecting a petition from the poultry industry that would have allowed chicken slaughterhouses to ramp up line speeds. That USDA decision came just two weeks after the government agency proposed a rule that would allow hog plants to do away entirely with maximum line speeds.

The poultry proposal came under heavy fire from consumer and work safety advocates, who argued that lifting the speed caps in slaughterhouses could endanger employees and the public because it would require faster work and less time for food safety inspections.

Poultry workers and their allies even protested outside USDA headquarters recently while wearing diapers ― a nod to the fact that some plant workers say the pace is so unrelenting they don’t have enough time to use the bathroom.

Those groups are now celebrating a rare regulatory victory under the Trump administration. In a letter to the poultry lobby on Tuesday, the USDA said it was not convinced that lifting the line speeds would be safe. Most plants have a maximum line speed of 140 birds per minute under USDA rules. The National Chicken Council wanted to eliminate maximum line speeds altogether for plants willing to take part in an updated inspection program.

The speedup would have applied to the zone in poultry plants known as the evisceration section ― the place where the organs are removed from the bird.

But safety advocates argued that if more birds are being sent down the evisceration line, then the extra work would spill over into other parts of the plant, too, like the “live hang” section where birds are prepped for killing.

The maximum line speeds are supposed to allow USDA inspectors adequate time to visually examine and flag any problematic birds that need to be pulled off the line. USDA inspectors, who analyze each carcass that comes down the line, are tasked with identifying diseased birds. They also examine the birds whose feathers and intestines have already been removed for any visible fecal matter. If the line moves too fast, the worry is that a contaminated bird will make it past inspectors and potentially wind up in the food supply.

“We established the [maximum] line speeds because that’s the rate at which we can verify the safety of the product,” Carmen Rottenberg, deputy administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at USDA, told HuffPost. “Line speeds are set up for that purpose.” Rottenberg added that it’s not up to her agency to account for worker safety issues and that it predominantly focuses on food safety concerns.

There are 20 plants that can already operate at a higher line speed ― up to 175 birds per minute, rather than 140 ― as part of a USDA pilot program. Rottenberg said other plants could seek the same waiver, and those applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis.

The agency is also considering allowing faster line speeds in pork processing plants. Worker safety groups have criticized that proposal as well. They hailed the USDA’s decision to reject the proposal for poultry plants as a step in the right direction.

“It’s a stunning rebuke to an industry whose business model is to increase profits by sacrificing worker safety and health,” said Debbie Berkowitz, an occupational safety expert at the National Employment Law Project, which campaigned against the proposal. “The nation’s poultry workers are a lot safer for it, as well as consumers.”

The poultry industry has argued that the speed caps should be loosened. The inspectors are looking for fecal matter or blemishes that might indicate a problem with a bird, but the industry says that visual inspections don’t help identify invisible risks like salmonella. The National Chicken Council, a leading lobbying group for the poultry industry, proposed that those caps be waived altogether for plants that have opted into a revamped inspection process that was developed by the USDA.

Under the industry plan, if a plant has already adapted to the USDA’s new inspection guidelines, its line speeds should be as fast as they want.

Poultry workers protested outside of the USDA's offices recently to decry the hazardous conditions they say they face in plants. Some wore diapers to signify the relentless conditions, and how they often don't even have enough time to go to the bathroom. United Food and Commercial Workers

Although the line speed limits are set for food safety purposes, worker advocates say they serve another important function: keeping the work pace in check. Poultry processing is a notoriously grueling and often low-paying job, often filled by refugees and immigrants. In 2010, about one-third of workers in poultry plants were made up of foreign workers, the Los Angeles Times reported last year.

While injury rates in the poultry slaughtering and processing industry declined from 2004 to 2013, according to a 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, many work-related injuries and illnesses often go unreported. Many workers are reluctant to come forward because they fear losing their jobs, and employers may underreport these cases because of concerns surrounding costs.

Amputations are not uncommon in slaughterhouses, and many workers suffer from carpal-tunnel syndrome, nerve conditions, musculoskeletal disorders, and other repetitive motion-related ailments. Plus, there’s exposure to chemicals and pathogens. Workers in poultry plants face the same hazardous risks today that they did back in 2005, according to the GAO.

In short, critics of the industry’s proposal said poultry lines already move too fast ― speeding them up would make these jobs even more hazardous.

One of the most vocal opponents of removing the line speed caps was the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents 70,000 poultry workers in the U.S. The union called the USDA’s decision to reject the petition “a victory for hard-working poultry workers who hold one of the most dangerous and difficult jobs in America.”

“It was unbelievable to see major poultry industry groups ignore these well-known risks and lobby the USDA to eliminate line speeds,” said Marc Perrone, the union’s president.

When the USDA said last year it would consider the industry’s petition, the loosening of the line speeds seemed very likely. Not only has the Trump administration been taking an ax to labor and environmental rules, but both Democrats and Republicans have targeted this particular regulation in the past.

USDA officials under President Barack Obama proposed allowing higher line speeds in poultry plants in 2014, prompting a backlash from worker and consumer groups that were normally on the Democrats’ side. The agency eventually shelved that plan for the remainder of Obama’s presidency, though critics expected it to be revived under the Trump administration.

Even though the USDA turned down the poultry industry’s request, the agency is still considering lifting line speed caps in hog processing plants.

Under a proposal floated earlier this month, the USDA would take some of the inspection responsibilities from government workers in pork plants and shift them to plant employees. The latter would be responsible for identifying and removing sickly hogs, freeing up USDA inspectors to focus on food safety issues off the processing line, like microbial testing. The USDA has called it an inspection “modernization” plan.

If a plant opts into this new system, the typical speed limit ― currently 1,106 hogs per hour ― would be waived. In theory, the plant could then process hogs as fast as it wanted, so long as unfit animals were still culled from the line.

The same groups that opposed lifting the line speeds in poultry plants have come out in opposition to the plan for hog plants, saying it would pose the same dangers to health and safety. The USDA said it will put the plan up for a 60-day period of public comment.WASHINGTON — She was the silent one at the edge of the table, a woman in a gray suit with a red pin emblazoned with her aunt’s name: Recy.

This was Rose Gunter, the niece of Recy Taylor, who died in December. The pin was courtesy of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat whose office had a couple hundred of the pins produced.

“Recy” doesn’t have the same cachet as “MeToo” or “TimesUp.” “Recy” isn’t a movement or a cause, at least not yet. “Recy” is just a reminder of how particularly vulnerable black women are to sexual assault and of how little they have figured thus far into the broader culture’s reckoning with misogyny in all its manifestations. It’s an unfamiliar name on a button, reminding you to Google it later on.

We were at a dinner Monday night in the back corner of Acadiana, a swanky Creole eatery in Northwest D.C. The event was organized by Watson Coleman, on whose invitation Gunter would be attending President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address. Sitting around a table covered with oysters, deviled eggs and biscuits were six women who are highly respected in their fields: Fatima Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center; Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights for America; Elizabeth Meyer, founder of the Women’s March on New Jersey; Beth Hubbard, a documentary film producer; Enchanta Jackson, the organizing director at Color of Change; and Watson Coleman.

It was the seventh woman, Gunter, who got my attention by virtue of her silence. Many of us ― including most of the women at the dinner table ― had not heard of Recy Taylor before Oprah Winfrey name-dropped her in a speech at this year’s Golden Globe Awards.

Taylor was kidnapped, blindfolded and raped at gunpoint in the back of a Chevy by six white men in 1944. The men released Taylor after she promised to stay silent about the assault. But Taylor refused to be silenced. She told her family about the assault, and soon the incident had gone national. Me too, she said, years before Gwyneth Paltrow said it. Time’s up, she said, years before Natalie Portman said it.

There was nothing abnormal about Taylor’s assault or the lack of justice she and her family received afterward. In fact, the rape of black women was often a counterpart to the lynching of black men, a political tactic used to silence a community. There’s that word again. Silence.

Black women have gone missing from the #MeToo conversation, a different but still disconcerting kind of silence. “The absence of black women from the spotlight of #MeToo has historical roots that predate Taylor’s rape,” wrote Soraya McDonald for “The Undefeated.” “Taylor’s story isn’t just about her. It’s about thousands of women just like her whose stories we may never know, who were victimized and brutalized without recognition or recompense for their injuries.”



At dinner on Monday, Watson Coleman seemed aware of the absence. “Women are very prominent in this moment and this movement,” she said after taking a swallow of Malbec. “And we had to be very careful that it didn’t just have one face. When [black women] thought about feminism and the feminist movement, we automatically thought of other women. But we were there in it. We were being affected by it.”

And black women were in some ways the cause of national feminist movements, Watson Coleman noted. After Taylor told her family what had happened to her, an investigator for the NAACP named Rosa Parks came to the small town of Abbeville, Ala., to push for prosecution of the attackers. Parks was run out of town by the sheriff. But, despite the failure to achieve any legal redress, Taylor’s assault gave rise to a national campaign against the brutal rape of black women by white men.

“People don’t think of us as having suffered. People don’t think of us as having the same suffering experiences and no justice,” said Watson Coleman. “This is a classic example of that.”

The conversation at the table shifted from Trump’s current policies to how things seemed a bit easier under President Barack Obama to youth engagement in politics. Throughout it all, Gunter didn’t say a word. She’d nod her head. She’d smile. She’d laugh. But she didn’t speak. Finally, Graves addressed Gunter. She said she was excited to share a table with Gunter, “especially right now when our stories are finally being told.”

Gunter gave a quiet smile and a nod.

“That’s that silent power,” said Hubbard.

The conversation stalled as people took bites of their food. And I took my shot.

“What are your thoughts on all of this?’ I asked Gunter, who cared for her aunt in her final years. “You haven’t said that much, and I’m interested in what you have to say.”

“About this conversation?” she countered.

“Yes, ma’am.”

“It was truthful,” she said before pausing to collect her thoughts. After a few seconds, she sighed and gave me a smile.“I can’t think of what I want to say right now. I’m not a talker.”

That didn’t stop the questions from flying in now that she had spoken. What would Taylor have said about the #MeToo movement, Meyer asked. “I think she’d be relieved in some way,” said Gunter. She’d be overjoyed, Gunter added, and maybe even a little satisfied.

We learned Gunter didn’t know about her aunt’s rape until 2010, which sparked a conversation on how the rapes of black women are often “family secrets.”

“She’d only talk about that with her baby brother,” Gunter said.

“So how did you find out?” asked Meyer.

“A newspaper came out when the book came out,” Gunter replied, referring to At the Dark End of the Street, a book detailing Park’s legacy as an activist and Taylor’s assault. Shortly after the book was published, Abbeville’s current mayor, the county government and the Alabama Legislature issued apologies.

“Did any of the family members apologize?” asked Watson Coleman.

“No.”

“In fact, they really acted like it didn’t happen,” said Hubbard.

“Yeah, but it did,” said Watson Coleman.

Gunter nodded, and as the questions came flooding in, she kept shifting in her seat. She seemed unaccustomed to the spotlight. She preferred her silence.

Not all quiet is created equal. There’s a difference between words suppressed and words withheld. On Tuesday night, Gunter will again sit in silence, dressed in all black. This time in front of a man who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy.” A man whose presidency has been an act of aggression against people of color in general and black women in particular — black women, who suffer from higher rates of sexual and domestic violence than any other demographic, who are the fastest-growing part of the prison population, who are more likely than their white counterparts to be the sole providers for their households and to live below the poverty line.Brenda Fitzgerald, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resigned Wednesday after coming under scrutiny for buying shares of a tobacco company while leading the agency.

Fitzgerald also owned stock in various tobacco companies, including Reynolds American, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands, Philip Morris International and Altria Group, before taking her position, Politico reported Tuesday. The CDC is a national leader in the fight against tobacco.

“Dr. Fitzgerald owns certain complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all of her duties as the CDC director,” CDC spokesman Matt Floyd said in a statement. She “could not divest from them in a definitive time period.”

After assuming her role as the head of the CDC, Fitzgerald also purchased stock in various health care companies including Bayer and Humana, Politico reported. A Health and Human Services Department confirmed “potentially conflicting” stock purchases to Politico and told the outlet Fitzgerald had since sold them.

HHS Secretary Tom Price appointed Fitzgerald, an ob-gyn, last July. Prior to joining the administration, she served as Georgia’s Department of Public Health commissioner from 2011 to 2017. Tobacco cessation was listed as one of her top priorities while she held that role.TommL via Getty Images

Australia’s national broadcaster has obtained secret government documents relating to national security, immigration, welfare, communications and controversial racial discrimination laws after someone purchased two government filing cabinets at a secondhand store.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. made the revelation on Wednesday after reporting for several days on secret government decisions and discussions that took place between 2013 and 2014. The broadcaster disclosed the former immigration minister’s plan to delay security checks on refugees so they would miss the deadline to apply for residency in Australia, as well as former Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s plan to ban anyone under 30 from accessing welfare payments.

Fellow journalists and political insiders had theorized about whether a source inside the government had leaked the stories, but on Wednesday, the ABC revealed a far less scandalous source: two filing cabinets from a secondhand shop in Canberra that contained hundreds of top-secret government documents.

#TheCabinetFiles should have remained sealed for at least 20 years. Now these top-secret documents are yours to explore https://t.co/xnhuyjW0Tu pic.twitter.com/IcsxpIfhVn — ABC Politics (@politicsabc) January 31, 2018

“They were purchased for small change and sat unopened for some months until the locks were attacked with a drill. Inside was the trove of documents now known as The Cabinet Files,” the ABC reported.

“The thousands of pages reveal the inner workings of five separate governments and span nearly a decade. Nearly all the files are classified, some as ‘top secret’ or ‘AUSTEO,’ which means they are to be seen by Australian eyes only.”

“But the ex-government furniture sale was not limited to Australians — anyone could make a purchase. And had they been inclined, there was nothing stopping them handing the contents to a foreign agent or government.”

The ABC did not say who purchased the cabinets or explain how it came to possess the documents, but the story sent shockwaves through Canberra, with many poking fun at the decidedly lo-fi way the broadcaster obtained the papers. Others were startled that such classified material would be discarded so frivolously.

Responding to the earlier ABC stories on Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commented, “I don’t know how it emerged from the ABC ... I think they have come across someone’s bottom drawer in Canberra.” His quip apparently proved not far off the mark.

On Wednesday, following the ABC’s report about its source, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet announced it would conduct an investigation.

Chief among the documents’ revelations is that Australia’s former immigration minister, Scott Morrison — who is currently Australia’s treasurer — authorized his Immigration Department in 2013 to ask domestic security agency ASIO to delay security checks on asylum-seekers after he was told that 700 people had to be granted permanent protection under Australian law.

Morrison asked how this could be avoided, and the Immigration Department suggested it could ask ASIO to delay security checks to prevent 30 extra refugees a week from being cleared to settle in Australia. Morrison signed off on his department’s suggestion, but it’s not known if ASIO complied with the request.

Food delivery giants like UberEATS and Deliveroo are under pressure to provide better pay and working conditions for their bicycle couriers, as Australian trade unions begin a push for stronger protections in the burgeoning “gig economy.”

The companies, essentially ad hoc delivery services for traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants or cafes, allow people to order food through an app and have it delivered. Uber, Deliveroo, Foodora and other services employ bicycle, motorbike and scooter riders as contractors, usually paying them a set rate per delivery, rather than by the hour.

Trade unions and riders object to this arrangement, as the companies usually do not provide paid sick leave or holidays, or help with medical bills in the event of an on-the-job injury. Unions and workers also say the payment scheme encourages risky riding to save time, and leads to exhaustion.

“Poverty is not an innovation,” said Sally McManus, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. “The callous and regressive actions of companies like Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Foodora, who illegitimately classify bike couriers as independent contractors, belong in the Victorian age. They have no place in Australia in 2018.”

A survey of 160 riders in Australia by the Transport Workers Union found that while 26 percent worked the equivalent of full time ― more than 40 hours a week ― more than 76 percent earned less than the $24 per hour minimum they would earn if properly employed as bike couriers. Some riders were paid as little as $6.67 per hour, according to the union.

“We put our life at risk and are pressured to get the delivery done quickly but we are putting our lives at risk in the rain,” one Deliveroo rider, age 24, told the union.

In Australia, Uber Eats riders are paid $5.50 per pickup, $3.50 per dropoff, and $2.20 per kilometre ridden. This payment structure was instituted in February 2017, effectively lowering the former pay of $11 per delivery. In London, the minimum payment for each delivery is £5.33, minus a service fee collected by Uber, while riders in other areas of the United Kingdom appear to receive lower amounts, according to Uber’s website. Australian Deliveroo riders earn between $9 and $10 per delivery, a company spokeswoman told HuffPost.

“Having hourly rates would actively negate the flexibility that riders want, because it would enforce working for a single company in mandatory shifts ― essentially forcing the work to no longer be on-demand,” Deliveroo said in a statement, claiming that the average Deliveroo rider earns more than the minimum wage.

“We believe benefits should be accrued on the basis of work performed, for example the number of deliveries completed, rather than the duration of work completed, which is the current system for benefits such as sick pay or holiday pay,” the Deliveroo statement added.

Uber said “earnings vary depending on when and where partners choose to deliver.”

“There is demand for more flexible, independent forms of work and digital technologies are opening up reliable, diverse and unprecedented opportunities for income generation ― often for those who need it most,” an Uber spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement.Sports betting bills have been filed in some 20 states, ranging from ones detailing exactly how the sports betting would work to mere placeholders that would allow for specific language once the case is decided.

Lawmakers across the country are moving quickly to legalize sports betting, wagering that the U.S. Supreme Court will allow it by session’s end and set off a race among states to cash in on contests ranging from regular-season college hoops to the Super Bowl.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on Christie v. NCAA, which could invalidate the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, banning states from authorizing or licensing sports betting. New Jersey argues the law violates the 10th Amendment, which says that any powers not granted to the federal government fall to the states. And court-watchers think a majority of justices seemed inclined to agree, based on their statements during oral arguments in December.

Sports betting bills have been filed in some 20 states, ranging from ones detailing exactly how the sports betting would work, to mere placeholders that would allow for specific language once the case is decided. Some bills, if passed and signed, would become law immediately upon a go-ahead ruling from the high court. Most would use existing wagering structures such as casinos or lottery commissions to oversee some form of betting on professional and college games. Some would allow on-site betting only, as at casinos or racetracks; others would allow betting remotely.

The main driver, of course, is revenue. In states where lotteries, casinos and horse racing are already legal, proponents see sports betting as an extension of their wagering reach and a way to cash in on a national mania. Opponents object on moral grounds or say that gambling in general is regressive, in that the poor suffer disproportionately from gambling losses, and leads to addictions that stress state resources, for example by increasing health care and criminal justice costs.

The NCAA, which runs the nation’s massive college sports system, opposes both legal and illegal sports wagering, saying in a statement it “has the potential to undermine the integrity of sports contests and jeopardizes the welfare of student-athletes and the intercollegiate athletics community.”

Legal gambling in 2015 brought in $27.7 billion to local and state governments, according to estimates by the Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York System.

A 2017 study by Oxford Economics, done for the industry group American Gaming Association, estimated that sports betting alone could become a $41.2 billion industry — including “downstream impacts” as well as spending by bettors — and contribute about $3.4 billion in taxes to state and local governments.

Wagering on sports is hugely popular — annual March Madness office pools are just one example — but is mostly illegal except in Nevada. The proposed legislation wouldn’t legalize those office pools, but new laws might cut into that market with similar, but legal, betting. Many state lawmakers are concerned that if they don’t get into the sports betting market quickly, gamblers will flow to nearby states and leave theirs behind.

“If we are prepared, it will boost our state’s economy, and if we’re not prepared, and the border states are, we’ll take a hit,” said state Sen. Mike Maroney, a West Virginia Republican who authored sports betting legislation that would put the state’s Lottery Commission in charge of sports betting and set a 2 percent tax on the revenue. Many lawmakers are looking to Nevada, where last year a legal $138.5 million was wagered on the Super Bowl alone.

But the legal betting market is nothing compared with the potential money now changing hands through illegal wagering. The American Gaming Association, a trade research group, estimated that Americans bet $4.7 billion on last year’s Super Bowl, an 11 percent jump over 2016. According to the association, 97 percent of the bets were illegal.

‘Ready to Roll’

Maroney said his state’s economy relies on legal gambling revenue from casinos, horse tracks and video lottery machines. “I don’t want to draw the line in the sand and say we are allowed this kind of gambling and not the other kind of gambling,” he said, adding that nearby states of Pennsylvania and Ohio are “ready to roll. If New Jersey wins [in court] it’s going to happen.”

Pennsylvania and Connecticut enacted sports betting laws late last year and are poised to get into that market if the Supreme Court allows it. Ohio, which legalized fantasy sports betting last year, is also likely to act.

Border-state poaching of gamblers already is at work throughout the country. New Jersey casinos took a hit when Maryland and Pennsylvania built more in-state gambling parlors. Recently Mississippi reported that casino revenue fell in 2017, due mostly to declines in riverboat gambling-sites along the Mississippi River, as many gamblers went to racetrack casinos in Arkansas, just across the water.

In most states gambling is a relatively small revenue source: It represents less than 2.5 percent of most states’ revenue, according to data from the Rockefeller Institute. But in a few states — Nevada (10.2 percent), Rhode Island (7.9 percent), Louisiana and West Virginia (6.7 percent) — its role is more significant.

Lucy Dadayan, who studies gambling for the Rockefeller Institute, said states should view sports gambling revenue with caution. She predicts a boon in the early stages of a legal industry, but then a decline later. And looking at Nevada as an example, she noted that “tax revenues generated from sports betting won’t be substantial and shouldn’t be viewed as budget savers.”

Sports betting makes up a small — but growing — portion of states’ gambling revenue. According to David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sports betting makes up just 2 percent of the revenue taken in by that state’s casinos. But in 2017, Nevada sports betting at casinos and casino-sponsored “sports books” took in $215 million, an 11.3 percent increaseover the year before.

Other states are rushing to get into the game “because they need the money,” Schwartz said. But gambling revenue in general declined during the Great Recession and hasn’t come back to where it once was, he cautioned.

Through sports books, gamblers register with casinos and download a wagering app on their phones. This allows them to place bets according to the point spread before games and also to participate in “dynamic wagering” during games.

For some lawmakers it’s an attractive industry. In Indiana, state legislators largely followed the Nevada model. Their legislation would allow the dozen or so state-run casinos to expand into sports betting on-site, along with mobile apps.

“I anticipate we’re going to see a change, a shift, in sports wagering,” said state Rep. Alan Morrison, a Republican from Terre Haute who sponsored the bill in the House (the Senate has an identical bill). “I would like Indiana to be proactive on it and be one of the first to be up and running rather than be lagging behind and see neighboring states get a jump on it.”

The Indiana bill is among the more prescriptive ones, laying out fee structures, revenue predictions and a 1 percent “integrity tax” on wagers involving MLB or NBA games. That tax would go to the leagues, to pay for procedures to assure that the games are played fairly and are not “thrown” by players or anyone else.

While MLB and the NBA have signed on to the plan, the NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, has not, which might mean the state wouldn’t offer wagering on college sports. Indiana has regulated fantasy sports betting, but NCAA games are excluded.

West Virginia, the home of a handful of casinos, had a similar bill stall last year, but backers see a renewed energy this year because of the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision.

Many states also have Native American casinos, which could be allowed to handle sports betting if the Supreme Court approves it. Indian casinos operate independently of state regulations, but generally under compacts with states that would have to be amended to accommodate sports wagering.

In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo is so confident that sports betting will be approved that her proposed budget includes $23.5 million in projected revenue from the activity. A bill in Kansas would authorize sports gambling at the state’s racetracks.

And in Minnesota, state Rep. Pat Garofalo, who is sponsoring a sports betting bill, said in a statement it’s time to move Minnesota’s sports gambling laws “out of the caveman era and into the 21st century.”

“Hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans already wager on sports,” Garofalo, a Republican, said. “Modernizing these laws will move these activities away from” the underground economy “where citizens have few protections, and into a safe, regulated business environment.”

Bucking the Trend

In other states, meanwhile, elected leaders are getting ahead of the Supreme Court to block sports gambling within their borders.

A broad betting bill to allow casinos as well as sports gambling was introduced in the South Carolina Legislature last year, but it got nowhere, partially because to make gambling legal would require a constitutional amendment.

Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said he’s opposed to legalization this year, even if the court rules in favor. State lawmakers’ opposition is even stronger.
