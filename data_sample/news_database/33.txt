A pair of former Disney executives have created a new social media platform for girls.

On Friday, Brooke Chaffin and Catherine Connors announced the launch of Maverick, a social network geared toward young women between the ages of 10 and 20. The aim is to connect and empower girls by fostering their creativity and introducing them to inspiring role models.

When users join Maverick, which offers both a free iOS app and desktop experience, they have the opportunity to participate in video, photo and text-based “challenges,” like creating their own superheroes, coming up with lyrics for their personal anthems, making dance videos and creating posters for meaningful causes. One recent challenge involves designing their own “freak flags” to celebrate their eccentricity.

“Maverick aims to provide girls and young women with ongoing opportunities to exercise their powers of creativity, curiosity, and daring in the years of their lives when they are still comfortable being messy, ambitious, and unapologetic,” Connors told HuffPost.

“This is with the hope and expectation that they will become practiced and comfortable in experimenting and taking risks, in challenging the pressures of perfection, in being their real, powerful, authentic selves, and in working together ― and that they will carry them forward into adulthood, and use them to make their own futures and change the world,” Connors added.

The challenges come from “Catalysts,” or role models from a range of fields meant to inspire the young “Mavericks.” After sharing their work in response to challenges, users have the opportunity to view and reward each other’s work with comments and badges for categories like “unique,” “creative,” “unstoppable” and “daring.”

Chaffin and Connors develop the challenges in consultation with the role models themselves, as well as educators and “girl experts” to create experiences that are fun and thought-provoking, inspire creativity and experimentation, and encourage the young women to work together.

The two women met while working at the Walt Disney Company, where Chaffin led Disney Interactive’s women and family division and Connors was editor-in-chief of Babble.

Though they bonded over their shared passion for empowering women and girls, Connors said the seeds for Maverick were actually planted some years before her time at Disney, when she was pursuing a career in academia.

“My area was women and girls in social thought, with a particular focus on how they assert themselves ― or rather, historically, how they’re unable to assert themselves ― in the public sphere. So I was very familiar with all of the research on what’s sometimes called ‘loss of voice’ or the confidence gap ― the phenomenon, around puberty and early adolescence, whereby girls go from being assertive and outspoken to not using their voices, not raising their hands, dropping out of sports, etc.,” Connors explained.

After Connors and Chaffin had both left Disney, they reconnected and decided to use their digital media experience to tackle this issue.

“Girls and young women do feel extraordinary pressure to be perfect and likable and to follow the rules. Much of their current social media engagement increases that pressure,” said Connors. “Maverick’s emphasis on creative messiness and authenticity allows girls to be able to push back against the myths of perfection - and to meaningfully exercise their very real powers.”

In addition to research, the women also draw inspiration from Connors’ 12-year-old daughter Emilia.

“She has always been intense and outspoken and driven and argumentative, and that’s awesome. But I’ve also found it really hard from a parenting perspective, in ways that have continually surprised me,” Connors told HuffPost. “I consider myself a really progressive, feminist parent, but I’ve found myself, too often, imposing problematic social norms on my daughter ... Basically communicating to her that she should try to be more likable and polite and cooperative ― a ‘good girl,’ who should conform to social approval ― rather than letting her be the fully powerful person that she already is.”

“I consider myself a really progressive, feminist parent, but I’ve found myself, too often, imposing problematic social norms on my daughter.” - Catherine Connors

Connors and Chaffin see Maverick as pushing back against the kinds of norms and expectations that hinder girls’ progress and suppress the ambition, energy and power they often exhibit at younger ages.

This goal has garnered broader support. Maverick has raised $2.7 million in seed funding from investors like LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.

The company is also offering a live events platform with MaverickLIVE, a day of events across the country to connect young Mavericks and Catalysts and to celebrate girls on the platform and their achievements in areas like comedy, sports, music and STEAM, a variation of STEM that incorporates the fields of art and design.

The first MaverickLIVE event, which will take place in Los Angeles on April 28, will feature “Founding Mavericks” ― peer role models like Laurie Hernandez, Chloe and Halle Bailey, Brooklyn and Bailey McKnight, Daunnette Reyome and Ruby Karp.

Although the opportunity to connect and empower young women and girls is enticing, many parents are undoubtedly worried about social media networks and online privacy following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

“We are very focused on protecting the privacy of our users and protecting their personal data,” Chaffin told HuffPost, noting that users under 13 need parental consent to use the platform and parents can view their child’s content through Maverick’s parent portal.South Korean officials have carefully choreographed nearly every moment of Friday’s summit between President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and each piece of furniture, carpeting and artwork has been selected to convey deep meaning.

The historic meeting, on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, will begin shortly before 10 a.m. local time. Kim and his entourage will be met by a South Korean honor guard and escorted to the Peace House, where they are expected to discuss inter-Korean relations and negotiate the groundwork to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.

Inside, South Korea said it has spared no expense to give meaning to every object in sight. The “symbolic spaces have been designed to quietly speak to the leaders of the two Koreas as they come together during this historic event,” Moon’s government said in press briefing material.

Kim will be seated at a specially made table exactly 2,018 millimeters wide, “symbolizing the year the historic summit is being held,” the briefing statement said. The table’s oval shape is “to help bridge the psychological distance” between the two Koreas.

“It is also intended to promote candid, heart-to-heart discussions among officials from both sides sitting around the oval table,” the statement said.

Carpets have been carefully selected as well. Blue carpet in a second-floor conference room “represents aspirations for a brighter, more peaceful future.” Green in a third-floor banquet room “evokes the freshness of a barley field in late spring.”

A sofa in another area is emblazoned with the Korean Unification Flag, a reception area has been designed to mimic a traditional Korean home, and all of the furniture has been crafted from walnut, which is not “prone to bending and warping over time.”

“The wood has been chosen to wish that inter-Korean relations would remain unwavering on the basis of mutual trust,” according to the statement.

After the first round of meetings, Kim and Moon will jointly plant a pine tree, which the statement said “stands for peace and prosperity,” on the military demarcation line between the two countries.

Later, the two leaders will dine on a tasting menu that’s also stuffed with significance.

The meeting will be a significant moment in thawing tensions on the Korean peninsula, and is intended to lay the groundwork for an upcoming summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. The White House has said the pair will meet sometime in May or June, although the details have yet to be announced.

Experts have said Kim is likely to be cautious during Friday’s meeting and doubt that Pyongyang will agree to completely give up its nuclear weapons, even under the right conditions. The Washington Post notes that some analysts are worried that an honor guard to welcome Kim would grant his regime long-sought legitimacy.The Boston Red Sox have a renamed street to call home.

On Thursday, the city’s Public Improvement Commission unanimously approved the baseball team’s request to return Yawkey Way ― a short stretch of road on which sits Fenway Park ― to its original name, CBS Boston reported. So it will be Jersey Street again.

There had been increasing pressure to change the Yawkey name with its ties to the Red Sox’s racist past. Current team owner John Henry told the Boston Herald that he was personally “haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.”

The street was dubbed Yawkey Way in 1977 after the team’s late owner, Tom Yawkey, who oversaw the Sox through 44 seasons. Yawkey had resisted the racial integration of baseball, choosing not to hire future Hall of Famers Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays. The Red Sox would become the last MLB team to integrate black players in 1959 ― 12 years after Robinson broke racial barriers with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Over the last year, articles have compared the continued use of Yawkey’s name outside Fenway Park to memorials for Confederate soldiers.

The Yawkey Foundations, which have made more than $450 million worth of charitable donations in the name of Tom and his wife Jean Yawkey over the years, argued against the street’s name change and said it was based on “a false narrative about his life.”

AdvertisementTIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American migrants from a caravan through Mexico reunited in Tijuana on Wednesday and planned to cross into the United States together this weekend, in defiance of threats by President Donald Trump to repel them.

The timing of the migrants’ arrival could compromise a flurry of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has repeatedly threatened to scrap if Mexico does not crack down on the flow of Central Americans through its territory.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said her agency was monitoring the caravan and would prosecute anyone who illegally entered the United States or made “a false immigration claim.”

Migrants began arriving by bus on Tuesday at a shelter that was a five minute-walk from the border and within sight of a U.S. flag fluttering under an overpass linking the two countries.

Minutes after disembarking, some sat outside the shelter with bowls of food, gazing over the road towards the United States.

“The wall doesn’t look that tall,” said Kimberly George, a 15-year-old girl from Honduras, nodding toward the stunted barrier only few feet away. “I really want to cross it.”

Migrants said they fled their homes in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because of death threats from gangs, the murder of family members or political persecution.

Moving from town to town, the migrant caravan became a stumbling block for U.S.-Mexico relations after Trump unleashed a series of tweets in early April, pressuring Mexican authorities to stop them.

Another busload of migrants arrived in the afternoon, overflowing the first shelter and more pulled in after dark. Migrant aid groups said it was the biggest single group they had seen arrive together as they scrambled to find places in ten shelters.

“Thanks to God we’re here,” said 34-year-old Aide Hernandez from Guatemala who had four children in tow. She said she planned to seek asylum in the United States. When asked why, she looked down, ashamed to detail a case of domestic abuse.

Honduran Angel Caceres dipped a tortilla into a plate of refried beans and rice, his first meal in two days. He preferred to spend what money he’d saved since leaving Honduras to buy food for his five-year-old son, Jeffrey, coughing with a dirty nose beside him.

Caceres said he fled Honduras in early March after a brother and niece were killed and his 82-year old mother was strangled to near death and raped.

“I left with a heap of things in my head,” he said and held out his phone with photos of a brutally beaten older woman in a hospital bed, repeating again and again: “82. She’s 82.”

Volunteers from U.S.-based advocacy group Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which organized the caravan, addressed the migrants to discuss a plan to cross the main pedestrian bridge into the United States together on Sunday.

Tensions flared after a Mexican immigration official suggested they go in smaller groups to the border station before the migrants had a chance to meet later in the week with immigration lawyers organized by Pueblos Sin Fronteras.Wahlberg with "All The Money In The World" co-star Michelle Williams at the premiere on Dec. 18, 2017, in Beverly Hills, California.

Mark Wahlberg knows we still have a “long way to go” before women and men are paid equally.

“We want to continue to make sure that everybody feels that we’re having equal opportunity and equal pay for everybody,” the actor told Extra on Wednesday evening at CinemaCon while promoting his upcoming film “Mile 22.”

Wahlberg, 46, was put in the hot seat in January when it was reported that he made over 1,000 times more than his co-star Michelle Williams for their work on the film “All The Money In The World.” USA Today reported that Wahlberg earned $1.5 million for the reshoot of the movie (actor Kevin Spacey was replaced in the film after allegations of sexual assault emerged against him) while Williams received less than $1,000.

“If there was a discrepancy in what we were doing in making the movie, we have a long way to go,” Wahlberg said. “We need to work together to make sure that everybody gets an equal opportunity out there.”

A few days after the initial report of pay inequity on set, Wahlberg announced that he planned to donate his $1.5 million reshoot fee to the anti-sexual violence organization Time’s Up, created in January by women in Hollywood.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders celebrated CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s confirmation as secretary of state on Thursday by sharing photos of his secret meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Pompeo met with the leader this month before direct talks between Kim and President Donald Trump planned for late May or early June.

“Great to have Secretary Pompeo confirmed,” Sanders wrote on Twitter. “He will do an excellent job helping @POTUS lead our efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.”

According to Trump, during his clandestine trip to North Korea, Pompeo wasn’t initially supposed to meet with Kim face to face. But the two ended up meeting for more than an hour.You can’t tell it from this photo, but Barack woke up on our wedding day in October, 1992 with a nasty head cold. Somehow, by the time I met him at the altar, it had miraculously disappeared and we ended up dancing almost all night. Twenty five years later, we’re still having fun, while also doing the hard work to build our partnership and support each other as individuals. I can’t imagine going on this wild ride with anybody else.

A post shared by Michelle Obama (@michelleobama) on May 23, 2018 at 4:03am PDTThe woman who gave the world “Bodak Yellow” is now getting sued for a lot of green.

The former manager of rapper Cardi B has filed a $10 million lawsuit against the performer. He claims to have turned her into a superstar, but has been left out of her success, according to Page Six.

Cardi B dumped Klenord “Shaft” Raphael last month and signed with Solid Foundation, a management company/label headed by Kevin “Coach K” Lee and Pierre “Pee” Thomas, according to Variety.

Raphael said her new contract violates the agreement she had with him, according to Billboard.

“While [Raphael] is proud of their successful collaborations as she evolved from Instagram influencer to music megastar, [he] is disappointed by her actions to freeze him out of her career, which are detailed in the complaint,” a spokesman for Raphael told the publication.

Raphael, who has worked with Cardi B since 2015, claims he helped get her on VH1’s “Love & Hip Hop: New York,” and also connected her with songwriters, producers and music publishers.

In addition, Raphael claims Cardi B defamed him by telling others, including fiancé Offset, that he stole money from her, according to TMZ.

Raphael said Offset texted him in December, saying in part, ”[U] better stop play acting like u don’t know u taking her sh** from her u a snake.”WASHINGTON ― The most conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives initially thought the newest farm bill would kick too few people off of food stamps, but now they’re warming up to the legislation.

The proposal would shift a portion of food stamp spending from benefits to training with the goal of prodding more people into low-wage jobs. Before the bill had been formally introduced, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the founders of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, didn’t think it prodded hard enough, and that Republicans shouldn’t even bother with it. Now he’s changed his tune.

“I’m all for the welfare reform aspect of it,” Jordan said Wednesday. “I think it’s off to a good start.”

Democrats oppose the food stamp legislation, which is part of a so-called farm bill that lawmakers want to pass by October. That means House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) may need 218 of the 236 Republicans in the House to support his bill ― and can’t lose too many of the three-dozen or so House Freedom Caucus members.

Getting the bill through the House by no means guarantees it becomes law, since Democrats can still block anything they don’t like from passing the Senate. But if the House can pass a more conservative version of its food stamp bill, doing so would give House Republicans a stronger negotiating position when the House and Senate farm bills are eventually merged.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, helps more than 40 million Americans buy food every month, making it one of the most important safety net programs in the U.S.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the nutrition provisions of the House bill wouldn’t reduce spending over 10 years, largely because $9 billion in savings from shrinking SNAP enrollment would be offset by $7 billion in spending on new training programs for remaining beneficiaries.

But fewer people might enroll in training to keep their benefits than the CBO expects, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost this week.

“It doesn’t save any money according to CBO, but in actuality there is a potential for savings,” Meadows said. He pointed to significant drops in food stamp enrollment in several states that recently imposed stricter eligibility requirements on adults without dependents.

Wisconsin, for instance, imposed a three-month limit on benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents in 2015. It’s one of only a few states that guarantees a slot in a training program like Conaway’s bill would require states to do. People could keep their benefits if they worked 20 hours per week or enrolled in the program.

In the first year, Wisconsin referred about 79,000 childless adult recipients to training and only 20,000 enrolled, according to state data. The total number of beneficiaries fell by roughly 79,000 during that time, while around 9,000 training enrollees gained employment that showed up in state tax records.

Currently, states can only impose the limit on adults aged 18 to 49 who aren’t working 20 hours per week and who don’t have minor children. Conaway’s bill would expand work requirements to people in their 50s and parents with children older than 6.

Conaway said he’d been trying to sway Meadows and that it’s possible the CBO underestimated the impact of his proposal. Democrats who have seen the CBO’s analysis on the bill’s effect on enrollment, which has not been made public, say several million would have to enroll in training and that more than 1 million would lose benefits over 10 years.

“If people come off quickly, there will be additional savings,” Conaway told HuffPost.

Conaway isn’t exactly going out on a limb by presenting this possibility.

“We agree that there’s a serious risk that the benefit cuts could be much larger than CBO projects,” Stacy Dean, a nutrition policy expert with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in email. “That’s one of our most serious concerns.”

Dean pointed to the hypothetical example of a cashier who has a stable part-time job but whose employer gives her fewer than 20 hours of work per week one month. The punishment for the first violation of the work requirement under the proposal would be no benefits for a year.

“Taking away her food assistance isn’t going to help her get more hours from her employer,” Dean said. “It’s just going to make it harder for her to feed her kids. We worry that the estimate doesn’t capture how many people, including workers, will lose SNAP simply as a result of the paperwork work requirements.”

It’s not a surprise that the Freedom Caucus is sounding less hostile to the farm bill, said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), one of the top Democrats on the food stamp issue.

“Freedom Caucus is a lot of bark but no bite,” he said. “At the end of the day, everybody rallies around whatever their leadership wants.”Serena Williams may pack a powerful punch with her tennis serve.

The red-state teacher revolt came to Arizona on Thursday, as thousands of educators staged a walkout and converged on Phoenix to demand more school funding from the state legislature.

The protest was expected to close about three-quarters of Arizona’s school districts as teachers reported their absences ahead of time, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic. Schools in the state’s 30 largest districts did not open on Thursday.

Organizers said they were expecting tens of thousands of teachers at the Phoenix rally. The massive protest follows other recent walkouts that closed schools in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. Teachers in all those states have rebelled against years of education cuts that led to stagnating salaries, overcrowded classrooms and dwindling school resources.

The Arizona walkout has been in the works for weeks, after the successful strike in West Virginia in late February and March led to 5 percent pay raises for teachers and state employees. Organizers have billed the walkout as #REDforED, with participants and supporters wearing red clothes as a show of solidarity.

The group coordinating the walkout, Arizona Educators United, has not said how long it will last. Some districts have said they plan to remain closed for as long as their teachers participate.

“Our goal is to ensure that students have access to highly qualified and experienced teachers, that educators are compensated fairly, and to improve the educational environment in the state of Arizona.” - Arizona Educators United, describing what the group wants from the walkout

Arizona Educators United has released a list of concrete demands, including a 20 percent pay raise for teachers and certified staff, a return of school funding to pre-recession levels, and a moratorium on tax cuts until the state’s per-pupil spending meets the national average.

“Our goal is to ensure that students have access to highly qualified and experienced teachers, that educators are compensated fairly, and to improve the educational environment in the state of Arizona,” the group said on its walkout planning website.

The root cause of the Arizona walkout is essentially the same as in West Virginia and Oklahoma.

Just like in those other states, Arizona legislators now find themselves in a jam after years of tax cuts. Funding has dropped as corporate and personal income taxes have fallen, and per-student spending remains far below what it was a decade ago. The loss of revenue has left the state with little money to pump into schools or salaries.

The walkouts have put tremendous pressure on lawmakers to raise taxes in states where Republican leaders are loath to do so. In the case of Oklahoma, the threat of a school shutdown led to the first tax hike in nearly three decades, overcoming a supermajority requirement that three-quarters of lawmakers approve it.

In Arizona, Republicans control both chambers of the statehouse, and the governor is Doug Ducey, a Republican. Ducey has laid out a plan to give teachers the 20 percent raise over the course of several years, but it mostly relies on rosy projections that tax revenue will increase due to an improved economy, as well as cuts to other programs. The state’s teachers unions have dismissed Ducey’s proposal.

The American Federation of Teachers-Arizona, one of the state’s main unions, has called for a 2.5 percent tax on services, such as consulting and legal services, which it estimates would raise $2.65 billion a year for school infrastructure, supplies and pay increases. One lawmaker has instead proposed a temporary, three-year increase of the state sales tax by 1 percent as a “bridge” to a longer-term solution.A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and other top state officials do not have to immediately come up with a new system for restoring voting rights to former felons.

U.S. District Judge Mark Walker had ordered Florida to come up with a new system by April 26, but a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit temporarily blocked that ruling on Wednesday, issuing a stay while the state appeals.

The Florida clemency board had planned an emergency meeting Wednesday evening to discuss changes to its system for restoring voting rights, but canceled it after the 11th Circuit’s ruling.

Former felons in Florida can request to have their voting rights restored, but there is no guarantee it will happen (some other states restore voting rights automatically). In fact, Florida is just one of four states that permanently disenfranchises people who commit a felony by default. After a waiting period, people who have entirely completed their sentences can apply to get their voting rights restored by the state’s executive clemency board ― which consists of the governor, attorney general, agriculture commissioner and the state’s chief investment officer.

The voting rights restoration process has moved extremely slowly under Scott, Walker noted in a February opinion. As of 2016, there were about 1.5 million people disenfranchised in Florida, making it the state with the largest disenfranchised population in the country, according to The Sentencing Project.

In a scathing ruling, Walker ruled earlier this year that Florida’s process violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and freedom of expression, because the board had unlimited discretion to restore voting rights.

The case, called Hand v. Scott, is being brought on behalf of nine felons seeking to have their voting rights restored.

“The ruling from the 11th Circuit preserves the status quo. The case will be briefed and argued to the 11th Circuit on the merits,” lawyers for those challenging the state’s system said in a statement Wednesday.

A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Walker had blocked Florida from using the clemency board to restore voting rights, but the 11th Circuit’s stay will allow it to resume doing so until the appellate court resolves the case.

The three 11th Circuit judges who issued the Wednesday ruling were Stanley Marcus, a Bill Clinton appointee, William Pryor, a George W. Bush appointee Beverly Martin, a Barack Obama appointee, concurred with the opinion in part and dissented in part.

Writing for the majority, Marcus said that Florida was likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal. He pointed to a handful of decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts that clearly showed state officials had broad discretion to choose how to restore voting rights. Furthermore, he said that the plaintiffs challenging the state’s system did not claim any discrimination had actually taken place, only that the state’s system left room for discrimination to occur.

Marcus also wrote that Section 2 of the 14th Amendment gave states the ability to disenfranchise people for certain crimes and that the First Amendment did not offer voting protections beyond those outlined in the 14th Amendment.

Writing separately, Martin said that Florida had only demonstrated a “mere possibility” of succeeding on the full appeal. She noted that the protections of the First Amendment did extend to the right to vote and that “our First Amendment rights of free expression and free association are most critical when they are invoked to ensure citizens’ free and full participation in the political process.”

Martin did acknowledge that states have the authority to disenfranchise individuals convicted of felonies. Recognizing that power, she said she would only block a portion of Walker’s ruling that prevented the state from continuing to permanently disenfranchise people, but leave the rest of it in place.“I intend to be here for the whole year,” Tillerson told CNN in January.

Tillerson ultimately learned that he had been fired the same way the rest of the world did ― after Trump tweeted about it.

This story has been updated with details on the vote for Pompeo.Racism has been blamed for the dramatic disparity between a light sentence a white official received for knowingly turning in fake petition signatures compared with jail terms given two minority women in the same Texas county who say they didn’t know they were ineligible to vote.

Rosa Maria Ortega, a U.S. permanent resident in Tarrant County, Texas, illegally voted in 2012 and 2014. The result for the Hispanic woman was a felony charge, but she said she didn’t know that because she wasn’t a U.S. citizen she couldn’t vote. In 2017, a jury sentenced her to eight years in prison.

Crystal Mason, a black woman, said she voted in the 2016 election in Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth, because her mom wanted her to. Charged with illegal voting, she said didn’t realize she was ineligible to vote because she was on supervised release from a felony conviction. In March, a state judge sentenced her to five years in prison. Mason, who is out of jail on an appellate bond, is asking for a new trial.

Russ Casey, a Tarrant County justice of the peace, turned in forged signatures to meet the threshold to get on the this year’s ballot for re-election. On Monday, Casey pleaded guilty to tampering with a government record, but his two-year prison sentence was suspended and he was put on five years of probation. He also was forced to resign his office, fined $1,000 and agreed to stay away from government buildings.

“The disparate treatment of these individuals is stark and clearly related to race,” Beth Stevens, voting rights program director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, told HuffPost. Casey was “a judge, and clearly should be held to a higher standard and engaged in actual active fraud.”

Concern about the differing treatment of the cases comes President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about voter fraud, claiming ― without evidence ― that between 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election. While winning the electoral vote ― which determines who occupies the White House ― he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by about 2.8 million votes.

Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University whose research focuses on voter fraud accusations, said it didn’t make sense that Casey got a significantly more lenient sentence when he was the only one of the three people who benefited from fraud.

“He didn’t do exactly the same thing [as Ortega and Mason], but you might argue that he did something worse,” she told HuffPost. “He was trying to personally benefit from the fraud. When voters make mistakes ― like these two women may have made, or were misinformed, didn’t understand what they were doing ― it’s hard to say that they personally benefited from that vote the way this man had if he won the subsequent election.”

The Tarrant County district attorney’s office has defended the different sentences by noting that Casey pleaded guilty while Ortega and Mason did not.

“He accepted accountability for what he did,” Matthew Smid, a prosecutor in the district attorney’s office, told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Clark Birdsall, Ortega’s lawyer, suggested that Trump’s comments about illegal votes swayed Wilson’s decision to prosecute his client and that she saw a chance to make an example out of an illegal voter.

He said that when District Attorney Sharen Wilson “was making her decision on how to handle Rosa Maria Ortega, she was following the current occupier of the White House; his lead in claiming the reason he lost the popular vote was due to 3 million illegal voters,” he told HuffPost.

Birdsall said Wilson’s office was unwilling to support a deal he negotiated with the state attorney’s general office to have the case against Ortega dismissed. He also speculated that the DA, who is white, may have had her office go easier on Casey “because he looks more like her.”

Samantha Jordan, a spokeswoman for the DA’s office, did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on the race issue. Earlier, she provided a document that said the office offered probation to Ortega and Mason in exchange for guilty pleas. But for various reasons, each defendant rejected those offers.

The document also noted that the office didn’t make sentencing recommendations in the Ortega or Mason cases, leaving it to a jury in one of them and a judge in the other to determine the punishment.

To Stevens, Ortega and Mason’s decision to maintain their innocence shouldn’t result in them getting the harsh sentences.

“Of course [Casey] pled guilty, they had him dead to rights on the fraud charge. He pled guilty to something that was going to give him probation,” she said. “We can’t ask people, with regard to the criminal justice system, to have to acknowledge guilt when they don’t believe that they’re guilty so that they can get the proper sentence.”

Minnite framed Ortega and Mason’s cases in simpler terms, questioning the point of tough prosecutions for two women who claimed they made a mistake and didn’t influence the outcome of an election.LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hip hop producer Russell Simmons and an aspiring documentary filmmaker have agreed to dismiss her civil lawsuit claiming that Simmons raped her at his Los Angeles home in 2016, court documents filed on Wednesday showed.

The case, filed in January in U.S. Court in Los Angeles, was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it cannot be filed again.

“I think Kanye’s lobbying for a job as Trump’s new communications director,” Colbert cracked Wednesday night. “He could just change his name to Kellyanne Kanye.”Janelle Monáe reveals personal details about her private life in the new issue of Rolling Stone, finally addressing longstanding rumors about her sexuality.

The singer-actress ― whose hotly-anticipated album, “Dirty Computer,” is due out Friday ― told the magazine she identifies with aspects of pansexuality and bisexuality.

“Being a queer black woman in America ― someone who has been in relationships with both men and women ― I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker,” Monáe said in the interview, published Thursday. She said she initially identified as bisexual, but added: “Later I read about pansexuality and was like, ‘Oh, these are things that I identify with too.’”

She continued: “I’m open to learning more about who I am.”

Monáe, who grew up in a Baptist family in Kansas, had been known to dodge interview questions about her sexuality. But the star told Rolling Stone that, in fact, she’s always been living her truth ― through her music, that is.

“If you listen to my albums, it’s there,” she said. Two of her songs, 2010’s “Mushrooms & Roses” and 2013’s “Q.U.E.E.N.,” reference a character named Mary as an object of affection. In fact, the original title of “Q.U.E.E.N.” was “Q.U.E.E.R.,” and the word can still be heard on the track’s background harmonies.

Monáe’s sexuality has been the source of fan and media speculation for some time. In February, she winked at the rumors about the nature of her relationship with actress Tessa Thompson in her “Make Me Feel” video. (Thompson also appeared in the video for “PYNK,” which dropped earlier this month.)

Though Monáe doesn’t talk to Rolling Stone about her relationship with Thompson, she said she’d love it if “Dirty Computer” inspired young listeners who may be struggling to come to terms with their sexuality, too.

“I want young girls, young boys, nonbinary, gay, straight, queer people who are having a hard time dealing with their sexuality, dealing with feeling ostracized or bullied for just being their unique selves, to know that I see you,” she said. “This album is for you.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is facing new accusations of ethical violations over his refusal to recuse himself from the process of repealing a landmark power plant rule.

In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday evening and obtained by HuffPost, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Pruitt’s statements over the past three months indicating he plans to repeal the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule to limit greenhouse gas emissions from utilities, violate impartiality requirements in the rulemaking process. The letter was signed by eight other states, the District of Columbia, one Florida county and five cities.

“The American people are entitled to an impartial decision-maker,” Becerra said in a statement. “EPA Administrator Pruitt simply cannot be that person. He must be recused from any involvement in the EPA’s attempt to repeal the Clean Power Plan.”

The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In his previous job as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt sued the agency more than a dozen times to block the Clean Power Plan, winning a historic stay in the Supreme Court in February 2016. The rule was left in limbo and, last October, Pruitt initiated the formal process to repeal it.

In January, California led the same coalition ― with Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, the District of Columbia, Florida’s Broward County, and the cities of Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, South Miami and Boulder, Colorado ― in filing a formal request calling for Pruitt’s recusal from the repeal effort, arguing that his leading role in the lawsuits that halted the Clean Power Plan made him biased in the new rulemaking process.

Since then, Pruitt has made at least three public remarks indicating he considers the repeal a foregone conclusion, suggesting the public comment period that ended Thursday ― a mandated part of the rulemaking process ― was for show. In comments detailed in the Thursday letter, Pruitt said the Clean Power Plan “is demonstrative of a violation of rule of law,” stated withdrawing the rule “is absolutely an important thing” and affirmed he is “getting rid of” the regulation.

“On January 9, 2018, we underscored that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt could not reasonably claim to have an open mind on the Clean Power Plan and provided over 500 pages of evidence,” Becerra said. “We now have even more information that supports our case.”

The new complaint comes after a marathon day of back-to-back House hearings at which Pruitt deflected accusations of corruption, blaming his staff and what he called deceptive media reports for a whirlwind of scandals over the past four weeks. Pruitt admitted he authorized his chief of staff to grant raises to two longtime political aides after the White House rejected the request but denied understanding that a legal loophole was used when the EPA awarded the five-figure salary bumps. The affair became a flashpoint in the ongoing saga over Pruitt’s ethics after the administrator denied knowing about the raises in a tense Fox News interview.

Republicans at the hearings signaled strong support for Pruitt, and admonished Democrats for raising concerns over the ethical lapses. But at least five Republican members of Congress have joined 170 Democrats calling on the administrator to step down over the past month. This week, Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who considers Pruitt a friend and protégé, distanced himself from the administrator and said he would support a hearing before the powerful Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the White House had begun urging Republicans to temper their defenses of Pruitt.

AdvertisementA former prosecutor during the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon’s 1974 resignation issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

“He cannot take the Fifth Amendment,” Jill Wine-Banks said on MSNBC. “That would be political suicide.”

Her comments came just hours after it was revealed that Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in the lawsuit filed by porn star Stormy Daniels.

“Michael Cohen can take the Fifth Amendment,” Wine-Banks said. “But the president of the United States cannot say, ‘I can’t answer questions because they might incriminate me in another matter.’ That just is not politically acceptable.”

Wine-Banks said her belief that Trump shouldn’t take the Fifth if called to testify doesn’t mean he won’t go ahead and do it anyway.

“I’m predicting what a totally sane person would do,” she said. “And he has gotten away with so much that he doesn’t have to act in the way that a predictable person would act.”A U.S. Border Patrol agent rides his ATV along the border at the site of the construction of new wall in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, as seen from the Mexican side of the border in San Jeronimo on April 17.

When Tim Purdon became U.S. attorney for North Dakota in 2010, he had a priority: improving public safety on the state’s four Indian reservations. Prosecuting violent crimes on Indian reservations falls to the Justice Department, and Purdon himself had worked similar cases as a public defender before taking on the U.S. attorney job.

But when Purdon took office, he found that more than a third of his criminal caseload consisted of immigration prosecutions, even though North Dakota lies more than 1,000 miles from the border with Mexico. Despite the state’s proximity to Canada, the defendants were by and large Latin Americans who’d been caught in the U.S. after getting deported. The cases were easy to win. All prosecutors needed was to present paperwork proving the prior deportation. But the cases sapped time away from Purdon’s prosecutors, whom he’d have rather tasked with crimes on the reservations or white-collar cases.

That all happened under the Obama administration. But President Donald Trump has doubled down on immigration prosecutions, seeing it as a way to draft the Justice Department into his immigration crackdown. Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced what he called a “zero tolerance” policy on immigration crime, directing all U.S. attorneys in the four Southwestern border states to prosecute every misdemeanor illegal border-crossing case “to the extent practicable.”

Purdon was livid.

“If you’re working on a misdemeanor illegal entry case, as a matter of fact, you are not working on something more serious,” Purdon, who left office in 2015, told HuffPost. “It is a net drain on the scarce resources of U.S. attorneys. Full stop.”

Despite Trump’s insistence that the border is in “crisis,” illegal entries from Mexico have hit their lowest level since 1971. But illegal entry prosecutions are still taking up half of the federal criminal courts’ workload. If Sessions gets his way, that percentage will continue to increase: Every U.S. attorney in the country will be doing more of the same work that Purdon complained about, and the five U.S. attorneys whose districts touch the southwest border will take on increasingly petty cases to keep the numbers up.

“We want to achieve this zero tolerance across the border and we are redirecting resources,” Sessions told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday.

Last year, Sessions issued a memo to U.S. attorneys in all 94 districts asking them to prosecute more aggressively the felony re-entry cases like the ones that bogged down Purdon when he served from 2010 to 2015. The memo asked U.S. attorneys in the Southwest to submit plans outlining how they’d go after misdemeanor illegal entry cases. The “zero tolerance” policy is just another step in the same direction.

“Isn’t the reality of the situation that the Justice Department is ICE?” Erendira Castillo, an attorney who has represented defendants facing immigration prosecutions for two decades in Tucson, told HuffPost. “Let’s call a spade a spade.”

Sessions didn’t invent this policy, but he’s taking it to another level.

Sessions’ strategy isn’t new. Although living in the U.S. without authorization is a civil offense, the act of crossing the border illegally was criminalized nearly a century ago. But until about 15 years ago, it wasn’t the Justice Department’s main focus.

Back then, an uptick in the number of Central Americans and other non-Mexican migrants were crossing through the Del Rio sector of Texas. Having run out of detention bed space, the Border Patrol had no choice but let them go after issuing notices to appear in immigration court, which the migrants began referring to a “permiso,” Spanish for “permit.” To solve the problem, the departments of Justice and Homeland Security teamed up to prosecute the migrants for the misdemeanor of illegal entry under a 2005 program called Operation Streamline. But what began as a tailored effort to address a single sector’s problem quickly morphed into a borderwide initiative, swallowing up half the federal criminal docket by 2009.

“If you’re working on a misdemeanor illegal entry case, as a matter of fact, you are not working on something more serious. It is a net drain on the scarce resources of U.S. attorneys. Full stop.” - Former U.S. Attorney for North Dakota Tim Purdon

Although Sessions didn’t invent the system, what makes him unique is that he sees no limit to how much the Justice Department should duplicate the work of ICE and the Border Patrol. And to do it, he’s pressing U.S. attorneys on the border to go after the least significant cases possible.

In practice, U.S. attorneys follow different guidelines. In recent years, the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona rarely bothered prosecuting migrants for illegal entry unless they’d been caught multiple times, while in Texas first-time offenders were routinely charged.

But with illegal crossings at historic lows, prosecutors have fewer people to charge. Even after Sessions’ directives last year, criminal immigration prosecutions continued to dwindle to less than half their peak of 95,000 cases in 2009. Sessions’ answer to that trend is to urge his U.S. attorneys to file more cases against people caught crossing for the first time ― people who could be summarily deported, without the cost of jailing them for a few days and hauling them before a U.S. magistrate judge. A conviction carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison, but in practice many people receive sentences ranging from time served to three months.

Arizona was the first federal district to follow Sessions’ guidance. Six weeks after last year’s memo, the federal courthouse in Tucson was packed with dozens of first-time offenders facing charges of illegal entry, ending a local policy in place for the last four years of generally limiting prosecution to people who had been caught crossing multiple times. The defendants received sentences of one to five days in jail before being deported.

And in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, where the number of immigration prosecutions had steadily dropped since 2012, those cases nearly doubled last year to 2,149 — despite the fact that illegal crossings through Southern California last year were the lowest on record since 1969. Those figures don’t include the number of pettier cases filed in magistrate court, where the number is also rising. Nationwide, misdemeanor illegal entry cases spiked 448 percent in February, compared to the year before.

Bridget Kennedy, who has worked as a federal public defender in San Diego for the last 10 years, described prosecutions of first-time border crosses as “unheard of” in her district before Sessions’ tenure. And she’s seen a further jump this month, coinciding with Sessions’ “zero tolerance” memo. Prosecutors are also showing less discretion to dismiss what she called “outlier” cases ― like when a defendant needs a hard-to-find interpreter for an indigenous language or has a strong asylum claim ― that were once routinely dropped.

“It is a lot of federal resources being put into a lot of low-level cases,” Kennedy told HuffPost. “It’s not only the numbers, but also the position that they can’t even dismiss the extreme outlier cases.”

Some observers praise Sessions’ commitment to immigration enforcement. Johnny Sutton, the former U.S. attorney for West Texas, credited a steady rise of immigration prosecutions under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama for the drop in illegal crossings.

“Frankly, I don’t think it changes much to what they’ve already been doing in Texas for a long time,” Sutton told HuffPost. “Me, personally, I would support what Sessions is proposing.”

But others who work within the system see Sessions’ efforts to double down on immigration enforcement as a strain on the limited resources of federal judiciary. The cost to prosecute people whom Border Patrol or ICE would likely deport anyway topped $1 billion annually for incarceration alone, according to a 2012 analysis published by Austin-based advocacy group Grassroots leadership. That figure doesn’t include all the other resources that DOJ has to muster to make these cases happen: judges, public defenders, prosecutors and U.S. Marshals.

“It’s a constant single-minded effort at the front end of the criminal justice system without regard for its impact on the rest,” Judge Bernardo Velasco, who presides over immigration prosecutions in Tucson, told HuffPost. “That’s the question that the Department of Justice never asks. In other words, if you’re going to do more of A, does that mean you want to do less of B and C? They never say that, but that’s the question that has to be asked.”

Still others wonder whether the Justice Department can easily change the course set by the George W. Bush administration and institutionalized by Obama ― with or without Sessions at the helm.

“Is it really Sessions as much as the interests that the whole system has in maintaining the investment on these cases?” Castillo, the Tucson attorney, said. “Everybody’s budget relies on keeping their numbers up.”

Doubling down on such small potatoes cases might make sense if the Justice Department did an effective job confronting more serious crimes. But its track record on more complex investigations doesn’t always inspire confidence.

Some 9 million Americans lost their homes in the aftermath of the 2007 housing and financial crisis. Despite widespread allegations that fraudulent and predatory behavior on the part of banks and peddlers of predatory mortgages drove that crisis, the Justice Department secured a conviction in only one major case against an investment banker.

That institutional failure wasn’t a fluke — it’s also a reflection of the Justice Department’s priorities. As the number of immigration prosecutions grew by a factor of 11 over the last two decades, the number of prosecutions for white-collar crime in federal court plummeted by 41 percent, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The steady decline continued in 2017, Sessions’ first year as attorney general.Weary from the parade of Trump administration nominees who appear unfit for important posts, Jimmy Kimmel said on his show Wednesday: “They vet the contestants on ‘The Bachelor’ more closely than Donald Trump is vetting these Cabinet picks.”

The White House has a few questions for candidates in Republican primaries hoping for President Donald Trump’s endorsement.

Do you support ending foreign aid to Pakistan? How about withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Did you back the president’s ban on visa-holders from several Muslim-majority countries? Do you support the president’s immigration proposals, including giving DACA recipients a path to citizenship? How about his proposal for steel and aluminum tariffs?

Candidates meeting with the White House in recent weeks and months are leaving with an “Opinion Leader Questionnaire” from the Office of Political Affairs, with eight yes-or-no questions to fill out and space to elaborate on their reasoning. The questions range from layups to relatively obscure issues. Some of the questions are potentially divisive in a GOP primary.

The document, described to HuffPost by three GOP sources on condition of anonymity, reflects how the White House hopes to use GOP primaries to move the Republican Party in Trump’s direction. While former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon’s dream of a nationwide insurgency against incumbent Republicans has gone up in smoke, the White House is still looking to turn the GOP into a more populist party.

“It’s necessary for the White House to want to make sure the candidates President Trump lines up behind share his views on issues like trade, immigration and an America first foreign policy,” said one former White House official.

Here are the questions included in the document:

“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court?”

“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement?”

“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s Executive Order to suspend the issuance of visas and other immigration benefits to nationals of countries of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen?”

“Do you support or oppose the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017?”

“Do you support or oppose the President’s intention to withhold foreign security assistance to Pakistan?”

“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s Infrastructure Initiative, which calls for $200 billion in Federal funds to spur at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments with partners at the State, local, Tribal, and private level?”

“On January 30, 2018, President Trump released a framework with the following four proposals to reform our immigration system: 1. Establish a $25 billion trust fund for the border wall system, ports of entry and exit, and northern border improvements 2. Promote nuclear family migration by allowing immigration sponsorships of spouses and minor children only 3. End the visa lottery program 4. Provide legal status for DACA recipients and certain other DACA-eligible illegal immigrants. Do you support or oppose President Trump’s framework for immigration reform?”

“Do you support or oppose President Trump’s imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports?”

After each question, respondents are given the chance to check “yes” or “no,” plus a box to explain the answer.

The document appears to be evolving; some campaigns had received a seven-question version that didn’t ask about the steel or aluminum tariffs. The version viewed by HuffPost was dated March 16 and requested answers by March 30.

Of the eight questions, five divide at least some elements of the GOP. Economic conservatives and free-traders have revolted against Trump’s protectionist moves, including the tariffs and his decision to throw away the TPP, a 12-nation trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration.

Republicans who favor a robust American presence abroad are likely to question his desire to cut off aid to Pakistan. And conservatives are often unenthusiastic about Trump’s infrastructure plan.

The most controversial might be the question on Trump’s immigration principles, where border-state Republicans are often skeptical of the president’s proposed border wall and immigration hawks don’t like the decision to include permanent legal status for DACA recipients. When a proposal based on the framework came up for a vote in February, it received just 39 votes, with GOP senators opposing the proposal from both the center and the right.

While previous administrations hadn’t issued formal questionnaires to candidates, it was standard for them to gather intelligence on candidates and political leaders meeting with the president.

“The political office is trying to gather the information they need to inform the president,” said Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist who worked in the White House political office under the George W. Bush administration. “It’s absolutely their responsibility to know the political beliefs of the people the president meets with or endorses.”
