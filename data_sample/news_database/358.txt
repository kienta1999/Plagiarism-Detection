Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) slammed Haiti on Tuesday, saying the country is covered with garbage and that conditions there are “disgusting.”

Gaetz was defending President Donald Trump, who last week reportedly dismissed Haiti and African nations as “shithole” countries while meeting with lawmakers to discuss immigration.

Trump has denied the comments.

“I would not pick those terms, but I would say that the conditions in Haiti are deplorable, they are disgusting,” Gaetz told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. “I mean, everywhere you look in Haiti, it’s sheet metal and garbage when I was there.”

Earlier in the conversation, Hayes tried to engage Gaetz by asking how he’d feel if someone used Trump’s reported language to describe Florida.

“If I called ― and you’ll forgive me for using the language of the president ― but if I called Okaloosa County a shithole, you’d understandably be upset with that, right?” Hayes asked.

Gaetz, whose district includes much of Okaloosa County, replied:

“Yes; I could also prove you wrong, because I could bring you to Okaloosa County and show you that it’s the home of the most beautiful beaches in America. I don’t know that in Haiti they can make the same claim.”

Trump’s comment set off protests by the Haitian-American community, including a demonstration outside Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Monday.

“I don’t want my kids to grow up thinking their parents are from a shithole country,” protester James Leger said, according to NBC Miami. “We’re asking you to apologize to the Haitians.”

Another protester wanted to remind Trump that Haitian immigrants contribute to America.

“The president does not understand us,” Jean Bruny, a Haitian pastor in West Palm Beach, told the Palm Beach Post on Monday. “We are not coming here to do any bad thing, we are coming here for a better life and to help our family in Haiti. We pay taxes, we buy houses, we contribute to the United States.”Former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford confirmed her reported affair with President Donald Trump in a previously unpublished 2011 interview with In Touch, the magazine revealed Wednesday.

The newly disclosed comments by Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, lend credence to last week’s Wall Street Journal report that a Trump lawyer arranged a $130,000 payment to her in October 2016 ― right before the presidential election ― to keep quiet about the relationship. Trump’s legal team and Clifford have denied both the affair and the payment.

But in 2011, In Touch says, Clifford told the tabloid that she had sex with Trump in his Lake Tahoe hotel suite in the summer of 2006, the year after Trump had married his third wife, Melania Trump, and just months after she gave birth to their son, Barron Trump.

The magazine chose to publish the interview this week in light of the Journal report and Trump’s rise in significance, magazine spokeswoman Kelsi Ignomirello told HuffPost.

“Donald Trump is clearly a more relevant public figure now than he was in 2011,” she said.

Clifford told In Touch she met Trump at the American Century celebrity golf tournament in July 2006. Wicked Pictures, the adult film company Clifford worked for, was a sponsor of the tournament’s gift lounge, where Trump allegedly approached her. He asked for her phone number and invited her to dinner in his hotel room, according to the 2011 interview.

“Oh, don’t worry about [Melania],” Trump allegedly told Clifford when she asked about his marriage during dinner. The pair had sex after finishing their meal.

“I remember thinking, ‘I hope he doesn’t think I’m a hooker.’ Not that I have anything against hookers. I just personally have never done it,” Clifford told In Touch.

She described the sex as “textbook generic,” according to the magazine, and added, “I actually don’t even know why I did it, but I do remember while we were having sex, I was like, ‘Please, don’t try to pay me.’”

A friend who corroborated Clifford’s story at the time to In Touch in 2011, fellow porn star Randy Spears, recalled Clifford describing the encounter as “pretty boring.”

This isn’t the only tryst Trump allegedly pursued at the 2006 golf tournament. Just weeks before Trump’s 2016 presidential victory, adult film actress and director Jessica Drake came forward with allegations that at the event, Trump grabbed her, kissed her and offered her $10,000 for sex.

Drake is one of more than 20 women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse over several decades. He has repeatedly denied all of the allegations.

Clifford told In Touch that at the end of her evening with Trump, he promised to cast her as a contestant on his NBC reality show “The Apprentice.”

“He goes, ‘People would think you’re just this idiot with blond hair and big boobs. You would be perfect for it because you’re such a smart businesswoman,’” she recalled that Trump said.

“He told me once that I was someone to be reckoned with, beautiful and smart just like his daughter.” - Stephanie Clifford, as quoted in a 2011 interview

He used the promise of casting her as a reason to keep in touch for the next year, according to the interview, and called her from a blocked number “about every 10 days” or whenever he “saw or read about me somewhere.” Her ex-husband, Michael Mosny, corroborated her claims that she and Trump frequently spoke.

At one point in their relationship, In Touch quotes her as saying, Trump even compared her to his daughter (presumably Ivanka, since the president’s other daughter, Tiffany, was a child at the time).

“He told me once that I was someone to be reckoned with, beautiful and smart just like his daughter,” Clifford allegedly said.

Trump appeared to try to initiate sex with her again in July 2007 when she visited his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Clifford said. Her rebukes marked the beginning of the end for their relationship, she recalled.

“He just kept brushing my hair off my shoulder and kissing my neck,” she alleged. “And he was like, ‘So, can you stay?’ And I was like, ‘No, I gotta go.’ I left, and he kept calling me less and less over the coming months.”My agent once sent me to see Harvey, too. I went right up to his room at the Peninsula, which I would never normally do, but Harvey was a New York guy, so it made sense. Plus, it was in the middle of the day, and he had an assistant there. He didn’t try anything on me. Had he, I’m a little rough around the edges and I grew up around some very tough people, so I probably would have picked up a vase and cracked him over the fucking head. But I also feel completely comfortable saying that I walked into that room batting the shit out of my eyelashes. My goal in that room was to charm him, as it is in most rooms like that. You think, “Not only do I have to show that I’m a good actress, but that director also has to in some way fall in love with me and at least become enamored with me.” That never felt right or good to me. And I’ve had conversations with my agent 17 years later where I said, “You sent me into that room knowing …” They claim they didn’t know.Protesters gathered in Russell Senate Office Building on Wednesday to show support for Dreamers.

More than 80 Jewish clergy members and activists were arrested on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for protesting President Donald Trump’s plan to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.

More than a hundred rabbis and activists, some wearing prayer shawls and yarmulkes, gathered in the center of the rotunda in the Russell Senate Office Building on Wednesday morning. They sang songs, shouted cheers and made statements of support for the young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, a group of whom were watching the action from a balcony one floor up.

Police arrested 82 protesters, U.S. Capitol Police communications director Eva Malecki told HuffPost. The protesters were charged for “crowding, obstructing, or incommoding” in a public building.

Activists from Jewish groups, including the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Bend the Arc Jewish Action and the Anti-Defamation League, were there to demand immediate passage of the Dream Act, legislation that could protect nearly 800,000 Dreamers from imminent deportation and provide them with a pathway to citizenship.

“It really speaks to who we are as a Jewish community, and specifically as an American Jewish community,” Barbara Weinstein, associate director of the Religious Action Center, told HuffPost. “We as Jews know the experience of being immigrants. And as Americans, we’re deeply aware of our history as a nation of immigrants, and that throughout that history immigrants have been a source of strength for this country.”

Weinstein, who was at Wednesday’s action, said the peaceful protest was intended to bring awareness to the Dreamers’ plight and urge Congress to act on legislation that would protect them from deportation.

“This is an issue that has bipartisan support ― Republicans and Democrats know this is the right thing to do,” she said. “Now it’s Congress’s responsibility to pass a clean Dream Act.”

The Dream Act, a longstanding wish of immigration reformers, has found renewed support since the Trump administration announced in September it would terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA has shielded hundreds of thousands of Dreamers from deportation.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it would ask the Supreme Court to overturn a judge’s ruling last week that blocked the president’s move to end DACA.

Religious leaders of many faiths and denominations have been among the most vehement opponents of Trump’s decision to end DACA. In November, some 15 Christian leaders and activists were arrested at the Senate building for calling for the passage of the Dream Act.

Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, was among the clergy members arrested Wednesday.

“This is no time for business as usual,” Pesner said in a statement ahead of the protest. “In the Torah, we are called 36 different ways to love the stranger, the orphan, and the widow. We were strangers in the land of Egypt, and know what it means to be turned away from places we thought of as home.”

The rabbi added: “Today, we say there is no more time to waste. We insist that Dreamers be recognized as the Americans that they are.”OksanaKiian via Getty Images

If you’ve been toying around with the idea of a simplified wardrobe, there’s no better time to start than the winter.

When I first joined the capsule wardrobe movement last spring, my wardrobe was in a constant state of confusion. I challenged myself to 3 months of little more than 30 pieces of clothing (inspired by Courtney Carver and her #project333), and though I had prepared for an average spring, the weather had other plans. I was dipping in and out of my winter clothes ― putting them back up, only to pull them out again a few days later. Needless to say, it was not the smoothest transition into the capsule lifestyle.

Looking forward to the weekend #fridayeve #sweaterweather A post shared by Nordstrom (@nordstrom) on Jan 11, 2018 at 4:08pm PST

Fast-forward to today, in the dead of winter, and I’ve mastered my capsule game. Winter is pretty predictably cold, so it’s easier to focus on warm layers. I have a sturdy collection of sweaters, long-sleeve tees, and vests to mix and match. On warmer winter days, I remove a layer; on colder ones, I add.

Another bonus? Getting dressed now takes less than five minutes. If you’re wondering when’s the best time to jump into a minimalist wardrobe, there’s no better season than right now.

To make the transition easier, I’ve outlined the essential 10-piece checklist you need to start a winter capsule wardrobe. Take a look below:After waiting an hour for Bernstein to return, Woodward said, he left the park to meet a girlfriend, whose last name and address Woodward told police he could not remember. He said he returned hours later to look for Bernstein.

Detectives found “abrasions, scratches and dirt” on Woodward’s hands when they interviewed him last week, according to the affidavit. When asked about the lacerations, Woodward reportedly said he had been participating in a “fight club” and had fallen into a “dirt puddle” while sparring.

According to the affidavit, Woodward’s fists were clenched as he claimed Bernstein had kissed him on the lips during their time together that night. He told investigators that he pushed Bernstein away and wanted to call him a “faggot.”

Text messages reviewed by investigators suggested Woodward knew Bernstein may have been trying to sexually pursue him, according to the Register. The affidavit indicated Bernstein had suspected Woodward was closeted.Two Catholic school girls look on as priests file into the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston for Mass.

Pope Francis has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t think women could ever become priests in the Catholic church. But the pope has indicated he’s interested in clarifying whether there’s historical precedent for women to serve as ordained deacons, who can perform some of the duties of a priest.

A new survey of American Catholic women suggests many are ready for that change.

A 60 percent majority of American Catholic women support the possibility of women being ordained as permanent deacons, according to a wide-ranging survey commissioned by America Media and conducted by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, in partnership with survey firm GfK.

Twenty-one percent of respondents said they may be supportive but wanted to learn more before making a final decision. Only 7 percent definitely said they would not support women being ordained as deacons.

Catholic women who attended Mass weekly were less likely than more infrequent Mass attenders to respond “yes” to the idea of women deacons. But even among weekly attendees, a slight majority (53 percent) agreed the church should allow women to be ordained as deacons.

A permanent deacon in the Catholic church can preach during Mass, perform baptisms, witness marriages and conduct funeral services. He can be married or single, and has to be at least 35 years old.

In 2016, Pope Francis created a special commission to study the possibility of women serving as deacons. Because of an emphasis on continuity and tradition in the Catholic church, Francis is likely not interested in changing the status quo or applying modern societal standards to the question of women’s ordination. The commission was only created to study whether there’s a historical precedent for women to serve as deacons.

Experts in Catholic church law have supported the idea of women deacons in the past. Some scholars claim there’s ample evidence of women being ordained to the diaconate from the early years of the church and into the Middle Ages. But others fear that opening the diaconate to women could one day undermine the church’s all-male priesthood.

According to Phyllis Zagano, a Catholic scholar at Hofstra University who was named to the pope’s commission on women deacons, women in the U.S. and around the world are already performing duties similar to those of deacons. She believes ordaining women as deacons would assure women they are also created in the image of Christ.

“The Church and its bishops can train, ordain, and give faculties to the women already working in diaconal roles in the US and elsewhere,” Zagano told HuffPost in 2016. “In doing so, it would recognize the deep anger so many women have in being told ― implicitly or explicitly ― that women cannot image Christ.”

The question about women deacons was just one part of the survey from America Media and CARA about the lives and opinions of Catholic women today. Researchers also found that while the overwhelming majority of American Catholic women believe in God, Mass attendance and participation in sacraments such as confession is dwindling, especially among younger Catholics. Only 17 percent of millennial Catholics indicated that they attend Mass at least once a week.

The survey results were “a real wake-up call for the Catholic Church to focus harder on its millennial outreach and to engage them in new and creative ways,” said Kerry Weber, executive editor of America Media.Twitter

You might imagine that a senator would have a way of communicating with the president other than an endless series of pitifully one-sided tweets. Surely, you think, a senator — let’s say a seven-term senator — who wanted to share a newspaper column with the president might have a means for doing so beyond his own burbling Twitter feed.

I’m afraid you’re unfamiliar with Chuck Grassley, the Republican senior senator from Iowa, who, like so many of his fellow Americans, has spent the first year of the Trump era shouting incoherent things at the president on the internet.

Grassley is the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is also a man whose Twitter aesthetic is best described as “19th-century village drunk tries to send a telegraph.” Concision reigns. Typos flower. Words cling together, as if for safety. He once tweeted an anecdote about hitting a deer, presumably with a car. “Assume deer dead,” he concluded.

For whatever reason, Grassley has decided that Twitter is the ideal medium through which to communicate with President Donald Trump. Below is a year’s worth of Grassley bellowing into the void about Iowa and ethanol and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, apparently in a vain attempt at influencing a man who will never even hear his half-literate cries. Here’s to three more years of this. Please no one tell Chuck Grassley about phones.

@realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas Mr President — ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) December 24, 2017The Trump administration has quietly eliminated funding for NASA’s research program that tracks greenhouse gases around the world.

According to Science, the Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) tracks the world’s flow of carbon dioxide from space. Such a system is critical to monitoring any improvements — or failures — in attempts to cut the pollution linked to climate change.

NASA spokesman Steve Cole told the magazine that the program was canceled due to ”budget constraints and higher priorities within the science budget.” Usually, Congress battles such cuts, but this time, there was simply no mention of the program’s $10 million annual budget in the White House budget.

Although existing grants will finish, Cole said, no new projects will be undertaken. NASA’s budget report for fiscal year 2019 assumes the “termination” of CMS.

Many of the projects CMS has tracked involved how effectively forests, including tropical forests, trap carbon dioxide. Carbon measurements were also critical for compliance with air pollution reduction goals, such as those required by the Paris climate agreement. In June 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the accord.

“If you cannot measure emissions reductions, you cannot be confident that countries are adhering to the agreement,” Tufts University environment professor Kelly Sims Gallagher told Science. She also called canceling the NASA program a “grave mistake.”

Climate change expert Rachel Licker of the Union of Concerned Scientists also told the BBC that “dismantling CMS will adversely affect our ability to track flows of carbon through our land, oceans and atmosphere.”

Europe has one carbon-monitoring satellite of its own and is on track to develop more. As the U.S. under Trump turns increasingly to fossil fuels, including coal, experts warn that it will cede developing cutting-edge technology focusing on pollution reduction and alternative fuels to other nations.Martinan via Getty Images A sunshine baby is one who was born before a miscarriage, stillbirth, infant death or other early loss of a child.

The world of parenting has its own language. Over the years, some of this vocabulary has gained wider currency, like the term “rainbow baby,” which refers to a child born after a miscarriage, stillbirth, infant death or other early loss of a child.

There’s another related term that hasn’t reached the mainstream yet: “sunshine baby.”

A sunshine baby is one who was born before a miscarriage, stillbirth, infant death or other early loss of a child. Just as a rainbow baby represents the hope after a storm, a sunshine baby represents the calm before. The child lost is often referred to as an “angel baby.”

After losing her angel baby, Angelique Zachara turned to crafting to find healing, celebrate her sunshine baby and nurture her hope for a rainbow baby.

For Zachara, a sunshine baby also represents hope. “You were able to conceive one child successfully,” she told HuffPost. “Even though that often gets brought up when going through a miscarriage, and that’s not really what you want to hear, truthfully we are lucky enough to have one, whereas some people were never given that chance or had that taken away from them.”

“Most women who encounter loss believe they are flawed or broke,” said Rachael DuVall, a follower of the Facebook page Miscarriage Mamas. “We internalize and blame ourselves for our miscarriages, so sunshine babies give the hope that it is possible and there is nothing wrong with mom and dad, it was just something that happened.”

Jessica Zucker, a clinical psychologist who specializes in women’s reproductive and maternal mental health, has researched the ways that loss affects family dynamics. She told HuffPost the idea of a sunshine baby can have different meanings for different families.

“Depending on the circumstances of the subsequent loss, mothers might look back at the naiveté they were able to relish with the ‘sunshine baby.’ This child might come to represent a period of relative calm or, at the very least, a grief-free period of parenting,” she explained.

Aleksandar Nakic via Getty Images

This sentiment resonates with Zucker herself, whose second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 16 weeks.

“Sometimes I find myself reminiscing about who I was as a woman and a mother prior to my pregnancy loss and the maze of grief I navigated afterward,” she said. “Included in those daydreams are all the moments with my ‘sunshine baby,’ my son, who came into the world after a very smooth and peaceful pregnancy. He entered a home not tinged with remnants of mourning.”

Zucker believes that using symbols like “sunshine” and “rainbow” helps us talk about loss and hope.

“I find the terms important in that they acknowledge the complexity of pregnancy and infant loss and the pregnancies that follow,” she said. “Losing a wanted pregnancy invariably impacts the way we feel about the children we have underfoot and/or those we hold in our hearts. I think as a culture it behooves us to recognize just how challenging these losses can be for women and families, and these terms help ground us in that.”

But Misty Hernandez, a moderator for Miscarriage Mamas, doesn’t particularly like the term sunshine baby.

“I honestly don’t think it is a positive thing,” she told HuffPost. “The term ‘sunshine’ is taken away from any parent whose first pregnancy resulted in a loss. Some women may mourn the loss of their sunshine even more once they realize that they will never, ever experience one.”Attorneys general from 22 states have banded together to sue the Federal Communications Commission for axing net neutrality rules the Obama administration put in place in 2015.

Despite opposition from politicians, digital consumers and even a top FCC official, the agency voted last month to repeal net neutrality regulations that classified the internet as a public utility and required internet service providers to deliver all digital content at the same speed.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman took the first step toward suing the FCC and the federal government over the rollback by filing a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Schneiderman is leading the multistate lawsuit, backed by a coalition of attorneys general from 20 other states ― California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington ― and the District of Columbia.

The attorneys general, all of whom are Democrats, claim that the FCC broke federal law when it reversed the net neutrality rules.

“An open internet ― and the free exchange of ideas it allows ― is critical to our democratic process,” Schneiderman said in a statement Tuesday. “The repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers ― allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online.”

President Barack Obama established net neutrality in 2015 so that ISPs couldn’t offer faster speed and better access to large companies ― Netflix and Facebook, for example ― who can pay more than smaller companies.

Some experts believe that without the the Title II regulations that classify the internet as a public utility, smaller companies will be pitted against digital giants such as Netflix and Hulu in a money bid over faster delivery speeds. The rollback could also give internet providers the power to block lawful websites, apps or digital content at their own discretion.

Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin slammed the FCC and the Trump administration on Tuesday for giving more power to big digital companies.

“Big business must not be deciding what people in Hawaii can access on the Internet and how easily we can access it,” Chin said in a statement. “This lawsuit challenges the rushed attempt, riddled with irregularities, by the Trump Administration to rollback net neutrality.”

In December, Schneiderman announced his plans to sue the FCC, shortly after the agency voted to repeal net neutrality regulations.Black outfits that many actors and actresses wore at the 2018 Golden Globes to raise awareness about the Time’s Up initiative against workplace sexual harassment will be auctioned this week to benefit the cause.

Time’s Up, eBay and Condé Nast on Wednesday announced a partnership to auction the clothes on Friday, with proceeds going to the Time’s Up legal defense fund.

“We’re thrilled that actors and others in the entertainment industry are leading in this extraordinary way to end the scourge of workplace sexual harassment,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, which administers the Time’s Up’s fund.

“Each time they’ve stepped up they’ve inspired more attorneys to join the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund and more individuals to contribute,” Graves added.

Actress Jameela Jamil wants men to do better.

In the wake of sexual assault allegations against comedian Aziz Ansari, Jamil, star of the TV series “The Good Place,” has some advice. In a post on her website titled “What We Need to Learn from the Aziz Ansari Clusterfuck,” Jamil says she has “no right, nor inclination, to comment,” on the assault allegations against Ansari, and instead focuses on the concept of consent.

The Ansari story “has indeed sparked an interesting conversation about consent, both technical and more importantly, emotional, and how vital it is to read the room and make sure the other person is not just willing, but damn well enthusiastic,” Jamil writes. “Especially, in my opinion, if that person is the one to be penetrated. You want to enter them. You best ensure you are a welcome guest, not someone who just begged, pressured, guilt-tripped or harassed their way inside.”

Jamil points to the “bullshit fantasy” of pornography as a main reason men feel they can objectify women.

“We have allowed pornography to continuously promote that narrative that a woman is a hole for a man to enjoy when and how he feels like it,” the British-born actress writes, arguing that the mentality leads to women finding sex dissatisfying.

“Learning sex from pornography is like learning how to drive from The Fast and the Furious. A terrible idea,” she writes.

Jamil also places blame on popular culture, and blasts music videos, “where the girls are always practically naked and performing rehearsed dance routines for the men, who are sitting there on their arses, sometimes in outdoor winter layers, doing nothing other than enjoying their needs being met.”

She critiques music lyrics as well, which she says have gone from “’Try a little tenderness,” to “MURDER THAT PUSSY. BEAT THAT PUSSY UP. PUT THAT PUSSY IN A TOASTER. SHRED THE PUSSY AND PUT IT IN THE BIN. THROW THE PUSSY OUT THE WINDOW. FLUSH THE PUSSY DOWN THE TOILET.

″(Poor old pussy having a terrible time.)”

The culture’s message to men, Jamil says, is that they “do not need to worry about what our needs and boundaries are.”

Which is why Jamil argues that mere consent isn’t enough.

“CONSENT SHOULDN’T BE THE GOLD STANDARD,” she writes. “That should be the basic foundation. Built upon that foundation should be fun, mutual passion, equal arousal, interest and enthusiasm.”

Jamil’s response to babe.net’s story about Ansari — which Jezebel calls “amateurish” and says “left the subject open to further attacks” — echoes the sentiments of some female writers who have raised the story of a young woman’s crushing experience as an opportunity to discuss what women have been conditioned to expect in their romantic and sexual lives.

“If the #MeToo movement is going to amount to sustained culture change ― rather than simply a weeding out of the worst actors in a broken system ― we need to renegotiate the sexual narratives we’ve long accepted,” wrote HuffPost’s Emma Gray. “And that involves having complicated conversations about sex that is violating but not criminal.”

Jamil suggests those conversations sometimes need to happen during sex, and encouraged women to “act in honour of your needs” (that is, she mentions, as long as one feels safe).

Jamil urges men to step up as well.In a bizarre tweet that was quickly removed, Brit Hume of Fox News assured the world on Tuesday night that he was not fantasizing about President Donald Trump’s penis.

Hume, a former Fox News anchor and current senior political analyst, was defending Trump’s health exam results on social media from those casting doubt on the president’s listed height of 6′3″ and weight of 239 pounds (one pound short of the number that would be considered obese).

“I’m his height and weigh about 190. He looks about 50 pounds heavier than I am,” Hume wrote in reply to one critic. “And I’m inclined to believe his highly regarded doctor over some eyeball estimates made from a distance.”

“Daily Show” writer and producer Matt Negrin tweeted:

Hume’s reply was deleted, but widely shared:

The deleted tweet got quite a rise out of Hume’s fellow Twitter users:

But Negrin, who started the whole thing, may have summed the evening up best:Actress Pam Grier poses for a photo circa 1972 in Los Angeles. Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images

A Pam Grier biopic is in the works.

The 1970s icon confirmed that the film, tentatively titled “Pam,” will bring her life story to the big screen and follow the various relationships she discussed in her memoir, including her romance with comedian Richard Pryor. Former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Jay Pharoah has already been picked to portray Pryor.

The “Foxy Brown” actress, who wrote about her relationship with the comedian in her book Foxy: My Life in Three Acts, told Deadline that she thought Pharoah was the perfect person to play Pryor.

“I watched him and heard his voice and closed my eyes and said, ‘It’s Richard,’” she said.

Pharoah, who read a script by Bennie Richburg, told Deadline that the story is “heartbreaking, raw, honest and beautiful, all rolled into one testimony.”

Grier is known for dominating the blaxploitation film era with classic roles in movies like “Coffy,” “Jackie Brown” and “Sheba, Baby.” She made her mark in Hollywood by becoming one of the first black female leads to star in several action films. Taraji P. Henson gave a nod to Grier’s legacy with her most recent film, “Proud Mary.”This is the world's DEADLIEST cat. Seriously. Look at her. 😍 pic.twitter.com/U2WHDx0Avd — BBC One (@BBCOne) January 15, 2018

The deadliest cat in the world isn’t a lion or tiger. It’s the black-footed cat, which weighs less than 5 pounds, making it one of the smallest cats in Africa, per National Geographic.

A new video from the BBC’s “Big Cats” series features an adorable black-footed cat nicknamed Gyra and shows why she’s oh so deadly.

Check it out above.White supremacists in the United States killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, and were responsible for far more murders than domestic Islamic extremists, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America, a new report states.

The report, “Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2017,” published Tuesday by the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said extremists killed 34 people last year. Twenty of those victims — or 59 percent — were killed by right-wing extremists, a designation that includes white supremacists, members of the so-called “alt-right” and “alt-lite,” and members of the anti-government militia movement.

Of the 34 people killed, 18 were murdered by white supremacists, marking a 157 percent increase over the 7 people killed by white supremacists in 2016.

That’s also double the number of people killed by domestic Islamic extremists in 2017. Nine people were killed by domestic Islamic extremists last year, according to the report, eight of whom died in a single attack in New York.

Anti-Defamation League

In 2016, Islamic extremists were responsible for the bulk, about 71 percent, of domestic extremist murders in the U.S. This was largely an “aberration” however, the report states, due to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in which Omar Mateen killed 49 people and then pledged his allegiance to ISIS.

2017 marked a reversion back to the long-term trend in America, in which right-wing violence accounts for the majority of murders by domestic extremists.

From 2008 through 2017, according to the ADL, right-wing extremists have killed 274 people. That’s 71 percent of the 387 murders committed by extremists over the past 10 years.

Anti-Defamation League

“Americans do not have the luxury to ignore any extremist threat, including threats posed by white supremacists who are weaponizing social media and are more likely to take their actions into the streets,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s CEO, told HuffPost in a statement. “Their actions fuel controversy and conflict and their racist rhetoric and hateful ideas can inspire violence.”

The horror of right-wing extremism gained national attention in August, when more than a thousand white supremacists held a large rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The assorted racists and fascists, emboldened by President Donald Trump’s election, weren’t ashamed to show their faces, nor did they shy away from violence.

At the end of the rally, James Alex Fields Jr., a member of the far-right extremist group Vanguard America, allegedly drove his car into a crowd of protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Earlier that year in May, a right-wing extremist named Jeremy Christian allegedly stabbed two men to death aboard a train in Portland, Oregon, as they tried to stop Christian from harassing two teenage girls, one of whom was black and one of whom wore hijab.

Also in May, a University of Maryland student named Sean Urbanski, who belonged to a bigoted Facebook group called “Alt-Reich Nation,” fatally stabbed Richard W. Collins III, an African-American student at Bowie State University. A prosecutor later stated that there was “lots of digital evidence” proving that the murder was racially motivated.

In March, a white supremacist from Maryland named James Harris Jackson, who frequented the alt-right website The Daily Stormer, traveled to New York to kill black men. Using a sword, he fatally stabbed a 66-year-old black man named Timothy Caughman in midtown Manhattan. He then turned himself into police.

And in December of last year, two young white supremacists on opposite sides of the country allegedly committed double homicides. In Virginia, 17-year-old Nicholas Giampa, who’d grown enamored with a neo-Nazi group called Atomwaffen Division, killed his girlfriend’s parents after they had convinced their daughter to break up with Giampa because of his racist beliefs. In Aztec, New Mexico, 21-year-old William Atchison, who frequented white supremacist sites like The Daily Stormer, and who had grown obsessed with school shootings, killed two students at a local high school. Atchison took his own life, and Giampa attempted to and remains hospitalized in critical condition.

The increase in right-wing extremist murders helped make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence since 1970, according to the ADL.

The deadliest attack last year, however, wasn’t committed by a white supremacist, but allegedly by Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic extremist accused of driving a truck into a bike path lane in lower Manhattan, killing 8 people.

Anti-Defamation League

Although murders by extremists represent only a tiny fraction of the overall murder rate in the U.S. each year, “because of their nature they can have outsized impact, affecting entire communities — or even an entire country — in ways many deaths may not,” the ADL said in its report.

Moreover, the ADL noted, the deaths described in its report represent “the tip of a pyramid of extremist violence and crime in the United States; for each person actually killed by an extremist, many more are wounded or injured in attempted murders and assaults.”

Greenblatt, the ADL CEO, wrote an article in The Atlantic on Tuesday imploring the public to take the threat of right-wing violence more seriously.

“In recent years, much of the public discussion and the federal government’s focus have been on the violent threat posed by extremists inspired by ISIS, while less attention has been paid to the reality of right-wing violence,” Greenblatt wrote. “There’s no doubt that Islamic extremism is a significant threat, but we shouldn’t ignore any forms of extremism — we must tackle them all.”

On Tuesday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said in a tweet that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen “failed to mention” the threat of domestic terror by white supremacists during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that day.

It is deeply troubling that when talking about threats to our nation, Secretary Nielsen failed to mention a report that talks about some of the most rampant terror attacks that face our nation — domestic acts of terror, including white supremacist extremists. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 16, 2018

The Trump administration last year revoked federal funding for a program aimed at de-radicalizing neo-Nazis. And after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last August, the president defended the racists who gathered there, saying there were “very fine people on both sides” of that day’s demonstration.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Giampa had killed himself. He attempted to, and is hospitalized and in critical condition.

Children’s books are popular presents for newborns, but if you’re the gift-giver, the options can seem endless.

We asked members of the HuffPost Parents community to share the kids’ books they come back to again and again when they need a gift for a baby shower. Some may be more for the parents (hello, Go the F**k to Sleep), while others are classics that kids have cherished for generations.

Here are 45 children’s books (of the more than 500 suggestions we received) to consider giving at baby showers:

“Go the F**k to Sleep by Adam Mansbach because it’s so true and funny when you’re sleep-deprived.” ― Rebecca Kenneally Hatch

“Love You Forever by Robert Munsch. It’s a really sweet book that I think helps kids understand that even when they make us crazy, we can’t not love them. I don’t know anyone (who’s a parent) who can read that book without tearing up.” ― Kelly Allen

“On The Night You Were Born by Nancy Tillman. I just love reading it, the words feel like they are coming out of my heart.” ― Lisa Silverman Gorman

“Ezra Jack Keats’ The Snowy Day because it’s hard to find quality children’s books with brown characters, and I like to normalize books with girls and minorities as main characters for children as early as possible.” ― Monique Lafourche Delaney

“Love The Going to Bed Book by Sandra Boynton. I have been reading it to my son since he was born, and now at the age of 2 he ‘reads’ it with me. Sometimes when he’s tired he will quote the last page in the book: ‘The moon is high. The sea is deep. They rock and rock and rock to sleep.’” ― Michelle Ducharme

“A is for Activist and Counting on Community, both by Innosanto Nagara. I think it’s very important to begin to instill a sense of awareness and an appreciation for justice, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, and other important issues at a young age.” ― Laura Meixell Kuhlmann

“Little Blue Truck by Alice Schertle. Such a sweet story about kindness and teamwork. We can recite it by heart in our house. Given it out many times as gifts to friends and teachers.” ― Nicole McConnell

“The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn. It’s hard to let your children go to preschool or kindergarten. This book has a Mama Raccoon who kisses her child’s palm before she leaves him at school. If he misses her he can place his palm with the kiss on his cheek, and he will know his mother loves him. Baby Raccoon also kisses his mother’s palm before he heads off to school. Real love endures even when we’re away from our loved ones. Sweet story. Beautiful artwork.” ― Donna Worthington Shiro

“Guess How Much I Love You by Sam McBratney. It’s a sweet story of the baby bunny and its dad, proclaiming who loves who more. The illustrations are charming and the story is a nice, short read for bedtime.” ― Kyndra Elston

“I give the book I wrote titled Esteban de Luna, Baby Rescuer! I wrote it after I had my son to encourage little boys to see the skills of caring and nurturing as ‘superhero’ skills. Plus, it features baby-wearing and it’s bilingual!” ― Larissa Mercado-Lopez

“I Love You, Stinky Face by Lisa McCourt. For the same reasons many have said about their suggestions, no matter how gross they get, how scary or awful they behave, we will find a way to love them ― no matter what.” ― Jessica Case

“The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle. I grew up with it, read it to both my girls, and now my oldest daughter reads it to her baby sister. That book is like a tradition.” ― Morgan Allen

“Giraffes Can’t Dance by Giles Andreae is one of our faves to give. Everyone has their own beat and you just do you, don’t worry about what anyone else’s talents or gifts are, you have your own!” ― Amanda Hanstad

“Miss Rumphius by Barbara Cooney. The illustrations are gorgeous, and the idea of the book, to find a way to make the world more beautiful, is really a lovely thought, I think.” ― Alexis Dionne Campbell

“Everywhere Babies by Susan Meyers. It’s a simple board book talking about how no matter where babies are born, they have families who love them, rock them, feed them, play with them. The artwork is beautiful and I love how diverse the families are in the book.” ― Meaghan Breaux

“Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes by Mem Fox. Talks about how we’re all the same despite our different backgrounds and how this little child is especially precious because they’re ‘mine all mine.’ A sweet little rhyme.” ― Keren Strathearn

“You Are My I Love You by Maryann Cusimano Love, illustrated by Satomi Ichikawa. This book shows the impact that parents and children have on each other. It shows the relational balance between parent and child. It is so simple and relatable.” ― Shannon Turner-Ivsek

“Each Peach Pear Plum from Allan and Janet Ahlberg. Lovely to read. Beautiful rhymes and illustration. Both kids loved it. Always give it as a present.” ― Ana Camelo

“The Runaway Bunny by Margaret Wise Brown. Beautiful illustrations and great message of providing support while allowing kids to have independence and adventure.” ― Suzen Ruis

“Chicka Chicka Boom Boom from Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault. I love giving this book because it’s lyrical and fun to read a lot. As babies get older, it’s fun for them to start reading as they recognize the letters and sounds.” ― Natasha Lewis

“Outside Over There by Maurice Sendak. The main character is a girl who saves her baby sister. I appreciate a children’s book with a strong female character! I also love this book because it teaches children to have a good imagination with their ordinary world around them.” ― Rachel LaCour

“Rosie Revere, Engineer by Andrea Beaty. It’s for older kids but the rhymes are wonderful, the theme is poignant and timely, and the drawings are colorful and warm. I love giving this book to future parents of girls.” ― Caity Yaussi

“Someday by Alison McGhee. I still can’t even read it without choking up. It is about the life cycle, about your first memories with your baby, watching them grow, the conflicting feelings you have in life. It says so much with so few words. The line is something like, ‘Sometimes I watch you sleep, and I dream too...’ (seriously crying just writing this and my kid is 4-and-a-half).” ― Amber Manke

“The Wonderful Things You Will Be by Emily Winfield Martin ― multicultural, with the sweetest faces and soft artwork, wondering what the little one might be like as he/she grows. And it subtly breaks gender biases, too.” ― Diane Dietz

“Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? from Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle. All of my babies have loved this book. We all have it memorized and when we are in the car and the youngest one gets fussy we all start reciting the book, with the same pace and inflection I did when they were all babies. I always give it as a gift for a baby shower or first birthday.” ― Wendy Fortner

“The Paper Bag Princess by Robert Munsch, especially for little girls. Early lessons in empowerment.” ― Rebecca Erin

“Why Does Mommy Have Tattoos? by Marilyn Rondon is colorful and quick, but it was a cute read about tattoos. Most of them I have myself so my son loved pointing out mine that matched the part in the story. Absolutely love it.” ― Lauren Elizabeth Metzel

“Sleep Like a Tiger by Mary Logue. The art is gorgeous and it tells the story of a little girl going to bed so gently. In response to her assertion that she isn’t tired, her parents just say, ’We understand. Please brush your teeth. You can stay up as late as you like.′ It’s just lovely and presents an example of engaging with your child that isn’t adversarial. I think it’s a nice model and so pretty.” ― Allison Sook

“Let Me Hold You Longer by Karen Kingsbury. We focus so much on our kids’ ‘firsts’ but sometimes miss the last time that they’ll ever do some of these things. My grandmother gave it to me for my first child and I give it at every baby shower I go to. I can’t read it without crying but it is a beautiful book.” ― Heather Todd

“Wherever You Are, My Love Will Find You by Nancy Tillman. We are a military family and right before my husband’s third deployment he recorded that book for our children. This meant so much to our children being able to hear his voice. So now I give this book to my friends/family having babies because usually I’m the one that doesn’t live close by. I want them to know I’ll love them no matter where I am.” ― Kassie Rice

“Russell the Sheep by Rob Scotton. Brilliant children’s book. It’s about a sheep who can’t fall asleep like the rest of the flock.” ― Marie Aldous

“Llama Llama Red Pajama from Anna Dewdney is my son’s favorite book. The baby llama wants his momma (he’s supposed to be going to sleep) and screams bloody murder when she doesn’t come back up right away. Good book for opening conversations about patience, anxiety, and nighttime fears! Ten years later, I can still recite it from memory. Also check out a recent rap version by Ludacris on YouTube.” ― Elizabeth Washburn Galbraith

“Wish by Matthew Cordell. I know far too many couples who have struggled to get pregnant or who have lost babies. This is a beautiful book that outlines that struggle and the wish of the parents to have their family grow.” ― Kayla Stremel

“Welcome, Baby by Barbara Reid. As a new mom wanting to read a book to her newborn it was perfect. The length was great for a newborn and infant, and it is dead-on without being over the top sappy about how it is to welcome a baby into your world.” ― Behnaz Somji

“The Snail and the Whale by Julia Donaldson. A really intricate story about travel, and family, and beauty, and awe, and carving your own path, and how even small things and people can make a big impact on the world and those they love, but it’s so accessible to even small kids, and so beautifully written. Sometimes I read it just for myself.” ― Meghan Hart Arbuckle

“Stellaluna by Janell Cannon. Perfect length, great story. Cute silly bits, a perfect message of inclusion and acceptance. And opens up a conversation about how to deal with embarrassment, as well as modeling non-bullying behavior perfectly.” ― Stefany Brianne Stevenson Hess

“Hush Little Keiki by Kim Vukovich. Lovely Hawaiian version of the classic lullaby, but so much more beautiful. I love finding books with local relevance; this has been my favorite.” ― Erica Hanley

“Something From Nothing by Phoebe Gilman. Two parallel stories happening, one about a little boy and his faith in his grandfather; the other follows a little mouse family who lives underneath the floors of the little boy. My daughter made me read it, night after night, and 10 years later I’m rereading it with my youngest.” ― Tara Dean

“The ‘Lil’ Libros’ collection [by Patty Rodriguez and Ariana Stein]! If you haven’t looked them up, I recommend you do. They are amazing bilingual board books with amazing illustrations.” ― Karina Wong

“The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf. He just wants to smell the roses, be happy, and be himself.” ― Stephanie Tapia

“The Monster at the End of This Book by Jon Stone is my favorite to give because it speaks directly to kids and involves them in the story. It really makes them giggle, too.” ― Kristin Miller

“One of the ‘BabyLit’ primer board books (Pride & Prejudice for counting, Sherlock Holmes for sounds, etc.). They’re sturdy, colorful, fun, and introduce the classics!” ― Mellissa Miller

“I like Older Than The Stars by Karen C. Fox. It’s a great way to introduce scientific literacy at a young age.” ― Victoria Simms

“Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein. It’s creative, fun, and can be enjoyed at any stage of life.” ― Amber McGaw
