President Donald Trump announced he has ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take steps to ban bump stocks, the type of gun modification that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock used to kill 58 people in October.

“Just a few moments ago, I signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,” Trump said Tuesday while speaking at a medal of valor ceremony at the White House. “I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized ... very soon.”

“The Department understands this is a priority for the President and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process,” the DOJ said. “We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed.”

Bump stocks are devices that allow a semiautomatic rifle to fire as quickly as a machine gun. The accessory replaces the firearm’s stock ― the piece that rests against the shoulder ― and harnesses its recoil to slide the gun rapidly back and forth onto the shooter’s trigger finger, firing each time.

Paddock was found to be in possession of more than a dozen assault-style rifles, many outfitted with bump stocks and 100-round magazines. He was ultimately able to fire more than 1,100 rounds in a period of 10 minutes.

In 2010 and again in 2012, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled that it did not have the authority to regulate bump stocks because they are not technically “machine guns,” which federal law defines as firearms that shoot more than one shot per pull of the trigger. As an executive agency, the ATF can’t officially make new laws. Instead, it’s limited to interpreting and enforcing acts of Congress ― in this case, gun control laws passed in 1934 and 1968.

Justice Department officials said in December that they do not believe they could regulate bump stock sales without congressional action, according to The New York Times.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to ban bump stocks and other similar accessories in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, but the measure appeared to have stalled in recent months. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who sponsored one of the bills, said Trump’s announcement marked a “good step forward,” but called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to bring his proposal to the floor for a vote.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who sponsored a similar Senate bill, called the announcement a “small, but vital step.”

Sign after sign this week that we've hit a fulcrum point in this debate where politicians are, for the first time, scared on the political consequences of inaction on guns. Small, but vital step in the history of our movement. https://t.co/LVRAyPnzRp — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 20, 2018

ATF announced in December that it would explore the possibility of regulating bump stocks as machine guns, and asked the public to submit comments on the proposal. In the end, 85 percent of the more than 32,000 comments expressed opposition to such regulation, according to an analysis conducted by The Trace.

“I am directing the Department of Justice to dedicate all available resources to complete the review of the comments received, and, as expeditiously as possible, to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns,” Trump said Tuesday in a statement.

A number of states and local jurisdictions have taken up the debate over bump stocks in the meantime. Massachusetts and New Jersey have both passed laws banning the devices. Several states, including Connecticut and Washington, as well as smaller municipalities, are also considering similar measures.Lucy Nicholson / Reuters

Sibling figure skaters Maia and Alex Shibutani set the internet alight after winning bronze for Team USA at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday.

The brother and sister duo — known as the “Shib Sibs” — nabbed third in the figure skating ice dance event. Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir won gold, and France’s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron grabbed silver.

The siblings’ podium-ascending performance captivated people on Twitter, including “Saturday Night Live” comedian Leslie Jones, who shared this video of their routine:

Former Olympic figure skating champion Meryl Davis shared this adorable throwback GIF of the pair in celebration:

The shooting came at a time when the White House was on the defensive after the latest indictments in the Russia investigation and new reports accusing Trump of having an affair with former Playboy model Karen McDougal as well as porn star Stormy Daniels, among other developments.

“For everyone, it was a distraction or a reprieve,” the official said in an article published Monday. “A lot of people here felt like it was a reprieve from seven or eight days of just getting pummeled.”

The source, who was not named, compared the Florida shooting aftermath to that of the Las Vegas massacre last year, in which 58 people were killed and close to 500 others injured.Ariana Kukors holds up her bronze medal for the women's 200-meter individual medley final during the 14th FINA World Championships on July 25, 2011.

Former Olympic swimmer Ariana Kukors says she was 13 years old when her coach, Sean Hutchison, began grooming her for a sexually abusive relationship. She says they often met for coffee and he texted her constantly, sometimes asking her sexually suggestive questions.

By the time she was 16, Kukors says the relationship turned sexual. She says Hutchison often had her sit on his lap and, later, progressed to kissing her in elevators and touching her over her clothes.

“I’d never been physical with anyone before but I now found myself alone with him, engaging in sexual acts and trying to hide my embarrassment when he sat in the women’s locker room and watched me shower,” Kukors recently wrote on her website after going public with her allegations against Hutchison. “But he said he loved me, and I thought he held the keys to my future ― not just to my swimming career, but to my whole life.”

Kukors wrote that it was the beginning of “an extensive, abusive, and incredibly manipulative relationship” that lasted until she was 24 years old.

“I think back on those times now, tearfully asking why no one helped me, why no one stepped in to save me from this monster. It’s still hard to comprehend, but Sean had perfected the art of grooming; I wasn’t even aware I needed saving,” she wrote. “And as long as I swam fast, it seemed easy enough for the organizations that have masterfully buried these tragedies for years, to once again brush off the rumors [of our relationship].”

Hutchison has denied all allegations, writing in a statement that "at no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual."

Now, at 28, Kukors is ready to take on USA Swimming and other institutions she says enabled Hutchison for so long.

“I’m trying to process all this information, and I think I really just want to start asking questions,” Kukors told HuffPost. “What signs were missed? How can we change the environment that really enabled this to occur? How did we miss these things for so long? How can we raise awareness?”

Kukors’ experience aligns with a recent report from the Southern California News Group that found that USA Swimming ignored or covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases over the course of a few decades. Insiders told SCNG that it’s somewhat common for coaches to have sexual relationships with their athletes, leading some to marry the swimmers they once coached.

Her accusation also comes on the heels of the recent USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal involving former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar, and similarly argues that people in power only cared about winning and safeguarding the sport’s image, thus protecting and enabling an abuser.

Kukors spoke to HuffPost about what it’s been like to come forward with her story and the next steps in her fight against sexual abuse.

What has it been like to come forward with your story?

I didn’t realize until I hit “send” and we posted my story that every single word was therapy for me. My therapist has been asking me for months to start writing, and it was amazing what happened when I finally just sat down and let everything flow out onto the paper. The wave of emotions that I’ve gone through since then have been a lot ― in some ways, I’ve never felt more empowered and supported, and in other ways, I’ve never felt more vulnerable in my entire life, just spilling the darkest parts of myself in public.

I told myself if I’m going to go public with this, if I’m going to share, I have to go all in. I don’t even know what that looks like still. There’s no handbook to really understand how to do all of this.

I think my biggest thing right now is to just honor the truth of where I’m at. I keep telling people, I’m like, “I’m taking my life minute by minute right now.” Today, this morning, I got up and I went to a yoga class. I was so proud of myself for doing that because I’ve not been able to work out in few weeks. As silly as that sounds, but just being able to honor my truths and understand where I’m at with that process.

“In some ways I’ve never felt more empowered and supported, and in other ways, I’ve never felt more vulnerable in my entire life.” - Ariana Kukors

What do you hope people take away from your story?

The next phase is to really talk about grooming and talk about these sexual predators, and hopefully open up dialogue. My hope is to start to have conversations about how can we spot these signs of grooming, these signs of sexual abuse, before it’s too late.

I’ve received so many messages from parents who say we’ve talked about so many different things with their children, but this creates a whole new set of dialogue to understand what interactions are like between kids and adult figures in their life. What happens when somebody that you trust and that everyone in your family, in your community, trusts ― and that person betrays your trust right under your watch?

In my story, I wrote about Sean’s handshakes, how he made every athlete shake his hand after practice, and how that was part of his grooming process. I think a lot of people have been like, “Wait, handshakes are bad?” The thing I want to clarify is a handshake isn’t bad, but it’s the repetition of that when the person on the other end of the handshake is a predator, and they’re trying to gain your trust. They’re trying to make sure they’re looking at you in the eye, and you’re becoming even more comfortable with that interaction. My point in saying that is just to be able to be aware of everything and how these simple daily gestures can be abused and taken advantage of. I think it’s important to know.

It was inspiring in so many ways to see. I could not take my eyes off the victim impact statements. I would just watch them hour by hour and was inspired; I was horrified and saddened beyond belief. But also, to watch these women stare at their abuser and speak their truth in their loudest voice for me was so important in every way. It continues to remind not only me, but so many others that it doesn’t matter what part of the journey you’re on. When you’re ready, you will be heard. You will have a voice. It doesn’t matter what part of the path you’re on, or what your name is.

Every single person has a story. Every single person has a voice, and through all of this, just watching them and just as a fellow abuse survivor, I’m just hoping that that was such a huge part of their healing process, because at the end of the day, that’s all we can hope for.

Nassar was a well-liked, respected and powerful figure within the gymnastics community. From what I’ve read, so was Hutchison. Do you think there are any similarities between your story and the stories of the Nassar survivors?

I don’t know if I can answer that specifically, other than when you have somebody who’s in place of power, my whole family respected Sean. My parents respected Sean and thought highly of him, and so, to have somebody like that who has worked with you from a young age, they program you and manipulate and control you in every way.

Not only was my personal life tied up with Sean, but my swimming career was, too. Looking back now, it’s been an incredibly hard process to try to unravel my swimming career from this man who controlled and programmed me.

The common thread that I keep seeing is somebody who is in power or the child looks up to. That’s why I think that one of my biggest hopes in this is just to create more dialogue. I’ve had so many parents who reached out, and I hope that parents continue to have dialogue with each other, that they’re watching what’s going on in the pool deck or the practice fields and talking to each other.

There’s so many times that I was in a hotel room by myself with Sean, just me and him behind a closed door. People knew this. The conversation was, “Ari’s the favorite,” or “Ari’s on the path to the Olympics.” My answer to that is let’s create dialogue, because at no point is that ever acceptable, no matter what part of your journey you’re on.

Have you been watching the Winter Olympics?

Yea, I’ve been able to tune into some of the events. I love ice dancing. That’s one of my favorites.

We’ve heard about the systemic problem of sexual abuse in a lot of Olympic sports, ones where kids start at a young age and basically give up their childhoods to become elite athletes. What has it been like, as a survivor, watching the Winter Olympics now?

I was watching ice dancing last night, and I’m so in awe of them. I have so much respect for these people who have sacrificed so much. Obviously, a thing like the Olympics is so close to my heart, but I think the same could be said for every industry where you have to sacrifice a lot.

My husband and I love to take in great music, and so I go to a concert, and I watch the pianist. I’m like, “Oh my gosh, the dedication that that person has had towards their craft.” Or a lot of the work that I’ve done in the last few years have been with high-level executives in corporations. I watch that, and I’m like, “Gosh, the sacrifice that they’ve made to really sharpen their tool.”

Then I look at so much that’s going on in the acting world today. I think the same could be said there, too. I have deep respect for people who are pushing the line day after day.

If you could say one thing to survivors of sexual assault who haven’t been able to speak out or are still struggling, what would it be?

I would tell them to hold onto their truth. And if they’re not at the place where they’re ready to vocalize it, I would just tell them that I see you, I feel you. I’m holding a space for you in my heart or in the public space. I’ve just found in the last week and a half that the next step in my healing was acknowledging what happened to me publicly, but I also have to pay respect to the fact that every single person is on their own journey.

When you come forward with your story, you want others to also speak up and validate your experience and Sean’s behavior. I’ve had so many people who have reached out privately, and the thing that I’ve really come to understand and respect is that every single person is on their own path of understanding.

I knew that I had to acknowledge what happened to me. I think the thing that I want people to know is that I am rooting for them so hard, and I’m lovingly holding a space of support and strength.

That’s the most important thing ― to respect the journey that you’re on, and show yourself some love if you can. I know how hard this is. I know how vulnerable you have to be. Just hold onto your truth with all your might.Chrissy Teigen is adorably clueless.

On Monday, the model and wife of musician John Legend took a quiz on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” called “You Don’t Know Jack About John.” Let’s just say her lack of knowledge about Legend’s career is pretty legendary. (Get it?)

Girlfriend didn’t know which album her husband won his first Grammy for, or the fictional band his character was part of in the Oscar-winning film “La La Land.” And those songs he did with Alicia Keys for “Carpool Karaoke”? Yeah, Teigen never bothered to watch.

“This is good,” Teigen said in her own defense. “I wasn’t, like, a creepy stalker.”

“Yeah, you just love him for who he is,” Degeneres said.

To be fair, Teigen did manage to answer a couple questions correctly near the end.

Teigen may not have a Ph.D. in Legend Studies, but it’s OK. Her husband loves her for other reasons.

“She pushes me to be funnier,” Legend said of his wife in September. “Not because she’s trying to, I think it’s just being around her. And to be bolder.”Combine dance experience from “Saturday Night Fever,” “Grease” and “Pulp Fiction” ― and you get John Travolta getting down at the Cannes Film Festival.

The Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead has triggered a rise in the sales of bulletproof backpacks.

On Thursday, one day after former student Nikolas Cruz stormed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and injuring dozens more, Massachusetts-based company Bullet Blocker was inundated with orders for bulletproof backpacks, comprising a 30 percent spike in sales.

The concept for the company originated in 1999 by father of two Joe Curran, a self-described “helicopter dad” and former U.S. Army Ranger in Lowell, Mass. Curran became concerned about school security after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colo., during which teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 students and injured 20 others.

But would be eight years and three more school shootings before Curran had the resources to go into business. “Virginia Tech was the final straw for me,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle, referring to Virginia Polytechnic student Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people on the Blacksburg, Va., campus before committing suicide in 2007. “I started asking local schools for their security plans in the event of armed intruders and there weren’t any concrete plans, so I wanted to promote the idea of kids protecting themselves.”

Bullet Blocker sells 11 backpacks, ranging in price from $210 to $490, including “My Child’s Pack,” a $199 sack (on sale from $210) weighing 2 pounds and available in pink or blue.

The latter looks like a standard school bag but it’s lined with knife-and-bulletproof material called Kevlar that’s approved by the National Institute of Justice, an organization that sets body armor standards for law enforcement. Specifically, the fabric “traps and slows down” bullets shot from a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum, a 9mm handgun, and a .45 caliber weapon.

“Recently, a woman in Hollywood, Calif., bought one for every child she knows, and the wife of a New England Patriots player ordered three for each of her children,” says Curran. “The idea is that kids can hold it up as a shield.”

Photo: Bullet Blocker

The company has an in-house team that sews the bags from scratch and also retrofits existing bags, accessories such as notebooks, iPad cases, and three-ring binders, as well as clothing. For example, Curran recently outfitted a slew of Gucci products — a leather diaper bag for $3,100, a duffle bag for $4,250, and a zip-up jacket for $3,200 — a teal Hermès Evelyne III purse for $5,225, an Armani suit for $5,895, and a Saint Laurent moto jacket for $6,450.

Bullet Blocker is one of several companies specializing in bulletproof kidswear, including the Florida-based Guard Dog Security, which is donating 50 percent of its proceeds to the victims of the Parkland shooting, and a South Carolina outdoors company called Nichols Store, which sells bulletproof inserts and a class for parents on how to use them.

Curran acknowledges that his price point is high but says in the past, when parents couldn’t afford a backpack, “We took care of it.” He tells Yahoo Lifestyle, “I’m not getting rich doing this. But the peace of mind is huge.”

AdvertisementOlympians ― they’re just like us ... when it comes to their love of BTS.

Team USA ice skaters Alex and Maia Shibutani recently shared a photo of themselves holding customized Ralph Lauren hats for each member of the K-pop band. The “Shib Sibs,” who won the bronze medal at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, also asked for some help from the band’s fiercely loyal fanbase, BTS Army, to get the gear to their beloved artists.

Fans flooded the duo with tips on how to reach BTS and send the Olympic hats. But Alex told People that they haven’t been able to get the hats to the band yet.

“We would like to get rid of them and give them to BTS. We really appreciate and respect their work that they do,” Alex said. “What they’ve done breaking through to Western pop culture is awesome.”

Alex explained to People that the love he and his sister share for the K-Pop stars comes from a personal place. He said he sees parallels between the sibs’ journey and that of BTS. In a way, he and his sister were “trailblazers” in Asian representation, as is the band, Alex said.

“We were the first ice dance team of Asian descent to win a medal in the Olympics, and so that was something that we’re really proud of. We haven’t been following K-pop for our entire lives, but real recognizes real. And we see what they’re doing and the impact they’re having, and we respect that.”

Considering BTS’ quick ascent in the music industry, it’s no wonder that the Shib Sibs stan the band. Earlier this month, the band’s single “Mic Drop” remix with Steve Aoki, featuring rapper Desiigner, was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Days later, their song “DNA” also earned the distinction. The band also recently graced the cover of Billboard and chatted with the outlet about “representing a new generation.”

British billionaire Richard Branson has announced plans to build a high-speed shuttle in India that could potentially revolutionize travel in the country.

The proposed hyperloop route between Mumbai and Pune, two major cities in the western state of Maharashtra, would reduce travel time from over three hours by train to just 25 minutes, according to a Virgin press release.

Branson, co-founder of the British multinational conglomerate, signed a preliminary agreement with Maharashtra’s government on Sunday, the Press Trust of India reports. The project will now undergo an extensive feasibility study.

“I believe Virgin Hyperloop One could have the same impact upon India in the 21st century as trains did in the 20th century,” Branson said in the press release. “The Pune-Mumbai route is an ideal first corridor as part of a national hyperloop network that will dramatically reduce travel times between most of India’s major cities to under two hours.”

A post shared by HyperloopOne (@hyperloopone) on Feb 17, 2018 at 9:26am PST

The hyperloop will also connect passengers to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is being built near Mumbai. Branson estimated that the shuttle would support 150 million passenger trips per year and “create a thriving, competitive megaregion.”

Entrepreneur Elon Musk first published a white paper outlining his vision for a vacuum-based, high-speed, underground shuttle system, or hyperloop, in 2013. Others picked up on the idea. Last October, Virgin partnered with Hyperloop One, a U.S. company attempting to build a full-system hyperloop.

A post shared by HyperloopOne (@hyperloopone) on Apr 6, 2017 at 7:07am PDT

The Virgin Hyperloop One project aims to “move people and things at airline speeds on the ground,” according to Virgin. Passengers and cargo would be loaded into pods, which would then be propelled through a low-pressure tube. Magnetic levitation would lift the pods above their tracks. Low aerodynamic drag would allow the pods to travel extraordinarily fast.

A functioning hyperloop would carry passengers at a top speed of 670 miles per hour, more than 10 times the speed of traditional rail services, according to a Virgin Hyperloop One frequently-asked-questions page. For passengers, it would feel like riding in a plane, the company claims.

In addition to India, the Virgin Hyperloop One team has been working on planned routes in the Middle East, Europe, Canada and the United States. They say their goal is to have operational systems running by 2021.A "fresher" at the University of Newcastle in Australia drinks from a public dog bowl on a sidewalk. ABC/End Rape on Campus Australia

Shocking footage has emerged of disturbing hazing rituals at an Australian public university where new students were forced to drink beer off the genitals of older students, have their heads shaven and drink their own vomit, among other outrages, in “a sick cycle” of initiation.

Students living in dormitories at the University of Newcastle, north of Sydney, were exposed to initiations involving coerced drinking and humiliations, according to videos collected by the End Rape on Campus Australia group. The footage, published on news.com.au and assembled from about 200 videos recorded from 2012 to 2016, show multiple acts of hazing of male students from several dormitories.

Graphic videos show young men kneeling in front of older students and being made to drink alcohol poured along or atop genitalia. In other footage, published by news.com.au, students fitted with dog collars are made to drink from public dog bowls and have their heads crudely shaved. All the incidents take place during the day in public spaces.

Students also participate in binge-drinking competitions called “throwie cup,” in which the aim is to drink 24 beers in the fastest time ― and if a competitor throws up, he has to drink his own vomit to remain in the contest.

A former student, referred to only as Andrew, told news.com.au that each new student ― called a “fresher,” short for freshman ― is assigned to an older student.

″The returning student essentially treats their fresher like shit who internalises it all as a rite of passage: we treat you like shit and next year you get to treat someone else like shit. It’s a sick cycle,” Andrew said.

Nina Funnell, a member of the group End Rape on Campus Australia who published the news.com.au report, told the Hack radio program the rituals were dangerous. “I think it points to a pretty toxic culture where you have hypersexualised rituals meeting with alcohol at the same time. There is a lot of coercion, pressure and expectation of others, and it can be difficult for those who do want to say no. What we know is that this is not an isolated incident.”

Funnell added that the hazing happens “around the country ... this is a systemic problem that requires a systemic response.”

Other behavior at the university, captured on video, included students skateboarding naked in dormitory hallways and causing property damage. Older students were also shown bursting into the rooms of younger students and forcing them to drink alcohol, and images showed students being cling-wrapped to poles. None of the videos showed female students being hazed.

A University of Newcastle spokesperson told Fairfax they were “appalled” at the videos.

“The university takes all allegations of student misconduct seriously and acts swiftly to remove offensive behaviour from our campuses where it is reported,” the spokesperson told Fairfax. “Four years ago, the university took over additional management responsibilities of the residential colleges. Since that time, we have worked consistently to develop and implement targeted programs aimed at educating students and their support staff on the appropriate behaviours and our expectations of conduct in our community.

“As well as the education and preventative measures, students found to have behaved in this way are subject to severe penalties.”

Newcastle boasts on its website that its campus housing was “awarded the Asia Pacific Association for Student Housing award for Housing Operator of the Year in 2017 and Excellence in Student Experience in 2016.”

Australian universities, unlike those in America, do not have a fraternity or sorority culture. However, hazing rituals such as this ― often involving alcohol ― associated with university dormitories or amateur sporting teams are regularly uncovered in media coverage. The drinking age is 18 in Australia.

Other well-publicized hazing incidents have occurred in the emergency services and defense forces, which were investigated as part of a federal inquiry into child sexual abuse.Fergie says she tried her best in her ill-received performance of the national anthem before the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday night.

Jamaica’s Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian and Carrie Russell, meanwhile, became the Caribbean island’s first Olympic female bobsledders — following a tricky week in which their coach, Sandra Kiriasis, resigned and put their competition into jeopardy after she threatened to take the team’s bobsled.

They follow in the footsteps of Jamaica’s bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Their story inspired the movie “Cool Runnings.”

Team USA’s Elana Meyers Taylor and Lauren Gibbs led the two-woman bobsleigh field after the first heat. Jamaica secured joint 17th place out of 20. Nigeria finished last.

But both teams won new fans around the world:

The curlers entered the Olympics ranked eighth in the world, but victories over higher-ranked teams like Canada, Switzerland, Great Britain and previously undefeated Sweden have put the team in first place, according to the Wall Street Journal.

After beating the United States team on Monday, the 6-1 South Koreans became the first team confirmed for the semi-finals, according to NBC.

Their mad curling skills are earning them fans, and their nicknames are feeding the frenzy.

Team members Kim Eun-jung, Kim Seon-yeong, Kim Kyeong-ae, Kim Yeong-mi and alternate Kim Cho-hi all share the very common Korean surname of Kim. Only sisters Kim Kyong-ae and Kim Yeong-mi are related, according to USA Today.

So in order to practice their English and help others identify them, the South Korean curlers all adopted nicknames based on breakfast foods they enjoy.

Kim Yeong-mi is known as “Pancake,” while her sister Kim Kyeong-ae is “Steak.” Kim Eun-jung is called “Annie,” a tribute to the California-based yogurt brand. Kim Cho-hi is “Chocho” after a type of cookie. Kim Seon-yeong is called “Sunny,” after sunny-side up eggs.

The food connection doesn’t end there. The team members come from a town in the Gyeongsangbuk-do province, an area is known for its garlic farms.

As a result, many people are calling the team the “Garlic Girls,” according to Food And Wine.

However, coach Kim Min-jung turns up her nose at that particular moniker and is hungering for the internet to come up with a better name, according to USA Today.

A wardrobe malfunction may have cast a shadow on the first of their two Olympic performances this week, but French ice dance duo Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron refused to let the costume snafu dash their medal hopes.

The pair clinched the highest-ever free dance score (123.35) on Tuesday, a day after the outfit malfunction which caused Papadakis to accidentally reveal her breast during their short dance routine.

The mammoth score wasn’t enough to knock Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir from the top of the podium, yet the French duo finished a close second. (The “Shib sibs” from the U.S., Alex and Maia Shibutani, took bronze.)

The highest ever free dance score!

Although this was the first time that Papadakis and Cizeron competed in the Olympics, they showed great poise under pressure. The two-time world champions managed to finish second at Monday’s short dance event despite Papadakis’ outfit slip-up, which she later called her “worst nightmare.”

“It was pretty distracting,” the 22-year-old told The Associated Press. “I told myself, ‘I don’t have a choice. I have to keep going,’ and that’s what we did. I think we can be proud of ourselves being able to deliver a great performance with that happening.”

The pair scored 81.93 in the short dance event. Olympic fans lauded the duo for nailing their routine despite the mishap:

Okay, but seriously, it's just a nipple.

Chef David Chang has always been known for challenging diners’ tastebuds. But recently, he’s making people look at different foods with fresh eyes.

The restaurateur, best known as the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, has been the champion of the #uglydelicious movement on social media since sometime in late 2016. He’s frequently posted photos of dishes ― many of which are ethnic cuisines ― that are not seen as aesthetically beautiful in the Western mainstream media, yet are absolutely, well, delicious. Chang has said that it’s a way to embrace foods like those home-cooked Korean foods he once found “uncool.”

The movement speaks to many Asian-Americans like myself, who grew up experiencing a tug between two cultures. So many of our childhood memories include trying to navigate between our sometimes secret love for our cultural foods while withstanding the contempt directed toward our immigrant families for our “weird” or “smelly” dishes.

#UglyDelicious is something that perfectly encapsulates that perpetual dichotomy. And it’s also a mark of unapologetic pride. Because damn, our food is delicious.

HuffPost recently sat down with the Chang, who’s gearing up for his new Netflix show, also titled “Ugly Delicious.” The show, which premiers on Feb. 23, explores the intersection of culture and food.

Chang talked to HuffPost about his connection to his Asian-American identity, what he learned while filming the series and also why kimchi ice cream should not be a thing.

Many of us grow up embarrassed about our ethnic foods but as we get older and learn more, we reclaim them and learn to embrace our identities. Has your perception of your family’s own Korean dishes changed over time?

Absolutely. That sentiment of being embarrassed about it and hiding it ― my story is not unique. The only thing that’s unique is that I’ve been given a platform to talk about it. It’s something that, from an Asian-American perspective, it’s important that these stories are told. I don’t know if these stories have been told, at least in a national media audience.

I’m 40 years old, and maybe it’s just the sheer passage of time, but I’m comfortable with this ― I’m not comfortable with being American, I’m not comfortable with being Korean, I’m OK with being something in between. This is what I like, and don’t tell me it’s not valid.

Have you also had that moment in the lunchroom during which you opened up your lunchbox and people gawked at your ethnic food or made fun of it?

Of course! Those are probably some of my most impressionable memories ― being vilified and made fun of and bullied for the food I was eating. It’s only natural I’m going to want to reject it as I grew up.

And there was a double standard. In my house, I loved it. Outside my house, I hated it.

So there’s been a lot of criticism from the Asian-American community toward non-Asians who are claiming our native foods or cuisines and labeling them as trendy and subsequently legitimizing them in a way. What’s your take on this?

Asian-American food, Asian food in general, is not the predominant food and it’s going to be widely misunderstood ... My viewpoints on it are changing. It’s about moving the conversation forward. If someone wants to talk about it, and promote it ― fine. All I ask is that it’s respectful. All I ask is that they pay tribute and understand it and [the food is] an homage to where it came from.

Do you think there’s a specific way to respectfully present kimchi, for example, from a white chef?

Yeah, I think people do it all the time. For me, my simple litmus test is ― if someone wants to make Korean food, great. Doesn’t mean they have to be Korean. But ... It’s like, hey, I’m not trying to make kimchi ice cream. [Laughs] It’s making a dish and using it in a way that’s going to be respectful of both cultures you’re trying to fuse together.

In the series, we see you and Ali Wong talking pho. And she’s saying how good pho isn’t all about a nice bathroom and nice service― it’s the authenticity of the pho. What’s your philosophy on that?

I think what Ali was saying is you can still have a very clean bathroom and have great pho but the point is, don’t lose sight on the food itself. “Rude” service at an Asian restaurant might not mean it’s rude service. It might not just be Western service ― it’s about looking at it in a different light. If you’re looking at things from a Eurocentric point of view, it’s going to look “weird.”

The series explores the cultures behind the food. But did you feel closer to your own culture as you were filming the series? Or did you learn more about yourself?

I think what changed was I tried to be more respectful and more empathetic and know that many of the things that I believe might be wrong.

My viewpoints, for instance, on New Orleans have changed. One of the episodes deals with shrimp and crawfish in Houston and New Orleans. It uses shrimp as a vehicle to talk about change and respect and tradition. New Orleans is centuries old and part of the reason why people go there is the French Quarter and history and lineage. It has to carry this old beautiful tradition that Houston doesn’t. Houston can do whatever it wants.



When I initially finished the show I was thinking, “Houston to me is a better food town. It’s more interesting.” But for a lot of reasons, Houston is not beholden to history like New Orleans is ... Because I’m not from New Orleans, I don’t know what that’s like but for some chefs born and raised in New Orleans. That’s a burden they have to carry that I can never understand. I can’t be like, “Hey New Orleans, move faster.” Because they can’t. They have to be respectful. It’s wrong for me to be like, “New Orleans isn’t as good as Houston.”

What do you think Asian-American chefs are doing right, or what mistakes are they making? Do you have any advice?

My advice to Asian-American chefs is to find your own voice; find your own path. Because that can be a multitude of things. Don’t think it’s just one thing.Skiers ride the chairlift at Sunlight Mountain Resort in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Water scarcity and new research are spurring ski resorts, water districts and states across the West to invest in “cloud seeding,” a technology that aims to increase natural snowfall.

By Sophie Quinton

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Machines that prod clouds to make snow may sound like something out of an old science fiction movie. But worsening water scarcity, combined with new proof that “cloud seeding” actually works, is spurring more states, counties, water districts and power companies across the thirsty West to use the strategy.

Last month, a study funded by the National Science Foundation proved for the first time that the technology works in nature. That study, combined with other recent research, has helped make cloud seeding an attractive option for officials and companies desperate to increase the amount of water in rivers and reservoirs.

In Colorado alone, more than a hundred cloud seeding machines are set up in mountainside backyards, fields and meadows. Some older versions of the contraptions look like a large tin can perched on top of a propane tank. New ones are large metal boxes festooned with solar panels, weather sensors and a slim tower.

Their goal is the same: to “seed” clouds with particles of silver iodide, a compound that freezing water vapor easily attaches to. That makes ice crystals, which eventually become snowflakes.

Colorado’s $1 million a year program has been around since the 1970s and is paid for not just by the state, ski resorts, and local water users but also water districts as far away as Los Angeles that want to increase snowmelt into the Colorado River, which sustains over 30 million people across the Southwest. Currently, most of the river basin is experiencing a drought.

“Everyone starts to get nervous when there’s no snow in Colorado,” said Joe Busto, the scientist who oversees Colorado’s cloud seeding program.

Major urban water districts in Arizona, California and Nevada have funded cloud seeding in the Rocky Mountains for over 10 years and are now close to signing an agreement with officials in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming to split the cost of nine more years of seeding.

Cloud seeding is a relatively cheap tool for bulking up the water supply in Lake Mead and other reservoirs, said Mohammed Mahmoud, a senior policy analyst for the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. The up to $500,000 annual commitment the district is making to the regional agreement comprises a tiny fraction of its budget, he said.

Yet it’s hard to tell how much additional precipitation cloud seeding creates or how much additional snow or rain eventually makes it into city water pipes. Cloud seeding only works when there are freezing, moist clouds in the air. And the technology can be controversial.

“The whole thing is propaganda,” said Jamie Kouba, 32, a farmer from Regent, North Dakota, who argues that cloud seeding is decreasing rainfall in his area, rather than increasing it. He’s organizing local farmers in a campaign against the practice.

A 20th Century Technology

Scientists discovered in the 1940s that certain molecules make a good foundation for snow. In one famous experiment, a chemist made it snow by dumping six pounds of dry ice out of an airplane over western Massachusetts.

It didn’t take long for states, localities and ski resorts to start experimenting. Colorado’s Vail ski area began cloud seeding in the 1970s, for instance. Today California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming have winter cloud seeding programs, and Texas and North Dakota have summer programs, which aim to increase rain and decrease hail.

Cloud seeding machines are nothing like the “snow guns” used to blast water over ski slopes. Instead, when they’re turned on they generate smoke that floats into the air like incense. Some state programs rely on ground-based machines. Others use airplanes to drop flares that generate silver iodide smoke into clouds, or to fly into a storm with flares strapped to their wings.

The January National Science Foundation-funded study, which was conducted in Idaho, was the first to show real-world observations of silver iodide forming ice crystals inside clouds and falling out as precipitation.

Such research has increased interest in cloud seeding, particularly among private companies and utilities, said Neil Brackin, president of Weather Modification Inc., a North Dakota company that does cloud seeding. “We’re able to now really demonstrate the technology, and they can see it’s not something conceptual that works in a lab — it’s measurable.”

Other recent studies have used computer modeling to estimate the increase in snowfall from cloud seeding. A 2014 study across two Wyoming mountain ranges found that cloud seeding could increase snowfall by 5 to 15 percent — but only when the right conditions for seeding were met, or during 30 percent of snow events.

“In one famous experiment, a chemist made it snow by dumping six pounds of dry ice out of an airplane over western Massachusetts.”

Relatively small increases still matter. “People in the western United States — we’re always water-stressed out here,” said Frank McDonough, an atmospheric scientist in Nevada who oversees the cloud seeding program at the Desert Research Institute, part of the state university system. Along the Colorado River, more water is promised to people than is available.

Nevada’s cloud seeding program can increase the snowpack by up to 10 percent, McDonough said.

That translates into 80,000 more acre-feet a year of water, enough to sustain about 150,000 households.

Still, he said, cloud seeding programs are difficult to evaluate. “Ten percent of additional snowfall is within the natural variation of storms.”

Although it’s hard for scientists to gauge the effectiveness of cloud seeding, many water districts are willing to take a chance on the technology because cloud seeding is relatively cheap.

Idaho Power, which serves customers in Idaho and Oregon, has been using cloud seeding to boost the volume of water moving through its hydroelectric dams since 2003. The company’s representatives say the $3 million seeding program they oversee — which is partly funded by the state and other water users — generates billions of gallons of additional water for much less than 1 percent of the company’s operational budget.

“When you do the math, it turns out to be about $3.50 per acre-foot,” said Shaun Parkinson, water resources leader at Idaho Power. Renting water through a water supply bank — another way for irrigators to access more water — costs $17-21 an acre-foot, he said.

As the technology advances, cloud seeding could get even better results. In Colorado, Busto is adding more remote-controlled generators that can be driven high on a mountain, closer to clouds, and left there all winter. Currently, most cloud seeding machines in the state are installed on private property and manually operated by homeowners and farmers who are paid to turn them on when a storm comes.

Still, Busto warns that cloud seeding isn’t a cure for drought. Take this winter, which has been too warm and too dry for seeding. “We have not been able to run our cloud seeding machines because there’s been no storms coming through,” he said; the machines have only run a handful of times so far.

Challenges Remain

State lawmakers can be reluctant to spend money on cloud seeding technology, particularly during tight budget years.

Wyoming’s Legislature, for instance, put about $120,000 to $160,000 into the state’s cloud seeding program each year since it started in 2005. But now the state is running a deficit, and lawmakers want to cut next year’s funding to $80,000.

At a recent meeting at the Wyoming Water Development Office in Cheyenne, state engineer Patrick Tyrrell told cloud seeding company representatives and state and local officials from around the region that his team hasn’t yet found local funders, such as ski resorts, to step in to help pay for the program.

Kansas’ cloud seeding program has dwindled almost to nothing since the 1970s because of budget cuts. Nevada’s Legislature eliminated funding for cloud seeding during the 2008 budget shortfall, McDonough said. Lawmakers voted last year to resume funding.

Cloud seeding can also face public opposition. State officials who manage the programs are used to explaining the science to lawmakers, their governing boards, reporters and concerned citizens.

“Most people don’t understand the science very well, and they don’t understand who’s doing what and where,” Busto said. It’s easy to find websites and online videos dedicated to conspiracy theories, such as that cloud seeding caused last year’s hurricane and flooding in Houston, or that cloud seeding is part of a government plot that will inevitably poison all life on Earth.

Busto said he has been confronted by people who are worried that exposure to silver iodide will make them sick. But silver is a naturally occurring element that is not inherently harmful, he said. In the 2014 Wyoming study, scientists found that seeding added some silver iodide to the surrounding water and soil but far too little to pose a known threat to human health.

North Dakota’s Kouba is one of the skeptics. He has compiled state rainfall data going back to the 1970s and concluded that cloud seeding has decreased rainfall, particularly in counties that are downwind of seeding operations. “I’m in a downwind county, and we have lost considerably,” he said.

Last summer, when a drought seized western North Dakota, Kouba circulated a petition asking the Hettinger County Commission to file an injunction against a nearby county to stop cloud seeding there. He managed to get about half the county to sign on, he said. Recently, he presented his rainfall data to the state water commission.

North Dakota officials say there’s no evidence that cloud seeding caused last year’s drought. If anything, cloud seeding in one place leads to more precipitation downwind, not less, said Darin Langerud, who oversees cloud seeding for the North Dakota Atmospheric Resource Board.

Busto said actual science fiction — such as “Geostorm,” a 2017 movie about malfunctioning climate control satellites — fuels misperceptions about what states are really trying to do.

“Every time something like that comes out it feeds more conspiracy theories,” he said. “I’m just trying to make more snowflakes at a ski resort.”WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday released hundreds of pages of transcripts and other details from its investigation of a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Russians who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, President Donald Trump’s Democratic rival for the presidency.

The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Republican Chuck Grassley, released its interviews with Donald Trump Jr., Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Moscow-based developer Ike Kaveladze.

The transcripts also included interviews with Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, which researched Trump’s ties to Russia and produced a dossier denounced by the White House, and Robert Goldstone, a music publicist who said he had information about Clinton, and written responses to questions from the committee from Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who attended the meeting, and Anatoli Samochornov, her translator.

During his interview, Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, was asked about communications from Goldstone about offers of support from “important” Russians as Trump emerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination during the primaries.

Trump said, however, that he would have taken such a message only as “general well-wishing,” not a concrete offer of help.

The committee said that Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, declined to be interviewed but submitted material relevant to the investigation.

The interviews were conducted between July 2017 and March 2018.

Grassley had said in January he wanted to release the transcripts of the interviews. His committee is one of three congressional panels investigating the intelligence community’s finding that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election to boost Trump and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating.

The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting has been central to those probes.

Russia denies trying to influence the election. Trump dismisses any talk of collusion.Spoiler alert: Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.

It’s been almost 20 years, and it still feels weird to talk about the plot twist from “The Sixth Sense.” At least we waited two decades to ruin the movie for you. Meanwhile, the movie’s composer, James Newton Howard, didn’t even wait two minutes.

During a phone conversation with HuffPost, Howard recalled how one of the songs he included on the “Sixth Sense” soundtrack, which was released at the same time as the movie, was called “Malcolm Is Dead.” As you can tell, it pretty clearly stated that Bruce Willis’ character, Malcolm, was, in fact, dead.

“[Director M. Night Shyamalan] called me up kind of comically hysterical, saying, ‘James, you gave away the secret of the movie. You can’t say “Malcolm Is Dead!”’ But, of course, by the time the whole thing was out, we were laughing about it.”

Despite the soundtrack giveaway, Shyamalan’s unexpected ending helped launch his career. Malcolm’s big moment is still listed among the greatest surprises in movie history, and that, along with subsequent films, earned Shyamalan a reputation for delivering a well-executed plot twist. There’s even a “South Park” parody to prove it.

But all of that success seemed to lead up to the biggest twist of all.

Howard, a longtime collaborator who’s composed on nearly all of Shyamalan’s movies, said that he believes “The Sixth Sense” weighed on Shyamalan’s shoulders, so much so that the director became wary of his reputation for surprises.

“I think, in a way, for Night, that the success of that ‘Sixth Sense’ moment was so profound that it almost became such an expectation on the part of the audience that he was going to do that every time,” he said. “Night’s first consideration is storytelling, and he’s a great storyteller, but I think he felt the burden of that ... as some kind of identification that he was going to sort of have to bear for the rest of his entire career.”

“Often times, I think he wanted to get away from that,” he added, “and people didn’t like it. He tried to get away from it. They always wanted him to do a certain kind of thing.”

Though Shyamalan’s recent films — “Split” and “The Visit” — have been critical and commercial successes, the director also produced a string of twisty movies in the mid-2000s, including the abhorred psychological, uh, tree thriller, “The Happening,” that made critics and audiences wonder, “What’s happening?”

The movies make a little more sense now when you consider Shyamalan might have been reluctant to deliver them to audiences in the first place. (Reps for the director did not immediately return a request for comment.)

But if he did want to abandon the storytelling technique that made him famous, Shyamalan hasn’t done a very good job of that. Long after “Sixth Sense,” most of the director’s films still end in some kind of twist.

Being pigeonholed isn’t really something Howard himself has had to deal with. Over the course of his more than 30-year career, he’s amassed an eclectic archive of films, composing for “The Fugitive” and “The Dark Knight” ― even “Space Jam.”

The composer spoke with HuffPost about his past projects and condensing his musical catalog down to a multi-hour concert, which he toured across Europe late last year. There, audiences were treated to Howard’s music as well as movie clips and anecdotes from his three decades in film.

How’d you fit 30 years of music into one concert?

I was trying to balance things that I thought people would want to hear — would expect to hear — with music that I thought was perhaps worth hearing that they hadn’t heard. That was kind of what my goal was. And I guess I succeeded. They really received it so enthusiastically. I was quite moved, but it was very difficult because I have 130-some movies to pick from.

How’d you decide what stories and songs made the cut?

I could bore you for hours with all kinds of intrigue and funny things that happened.

I mean, bore away.

Collaborations are, by nature, complicated ― and whether it was on movies where I was on the verge of being fired, or I wanted to be fired and other people got fired. Just the nature of it was one of those things, there tends to be a lot of drama surrounding it. I try to stay clear of it and focused on the music, but it can get pretty extreme when you have studios making hundreds of millions of dollar investments and directors who are not in line with what the studios are feeling, but I’m really on the director’s side. I’m sort of really trying to be a mediator. It’s an adventure each time you step out on one of those things.

Speaking about possibly being fired, I know you’ve talked before about how stressful it was working on “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” Was that a project you were worried about being taken off of?

No, I didn’t think I was going to be taken off, because I had written 80 percent of the score, which they loved. What I wanted to avoid was having “Hedwig’s Theme” be the main theme now for “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” because that would make it bad, storytelling-wise. Because this story takes place 75 years before Harry’s even born, so how does “Hedwig” ― he’s not in the movie ― how does he figure?

I wanted to kick John Williams’ theme out the door. Nobody admires John Williams music more than me. I think he’s the greatest who ever did it, but one of my goals of doing that movie was to hopefully end up branding my own theme. I think there’s always going to be a little bit of “Hedwig’s Theme” in there somewhere, just as an homage to the fact that it’s in the “Harry Potter” universe, but the primary themes were definitely all new, which was very satisfying.

I’ve seen you say music is the final edit of a film. What music would you say changed a movie?

I think an interesting example is a couple years ago I did a movie called “Nightcrawler” with Dan Gilroy. In “Nightcrawler,“ Jake Gyllenhaal played a real psychopath nutcase. When I did my first pass on the movie, Dan said, “No, you’re playing it like he’s a psychopath.” I said, “Well, he is a psychopath.” He said, “Yeah, but he’s succeeding,” and he said, “I want you to do it from his point of view. I want you to pretend that this is your son and he’s achieving these things, and you’re proud of him.”

So I then turned around and wrote a score that was celebratory when he was arriving at a crash scene and moving bodies so he could get a better [photo] shot, which is a despicable thing to do. I was playing this kind of triumphant music, and it created a very strong dissonance. I think people were confused, but in the end really enjoyed that experience because it was unlike perhaps something they had seen before.

For the “Hunger Games” films, you worked on Jennifer Lawrence’s song, “The Hanging Tree,” which became huge. How did that happen?

It was [director Francis Lawrence’s] idea, I think. The lyric to that song appeared in the book, but there was never a melody. There was obviously, if you’re reading Suzanne Collins’ book, you’re reading, “Are you coming to the tree ... ” It was a nursery rhyme or something. Francis had the idea of contacting the guys in the Lumineers to write a melody, and then once he had a melody — and this is all going on unbeknownst to me — Francis said to Jennifer, “Can you sing this song?”

Francis then came to me and said, “James, can you turn this into an anthem or at least bring in harmony and give it some size and dimension ... so by the time it’s done, it reaches this big climax?” Which I did, so I wrote all the harmonies, and I did all the orchestration and kind of changed from the solo vocal to the version it became, and then the record company didn’t want to put it on the “Music Inspired By” album for some reason [...] they didn’t want Jennifer singing “The Hanging Tree.”

I said, “OK, wow, can I have it?” And they said, “Well, you better ask Jennifer,” so I contacted Jennifer through her agent, and Jennifer gave me permission to put that version on my album, my score album, with the one exception. She said, “You can have it as long as I never have to sing you that song as long as I live.” She didn’t enjoy singing. I don’t think she enjoys it even though she has a great voice. So I said, “Yeah, no problem. You certainly wont have to sing it again for me.” I took it and put it on my album and before you knew it, somebody put it on the radio, and it became this viral hit. But it was a complete accident.

What did you think when it took off?

It was fun. It was just hilarious. I felt wrong at first because it said, “‘The Hanging Tree’ by James Newton Howard.” What it should’ve said, and what it did say on the second release, was “‘The Hanging Tree’ by James Newton Howard featuring Jennifer Lawrence,” which they left out the first time. Jennifer, I don’t think, could’ve cared less, but I felt self-conscious about it, because it was obviously the two of us that made it happen.

Another movie you’ve done that has become more and more popular is “Space Jam.” What was it like looking back on it?

If you watch the old Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck cartoons, Warner Bros. cartoons, the music was extraordinary. It was very intricate, very fast and really inventive, and it was by this guy named Carl Stalling. Every time Tweety bird or the cat would tiptoe over ... it was really hard to do that virtuosic film writing. And so, when I got that movie, I thought that obviously that would have to happen. You need to speak in the vocabulary of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons, so I really had to learn. I had to take a Cliffs Notes class in Carl Stalling, and I found that a challenge. It was really, really hard writing that score. It was probably an hour and 45 minutes of very detailed, intricate music. It was hard, but it was fun.

[The film] has this kind of cult following ... my older son is 23. They grew up with that thing, too, and they all had “Space Jam” parties to get together and watch it.

One of the fun things of going on tour was these films have a life beyond their release, and people do really still enjoy them out there. In many cases, the music has really been a factor in their lives.

In terms of music that has had an impact on people’s lives, you also wrote the music for Harvey Dent in “The Dark Knight.”

I thought, for Harvey Dent, before he becomes the other character, that there was a nobility about expressing his character with brass, so I wrote a [Aaron] Copland-esque fanfare for him, and that really became his theme and of course that all changed and got very dark when he transformed into this other character. I was just portraying him as kind of a Western hero. I just thought that really worked. [Chris Nolan] liked the idea.

It was really nice, because all the orchestrations in “Batman Begins” and “The Dark Knight” are mostly kind of low, moody strings with that powerful French horn line. It was nice to kind of get up above middle C and write some music. It kind of felt like the sun had come out when we first met this character.

It’s interesting hearing that Harvey Dent was introduced like a Western hero. What are some things you would notice in your music ― unusual inspirations ― others wouldn’t?

Generally, it’s about tone. You’re trying to find ... I mean, I did the same kind of thing in a couple of Night’s movies. Think about “Unbreakable,” for instance. You had Bruce Willis, who, he’s a superhero and he doesn’t know it. When he acts in a heroic way, I presented him with a heroic theme, but in that case there was much more emotion attached to it because there was also the death of his wife, so there was a tragic side to it, and that’s my favorite kind of thing to do. I suppose that’s why I’m not as interested in doing superhero movies because I feel like they can be pretty one-dimensional, and they’re really fun. They’re great, but I tend to be more interested in complicated personalities where you can really play off of different aspects of who [the characters] are and highlight their weaknesses and their strengths.

You’re working on Disney’s “The Nutcracker.” What was it like adapting that music for a film?

My first idea is to use Tchaikovsky whenever possible. That’s No. 1. No. 2, to use Tchaikovsky in its purest form is not going to work in many cases in the movie as a storytelling device because you’re in a movie. You’re telling different stories, so in many cases Tchaikovsky has to be reorchestrated or restructured or just a small part of it, and then you add to it. The third part is just to make sure that the integrity of one of the greatest composers who ever lived is maintained to the greatest degree as possible.

It’s a very different story, because the funny thing about “The Nutcracker” is, if you watch “The Nutcracker,” there’s not a lot of story there. It’s not a story for a two-hour movie. Basically, a girl wakes up. The Nutcracker turns alive. There’s people dancing around, and then she wakes up, but there’s not a lot more to it than that. The music and the ballet are incredible works of art, but this is a different thing. This has been exploded into an adventure and a coming-of-age story and all kind of wonderful things. Tchaikovsky is ever-present, but I would say that it’s a good portion of original music that I’m trying to butt up against, in as graceful as possible way, to the other guy, Tchaikovsky.
