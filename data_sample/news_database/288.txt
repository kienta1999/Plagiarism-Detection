WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Monday for the Senate to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for any role they’ve played in fueling the opioid epidemic that has spread despair in his state and across the U.S.

In a letter to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the committee on health, education, labor and pensions, Sanders encouraged him to hold hearings on the matter just as the Senate had once compelled Big Tobacco executives to testify about the deadly hazards of smoking.

“That committee had the courage to demand that the leading executives of the tobacco industry tell the American people what they knew and when they knew that tobacco was addictive … and had killed millions of people,” Sanders wrote. “Though all denied under oath believing tobacco was addictive, we now know they were lying. But the hearing eventually led to real change,” with the Food and Drug Administration regulating tobacco and the rate of smoking in the U.S. at a record low.

Sanders pointed out that the hearing helped states reach massive settlements with the tobacco industry. Several local jurisdictions have already filed lawsuits against painkiller manufacturers. Some have already received settlements. The opioid crisis, Sanders, wrote, “did not happen in a vacuum.” He praised investigative journalists for exposing Big Pharma’s lies about opioid painkillers not being addictive and how small-town pharmacies were flooded with opioids.

“Yet, while some of these companies have made billions each year in profits, not one of them has been held fully accountable for its role in this crisis,” Sanders wrote. “Individual states have received small settlements from companies after taking legal action, but not nearly enough to pay for the costs associated with the opioid epidemic. The states cannot do it alone.”

Sanders sees an economic cost as well as a human cost to the epidemic. And he wants the industry to be liable for the economic costs. Sanders noted in his letter that he plans to introduce legislation that would in part require companies to reimburse communities for the devastating economic consequences that their painkillers have caused.

In a recent hearing, Alexander focused on state efforts to combat the epidemic. And at a hearing last month, Alexander called just one witness: a reporter who had written a book on the heroin trade and its effect in Ohio. The reporter acknowledged that he had no expertise in making any policy recommendations.

Alexander’s office said it plans to hold more hearings on the opioid epidemic, including one later this week. The office is in the process of considering Sanders’ letter.The public was appalled. The family was hurt. But the White House likely won’t apologize for an aide’s cutting comment that Arizona Sen. John McCain’s opposition to Gina Haspel heading the CIA didn’t matter because “he’s dying anyway.”

In the past, Trump administration advisers have praised McCain’s years of public service in government and in the military. But there wasn’t a word of regret from the White House on Sunday about Kelly Sadler’s leaked comment.

McCain’s daughter, talk show host Meghan McCain, told ABC News that Sadler had called her to personally apologize, but she was waiting for more.

“I asked her to publicly apologize and she said she would,” said Meghan McCain. “I have not spoken to her since and I assume that it will never come.”

National Security Adviser John Bolton told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he will never forget McCain’s vital support during his difficult 2005 confirmation fight to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

“[McCain] did it because he thought I was being treated unfairly. I’ll never forget it, I’ll be grateful forever, and I wish John McCain and his family nothing but the best,” Bolton said.

But when pressed by Jake Tapper to address Sadler’s hurtful comment, Bolton said curtly: “I’ve said what I’m going to say.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) described Sadler’s comment as “disgusting” on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” He called McCain, who was a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam, an “American hero.”Comedian Sarah Silverman announced to her followers via Twitter on Monday that she and her boyfriend, British actor Michael Sheen, had split over Christmas.

“I mean not ‘over Christmas,’” the comedian humorously clarified, “that wasn’t the fight that ended it.” She then clarified further, “No fight. We just live in different countries and it got hard.”

The great @michaelsheen & I consciously uncoupled over Christmas. I mean, not “over Christmas” - like that wasn’t the fight that ended it. No fight. We just live in different countries & it got hard. Felt we should just tell y’all so u stop askin, “How’s Michael/How’s Sarah?” — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 5, 2018

Sheen might be best known to American audiences for his portrayal of Dr. William Masters in the Showtime series “Masters of Sex,” on which Silverman had a recurring role.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee voted unanimously on Monday to approve the release of a memo that Democrats say will rebut a contentious Republican memo alleging FBI bias against President Donald Trump.

The vote will send the memo to the White House as soon as Monday night, giving Trump until Friday to decide whether to allow its release.

If he declines, after approving the release of the Republican memo despite strong objections by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it could set up an angry dispute pitting the White House and many of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress against Democrats, law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

A week ago, Republicans, who control a majority on the committee, joined together to block the release of the Democrats’ memo and approve the Republican memo, despite unanimous Democratic opposition.

But Republican committee members said on Monday they were comfortable with releasing the Democratic document now that it had been reviewed by House members.

The Republican memo accused senior FBI and Justice Department officials of not revealing that portions of a dossier used in seeking a court warrant to eavesdrop on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page were partly paid for by Democrats.

Trump allowed its release to the public last Friday.

Democrats said the Republican memo was intended to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s criminal probe into possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.

The dispute, an extraordinary breach between the White House and law enforcement, also deepened partisan rancor over congressional investigations of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, prompting concern about lawmakers’ ability to produce unbiased reports.

House intelligence is one of three congressional committees looking into the matter, along with Mueller.

Russia denies trying to influence the election. Trump denies collusion between his campaign and Moscow.

Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to say the memo vindicated him, and used another tweet on Monday to accuse Representative Adam Schiff, the top House Intelligence Committee Democrat, of leaking “confidential” material. Schiff responded by warning Trump against “tweeting false smears.”

The White House said it was open to releasing the Democratic memo once it goes through a security review.

Democrats worried that Trump might try to use the Republican memo to make the case for firing Mueller or Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 official at Justice, who is overseeing the Russia probe and signed off on at least one warrant application for Page.Fourteen years after his infamous halftime performance, Justin Timberlake delivered a much tamer show at Super Bowl LII on Sunday night in Minnesota.

With the Eagles leading the Patriots 22-12 going into the second half, Timberlake’s friend, Jimmy Fallon, introduced the singer.

The 37-year-old kicked off the performance by singing his new single, “Filthy,” which was accompanied with a trippy light show. He then sang “Rock Your Body” ― the classic he sang with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl. Timberlake didn’t bring Jackson out to sing, despite rumors that she might join him on stage.

Timberlake then got the crowd riled with “SexyBack” and “My Love.” He later played “Cry Me A River” before he and his dancers broke it down on the field. He also sang “Suit and Tie” while accompanied by a band, before playing “Until the End of Time” on the piano.

Timberlake then dedicated a song to Minneapolis, playing “I Would Die 4 U” while a projection of Prince played ― not quite the rumored hologram that caused trouble prior to the show.

Many were still upset with the Prince tribute, given that Timberlake and the late singer had a contentious history. Timberlake mocked Prince’s short stature at the 2007 Golden Globes, and later dissed him on the song “Give It to Me.”

OK the Prince projection was pretty cool. pic.twitter.com/zfpIuaHjMr — Doha Madani (@DohaMadani) February 5, 2018

After the Prince tribute, Timberlake sang “Mirrors” while fans and background singers flashed mirrors around the stage, before eventually ending on “Can’t Stop The Feeling.”

Timberlake is the only person to perform at the halftime show three times. During his infamous 2004 Super Bowl performance, the singer, who was a few years into his solo career at the time, joined Janet Jackson onstage to perform “Rock Your Body.”

After singing the lyrics “I bet I’ll have you naked by the end of this song,” he ripped off Jackson’s corset and her bra as well, exposing Jackson’s bare breast to over 90 million people in a moment later remembered as “nipplegate.”

Jackson and Timberlake both reportedly agreed on the final costume reveal, though removing her bra was accidental. However, Timberlake escaped the episode unscathed and went on to have a successful solo career. Jackson’s career suffered after MTV said the star “engineered” the event, and she was reportedly blackballed from major TV networks and the Grammys.

Many hoped Timberlake would bring Jackson back to the stage on Sunday, especially since even he admits he only got a small percentage of the blame for nipplegate. Jackson denied they were reuniting in messages on her social media accounts posted the day before the Super Bowl.

“To put to rest any speculation or rumors as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow; I will not,” she said. “Thank you for your support and I do look forward to seeing you all very soon.”MINNEAPOLIS – In the wildest shootout in Super Bowl history, unheralded Nick Foles outdueled legendary Tom Brady to lead the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl title, defeating the New England Patriots, 41-33.

Foles went 28 for 43 for 373 yards and three touchdowns, including leading a come-from-behind, game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. A back-up most of the season to Carson Wentz, Foles was particularly brilliant when it mattered the most, on third and fourth downs in clutch situations. He even caught a touchdown pass at the end of the first half.

New England somehow lost despite never punting or turning the ball over. Brady, seeking his sixth championship, broke his own Super Bowl record for most passing yards with 505. He went 28-for-48 and tossed XX touchdowns.

Brady was brilliant.

It was Foles who was the champion and Super Bowl MVP though.

USA Today Sports / Reuters

Trailing for the first time in the game, 33-32 with 9:26, Foles led the Philly offense on a legendary game-winning drive. It included converting twice on third down and once on fourth down, often by the smallest of margins. It ended with a six-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Zach Ertz, who leapt across the goal line.

Ertz lost the ball on contact with the field just after he crossed the goalline. Replay ruled it a catch, determining he had made a football move and became a runner therefore the play was dead when the ball crossed the plane of the end zone.

In the third quarter, Foles hit running back Corey Clement on a 22-yard dime into double coverage. The running back initially controlled the ball, bobbled it a bit and then appeared to fail to get both feet in the end zone. Initially ruled a touchdown, it was upheld on a controversial replay review and brought one of the NFL’s most tired storylines – what’s a catch – to the Super Bowl.

After the Ertz score gave Philly the lead, Brady got the ball back with 2:21 remaining in the game, spurring thoughts of another dramatic Patriots comeback.

Not this time, though. The Eagles defense stepped up when Brandon Graham strip-sacked Brady, causing a fumble that was recovered by the Eagles. Philly kicked a field goal to extend the lead to eight.

With 1:05 remaining, Brady then attempted to drive New England again for a touchdown and two-point conversion but couldn’t do it.

It was the first sign of life by the Philly defense. New England, to that point, had neither punted, had a turnover or allowed a sack.

That’s the Eagles though, opportunistic, confident and more than capable of standing up to the NFL’s biggest bully and punching back.

The game was an offensive classic, setting multiple Super Bowl records, including most yards gained before the start of the fourth quarter.

The Eagles led 22-12 after a wild, entertaining first half that saw a little bit of everything.

There was 683 total yards. A brilliant 37-yard Foles-to-Jeffrey touchdown pass. A 46-yard Rex Burkhead catch and rumble.

Each team missed an extra point. Philly failed on a two-point conversion. New England had a bad snap cost them a field goal. Patriots receiver Brandin Cooks was knocked out of the game on a violent hit.

There were gadget plays and huge gains galore.

Corey Clement had a 53 yard catch and run for the Eagles. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for 36 and added a touchdown. New England saw Danny Amendola haul one in for 50 and Chris Hogan for 43. James White scored on a 26-yard run.

The pregame festivities were mostly eventless. All players stood for the national anthem, as they have for the entire playoffs in a movement that had mostly faded away this season until it was rekindled by president Donald Trump in week three.

Pink sang it well after taking out a throat lozenge just before performing.

At halftime, Justin Timberlake performed a number of hit songs, including singing Purple Rain as the image of Prince, a beloved native of Minnesota who passed away last year, was projected onto a giant curtain inside U.S. Bank Stadium.

This prompted lots of speculation about what it was.

Well, Pink wasn’t having any of that.

Later Sunday, she set the record straight.

It was a throat lozenge — P!nk (@Pink) February 5, 2018

“It was a throat lozenge,” she tweeted.

Which makes sense.

The pop star had been pretty vocal about having the flu in the days leading up to her performance. “Trying to practice the flu away,” the “What About Us” singer wrote on Instagram over the weekend.

“I’ve been waiting to sing this song since 1991 when I saw my idol, Whitney Houston, own this song. And now, my chance has finally come. And it just so happens that this chance comes when I have two small Petri dish kids who literally cough INTO MY MOUTH and rub their snot on my cheek.”

She added:

“I’ve arrived at another one of my dreams which is slowly becoming a sort of nightmare.”Budweiser dedicated its 2018 Super Bowl ad to showing consumers how its parent company, Anheuser-Busch, aided relief efforts during the final months of 2017, as many communities continue to rebuild months after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the California wildfires.

In partnership with American Red Cross, Anheuser-Busch’s emergency water program regularly uses its brewery in Cartersville, Georgia, to can clean drinking water instead of beer to support response efforts. The company uses the same methods it typically employs to deliver beer to get clean water to affected areas. By the end of the year, the company will also make its brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, capable of canning clean water to aid disaster relief.

Just after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in late August, NBC reported the Cartersville brewery sent more than 155,000 cans of clean drinking water to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Arlington, Texas. In total, the company said it donated 3 million cans of clean water to 50 different communities in 2017 to aid disaster relief efforts.

Anheuser-Busch isn’t the only company to tout such efforts. Forbes reported that beer company MillerCoors sent out 50,000 cans of clean water after Harvey. Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. also detailed their emergency response efforts in bringing aid to the U.S. and Caribbean, which included delivering clean water and milk, as well as financial donations to American Red Cross. Procter and Gamble sent a mobile laundry truck so those in hurricane-affected areas could get their laundry done free of charge.

And while Budweiser’s Super Bowl ad is still just trying to sell beer at the end of the day, the spot does give consumers a brief look into the lives of its employees.

Audiences follow real-life Budweiser employee Kevin Fahrenkrog (and his wife) to the Cartersville brewery. There are no actors in the ad, according to the company, as 24 Anheuser-Busch employees are featured in the commercial. Employees recreated how they transform the plant into a canned water facility during emergencies.

Former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) has decided against running for Senate this year because God didn’t say yes.

“I tried to have my ears open and hear what God was saying to me, and I considered it for quite a long time,” Bachmann said Saturday on “Understanding the Times Radio” with Jan Markell. “It became very clear to me that I wasn’t hearing any call from God to do this.”

Bachmann, a staunch conservative who served four terms in the House and ran for president in the 2012 election, had been mulling a bid for the seat vacated by Sen. Al Franken (D). But as first reported Monday by Minnesota Public Radio, she didn’t get a “sense from the Lord” that she should go for it.

Here’s a radio clip:

Bachmann first indicated in December that she was eyeing Franken’s seat and said she would be asking God for guidance.

The Lord flippantly responded on a billboard in St. Paul, Minnesota, last week: NO.

The group behind the billboard, TheGoodLordAbove, runs a satirical website that claims to belong to God.

Newly appointed Sen. Tina Smith (D) began temporarily filling Franken’s seat last month. Smith, who served as lieutenant governor of Minnesota for three years, is running in November to fill the remainder of Franken’s term, which goes through 2020.“We started it a couple of years ago just for fun, and then it grew from there,” she told HuffPost.

Their quirky enthusiasm quickly made it one of the most entertaining parts of the Super Bowl that year. They came back for Super Bowl 51 and didn’t disappoint.

Well, Sr. Miriam James and Sr. Mary returned for Super Bowl 52 to watch the Philadelphia Eagles beat the New England Patriots 41-33. Maybe they put in a few good words to the man upstairs?

Ultimately, the nuns are just in it to have fun and they hope everyone following them will have fun too. “We love to laugh and hopefully bring people joy (while watching the Eagles win),” she says.

Oh, it brings us more joy than you can know, sister.

And who can forget when he referred to ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon as “Sloppy Steve”?

Yes, the ability to make schoolyard-level insults stick is President Trump’s superpower.

Which is why many people on Twitter felt something was amiss Monday when the President attacked Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) by calling him “Little Adam Schiff.”

Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!

Even Trump supporters were a little disappointed by the president’s insult and gently offered suggestions (but not in a manner that might make the chief executive turn on them instead).

Schiff responded with his own tweet a short while later, but preferred to insult the president’s policies rather than come up with a nasty nickname.America and the Western world have been fighting an endless war on terror since September 11, 2001. At a cost of nearly $7 trillion, this war has nearly bankrupted our nation. The financial cost fails to account for the heavy long term physical and mental toll on millions of service members and their families.



Shamefully, we don’t even dare call this war by it’s proper name, “the global war against Islamic terrorism.” Failure to properly identify the enemy is a slap in the face to every service member who has served and to all the military families who have sacrificed so much in this endless war. Worse, when our political and religious leaders tell us ‘Islam is a religion of peace’ and ‘terror has nothing to do with Islam,’ America cedes the moral high ground of freedom, and we no longer become a beacon of hope to all those living under a hateful and deadly ideology that punishes or kills them for leaving Islam. Until we face the truth about the root cause of terrorism, we will never win this war.



Many military families are asking, ‘for what purpose are we sacrificing American lives in this war?’ It is our duty as a country to clearly identify the enemy and clearly outline the path to victory. Only then can we ask a service member to place their life in danger.



President Trump is fighting every day to redefine our failed foreign policy of military intervention. He continually battles those who clamor for regime change in the Middle East, including those who want regime change in Syria.



Who is pushing hardest for regime change? I bet a full airing of my conversation would give you a better picture of my thoughts on broader Middle Eastern politics. Here is a brief outline.



For two decades or more, America’s honorable military tradition has been at the beck and call of a policy to rewrite the map of the Middle East, for reasons both evident and secretive. Interests beyond the disclosure of national security objectives and clear and present danger have placed our nation’s finest young men and women in theaters of battle with objectives that have been concealed from the American public and shielded even from Congressional approval to go to war, as demanded by the Constitution.



I don’t think this is a secret to most Americans to say that our military has faced a rate of deployment and a burden of service that has been unprecedented in our national history. And I don’t think it’s controversial to speak the truth about the manipulations and unarticulated objectives of the Obama-Hillary Clinton foreign policy. It’s high time someone spoke the truth about endless wars and the disservice that’s been visited on the finest military tradition and the most effective fighting force in the history of warfare.



Our fighting men and women are always ready and willing to answer the call and to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. We owe to them as leaders and as citizens that that sacrifice never be demanded on false pretense. In Iraq it was weapons of mass destruction. In Libya it was humanitarian intervention. The result in every conflict in the Bush-Obama era has been regime change that has left the most radicalized and dangerous elements of Muslim leadership in charge of entire nations. With accelerated chaos, increased bloodshed and fewer rights and freedoms as a result.



I think our nation’s soldiers deserve better political outcomes than to watch patches of sand they fought, bled and died for to be given back to an ever encroaching enemy, and in every case, turned over to people who hate the United States, are openly hostile to democratic ideals and have no respect or reverence for essential liberty or the dignity of human life. The Middle East is not a military failure. It is a political travesty and a dishonest expenditure of the most valuable resource we have. The very best and most dedicated of our young men and women in uniform.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mick Mulvaney, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has pulled back from a full-scale probe of how Equifax Inc failed to protect the personal data of millions of consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.

Equifax said in September that hackers stole personal data it had collected on some 143 million Americans. Richard Cordray, then the CFPB director, authorized an investigation that month, said former officials familiar with the probe.

But Cordray resigned in November and was replaced by Mulvaney, President Donald Trump’s budget chief. The CFPB effort against Equifax has sputtered since then, said several government and industry sources, raising questions about how Mulvaney will police a data-warehousing industry that has enormous sway over how much consumers pay to borrow money.

The CFPB has the tools to examine a data breach like Equifax, said John Czwartacki, a spokesman, but the agency is not permitted to acknowledge an open investigation. “The bureau has the desire, expertise, and know-how in-house to vigorously pursue hypothetical matters such as these,” he said.

Three sources say, though, Mulvaney, the new CFPB chief, has not ordered subpoenas against Equifax or sought sworn testimony from executives, routine steps when launching a full-scale probe. Meanwhile, the CFPB has shelved plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data, an idea backed by Cordray.

The CFPB also recently rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when they offered to help with on-site exams of credit bureaus, said two sources familiar with the matter.

Equifax has said it is under investigation by every state attorney general and faces more than 240 class action lawsuits.

The Federal Trade Commission is examining the breach and the company may face financial penalties. The last time the FTC penalized a major credit bureau was in 2012, a $393,000 settlement with Equifax.

In contrast, the CFPB fined credit bureaus more than $25 million just last year for over-marketing its monitoring services, which generated monthly fees.

The FTC confirmed in September it was investigating Equifax but a spokesman declined further comment.

Credit bureaus like Equifax, TransUnion and Experian collect and store personal information on scores of millions of consumers. Banks and other lenders rely on the information to track how consumers spend money and manage debt, then use it to decide what interest rate to charge for loans.

The Equifax breach exposed vulnerabilities in how the companies keep data safe. It also highlighted how credit bureaus exist in a regulatory gray zone where they are partly regulated by several agencies.

Under Cordray, the CFPB and FTC agreed to work together on the Equifax inquiry, sources said. But while the agencies have similar powers to investigate, only the FTC has issued a subpoena.

And while Cordray had asked bank regulators to join in fresh cybersecurity exams of the bureaus, last month the CFPB told the regulators that no on-site exams were planned, so their help was not needed, said three officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The banking regulators declined to comment, and the credit bureaus declined to comment on their dealings with regulators.

But TransUnion said the CFPB has no authority to examine the company over cybersecurity concerns. “We believe that it is clear that the CFPB was not given legal authority to supervise any financial institutions with respect to cybersecurity,” the company said in a statement.

The CFPB has come under sustained attack from Republicans during the seven years of its existence.MINNEAPOLIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Moments after a stunning Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, New England Patriots’ 40-year-old quarterback Tom Brady was not ready to retire, saying he would likely return and try again for his sixth National Football League title.

Brady, the face of the NFL with his five previous Super Bowl victories, suffered his third defeat in the championship game, losing the ball on a strip sack at a crucial time in the Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 victory.

“I expect to be back,” Brady said. “It’s 15 minutes after the game ended, so I would like to process this. I don’t see why I wouldn’t be back.”

The strip-sack play with a little over two minutes left and his team down five points overshadowed his Super Bowl record 505 yards passing. He completed 28 of 48 passes with three touchdowns and no turnovers, moving the ball so well that the Patriots never punted.

For all his success, though, two failed plays will stand out in Sunday’s loss.

On the strip sack, he dropped back to pass and came under pressure, with Philadelphia linebacker Brandon Graham knocking the ball loose and Philadelphia’s Derek Barnett recovering and advancing the ball to the Patriots’s 31-yard line.

That led to an Eagles field goal and an eight-point lead that held for the rest of the game.

“Those guys had a good rush and got it there and made a good play,” Brady said. “They made a good play at the right time.”

In another rare flop, he went out as a receiver on a trick play on third down in the second quarter but could not haul in the pass from receiver Danny Amendola, which was just beyond his reach.

Brady handed off to running back James White, who pitched it to Amendola on what appeared to be a reverse while Brady sneaked out into the flat, wide open. A catch would have resulted in a first down. Instead, it bounced off his outstretched hands.

“Danny made a good throw. I just didn’t make the play,” Brady said.

Asked if he caught the pass in practice, he said: “Yeah, I caught it. Didn’t catch it tonight.”

Dominant as the Patriots have been since Brady’s first championship after the 2001 season, he said: “No one is going to feel sorry for us.”

Nor will they feel sorry for Brady, who is revered in New England and in 2009 married Brazilian-born model Gisele Bundchen, the mother of their two children.

Brady has attributed his longevity in part to a strict diet of largely organic, plant-based foods, avoiding those he says contribute to muscle inflammation, while drinking 12 to 25 glasses of water per day, including 20 ounces (60 cl) fortified with electrolytes first thing in the morning.

He says he goes to sleep at 8:30 p.m.

For now, he will have the off-season to contemplate how the Patriots will return to football’s center stage.The Super Bowl is one of the greatest visual spectacles on Earth, but at least one young kid at the game appeared to have found something more interesting on his phone, in the process creating the greatest meme of the day.

Justin Timberlake’s halftime performance grabbed headlines even before it started ― with speculations about whether he would address the 2004 ‘nipplegate’ controversy with Janet Jackson, if Jackson herself would make an appearance, and even rumors about a Prince hologram. As Timberlake ran through a medley of hits on the field, a large crowd of fans gathered around.

One of them was a 13-year-old from Massachusetts, identified as Ryan McKenna.

When you’re introverted and don’t know how to act around normal people.

Timberlake singled the kid out in the middle of the crowd, snapping a quick selfie with him and then getting back to his performance. With the cameras firmly on him, hundreds of millions of people around the world looking directly at his face, McKenna did exactly what most people would do in an awkward situation: look deeply into their phone.

As other fans danced, sang and generally lost their minds, viewers at home saw McKenna grab his phone ― and inspire a stack of jokes.

People on social media couldn’t stop joking about what the kid was looking at that was so much more important than what he was doing, in the middle of the field, during the halftime show, at the Super Bowl.

Some people criticized the kid for not living in the moment.

The Twin Cities Pioneer Press caught up with McKenna after the halftime show. He said he was recording a video of the performance and then, as Timberlake neared, he turned his phone around to switch modes and take a photo.

“It’s been so crazy,” McKenna told the Pioneer Press. “I don’t even know what to think. All my friends have been texting me and stuff. It’s insane.”

Ryan’s dad John McKenna told the Pioneer Press that his phone “started blowing up” following the TV broadcast of the moment.SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has banned 36,000 foreigners from entering the country ahead of the Winter Olympics, citing security concerns, Yonhap News Agency said on Monday.

Yonhap cited a South Korean lawmaker as saying the spy agency had told lawmakers it was working with foreign intelligence agencies to beef up foreign nationals’ identity checks as an anti-terrorism plan for the Olympics.Fans in Philadelphia promptly took to the streets on Sunday night after the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots, 41-33, for the team’s first Super Bowl championship.

Fans shot off fireworks, climbed poles ― despite the fact that many had been greased ― scaled buildings, marched, chanted and made a whole lot of noise.

But there were also reports of small fires and at least one overturned car, as well as smashed windows, damage to stores and poles being completely removed out of the ground.

Three people were arrested during the rowdy celebrations, a spokeswoman Mayor Jim Kenney’s office on Monday.

“Tens of thousands came out and celebrated this amazing victory last night, and but for a handful of bad actors the celebration was peaceful and jubilant,” according to the statement. “We’re thankful for our PPD for their assistance in getting the crowds dispersed and people home safely.”

Police have not yet released specific figures such as the number of injuries.

“We have had several acts of vandalism where windows have been smashed, and some injuries have been reported around light poles that have been pulled down,” the Philadelphia Police Department said in a statement to The New York Times. “We have one report of looting at a gas station. There have been no fatalities.”

Roughly a dozen Eagles fans scaled an awning attached to the Ritz Carlton hotel in downtown Philadelphia, causing the structure to collapse. It’s not clear if anyone was injured.

At least two phone poles were toppled and at least one person was seriously injured, CBS Philadelphia reported.

The city’s mayor urged fans to “celebrate safely.”

“We know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your Birds as champs,” Kenney said in a statement Sunday. “I urge everyone to celebrate in a way that is safe and respectful to everyone from neighbors to strangers. Go forth and celebrate, but do so in a way that will make Philadelphia shine.”

Here are some of the scenes from throughout the city:

The 1992 Olympic gold medalist told InStyle that she gave fellow skater Karen Chen some heartwarming advice before the 18-year-old heads to the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea.

“The one major thing that I’ve told her is that for the Olympics you have to learn to insulate yourself from the pressure,” Yamaguchi said. “I’ve always tried to keep her thinking positively because it’s easy to let doubts creep into your head before a big performance like this.”

The 46-year-old noted that with the rise of social media, “it’s easy to feel like you are being constantly judged.” But she assured Chen that despite the critics, many more want to see her succeed.

“I told Karen, ‘America is rooting for you! You can’t forget that—even with all the pressure that you’re feeling right now,’” Yamaguchi said. “I’m so proud of her because she has overcome a lot of obstacles to get to this point.”

Chen has faced some serious medical issues and other challenges on her journey to the Olympics. She detailed those struggles in her autobiography, Finding the Edge, which features a foreword written by Yamaguchi. In particular, Chen wrote that she’s been dealing with a “chronic, and at times debilitating, back condition.” But she said she turned her pain into a lesson about life.

“Initially, my back pain was scary and I dealt with a lot of fear. But my only choice was to figure out a way to overcome the fear. I tried avoiding it — which didn’t work,” the teen wrote. “It was only after I embraced it that I found a breakthrough. My back condition forced me to strengthen other areas of my body, which made me more powerful overall. In my weakness, I found strength.”

Yamaguchi also talked to InStyle about becoming the first Asian-American woman to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics.

“It’s funny because at the time I didn’t even know I was the first until it was reported on the news,” she said. “It’s cool though! I love when young skaters come up to me and say that I’ve inspired them to take up the sport.”

Indeed, Yamaguchi’s accomplishments made an enormous impression at the time on young Asian-Americans, who rarely saw themselves represented in sports or entertainment. Writer Nicole Chung penned a piece for The New York Times in 2016 talking about just how much Yamaguchi meant to her and to a generation of children of color.

Will Smith returned to his roots on Sunday with a short film to create some hype for the Philadelphia Eagles’ big night.

A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith) on Feb 4, 2018 at 2:42pm PST

In case you forgot, Smith is from West Philadelphia, born and raised. The “Fresh Prince” star is clearly rooting for his hometown team to win its first Super Bowl in franchise history. The video above depicts a montage of game-day preparation scored to the theme song of the city’s other famous athlete, Rocky Balboa.

Smith got ready with his special Eagles merchandise, keychain included, and watched a little pregame analysis, which is a roller coaster of emotion. His game face is more than a little intimidating with Bill Conti’s classic “Gonna Fly Now” playing in the background.Several members of Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles have said they will not visit the White House if invited by President Donald Trump.

Wide receiver Torrey Smith, defensive end Chris Long and safety Malcolm Jenkins have all said they won’t be going, NJ.com reported.

Jenkins said during an appearance Monday on CNN’s “New Day” that he does “not anticipate” attending the White House celebration.

“My message has been clear all year,” Jenkins said. “I’m about, you know, creating positive change in the communities that I come from, whether it be Philadelphia, New Jersey, Ohio, Louisiana or this entire country.

“I want to see changes in our criminal justice system,” he continued. “I want to see us push for ... [economic] and educational advancement in communities of color and low-income communities. And I want to see our relationships between our communities and our law enforcement be advanced.”

Several members of last year’s championship team, the New England Patriots, also refused to attend a White House ceremony in order to protest Trump’s policies. Since then, relations between the president and NFL players have only worsened.

In recent months, Trump has urged the league to fire or suspend players who took a knee during the national anthem in order protest racial inequality and police brutality.

“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired?’” Trump said during a speech in Alabama in September.

After Trump’s speech, more players began kneeling during the national anthem. He continued to slam their actions on Twitter and in speeches, and even raised the issue ― without mentioning the NFL specifically ― during his State of the Union address.

But players insist that they’re demonstrating to bring attention to important issues, not to disrespect the flag or the anthem.

“They call it the anthem protest,” Smith told NJ.com. “We’re not protesting the anthem. It’s a protest during the anthem. I understand why people are mad or may be offended when someone takes a knee.”

Long made his intentions clear in a podcast interview last week.

“No, I’m not going to the White House,” he told the “Pardon My Take” podcast. “Are you kidding me?”

Long was on the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots last season and was among several players who declined the White House visit.

“[When] my son grows up, and I believe the legacy of our president is going to be what it is, I don’t want him to say, ‘Hey Dad, why’d you go [to the White House] when you knew the right thing was to not go?’” Long said, according to the Washington Post.

Eagles running back LeGarrette Blount also skipped the visit last year when he was a member of the Patriots. Although he hasn’t announced his intentions this year, Blount expressed strong feelings last time around.

“I just don’t feel welcome into that house,” Blount said at the time. “I’m just gonna leave it at that.”

Last year Trump withdrew his White House invitation to the NBA champion Golden State Warriors after two-time MVP Steph Curry said he didn’t want to go.

This article has been updated to include Malcolm Jenkins’ comments.Rachel Crooks, one of the 19 women who have accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, announced Monday that she is running for the Ohio state Legislature.

Crooks, a 35-year-old director of international student recruitment at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, told Cosmopolitan magazine that she was inspired to run for office in part because she wants to be a voice for women who have suffered sexual harassment and because Trump has never been held accountable for allegedly kissing her without her consent in 2005.

When Crooks was 22 and working in Trump Tower in New York, she said she met the real estate mogul for the first time outside an elevator in his office building. He allegedly kissed her on both cheeks and then moved to her mouth. The New York Times reported her story in October 2016 along with that of another accuser, but Trump was nevertheless elected president the following month.

“I think my voice should have been heard then, and I’ll still fight for it to be heard now,” Crooks told Cosmo. “Americans are really upset with politics as usual, and I want to be a voice for them.”

Trump has denied Crooks’ allegations, as well as those of the 18 other women who have accused him of sexual assault and harassment.

Ohio’s Democratic Party is backing Crooks, who wants to expand access to affordable health care and to reform the state’s education system by moving money from charter schools to public schools.

If she wins the Democratic primary in May, she will challenge incumbent state Rep. Bill Reineke (R) in the fall. Ohio’s 88th District swung for Trump in 2016, but favored Barack Obama in the two previous presidential elections, so Crooks is hopeful she can flip it back after a year of Trump’s “erratic and ineffective” leadership.

Crooks, who said she never considered running for office before Trump’s election, told Cosmo that she has been inspired herself by the groundswell of women leading the resistance against Trump. An unprecedented number of women are running for office in 2018, motivated to challenge the president and the political system that has kept men like him in power for centuries.

“Women are uniting,” Crooks said. “The momentum is now. I want to be part of it.”After months of speculation, Kylie Jenner announced Sunday that she and boyfriend Travis Scott welcomed a baby girl on Feb. 1.

The 20-year-old lip kit mogul, who explained in a long note why she kept her pregnancy secret, provided fans with a nearly 12-minute video documenting her last nine months. It answered some of the questions fans have been dying to know, and also gives a first look at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s third child, Chicago West.

Jenner’s video, titled “To Our Daughter,” shows the then-pregnant reality star holding little Chicago.

“She looks completely different,” Jenner says in the video. “She’s so little.”

During the sweet moment, Jenner’s best friend, Jordyn Woods, asks Kardashian if she’s decided on a name.

“I think we’re gonna go with Chicago,” Kardashian says. Jenner tells Kardashian she loves the name.

Jenner didn’t reveal the name of her own baby girl, or a full photo or video. Her YouTube video shows only a shot of the baby’s arm and leg wiggling around shortly after her birth.

There are many other big reveals in the video. Friends share how Jenner told them she was pregnant, and another friend says Jenner has wanted a child since she was 15.

Woods confirms that in the video.

“When you’re 20 years old, you’re just figuring out your life,” Woods says. “You don’t know what you want, you’re an indecisive teenager and you’re just becoming a young adult, and there was one thing that your mom knew for sure, and that was you.”Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and Shuri (Letitia Wright) in "Black Panther."

“Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler thinks it would be “amazing” to do a spinoff film featuring the badass women of Wakanda.

“Oh man. That would be amazing if the opportunity came up,” Coogler responded to a question about an all-female “Black Panther” during a talk at Cannes Film Festival last week. “They did it in the comic-book version.”

Marvel announced in March that the female warriors of “Black Panther,” the Dora Milaje, are getting their very own three-issue comic book mini-series. The first installment, set to be released in June, is titled Wakanda Forever: The Amazing Spider-Man.

Coogler added that one of his favorite parts of “Black Panther” occurs when T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is believed to be dead and the women of Wakanda ― Okoye (Danai Gurira), Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) ― have to take the reins.

“That part of the movie you feel like you’re watching something fresh and new. That part of it was exciting,” he said. “We have these actresses who could easily carry their own movie. Some of them have before. We were so fortunate. I would watch a movie with them!”

“Black Panther” dominated the box office after its February release and has earned over $696 million domestically. Worldwide, the film has grossed over 1.3 billion as of May 14.

When moderator Elvis Mitchell asked at Cannes if the women of Wakanda were just as important as the men, Coogler responded: “I think you could argue they are more important.”Top Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania suffered another defeat on Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court denied their request to delay drawing a new congressional map ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state’s congressional map gave Republicans such a clear political advantage that it “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s constitution. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court gave Republican lawmakers about three weeks to redraw the map, and said the court would redraw the map itself if the lawmakers failed to agree on one with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D).

Hinting that there weren’t federal questions at stake, the Pennsylvania justices wrote the Pennsylvania Constitution was the “sole basis” for their decision.

Pennsylvania Republicans appealed the state court’s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying the U.S. Constitution only granted legislatures, not state courts, the power to draw congressional districts. They also said an entirely new congressional map would cause chaos in the system’s election process, set to begin at the end of February. Pennsylvania’s top election official says they can run the election in a timely manner with a new map in place.

Their request went before Justice Samuel Alito, who oversees the 3rd Circuit, which includes Pennsylvania. Alito denied the request on Monday without referring it to the whole court.

“This was always a Pennsylvania state court case about Pennsylvania’s Constitution, and the U.S. Supreme Court rightly refused the Republican Legislative leaders’ attempt to manufacture a federal issue,” said R. Stanton Jones, a partner at Arnold & Porter, which helped represent the plaintiffs: 18 Democratic voters from each of the state’s congressional districts. “Pennsylvania voters will now get to cast their ballots in fair elections this year.”

Wolf, who was named as a defendant in the suit but supported the challenge to the state’s congressional map, praised the Supreme Court’s decision on Monday. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court gave him and lawmakers until Feb. 15 to come up with an agreement on a congressional map.

“The U.S. Supreme Court correctly recognized that there is no reason to delay implementing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s order. Now, all parties must focus on getting a fair map in place,” he said in a statement. “Gerrymandering is wrong and we must correct errors of the past with the existing map. My team is ready, willing and able to work with the General Assembly to ensure a new map is fair and within the clear orders given by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.”

Legal experts saw the GOP appeal to the Supreme Court as a long shot, because the case involved a challenge to Pennsylvania’s congressional map solely under the state’s constitution, not the federal one. In a 2015 case from Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that an independent commission could draw congressional districts, recognizing that state legislatures were not the sole bodies with control over the redistricting process.

In a joint statement, Pennsylvania House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R) were defiant, saying they still did not believe the state’s congressional map was illegal. They said the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had “handicapped” Alito by failing to provide a full opinion to accompany its order to redraw the state’s congressional map.

“It is astounding that fourteen days after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled the map to be unconstitutional, the Justices have still not issued a majority opinion. This irresponsible approach handicapped Justice Alito by not providing him with more information, just as it has handicapped the Legislature,” they said in the statement.

The top Republicans added they would “do [their] best” to come up with a new map by the court’s imposed deadline, but “may be compelled to pursue further legal action in federal court.”

The ruling from the high court ended Republicans’ last pending legal appeal on redrawing the state’s map, but Republicans in the state may not be done fighting. Scarnati has indicated he won’t comply with a court order to hand over information to assist the court in drawing the map because he believes it’s unlawful.

The Brennan Center for Justice has described the Pennsylvania congressional map as one of the worst gerrymanders in the country. Controlling the redistricting process in 2011, Republicans drew a congressional map that gave them a considerable advantage. In every election since that map was implemented, Republicans have won 13 of 18 congressional seats, despite winning just about 50 percent of the vote.
