Faith-based refugee resettlement agencies were among the first to speak out against President Donald Trump’s plans to drastically curb refugee admissions to the United States. One year after Trump first issued an executive order restricting immigration, some of these agencies are reflecting on a policy many religious leaders feel has been detrimental to the country.

The Christian refugee agency World Relief, a humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, issued a strong condemnation Thursday of the “various incarnations of the travel ban,” saying the policy has prevented thousands of families fleeing conflict in Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Myanmar from seeking shelter in America.

“Make no mistake, this has been a net loss for our country,” the organization said in a statement. “Refugee families don’t tear America apart, they make us stronger ... We pray that President Trump and elected officials from each side of the aisle would ensure that we remain a beacon of hope to ALL people seeking a better a way of life.”

The president signed his first executive order on immigration on Jan. 27, 2017, and followed it up with two other modified iterations of the ban. All three versions placed travel restrictions on citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. The first two bans also suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the third version of the ban.

Six of the nine voluntary agencies that the federal government tasks with refugee resettlement are faith-based, and many have been speaking up for refugees over the past year.

In its statement, World Relief said less than 30,000 refugees had been admitted to the United States in 2017, compared to over 99,000 in 2016. Broken out into religious affiliation, World Relief estimated that the number of Christian refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2017 was 63 percent lower than the number admitted in 2016. About 80 percent fewer Muslim refugees were admitted during that time.

Even though Trump capped refugee arrivals for 2018 at 45,000, the country is only on track to resettle half that number, World Relief reports.

“The combination of drastically reducing the refugee arrivals ceiling with the various executive orders affecting refugees over the past year have harmed persecuted Christians as well as those of other faiths,” World Relief said in its statement.

Linda Hartke, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, told HuffPost the ban has meant that vulnerable refugees, including torture survivors, unaccompanied refugee children, persecuted religious minorities and those with severe medical needs, continue to be in harm’s way.

“As Christians, we are called to love and serve the neighbors God gives to us and provide places of safety and protection for those fleeing danger,” Hartke said in an email. “The administration’s decisions have been a clear violation of these values, as well as our American ideals of compassion and acceptance. America is diminished when we abandon our values and close our doors on those in need.”

The Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS, founded as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, released a video to mark the anniversary of the first travel ban. In it, the writer and actor Scott Rogowsky recounts the history of the ban, which was first enacted on Holocaust Remembrance Day. He also points to the mandate in Jewish scriptures to love and welcome the stranger.Dozens of other current and former employees told The Guardian they had witnessed “a culture of silence” at the organization in which victims feared their jobs would be compromised if they came forward about misconduct.

The World Food Programme and UNAIDS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the investigations of senior staff. Both investigations were addressed in a briefing on Thursday with Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the U.N.’s secretary-general. Dujarric did not confirm or deny the reports.

In a statement to The Guardian, a spokesperson for UNAIDS said the organization could not comment on investigations but added that it observed “a clear regulatory framework for all investigation processes and proceedings.”

On Wednesday, the World Food Programme published an email to staff from its executive director, David Beasley, detailing changes to the program’s policy on sexual harassment and abuse.

Beasley wrote:

I know that some of our WFP colleagues are afraid to speak up, believing that they cannot even think about filing a complaint about misconduct because their jobs will be threatened or their careers derailed. [...] The only people who should be afraid about our policies in this area should be those who commit these acts. WFP has indeed taken serious action against people regarding sexual harassment, including suspending them while the conduct is reviewed, and, where it is established that it happened, firing them.

Among the changes the executive director announced were an end to a six-month time limit for reporting violations, as well as a new policy to allow anonymous complaints and complaints from former employees to be considered.

Beasley also said the program would implement stronger punishment for any attempts to retaliate against someone reporting abuse. He did not comment specifically on Lorentzen’s reported suspension.

“I intend to spend time during the coming year talking with and listening to women at all levels of WFP about these issues,” Beasley wrote. “I believe we can lead the rest of the U.N., even the rest of the humanitarian world.”SEOUL (Reuters) - A fire in a South Korean hospital that did not have a sprinkler system killed at least 37 people and injured more than 70 others on Friday, officials said, the latest tragedy to raise concerns over the country’s safety standards.

Many patients “walked though fire and smoke” to escape the blaze at the Sejong Hospital, in the southern city of Miryang, as the main exit was on the first floor which was ablaze, a city official told Reuters.

Other patients used ladders and plastic escape slides to flee upper floors, while firefighters carried patients who could not walk.

The fire is the deadliest in South Korea in at least a decade and follows a fire last month which killed 29 people in a high rise sports center.

The presidential Blue House initially said the fire killed at least 41, but then deferred to the city’s fire chief who put the death toll at 37.

Reuters

A list posted by fire officials outside the hospital identified at least 26 of the victims by name. With ages ranging from 35 to 96 years, at least 20 of the victims were over 70 years of age.

On a wall at a funeral home next to the hospital, officials had scrawled a handwritten list of names and hospital rooms as family members crowded around to look.

The fire started at around 7.30 a.m. (2230 GMT) at the rear of the emergency room on the first floor of the hospital, Choi Man-woo, the head of Miryang city’s fire station, told a televised media briefing. With a population of around 108,000, Miryang is about 270 km (170 miles) southeast of Seoul.

Television news footage showed a huge pall of black smoke billowing from the windows and entrance to the hospital and flames flickering.

At least 177 patients - most of them elderly - were at the hospital and an adjacent nursing home when the fire broke out, hospital director Song Byeong-cheol said at a press briefing.

Song said at least one doctor, a nurse, and a nurse’s aide were killed on the second floor.

Most of those who died were on the first and second floors, said Choi, adding there were no deaths from burns.

By Friday afternoon the burnt out hospital was ringed by police as forensic investigators combed the smoke-blackened building. Charred debris and shattered glass littered the ground outside.

NO SPRINKLER SYSTEM

Song said the hospital did not have a sprinkler system and was not large enough to require one under South Korean law.

That was due to change this year under a new law, however, and hospitals in the country had until the end of June to install a sprinkler system to comply with new regulations, Choi told Reuters. He said he did not know if the hospital had been planning to install a system.

Officials said they were still investigating the cause, but are looking closely at a possible short circuit in the emergency room’s heating and cooling system.

Song said the hospital had regular safety inspections.

South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy and one of the world’s fastest aging populations, has faced criticism in recent years over inadequate safety standards.

President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency meeting with top aides and called on the government to take “all necessary measures” to help survivors.

Interior minister Kim Boo-kyum traveled to Miryang to apologize for the fire. He promised the government would do its best in helping the victims, Yonhap reported.

A number of South Korean lawmakers also visited survivors and toured the scene.

In December, 29 people were killed in a blaze at an eight-story fitness center in Jecheon City.

Most of the victims of that fire were women trapped in a sauna by toxic fumes, sparking anger at reports of shoddy construction, broken doors, blocked exits and other problems that may have contributed to the deaths.Shoppers in France went nutty over heavily discounted Nutella on Thursday.

In ugly scenes evocative of Black Friday in the U.S., some customers at Intermarché supermarkets brawled in a bid to bag cheap jars of the chocolate-hazelnut spread, according to multiple media reports.

Police were reportedly called to deal with outbreaks of violence after the chain slashed the price of a 950-gram jar by 70 percent, to 1.41 euros (about $1.76) from 4.50 euros (about $5.61).

“They are like animals,” the BBC reported one customer at an unidentified store as saying. “A woman had her hair pulled, an elderly lady took a box on her head, another had a bloody hand.”

A regional French newspaper described the commotion as a “riot.” Some scenes were captured on camera:

In some stores, customers were limited to how many jars they could buy.

“People were piling in, they knocked everything over and broke stuff,” a worker at a store in Moselle, in eastern France, told the Agence France-Presse news agency.

Intermarché has not yet commented on the violence.

Ferrero, Nutella’s Italian maker, has distanced itself from the promotion, saying the supermarket chain “unilaterally” decided to cut the price.

A Tesla Model S sedan equipped with a semi-autonomous Autopilot system plowed into a truck stopped at a Utah traffic light Friday night, though it remains unknown if the Autopilot was in use during the crash.

The Tesla’s female driver suffered a broken ankle and there was extensive damage to the car, according to police. Authorities are still investigating and have contacted the National Transportation Safety Board, The Associated Press reported.

Tesla’s Autopilot system uses cameras and computers to regulate speed, change lanes and automatically stop cars. But drivers are instructed to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes and attention on the road.

It didn’t appear that brakes were applied before Friday’s accident. Witnesses said they didn’t see the car slow before it crashed into the back of a Unified Fire Authority mechanic truck at 60 mph in the town of South Jordan outside of Salt Lake City, reported the local Gephardt Daily. The driver of the truck didn’t require treatment.

The Tesla’s driver did not appear to be under the influence of any substance that could have impaired her driving, according to police.

“For unknown reasons, the Tesla failed to stop for the traffic at the red light and ran into the back of the Unified Fire Authority vehicle at 60 miles per hour,” local police Sgt. Sam Winkler told Fox-TV 13 in Salt Lake City.

Airbags were activated in the crash. A light rain had made the roads wet, according to a police statement.

The NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are investigating at least two other accidents involving Teslas, including the crash of a Tesla Model X SUV in California in which the driver was killed. Investigators are examining the Autopilot system in that case.

The NTSB and the NHTSA are also examining a fiery crash last week involving a Tesla Model S In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in which two teenagers were killed.White House officials have for months categorically denied that President Donald Trump was considering the removal of Robert Mueller, but news reports Thursday claim the president went so far as giving the order to fire the special counsel in June.

The New York Times, which first reported the news, revealed that the president only backed down from removing Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation, after White House counsel Donald McGahn III threatened to resign. The special counsel found out about the attempt to fire him “in recent months,” the Times wrote. The Washington Post echoed the Times’ reporting, saying it had independently confirmed from sources the claims about Trump wanting to terminate Mueller.

But Trump surrogates and White House officials have repeatedly rejected the idea.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the president on ABC’s “This Week” in early August and denied the special counsel was at risk. When host George Stephanopoulos asked whether the president would commit to not fire Mueller, Conway said “the president has not even discussed that. He’s not discussing firing Bob Mueller.”

Trump has repeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt,” insisting that there was no evidence of collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign in the lead up the 2016 election.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has reiterated Trump’s position during multiple press briefings, but has also denied that there was talk of firing Mueller.

“For the 1,000th time, we have no intentions of firing Bob Mueller,” Sanders told Fox News in December. “We are continuing to work closely and cooperating with him. We look forward to seeing this hoax wrap up soon.”

Speaking to NBC News just days before that, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said, “There’s no conversation about that in the White House whatsoever.”

Trump’s lawyers who are dealing with the president’s response to Mueller’s investigation have said the same thing.

White House lawyer Jay Sekulow told CNN in October, “The president is not interfering with special counsel Mueller’s position, he’s not firing the special counsel. He’s said that before.”

A day before the first concert, the artist announced she had suffered a vocal cord hemorrhage during tour rehearsals in October. Shakira delayed her tour twice before announcing rescheduled dates in December.

But the new year has brought new challenges for the star, as Spanish authorities confirmed this week that they were investigating Shakira for possible tax evasion. Spain’s tax authorities suspect the Colombian singer was already living in Barcelona from 2012 to 2014, before she officially switched residences in 2015 from the Bahamas to Spain, according to The Associated Press.So, I read ASOIAF before I really became ~politically aware~ and because of that whenever someone mentions #Davos I think of a very nice smuggler from Fleabottom and not a place in Switzerland where rich people goBut it’s not because Davis ― aka law professor Annalise Keating in ABC’s hit drama ― is a fan of President Donald Trump’s wife.

Hollis served in his role for 10 years, and oversaw the athletic department while Nassar treated some of the school’s athletes. The university employed Nassar for about two decades, until a report came out in the Indianapolis Star in September 2016 that alleged the doctor had sexually assaulted patients. Nassar also worked for USA Gymnastics, and treated some of the most high-profile gymnasts in the country.

“Michigan State University is a great institution, and its greatest strengths are the people who call themselves Spartans,” Hollis said in a statement. “Many, if not all, of those Spartans are hurting, especially the courageous survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse. My heart breaks thinking about the incomprehensible pain all of them and their families have experienced. Along with many, I was brought to tears as I listened to their statements. There simply aren’t the right words to express our sympathy.”

Hollis’ last day at the university will be Jan. 31, a spokesman for the athletic department confirmed to HuffPost.

Nassar’s abusive behavior was reported multiple times, so MSU faces severe scrutiny over the way it handles complaints of sexual assault ― most notably from several of the 160-plus young women who read victim impact statements in court this month. A Detroit News report alleged that more than a dozen university employees were made aware of Nassar’s abuse and did not stop him.

Both the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Michigan’s attorney general are expected to investigate MSU over the scandal. Hollis said Friday that he plans to “fully cooperate” with any investigation.

He also said in his statement that he did not know about the abuse allegations until September 2016.

“I have always been a Spartan, and always will be,” he said, then warned against “jumping to conclusions” about any part he might have played in the scandal. “I am not running away from anything, I am running toward something. Comfort, compassion and understanding for the survivors and our community; togetherness, time and love for my family.”

MSU President Lou Anna Simon also resigned from her post on Thursday.

Judge Rosemarie Aquilina concluded a week-long hearing on Wednesday by sentencing Narrar to 40 years to 175 years in prison.

AdvertisementThe 2018 Grammys are just a few days away (Sunday, Jan. 28), and the nominees this year are fire. Going through the list of nominees, it’s pretty obvious that many of these talented stars weren’t born with the fun names they go by. Celebrities and musicians alike are known for taking stage names as they rise to fame — and Grammy nominees like Bruno Mars, P!nk, and Jay-Z are just a few who have followed suit.

Here are the real names and the stories behind some of this year’s nominees’ unique monikers. You know — just in case you need it for trivia some day.

Bruno Mars

Real name: Peter Hernandez. Nominated for six Grammys, including Album of the Year, the artist inherited the nickname “Bruno” from his dad as a toddler, after the big wrestler Bruno Sammartino. This has stuck with him for life.

Jay-Z

Real name: Shawn Corey Carter. Nominated for eight Grammys, including Album of the Year, the rapper once known as “Jazzy” changed his name to Jay-Z in homage to his mentor — rapper and producer Jaz-O — and the J and Z subway lines of his hometown of Brooklyn.

Cardi B

Real name: Belcalis Almanzar. Nominated for two Grammys, including Best Rap Song, the rapper used to call herself Bacardi, while her sister went by Hennessy. When she kept getting deleted from Instagram because her name was the same as the very popular brand of rum, she decided to shorten it to Cardi B.

Lady Gaga

Real name: Stefani Germanotta. Nominated for two Grammys, including Best Pop Vocal Album, Gaga took her name from the Queen song “Radio Ga-Ga,” but her ex-boyfriend, producer Rob Fusari, takes credit for her name because “Radio” autocorrected to “Lady” on his phone.

P!nk

Real name: Alecia Beth Moore. Nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance, the singer picked up her stage name after she was told that she resembled Steve Buscemi’s character, Mr. Pink, from the 1992 film, “Reservoir Dogs.”

Lil Uzi Vert

Real name: Symere Woods. Nominated for five Grammys, including Best New Artist, Uzi said that some guy said to him once, “Damn, you rap fast like a machine gun, like Uzi.” He added “Vert,” short for vertical, as in going straight to the top!

SZA

Real name: Solána Imani Rowe. Nominated for five Grammys, including Best New Artist, SZA picked her name from the supreme alphabet: S = Sovereign or Savior, Z = Zigzag, and A = Allah.YURI CORTEZ via Getty Images

WASHINGTON – For two years, first as a candidate and then as president, Donald Trump has vowed to rip up the existing trade pact with Mexico and Canada if he could not negotiate a better deal.

Now, with those negotiations imperiled over U.S. demands, it appears that Trump may not have the legal authority to keep that promise.

Because the North American Free Trade Agreement was implemented by legislation that passed both chambers of Congress in 1993, it would take a new act of Congress to end U.S. participation.

At least that’s the view some NAFTA proponents are taking. Others disagree, and believe Trump, under a 1974 law, has the ability to withdraw – although his doing so would almost certainly bring legal challenges.

Jon Johnson, who helped negotiate the original NAFTA for the Canadian government, said he personally believes Trump lacks the authority to pull out on his own, but in any event is certain that Trump taking that step would generate an ugly fight over separation of powers in the United States. “Unless he had the concurrence of Congress, it would be a real mess,” he said.

Wendy Cutler, who worked for 30 years in the United States Trade Representative’s office, said the president has the ability to withdraw but that it’s unclear what would happen to the schedule of tariffs that were approved under the agreement. “Different lawyers have different views on this,” said Cutler, who ended her tenure in the office as deputy trade representative under former President Barack Obama.

Trump has stated that he has the authority to pull the U.S. out of the two-decade-old trade deal. “I do not have to go back to Congress or to the Senate,” Trump told Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, according to a leaked transcript of a phone call last year. “I do not need the vote of 400 people. I have the powers to do all of this.”

The issue of Trump’s authority is boiling to the surface now because the sixth round of re-negotiations is set to begin this weekend in Montreal. The U.S. has angered both Mexico and Canada with what those nations are calling “poison pill” demands that seem more designed to sabotage the talks entirely than achieve an equitable resolution.

The U.S., for instance, is insisting that NAFTA automatically expire after five years unless it is reauthorized ― a change that Canada and Mexico do not support. Nor do the two countries support a U.S. demand that automobiles must have 50 percent of their content manufactured in the U.S. to avoid tariffs. Currently, cars must have 62.5 percent of their content made in the three-country trading bloc to avoid customs duties, but there is no country-specific content requirement.

Trump has argued that he wants trade to be “fair” and “reciprocal” – neither of which appears to apply in the requested automobile rule.

“I don’t think they’re arguing to anybody that it’s fair,” Johnson said. “I think they’re arguing that they want it.”

He said that some disputed items ― such as Canada’s stiff tariffs on dairy products ― had actually been addressed in the lengthy negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country agreement that had included all three of the NAFTA members in addition to countries in east Asia and South America. Trump withdrew from that agreement shortly after taking office a year ago, but it had never been approved by Congress. (The remaining 11 nations are now moving forward with the agreement without the U.S.) Despite that, Canada could well agree to terms similar to those it accepted on dairy in the new NAFTA talks, Johnson said.

The biggest obstacle to those negotiations, he added, was Trump’s repeated attacks on the agreement itself. “He made a huge deal out of what a horrible deal NAFTA was,” Johnson said. “It was the worst deal ever. It was terrible. You pick your adjective. He used them all.”

Both farming interests and the business community have lined up solidly in favor of keeping NAFTA, arguing that millions of U.S. jobs would be lost if supply chains that run back and forth across two borders are suddenly disrupted.

Perhaps responding to those warnings, Trump’s message on NAFTA now has become more mixed – at times suggesting that a good deal will emerge from the new negotiations while occasionally continuing his long-standing disparagement.

“NAFTA is a bad joke!” Trump wrote in a Twitter statement last week.

“I don’t know where he stands on it. And I don’t think Mr. Trump knows where he stands on it,” Johnson said. “I think Mr. Trump changes his mind day to day.”

As in so many other areas, the root cause of the problem appears to be Trump’s fundamental ignorance about policy details.

Trump claimed expertise on the matter because his branded clothing was manufactured overseas and because foreigners often buy condominiums in his branded buildings. Despite this, Trump as a candidate and then as president has continued to make confusing and baseless assertions about trade. In meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump appeared to believe the U.S. had a separate trade agreement with Germany, which it does not. He has accused South Korea – which also has a free trade agreement with the U.S. – of taking advantage of American taxpayers. And, most famously, he has repeatedly conflated the U.S. trade deficit with the nation’s accumulated debt.

“The fact that he keeps insisting that trade deficits mean we’re being ripped off is a clear, clear sign that he understands nothing about trade,” said Monica de Bolle, a macroeconomist and trade expert at the Peterson Institute. “You’re not getting ripped off. Countries have trade deficits when they consume more than they produce.”

Trump, she believes, is being driven by the narrow slice of his supporters who see international trade as the basis of their woes. “Trump is trying to appease everybody who thinks they lost their job in the manufacturing sector because of trade,” she said. “That’s why this sounds so ‘Alice in Wonderland-’ like.”

Christopher Wilson, an expert on Mexican trade with the Wilson Center, said the key to resolving the negotiations will be finding something relatively innocuous to Canada and Mexico that Trump can claim as a win.Protesters from the group Revolting Lesbians hold placards and chant slogans outside New York City's American Museum of Natural History on Jan. 21, 2018.

More than 200 scientists and researchers on Thursday released a public letter urging the American Museum of Natural History to cut ties with Rebekah Mercer ― a right-wing philanthropist and mega-donor to President Donald Trump who has poured millions into think tanks and websites that vilify researchers and deny human-caused climate change.

The letter calls Mercer, whose family foundation has donated $4.1 million to the museum over the past four years and who’s sat on its board since 2013, an “anti-science propagandist.”

“Rebekah Mercer and the Mercer Family Foundation, political kingmakers and the financiers behind Breitbart News, have given tens of millions to organizations who broadcast climate science denial and block policy and technological solutions to the climate crisis,” the letter reads.

The statement launches a new campaign by activists and scientists who last formed a coalition in 2015 to call for the ouster of David Koch, the fossil fuel billionaire who helped bankroll the movement to discredit and attack climate researchers. The coalition hailed victory when the 77-year-old tycoon stepped down from the museum’s board of trustees in January 2016.

Last Sunday, a progressive group called Revolting Lesbians staged a protest on the museum’s marble steps facing Manhattan’s Central Park West to demand Mercer’s removal. Calling Mercer “the first lady of the alt-right,” a representative from the group, Anne Maguire, told HuffPost they sent letters to every board member ahead of the rally.

In a statement on Thursday, the museum said it believes “human-induced climate change is well-supported by scientific evidence and is one of the most serious issues currently facing our planet.”

“As a scientific and educational institution, the Museum deeply respects the work and views of scientists ― both those who work as colleagues at the Museum and those from the broader scientific community,” Roberto Lebron, a spokesman for the museum, said in the statement emailed to HuffPost. “The Museum itself, however, does not make appointment decisions concerning staff or Trustees based on political views.”

The Thursday evening announcement comes amid new scrutiny of donor influence over how one of the nation’s top science museums presents the evidence of human-caused climate change.

Museums -- particularly natural history museums -- are among the most trusted public institutions in the country, according to an ongoing survey. IMPACTS

Nearly three weeks ago, Jonah Busch, an environmental economist at the nonpartisan Center for Global Development, accused the museum of promoting misinformation on climate change in its David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing. In a widely-shared Twitter thread, Busch posted photos of a museum plaque that minimized human influence on global warming. While the exhibit said greenhouse gas pollution “may also have an effect on the Earth’s climatic cycles,” it said “there is no reason to think another ice age won’t come.”

Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research has found that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are enshrouding the Earth in heat-trapping gases, while a research review published in 2015 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of studies that concluded otherwise.

The influx of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions “will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years,” according to a 2016 study published in Nature, which Busch cited.

“When you’ve got people like Mercer on the board, it just makes it that much harder to give the benefit of doubt when they are putting up inaccurate information about climate change,” Busch, who is not involved in the campaign to oust Mercer from the board, told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. “Something you could give a pass to as an innocuous mistake starts to have the appearance of something more sinister.”

At a time when surveys regularly show eroding public trust in newspapers, government agencies and science academies, museums buck the trend.

Over 78 percent of Americans agreed that natural history museums were highly credible sources of information, second only to history museums, according to an ongoing national survey conducted by the research firm Impacts with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

By contrast, 67 percent said the same of daily newspapers, and just 51.4 percent of federal agencies.

The decline in public trust comes as the Republican-controlled Congress and White House target scientists conducting research that could hurt donors’ profits with probes and investigations they frequently compare to “witch hunts.”

In October, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt ― an unabashed climate change contrarian with deep ties to gas and chemical companies he now regulates ― put new rules in place to give more power to industry-funded researchers on the EPA’s science advisory boards.

Since taking over as chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology nearly six years ago, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) transformed the committee from a sleepy bastion of bipartisan agreement to a political cudgel and blunt instrument for industry groups.

“Science has never been more important to the country, yet it’s under more attack than we’ve seen in decades,” Jon Foley, executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, told HuffPost by phone Thursday. “It’s a bit worrisome to see prominent ― not just donors but trustees ― of major museums on the one hand supporting science, but on the other undermining it by funding groups that are deliberately trying to sabotage science on things like climate change.”

In 2015, Foley’s museum announced plans to completely divest from fossil fuels and bar contributions from oil, gas and coal companies. Foley said the decision alienated at least one longtime donor whose wealth came from fossil fuels a few generations back. But he said the move was necessary to preserve the integrity of the California Academy of Sciences’ reputation.

“We decided that’s simply incompatible to our mission,” said Foley, who is not involved with the American Museum of Natural History campaign. “When we talk about trustee candidates, it’s not about their politics ― it’s do people support science wholeheartedly, regardless of their opinion of how it affects their business or political ideology.”

“Sometimes that means not working with certain people and certain organizations, but that’s OK,” he added. “At the end of the day, it’s better for science and better for a public-serving institution to be OK with this kind of thing.”

Mercer and her father, Robert, made their fortune at the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. The secretive family rose to prominence in 2016 after funding and organizing Trump’s presidential campaign. The Mercers invested at least $10 million into Breitbart News, the right-wing website, and have spent $36.6 million on Republican races and and super PACs since 2010.

The Mercer Family Foundation has donated heavily to climate misinformation groups over the years, contributing nearly $5.9 million to the Heartland Institute, a leading proponent of climate science denial, between 2008 and 2016, according to previously unreleased tax filings reviewed by HuffPost.

The foundation ramped up spending on climate denial in recent years, giving money to think tanks and groups that spread climate misinformation, including $200,000 to the Oregon Institute of Science and medicine, $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition and $125,000 to the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.

“Their funding is as egregious as the Kochs,” Beka Economopoulos, whose New York-based nonprofit The Natural History Museum organized the letter, told HuffPost. “They’re a lightning rod for controversy. The spotlight of public scrutiny is starting to shine on the Mercers.”James Franco, seen here on Jan. 6, was digitally removed from the cover of Vanity Fair's 2018 Hollywood issue.

Some of the digital edits used in Vanity Fair’s 2018 Hollywood issue were unintentionally hilarious.

But at least one was no laughing matter.

James Franco — who was recently accused of sexual misconduct by five women — was supposed to be part of the magazine’s main feature. But the actor was digitally removed from the cover spread shortly before publication, per The Hollywood Reporter.

“We made a decision not to include James Franco on the Hollywood cover once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him,” a spokesperson for Vanity Fair confirmed to THR on Thursday.

Franco apparently sat for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz and was interviewed for the issue, which has been in the works since November. But he was scrubbed from the magazine after numerous women accused Franco of sexual misconduct on Twitter in early January, following the actor’s decision to wear a Time’s Up pin — part of a campaign to combat sexual misconduct amid the #MeToo movement — at the Golden Globes.

An explosive Los Angeles Times report soon afterward didn’t help Franco, either.

The “Disaster Artist” star denied the allegations made against him during a Jan. 9 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,” Franco said then, “but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn’t have a voice for so long.”Donald Trump’s lawyers were likely wise to walk back the president’s recent boast that he would be happy to answer questions from special counsel Robert Mueller under oath. A journalist whom Trump once sued said that when Trump was deposed under oath, he was reckless, “overconfident” and unprepared.

On Wednesday, the president told reporters that he was “looking forward” to answering Mueller’s questions “under oath” as part of the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign team and Russia.

White House lawyer Ty Cobb quickly informed The New York Times that the president only intended to say he was willing to meet with Mueller, adding nothing about any agreement to speak under oath. “He’s ready to meet with them, but he’ll be guided by the advice of his personal counsel,” Cobb said.

That’s a good move for Trump, wrote Timothy L. O’Brien, a Bloomberg editor, on Thursday. Otherwise it would be time for the president’s attorneys to “grab the worry beads,” he quipped.

Trump sued O’Brien for libel in 2006, claiming that a book O’Brien had written ― TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald ― underestimated the real estate mogul’s wealth and misrepresented his business record. Trump lost the lawsuit in 2011.

But before the case was over, he sat for two days of deposition under oath. Trump was forced to admit he lied 30 times, O’Brien wrote Thursday. (Longtime Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz represented him in the case.)

O’Brien, who is a former executive editor at HuffPost, wrote that Trump had a tough time holding his own against shrewd attorneys. He also demonstrated his “well-known inability to stick to the facts and a tendency to dissemble and improvise,” O’Brien wrote. “While under oath, he’ll try to avoid saying that he’s lied in the past — until he’s presented with documentation proving otherwise.”

How do you “differentiate between exaggeration and a lie?” Trump was asked in reference to the price of a real estate property. He responded, “You want to put the best spin on a property. No different than any other real estate developer, no different than any other businessman, no different than any politician.”

Unfortunately for Trump in that case, the opposing attorney had the actual property sales figure.

Mueller will likely have Trump’s previous statements, witness accounts and even emails and other documentation to challenge him during questioning if the president doesn’t stick to the facts, O’Brien warned.

The decision by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey against Trump’s libel suit noted that it was “indisputable that Trump’s estimates of his own worth changed substantially over time and thus failed to provide a reliable measure.” It cited a section of Trump’s testimony to make the point. When he was asked if he had been “completely truthful” in his public statements about the net worth of his properties, he answered, “I try.”Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg lashed out Saturday at the “epidemic of dishonesty” in politics that he said poses “one of the most serious dangers” to American democracy.

During a commencement speech at Rice University in Texas, Bloomberg slammed the “endless barrage of lies” and “alternate realities” in national politics.

“People are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts,” he said.

Bloomberg didn’t single out President Donald Trump, though, he has called Trump’s candidacy a “con.” Bloomberg said Saturday that rampant dishonesty in politics is now “bigger than any one person ... than any one party.”

He also held up presidents of the past — George Washington and Abraham Lincoln — as models of honesty.

“How did we go from a president who could not tell a lie to politicians who cannot tell the truth?” Bloomberg asked. “Today when we look at the city that bears Washington’s name, it’s hard not to wonder, ‘What the hell happened?’”

Bloomberg sharply criticized “enablers” who tolerate and defend lies.

Lies, he said, are only the start of a profound disturbance in U.S. politics.

“When elected officials speak as though they are above the truth, they will act as though they are above the law,” Bloomberg said. That invites “criminality” in the “form of corruption [and] abuse of power.”

“These abuses can erode the institutions that protect and preserve our rights and freedoms and open the door to tyranny and fascism,” he added.

Graduates: Bringing the country back together won't be easy, but I believe it can be done – and it will be up to your generation to help lead it. https://t.co/5psjBLeLCI pic.twitter.com/ghAKY6cNzO — Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) May 12, 2018WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said Russian agents created 129 events on the social media network during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, according to testimony to Congress, shedding more light on Russia’s purported disinformation drive aimed at voters.

Facebook, in a written statement to U.S. lawmakers released on Thursday and dated Jan. 8, said that 338,300 different Facebook accounts viewed the events and that 62,500 marked that they would attend. The company said it did not have data about which of the events took place.

Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, said in September only that Russians had created “several promoted events.”

Copies of the event pages that have surfaced since then show that at least some of them were political rallies centered on divisive subjects, such as immigration. Russia denies the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that it tried to meddle in American democracy.

Facebook delivered the details to Congress this month in response to written questions from the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee.

Facebook said that it had found “overlap” between the online marketing done in 2016 by Russian agents and by President Donald Trump’s campaign and called it “insignificant.” The company said it was not in a position to either substantiate or disprove allegations of collusion between the two camps.

Trump denies any collusion and has described investigations by congressional panels and a special counsel as a witch hunt.

Facebook has previously said some 126 million Americans may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, and that 16 million may have been exposed to Russian information on Instagram.

Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google testified about misuse of their services before three congressional committees in October and November.

Also in its written response to follow up questions, Facebook said that last year it removed Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab from its list of free anti-virus offerings to users who go to the social media site from a computer that may be infected with malicious code.

Facebook said it no longer provided Kaspersky Lab as a recommended anti-virus option but that it was “unable to easily reconstruct how many Facebook users downloaded Kaspersky software.”

Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied allegations by U.S. security officials that its software could enable Russian espionage, a fear that led to the U.S. government last year to ban the use of its products in federal computer networks.

A Kaspersky spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the testimony.

Facebook said it was also in the process of “phasing out internal use of a different Kaspersky antivirus product” that does not transmit data back to Kaspersky Lab. It did not name the product.

In separate written responses, Google said Kaspersky Lab had not been approved for use in its corporate systems and that a review had not found any installation of its products. Twitter also said it did not use Kaspersky Lab.Kyle Stephens, a survivor of former Team USA doctor Larry Nassar's abuse, gives her victim impact statement during Nassar's sentencing hearing in Lansing, Michigan, on Jan. 16, 2018.

“We are Jane Does no more.”

On Jan. 24, gymnast Kaylee Lorincz directed that statement at former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar. She stood up at a podium, the 155th woman to do so in a Lansing, Michigan courtroom over the past week, and faced both the man she says abused her and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, the judge who held that man’s fate in her hands.

After years of being ignored, disbelieved and silenced, Lorincz and the more than 160 other women Nassar victimized were finally heard.

So often, our justice system fails victims of sexual violence, but in Aquilina’s courtroom, 156 women spoke unencumbered as the world watched. Nassar, who pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct, was sentenced on Wednesday to serve 40 to 175 years in prison. (He will be sentenced for three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in another court on Jan. 31.) Media outlets like The New York Times, CNN, ESPN and HuffPost covered Nassar’s case for more than a year before he entered a plea. The number of public accusers rose rapidly in the meantime ― from two to 16 to 100 to 140.

But even after months of media coverage, many of the victims felt they were being ignored. They felt as though the public, despite being in the midst of a #MeToo moment, did not care about the stories of female athletes, even when those female athletes formed an army of more than 160 survivors.

“I haven’t sensed the outrage,” Nassar survivor Larissa Boyce told HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos just days before the disgraced doctor’s sentencing began.

But as woman after woman stood up in that courtroom and began telling her story, something clicked. Perhaps it was the volume of stories ― 156 from victims, and more from coaches and family members. Or maybe it was the simplicity of the setting that got the public to pay attention ― a camera in a courtroom focused on each survivor as she spoke, cutting away only for an occasional glance at Nassar or the judge.

The format practically demanded that we listen to each person’s words unedited, resisting “hot takes” and sloppy commentary. Those of us who watched were forced to absorb each word spoken, no matter how unsettling or painful or heart-wrenching or infuriating.

“After years of being made to feel isolated, silent and small, Nassar’s survivors had, as Raisman predicted, become “a force.””

The first survivor to deliver a victim impact statement was Kyle Stephens, a former family friend of Nassar’s. Stephens was abused from the age of 6, and when she told her parents at age 12, they didn’t believe her.

“Larry Nassar wedged himself between myself and my family, and used his leverage as my parents’ trusted friend to pry us apart until we fractured,” she said. “I was 12 years old when I told my family, ‘When Larry rubs my feet, he uses his penis.’ My parents confronted him and he denied any such action… My parents chose to believe Larry Nassar over me.”

Many of the women who spoke after Stephens described being confronted with authority figures who did not listen to or believe their accounts of the abuse they had experienced. At least six women reported Nassar’s actions to administrators at Michigan State University. All were dismissed.

One of those women was Boyce, a former gymnast who said she told MSU coach Kathie Klages in 1997 that Nassar had touched her inappropriately, and that Klages replied that she must have misunderstood the procedure. A 2014 MSU Title IX investigation into Nassar’s conduct reached a similar conclusion: that there was no wrongdoing on the doctor’s part, because, according to the Detroit Free Press, “The investigator determined that the woman likely misinterpreted what Nassar did because she didn’t understand the ‘nuanced difference’ between an appropriate osteopathic medical procedure and sexual assault.”

“I knew that he abused me,” said gymnast Amanda Thomashow during her victim impact statement. “I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure.”

At every turn, these young women were considered to be unreliable narrators of their own experiences. And the result was that a predator had access to a steady stream of young women to abuse for more than two decades.

After all, who would believe a girl ― or even a handful of girls ― over a respected, decorated, beloved doctor? As Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman explained, “From the time we were little, we are taught to trust doctors.”

And despite the fact that Nassar consistently made Raisman feel “uncomfortable,” she says she “felt guilty” for doubting his authority.

“I assumed I was the problem for thinking badly of you,” she stated.

Research has shown that when women report being in pain, they are more likely than men to be undertreated for that pain. Similarly, when women come forward and say they have experienced sexual violence, they are often doubted. Doctors, especially male ones, are assumed to be trustworthy. Young women aren’t even considered experts on their own internal lives.

The phrase “believe women” only exists because the default has traditionally been not to.

Army of survivors who are NOT going anywhere 💪🏻 pic.twitter.com/HIJMw5cwgE — Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) January 25, 2018

But for women to be believed, they must first be heard. Thanks to Judge Aquilina, Larry Nassar’s victims were. It was Aquilina who decided that she would give time to any accuser who wanted to come to Michigan and speak. The court initially expected that 88 women would give statements. But as the week went on, more women decided that they, too, wanted their day in court and their chance to face their abuser. They had become a collective ― an “army of survivors.”

It was also Aquilina who made the decision to directly address every woman who gave a statement, looking them in the eye and thanking them for being there. She often added assurances that their testimony would matter. We tend to think of courtrooms as cold, methodical, legal places. Aquilina’s courtroom was full of emotion and empathy, at least for Nassar’s victims.

“People will listen to you. I’ve listened to you,” she told Olympian Jordyn Wieber. “You are really very strong, not just as an athlete; as a woman, as a survivor.”

(The judge has also faced criticism for crossing a line in the commentary she directed to Nassar himself.)

Since the 1991 Supreme Court case Payne v. Tennessee, the right of victims to deliver impact statements in front of the court has been widely recognized. But rarely does the public get to see those statements delivered.

“Victims testify every day in every courtroom about the harms they have suffered at the hands of perpetrators,” said Jennifer Gentile Long, CEO of AEquitas: The Prosecutors’ Resource on Violence Against Women. “In many ways the proceedings [over the past week] gave a voice to all of those victims.”

And Nassar’s victims’ words reverberated far beyond the courtroom, even making their way onto signs at Women’s Marches across the nation.

“Little girls don’t stay little forever. They grow into strong women that destroy your world,” read one sign, quoting Stephens.

“We are here, we have our voices and we are not going anywhere,” read another.

A third, cheekier sign simply stated: “What Aly Raisman said.”WASHINGTON ― Raising the gas tax to help finance infrastructure improvements isn’t off the table for the Trump administration, according to White House aide DJ Gribbin.

“We don’t support it. We don’t oppose it either,” Gribbin, who serves as the special assistant to the president for infrastructure policy, said Thursday at the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting.

Trump last year said that as a funding source for his much-touted push to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure, he would be open to increasing the federal gas tax for the first time since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund, which helps pay for the nation’s roads, bridges, and transit systems, is primarily funded by the federal fuel tax. But the vast majority of Republican lawmakers, who control both houses of Congress, have opposed raising the levy.

Gribbin told dozens of U.S. mayors on Thursday that Trump’s long-delayed infrastructure proposal will include $200 billion in public spending, with the rest of the $1 trillion plan consisting of private tax incentives. But ways to finance the plan, as well as whether it should include more direct federal spending, will ultimately be left up to Congress, he said.

“We’re going to be open to conversations about increases beyond $200 billion (in federal dollars), but we’re not going to start on that front ― that’s a decision that needs to be made collectively between the House, the Senate, and the White House,” Gribbin said. He added that a list of Trump’s infrastructure principles will be shared with lawmakers on Capitol Hill a week or two after the president’s State of the Union address next week.

Trump said Wednesday at the White House that his proposal would result in about $1.7 trillion in overall investment over the next 10 years, larger than the $1 trillion figure he previously announced and that Gribbin discussed. Gribbin declined to comment when asked about the discrepancy.

“They’re proposing stuff without filling in the how” - Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D)

A draft document that listed principles of the White House infrastructure plan leaked earlier this week, but it lacked details on specific funding sources. The document also did not include information on how the the plan is supposed to achieve $1 trillion in new investment, especially given the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts to key infrastructure programs.

“They’re proposing stuff without filling in the how,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D), who is chairing a mayors’ conference task force on infrastructure, said. “But I appreciate at least it’s not opposition to some of the funding sources like the gas tax, and a willingness to go above and beyond” $200 billion in direct spending.”

Garcetti, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, also lamented that the Republican tax bill enacted late last year did not tap into the massive sums of cash corporations stowed overseas in order to upgrade U.S. roads, bridges, and other public works.

“That tax bill slowed down infrastructure and took away jobs from America, not the opposite,” Garcetti said.

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock (D) echoed Garcetti’s concerns about the lack of details in Trump’s infrastructure proposal. He added that he hoped the administration will not simply reshuffle funds from existing infrastructure programs like the Highway Trust Fund to pay for the plan.Conservatives pushing a conspiracy theory that the FBI is out to get President Donald Trump under the guise of probing his alleged Russian ties have pushed Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show” too far.

The late-night host explained on his show Thursday how Republicans were citing texts of FBI officials that insulted Trump and referenced a “secret society” to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation.

But what really troubled Noah was the conundrum created by FBI agent Peter Strzok, who worked for Mueller but was reassigned last summer. Text messages from 2016 revealed that Strzok called Trump an “idiot,” remarks the president later deemed “a treasonous act.”

“If someone thinks Trump is an idiot, you don’t want that person investigating him,” Noah said. “On the other hand, if you don’t think Trump’s an idiot, then you’re the idiot.”

WASHINGTON ― With his Justice Department and FBI facing broad attacks from some of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that he’ll stand up to any “unfair” attacks on the men and women of the Justice Department he now oversees.

Sessions, in a speech in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday, mentioned the “sharp criticisms” of DOJ coming from Congress. He said the Justice Department demands “the highest level of integrity, ethics, and professionalism from every person” in it, and that all employees are expected to “advance the mission of the Department honorably” in the service of the American people.

“If anyone falls short of these high standards, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action, and we will do so in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Department,” Sessions said. “And, while we are open to fair criticism, we will of course defend our investigators and prosecutors from criticism that is unfair.”

Such criticism has recently been coming from within Sessions’ own party. As they’ve sought to protect President Donald Trump from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have made broad attacks on the FBI’s integrity. They’ve suggested there’s a “deep state” operation against Trump, and that there was a “secret society” working within the FBI to stop him from ever taking office. After reading a secret memo authored by Republican staffers, members of Congress claimed to know about “absolutely shocking,” “sickening” and “jaw-dropping” information that was “worse than Watergate” and comparable to the actions of the KGB.

The comments from members of his party ― and from his own boss ― have put Sessions in a tricky spot. He has a delicate relationship with the president, who blames him for the existence of the probe threatening his administration and members of his family.

“He has his own detractor, and that detractor is the president of the United States,” Ron Hosko, a former FBI official, told HuffPost before Sessions’ speech. “He probably senses that he’s at risk, because of the recusal [from the Russia probe] and because of the deference to [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein and the subsequent appointment of Bob Mueller. That’s stuck in Donald Trump’s craw, period.”

Hosko, now part of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, praised Sessions’ work on law enforcement issues. But he said he wished the attorney general would step out in the bureau’s defense.

“Sessions is at risk. How quickly does he step up to back the men and women of the FBI while this scandal ― which is what it is ― kind of plays itself out?” Hosko said, prior to Sessions’ remarks on Friday. “I would certainly love it if the attorney general steps up and says, ‘Hey, look, let’s keep in mind there are 30-some thousand FBI employees who are out there defending our freedom and protecting Americans every day. We’ve got to keep that in mind as we work our way through this.’”

In his speech, Sessions said he loves the Justice Department and the “great people” who work there. “The vast majority are dedicated, hardworking, patriotic Americans. It’s an honor to serve with them,” he said.

A Justice Department official told HuffPost that Sessions’ comments on the criticism DOJ has been facing were added to his speech in recent days.

Sessions said his goal was “absolutely eliminating political bias or favoritism ― in either direction ― from our investigations and prosecutions,” saying that is the “antithesis of what the Department stands for, and I won’t tolerate it.”

Sessions said the best way to respond to criticism is for DOJ to “hear the concerns, and act on them professionally, fairly and completely, in order to maintain the public’s trust in their government.”

He also said the department should work on “identifying mistakes of the past, and correcting them for the future,” and should address problems “head on” instead of “sweeping them under the rug.”

Criticism from Congress, Sessions said, isn’t a bad thing.

“We welcome Congress as a partner in this effort,” he said. “When they learn of a problem and start asking questions, that is a good thing. Sunlight truly is the best disinfectant. Truth produces confidence.”

Sessions has not confirmed that he offered his resignation to Trump. His Justice Department has refused to confirm or deny the existence of his reported resignation letter, claiming that disclosing the existence of such a letter would violate Sessions’ personal privacy.
