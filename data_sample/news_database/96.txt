This female pilot is using Twitter to call out two sexist passengers.

A British aviator who is known online as Charlotte The Pilot hit back at two male passengers who’d insulted women pilots on a recent flight:

Had such a lovely day flying with an 👌 crew.



Baffled as to why 2 male pax felt that these comments were nescesarry.



‘I wont make any jokes about female drivers then’



‘Are you the pilot? If I’d know that I wouldnt have got on’



Fact is, I can fly an £80m jet, you can’t. — Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) May 20, 2018

“Baffled as to why 2 male pax felt that these comments were necessary,” Charlotte Knowlson wrote, before sharing their sexist remarks about women flying aircraft.

″‘Are you the pilot? If I’d know (sic) I wouldn’t have got on,’” she writes in a tweet, attributing the quote to one of the passengers.

“Fact is,” she responds. “I can fly an £80m jet, you can’t.”

In subsequent tweets, Knowlson revealed her initial response was to “be professional, laugh and ask them if they were enjoying the flight.” She rethought her stance, however, after a flight attendant “expressed her anger.”

The kind of attitude exhibited by those passengers puts women off pursuing careers in male-dominated industries, she said. Knowlson added that she “didn’t get where I am today by listening to these kinds of comments.”

“I’m not offended, I’m not disheartened,” she wrote. “I’m saddened by the fact that this is the attitude some still have and think it is ok to make these comments to women.”

Being used to this kind of humour, my reaction of course was to be professional, laugh and ask them if they were enjoying the flight. It wasn't unit later when a cabin crew member expressed her anger at the comment that it made me think. Why is this normal? — Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) May 20, 2018

It is this attitude that puts women off and another barrier stopping them from going into male dominated careers. It shouldn’t even be a thing!!! I am a pilot he is a pilot. See, there is no difference ..... #pilot — Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) May 20, 2018

I didn’t get where I am today by listening to these kinds of comments. I’m not offended, I’m not disheartened. I’m saddened by the fact that this is the attitude some still have and think it is ok to make these comments to women. — Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) May 20, 2018

Knowlson did not say which airline she is affiliated with. She did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

But her tweets about sexism in the industry touched a nerve with her 12,500 Twitter followers. It prompted others to share their own inspirational stories on the social media platform:

My BADASS daughter flies this for her weekend job & FW for her day job. VERY proud. I just passed the 30 year mark & still flying so she’s got a ways to catch dad! pic.twitter.com/3RvQrky9Lp — Kurtis Houk أحمد (@KurtisHouk) May 20, 2018

Charlotte tweeted this a couple of days ago. I totally agree with her sentiments. Some of the best and most talented pilots I have ever flown with are women. These outdated views and stereotypes only make the person saying them look bad. Don’t let them bother you Charlotte.😄👍🏻 https://t.co/hErWvOXtCC — Captain Dave (@DaveWallsworth) May 21, 2018

My wife’s a pilot, every time she flies she gets a ‘well done dear’ or similar from holidaymakers.

None of the troops she flew into Bastion or Kandahar felt the need to patronise her. — Danø 🇬🇧 🇺🇸🇨🇦🇦🇺🇳🇿 (@DanoDXB) May 20, 2018

@pilotcharlotte hey Charlotte. Would be proud to have you as my pilot anytime im on a plane. #noteveryoneislikethem casual sexism is not ok. — Daniel Buscini (@buscini) May 22, 2018

At 14, my eldest daughter could fly better loops than me. She went on to six years operational flying as a Tornado F3 WSO. Here's a couple of pics. Low level in Scotland, refuelling down in the Falklands. pic.twitter.com/41oh6cigMi — James Smith (@c_mperman) May 20, 2018

As a longtime private pilot (who has had several female flight instructors), I'm always glad when I hear a woman's voice saying, "Good afternoon, this is your captain.." Keep it up, and set an example for many more! — James Fallows (@JamesFallows) May 20, 2018

I was on an @AirCanada flight not long ago and when I heard the First Officer’s female voice my heart soared. You don’t just make jets fly, you make dreams airborne too. — Ruth Mitchell (@drruthmitchell) May 20, 2018For Marc Jacobs, nothing says true love quite like burrito bowls and guacamole.

The fashion designer on Wednesday night popped by a Chipotle franchise in New York, where he proposed to longtime boyfriend Char Defrancesco.

Of course, the romantic moment wasn’t exactly spontaneous. Just before Jacobs popped the question, a flash mob of restaurant “patrons” performed a choreographed dance to Prince’s 1986 hit, “Kiss.”

Jacobs captured the moment for posterity in a short Instagram video.

A post shared by Marc Jacobs (@themarcjacobs) on Apr 4, 2018 at 9:52pm PDT

Defrancesco, a high-end candle maker, posted the same clip to his Instagram, with the caption, “GET READY FOR THE ALL TIME GAG!!!!! Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen.”

Turns out, April 4 held special significance for Defrancesco for another reason: It was also his birthday.

A post shared by Marc Jacobs (@themarcjacobs) on Apr 4, 2018 at 5:38am PDTSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was issued an unusual challenge on Tuesday night when a constituent asked him if he’d take a DNA test.

Tammy Talpas read a statement to Cruz saying she was worried about her access to health care due to seven pre-existing conditions.

“If you force me into a high-risk pool, you will either bankrupt me or kill me,” she said. “I take these threats of medical aggression personally and seriously, and I can assure you I’m not the only Texan who does. My question is: Will you pledge to submit to a DNA test to prove that you’re human?”

Cruz didn’t directly answer.

“Well, ma’am, thank you for that, and one of the great things about our democratic system is we can treat each other with respect and civility,” he said.

“Is that a yes or a no?” she shot back.

AdvertisementPresident Donald Trump claimed Thursday that millions of people were voting illegally in California, returning to an allegation he has made since he was a candidate but has failed to substantiate with evidence.

Trump made the comments during free-wheeling remarks in West Virginia at an event that was supposed to be about tax reform. Trump was speaking about immigration when he pivoted to claim there was widespread voter fraud in California.

“In many places, like California, the same person votes many times, you probably heard about that,” he said. “They always like to say: ‘Oh that’s a conspiracy theory.’ Not a conspiracy theory folks. Millions and millions of people. And it’s very hard because the state guards their records. They don’t want to see it.”

There is no evidence that double voting is a widespread problem in California or anywhere else in the country. In 2014, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation allegations between 2000 and 2014. In a 2017 working paper, researchers estimated that 33,000 people voted twice in the 2012 presidential election, amounting to 0.02 percent of all votes cast in the election.. The Department of Justice also investigated claims of voter fraud from 2002 until 2007 and found little evidence of it.

Trump has failed to offer any substantial evidence for his claims of voter fraud in the United States. The White House has pointed to a 2012 Pew study that said 24 million voter registration records are no longer valid and that nearly 3 million people are registered in more than one state. But the study doesn’t say that those people voted and it’s not illegal to be registered to vote in more than one state.

Shortly before he took office, Trump claimed that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for illegal votes. He has also repeatedly said he would have won the state of New Hampshire during the 2016 election had it not been for people who were bused in to vote illegally. But state officials said they have no evidence that happened.

In May 2017, Trump convened a commission to investigate allegations of voter fraud and appointed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who has argued voter fraud is widespread, to lead it. The commission asked election officials in all 50 states for copies of their voter rolls. Many declined, either refusing to comply outright or saying that state laws forbade them from providing all the information the commission wanted. Several lawsuits accused the commission of violating various federal privacy, transparency and administrative laws and Trump disbanded it in January. Before the panel disbanded, it did not find evidence that voter fraud was widespread.

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D) dismissed Trump’s Thursday comments.

“It’s sad the president continues to recycle his same old lies. Frankly, it is tiring to have a conspiracy theorist in the White House,” he said in a statement. “His rants dishonor the thousands of local elections officials and volunteers, from across the political spectrum, who work hard to ensure the integrity of our elections.

The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.WASHINGTON — Several high-ranking officials at the Environmental Protection Agency were reassigned, demoted or opted to leave after they voiced concerns about agency head Scott Pruitt’s seemingly lavish spending habits, The New York Times reported Thursday.

Among the concerns that ultimately resulted in staff shake-ups were Pruitt’s first-class travel and pricey office desks, as well as requests for a bulletproof SUV, 20-person security detail and $100,000-a-month charter aircraft membership, according to the Times, which cited current and former EPA staff familiar with the situation.

Scrutiny over Pruitt’s alleged ethical misconduct is growing, and both Republicans and Democrats are pressuring him to resign as the nation’s chief environmental regulator.

The Times found that at least five EPA officials were sidelined for speaking up, either about agency spending or management. Kevin Chmielewski, a political appointee, was placed on administrative leave without pay. Two career staffers were reassigned to roles more removed from budgetary matters. Another left the agency and took a job at American University. And a member of Pruitt’s security detail was “removed from the team and had his gun and badge taken away after raising concerns about how Mr. Pruitt’s security was being handled,” the Times reports.

Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the agency, denied that the staff changes were related to employees’ concerns about spending. “We dispute the veracity of the accusations,” he told the Times.

At the center of Pruitt’s ethics scandal is a room he rented in a luxury Capitol Hill condominium that is co-owned by the wife of a top gas industry lobbyist, as ABC News first reported. Pruitt paid just $50 per night, well below market value.

On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Donald Trump “thinks that [Pruitt’s] done a good job, particularly on the deregulation front,” but added that “we take this seriously and we’re looking into it.” And on Thursday, Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary, said on Fox News that he “can’t speak to the future of Scott Pruitt.”On April 4th, 1968 at 7:05 p.m. central time, Dr. King’s life was cut tragically short. 50 years later a need for his dream to be fulfilled is far greater than ever.

Share your dream & post your own #DreamStillLives video. Spread love...spread hope. pic.twitter.com/51BaCW78GCThe Environmental Protection Agency’s lead ethics official this week walked back his defense of administrator Scott Pruitt’s controversial condo rental.

The official, Kevin Minoli, said last week that Pruitt’s rental of a room co-owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist didn’t violate federal gift rules and that the $50-a-night rate was within “reasonable market value.” But in a new memo first obtained by CNN, Minoli claimed that he hadn’t had all the facts before issuing his defense.

In the Apr. 4 memo, he clarified that last week’s comments were based only on the provisions of the lease, but did not cover ways Pruitt may have used the condo that fell outside of the terms of the deal.

“Some have raised questions whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the terms of the lease,” Minoli wrote in the document. “Evaluating those questions would have required factual information that was not before us and the review does not address those questions.”

Minoli did not say that there were any ethical violations and once again claimed that the terms of the lease were reasonable.

Pruitt is nevertheless facing intense scrutiny over the rental, a sweetheart deal that let him use the room whenever he liked and only pay for it on the nights that he slept there. The condo is co-owned by Vicki Hart, whose husband runs Williams & Jensen, a well-known energy lobbying firm.

While Minoli’s original assessment said the deal was above-board, some EPA officials reportedly said Pruitt’s daughter stayed in the unit’s second bedroom while working at the White House last year, according to The Washington Post. The lease would not have covered that arrangement, a detail that Minoli said he had not considered.

“The review addressed the terms of the lease as they were written in the lease agreement only,” the April 4 memo reads.

Hart has said she did not know that Pruitt’s daughter was staying in the condo, and told ABC News last week that she “never gave him permission” to use the other bedroom.

Walter Schaub, the former head of the Office of Government Ethics, noted that if Pruitt’s daughter was using the other room and Hart knew about it, the $50 rate could be well below market value and possibly qualify as a gift.

“If it turns out Pruitt’s daughter was staying in the other room, that’s not covered by the ethics opinion because it’s outside the scope of the lease,” Shaub told CNN. “It would raise a factual question as to whether the landlord knew and permitted his use of the second room, which would be a gift.”

You can review those comparables yourself and see what you think of them in terms of location and quality. As for what happened after the lease was signed, I think the question turns on how Pruitt used the property and what the landlord knew about that. /5 — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) April 5, 2018

The Post notes that the EPA’s ethics office only learned about Pruitt’s use of the room last week and Minoli’s approval came months after Pruitt stopped using it.

Pruitt has also drawn criticism over reports that the EPA approved a pipeline expansion project for a company that employed Williams & Jensen as lobbyists at the same time he rented the room. Both the EPA and the firm have denied that Pruitt was lobbied on the deal.

“There is no connection between decisions Administrator Pruitt has made at EPA and any place he has lived,” EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told the Post and CNN on Wednesday night. “Any attempt to draw that link is patently false.”Danny Tarkanian views the call to take away people's guns as "history repeating itself."

Nevada congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian suggested in a recent interview that the Armenian genocide could have been prevented had the Ottoman Empire not robbed Armenians of their guns.

Tarkanian addressed the issue of gun control during a March 27 radio interview with conservative firebrand Wayne Allyn Root.

“I happen to understand that the first thing Hitler did before he herded the Jews into concentration camps to kill them was he passed, I believe in ’38, a law that said no Jew could own a gun,” Root said. “In the end you’re powerless and defenseless if you have no gun.”

Tarkanian, a perennial Republican candidate and vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, said the Holocaust was an example of “history repeating itself,” and pointed to the Armenian genocide.

“I’m Armenian, and the Ottoman Empire ― they took the guns from the Armenians,” Tarkanian said. “They came and they killed 1.5 million of the 2 million that were there because they had no way to defend themselves.”

Root agreed, and claimed that despots like Russia’s Joseph Stalin and Cambodia’s Pol Pot “always take the guns first.”

Tarkarian and Root are correct that many mass killings throughout history followed the confiscation of guns. The Ottoman Empire passed gun control laws in 1911, about four years before the start of the Armenian genocide, and Armenians were required to surrender their weapons.

But Armenians had been forbidden from owning weapons for hundreds of years and were the victims of religious persecution well before the 20th-century genocide. A pogrom in the late 19th century, which predated the gun control legislation, also resulted in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Armenians.

Tarkanian has unsuccessfully run in state elections since 2004. Hours before the filing deadline for the 2018 midterms last month, Tarkanian dropped his bid to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R) and decided to run for a House seat instead. Trump had suggested Tarkanian make the move two days earlier:Lorde brought out Jack Antonoff at her Wednesday night concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and people have not stopped chattering about the duo’s chemistry ever since.

On her “Melodrama World Tour,” Lorde’s been doing a different cover song in her set each night. Wednesday night’s cover featured the singer’s iteration of St. Vincent’s “New York”... alongside Jack Antonoff.

They crooned to Annie Clark, then transitioned to Lorde’s own song, “Hard Feelings.”

Antonoff co-produced Lorde’s album “Melodrama” and also worked on St. Vincent’s album “Masseduction,” so his appearance was totally apropos.

But people on Twitter, Instagram and beyond couldn’t resist wondering: Are Antonoff and Lorde a romantic item?

In fact, people were saying that they REFUSE to believe the pair is not dating:

After helping guide Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage by the financially struggling Charleston Gazette-Mail, he recently was laid off. Damon Dahlen/HuffPost

Two days after graduating from West Virginia University in 1991, Rob Byers joined the Charleston Gazette as a full-time reporter in the state’s capital. He and his girlfriend had just put down a security deposit and first month’s rent on a house. He was flat broke but felt lucky to have landed a job at the state’s premier daily, one filled with a newsroom of reporters and editors who worked hard to live up to the paper’s righteous motto, “Sustained Outrage.”

Although Byers wasn’t from the state, he had grown up the son of a coal miner in southwestern Pennsylvania. He was raised in a house on a gravel road and knew his share of economic misfortune and tragedy. When Byers was in college, his father, having gone West in search of work after his mine was shut down, was shot in the back of the head and killed, apparently by a hitchhiker. Kinship with the people Byers covered came naturally. After a few years at the Gazette, he began a long series traveling West Virginia seeking out stories in its forgotten hollows. He and a photographer ended up crisscrossing the state for 120 weeks.

In Dehue, Byers saw what was left of a town slowly being eroded by strip mining. “Every time somebody would leave, somebody would come by and set the house on fire,” Byers recalled. In the lede of his dispatch from Dehue, he wrote: “The remains of houses lay like black smudges on the land, and amid the rubble, mailboxes peek through, the names on their sides reading like a coalfield history book.”

The town would soon become just a memory, its residents forced to find a future elsewhere. West Virginia adversity became a sort of beat for Byers: coal’s downsizing, the powerful floods that now regularly plague the region, the opioid epidemic that continues to ravage its small towns, the Donald Trump-like billionaire that has turned the governorship into a kind of performance art. Byers sought to cover all of it as a reporter and eventually as the paper’s executive editor.

But just as Byers oversaw coverage of the coal industry’s collapse, he was fending off his own. The Gazette’s owners, who owned a majority stake in the rival Charleston Daily Mail, eventually merged the papers and moved everyone into one newsroom. (The Daily Mail’s old newsroom still sits abandoned like some ghostly relic across the hall from the unified newsroom.) The purchase left the owners deep in debt. Byers thrived anyway, helping to guide one of the paper’s star investigative reporters, Eric Eyre, to a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the opioid epidemic in 2017.

Last fall, the Gazette-Mail stopped printing its Monday edition to cut costs. A few months later, the paper’s owners filed for bankruptcy. Byers had to get used to farewell emails from reporters leaving the paper for more financially stable jobs. Even under these circumstances, the paper still produced the kind of accountability journalism that lived up to its motto.

I had interviewed Byers twice ― once during the bankruptcy and once after the paper was sold to a Huntington, West Virginia-media company. I wanted to know how papers like the Gazette-Mail survived and how Byers still managed to publish great work. No editor seemed better suited to cover the American Rust Belt under Trump. He was made for this moment.

And then, on March 26, Byers was laid off. He got a letter in his office mailbox. Byers was home recuperating from hernia surgery when he found out. A colleague, who had been promoted to publisher, called him and gave him the news. Last spring, he was toasting the newsroom for the Pulitzer win. Now, he had to dash off a farewell email to his staff.

“It was hard for me not to rush out of bed, as usual, this morning and head downtown, as I have for so many years,” he wrote. “To say how much I think of that gray, dimly lit, windowless newsroom as a home away from home would take many, many emails, and none of us has time for that. Instead, most of us need to be thinking of today’s website, tomorrow’s paper, next week’s sections ... and, for some of us, our next chance to do a job that we love.”

I reached him on the phone a few days later. He still hadn’t gone into the newsroom to collect his things. He had just enough time to realize what many of the state’s other unemployed people must feel. “When you lose a job in West Virginia and you are at all interested in staying in West Virginia,” he said, “you immediately come to the realization about the lack of job opportunities there are in West Virginia.”

Byers worked in that newsroom for more than 26 years. Now he said he’s already contemplating newspaper jobs out of the state and, like the residents of Dehue, leaving the place he loved behind. He still keeps a piece of the old Dehue with him. “As I was leaving Dehue, I picked up a brick from one of the burned-out houses,” he recalled. “It’s still in my garage. I was never going to see this place again.”

Below is a transcript, edited and condensed for clarity, of two conversations with Byers. The first one took place in February, in the early days of the paper’s bankruptcy; the second was in March, a few days before he was laid off.

HuffPost: How stressed are you, and what has it been like?

Rob Byers: Well, it has been stressful, that’s true, in the last few weeks. It’s just difficult working under a cloud of uncertainty. I’m trying to do my best to keep the paper going in the way that people are used to having their Gazette-Mail, and that’s a high level of reporting, our typical watchdog coverage. We’re covering the statehouse like crazy. ... Got another big slug of rain coming, so there’s a chance for some flooding. We’ve already had a little bit, and so we’re concerned about that. We’ve got so much to do that there’s not a lot of time to sit around handwringing. Obviously it’s in the back of everybody’s mind, and we’d kind of like for the whole process to just get over with, but in the meantime we’ll just keep doing what we’re doing.

How do you juggle that with all the uncertainty?

Well, I’m trying to keep my own morale up. So it can be reflective on the rest of the newsroom. If I’m moping around and looking worried constantly, it’s not going to help us get the job done. I know people are worried, and we’ve had discussions and we’ve talked, and I’ve sent out a few emails just kind of encouraging people to bear with this process, and let’s see how it works out before anybody jumps to too many conclusions. All things come to an end, so we need to look at it as kind of a new beginning, rather than just drawing on the past all the time, because if we do that, it’s going to be really hard for us to go forward. We’ve got to look at this as a possible opportunity, something that we can hitch our wagon to and move forward.

The day after the bankruptcy, there was a coal industry attorney joking about how your environmental reporter Ken Ward might be getting a pink slip, and also joking about the paper’s finances. What was your reaction?

It was upsetting to me. It’s just a classless act. I just can’t even believe somebody would do that and would think it was funny. But on the other hand, you know, we’ve got broad shoulders here. We get criticized all the time, and we always have, from the days when we were called communists to God knows what we’re called now. But you know, we are critics ourselves. We’re pointing out problems all the time, so if we’re going to criticize, we’re going to have to take criticism, too. I would hope that it would stay on a more professional level than that. But that person did issue an apology, so that’s kind of behind us now.

What’s the past year been like for you and the staff? You had the really big high of winning the Pulitzer and then in less than a year you have this bankruptcy.

It’s been kind of a whirlwind, but when I made the announcement in the middle of the newsroom on the day that the bankruptcy came out ... I basically started by saying, “Nine months ago I stood in this newsroom. It was the best day that I’ve ever had here in the 26 years I’ve been here, and now nine months later I’m here on what’s quite possibly the worst day, as I announce this great newspaper is in bankruptcy and will not carry on in the way that it has.”

Did you have a sense that this was coming ― the bankruptcy?

I’ve known that things weren’t going well financially for a long time. The loan that is at the heart of all of this — that loan was taken out to purchase the interest in the Daily Mail in 2004 [and later combine the Daily Mail and the Charleston Gazette]. Then the recession hit, bottom dropped out in 2008, the internet’s decimating everything, our ad revenue. It was obvious what was happening. I had hoped it wouldn’t get to this point. You know, when you are in the meetings and you see financial reports, and you’re constantly asked to cut from the budget every year, like I’m sure a lot of newsrooms are, you know there’s problems.

You guys have always had a pretty tough relationship with the coal industry.

Yeah. Well, I mean, Don Blankenship [the former CEO of Massey Energy Co.] did sue us, and it was a long, drawn-out affair. That ran up a lot of legal bills, and it was something that the paper didn’t really need at the time. This was when we were going through a lot of hard times, and it was very costly. I think Mr. Blankenship knew what he was doing. He was trying to hurt us, and he was upset with us, and we had to fight it. Ultimately, we won that fight, but we certainly came out weaker financially. But I felt like we came out stronger in the eyes of the readership, that we showed again that we weren’t afraid to stand up to the coal industry or a titan of the coal industry like Blankenship. It was just what we did here, and it was going to carry on.

They tried to pull the rug out from underneath us many times, and they fought back against us, but it all came down to truthful reporting. I mean, we’re not here to try to decimate the coal industry. We never were. We’re here to be a watchdog for things like the coal industry and make sure that there’s accountability, make sure there’s environmental compliance, make sure workers’ safety is at a high level. I mean, all the black lung reporting you see now, this is all a continuing issue. It’s something this paper has been focused on for decades.

When was the last time you took an angry phone call from a person in power? I guess the governor, Jim Justice, when he first started, refused to cooperate with your reporters.

A column I wrote early on about the freeze and how the governor had decided that the way to keep any negative news about his administration out of the paper was just not talk to reporters — I wrote a whole column about that, about how, when the freeze is on, reporters work even harder. which is always the case, reporters have to work harder, dig deeper, to get simple stories a lot of times. But when they’re doing that, they uncover more and more details and write better stories. It is harder work, but it all kind of comes out in the end.

So we dealt with that off and on through the beginning of the Justice administration. It’s just something we have to deal with, and the Justice administration, Jim Justice himself, kind of echoes Donald Trump in a lot of ways. After the teacher strike, there was a press conference, and as Justice was walking out, one of our reporters asked about the money that he’d decided we could pay the teachers with. Why didn’t he tell us about this a couple weeks ago?

And the governor said the same thing, “Why don’t you ever ask any positive questions? This is a happy day. You should be positive.”

You hear Trump’s promises about coal or Gov. Justice’s promises about coal ― does it piss you off, knowing what you know?

It was just extremely irresponsible to make comments like, “We’re going to mine more coal than ever before,” and, “We’re going to put these hard-working miners back to work.” There’s a lot of political promises out there that aren’t fulfilled, but to drag people along with you on a promise that their whole livelihood depends on is just completely irresponsible and I just didn’t feel like that had any place in the campaign. That does come from having a father who was a miner and was out of work off and on. It’s nothing that I take lightly.

When your father was out of work did you feel it when he was not working? When the mine was closed?

When that kind of thing happened, we knew cutbacks were going to be made. My family used food stamps for a while, so when we’re writing about SNAP benefits and things like that nowadays it certainly resonates with me as well because I knew how important that was. I remember going to the grocery store with my mother and watching her use these stamps that look like Monopoly money that she was paying the grocery bill with and understanding why we needed to do that and other people didn’t. It set me on a trajectory to want to find something that I could immerse myself in that I felt would sustain me and be rewarding for me and not break my back underground.

The work became even more scarce when there was a fire at your father’s mine.

Marianna mine, mine No. 58. In Marianna, Pennsylvania, the belt caught on fire and the coal seam caught on fire after that, so what we thought was maybe going to be a minor shutdown turned into a long, long time. There was never any announcement for a long, long time that the mine was truly going to be shut down. There was always that hope, that type of hope that we were just talking about: “Yeah, it’s possible, we want to get back to work, we want to get back to work.” So my dad was biding his time, and he went to the refineries outside New York, there in New Jersey, and was kind of like a fish out of water there. He was biding his time, hoping that the mine would reopen, but eventually they sealed the mine. But he was kept on the hook for a long time, wondering what was going to happen.

And then he came back. He decided that he wanted to be a coal miner and that’s all he knew how to do, so he packed up everything in his pickup truck. He had a camper top on the back of the pickup truck, and he threw his old Army sleeping bag in there. He was in Vietnam and came home with a really nice down sleeping bag that they use in the Army. So he threw that in the back of the bed of his truck and headed out.

He was going to go out West and work in the big mines out there if they were hiring. But they really weren’t. I was in college at WVU at the time. I asked him to send me a postcard from every time he stopped and was near someplace. He could just send me a postcard and I could plot out his course on a map. I was very enthralled about the West in those days and always wanted to go there and see that country myself. So I lived vicariously through him and plotting out his course on a map, and it took him down through New Mexico. And that’s where the postcards stopped.

So what the police told me at the time was, they believe he picked up a hitchhiker and that the hitchhiker managed to get my father’s gun away from him. My father had a .357 magnum that he kept under his truck seat, and he got the gun away from my father and shot him in the back of the head. And left him for dead there not too far off the Interstate near a place called Cuervo, New Mexico.

The police contacted you.

My mother called me at college to tell me what had happened. But I hadn’t heard from my father going on two weeks so I was kind of expecting the worst. I knew something was up. These were the days before cell phones, so it’s not like you could just send a text. I got the call I was dreading.

What did it do to your relationship with your dad that he had to leave the state and move out, go to New Jersey and then West?

Well, it was particularly sad for me, and it was just a bad time all around. My dad always stressed that he wanted me to go to college. I was the first person in my family to go to college. He really stressed that I try to do as best I can in college, so I wouldn’t live the life that he did, professionally.

When I found out that he had died, it was just a week or two before finals week that year, and I decided that I was going to stay in college and not drop out for that semester. I stayed and I studied and I took those finals. I don’t think I did very great on them that semester, but I did what I thought that he would want me to do.

You seem like you are in a really good position to edit the paper, to be that watchdog around coal, especially now with your current governor and our president, given your background. Do you think that plays a role, just going through what happened with your father?

It gave me a little bit more credibility when it comes to writing about the coal industry and knowing about the coal industry. I’m not an outsider who doesn’t understand what it’s like to depend on the coal industry to put food on the table. It was everything for us when I was a kid. We dreaded any kind of work stoppage, strike, layoff, whatever. When dad was working well and things were going well, things were going well between my parents. And you know, if there was money, that really helps when it comes to your childhood, your parents’ marriage, everything like that. So I understand how that affects families and how important that is. I feel like I can write about that with more authority.

What do you think politicians like the governor or Trump don’t understand about the coal industry, knowing what you know?

Looking at the markets and looking at West Virginia as a whole, there’s no gain for me to shout from the treetops that coal’s coming back. That’s a political game for them and a way to get votes. I find it very irresponsible for any politician to jump up and say that when there’s so many more things that go into the coal market and coal jobs than just politicians saying, “We’re going to support the coal industry.” For a coal family, if that was my family as a kid and we heard that, we would take hope in that, and we might wait around and see if that mine is going to open again, you know, instead of maybe going and doing some retraining.

There’s always been nostalgia for coal and for times past in West Virginia, as far as the coal industry goes. When I first got here and the coal industry was still going great guns, people were still looking back to the days when towns like Welch, West Virginia, or other towns in the coalfields, were building. They would be like: “Oh, they had two movie theaters, a bowling alley, and everything like that. Everything was great.” Well, yeah, but also there were very few mine safety laws, and there was a company store and things like that. You look back and you gloss over the bad things.

While coal is a great heritage for West Virginia, a lot of people are realizing that we’re going to have to look forward. We’re going to have to find different things in this state. People are embracing natural gas, embracing tourism, hopefully embracing some tech jobs here, as we finally get our broadband situation worked out. That’s what people are starting to look to. For areas that are still holding onto the hope of the coal industry, it’s because there are no other opportunities in those areas right now, and it’s very easy to say, “This is a great job. I need this because there’s nothing else.” That’s why people are turning to drug abuse. That’s one of the reasons drug abuse is so bad in West Virginia, because opportunities are not there for people to better themselves.

It seemed like the West Virginia teacher strike proved something that was never covered during the run-up to Trump’s election. There is a progressive, pro-union streak in West Virginia, a viable progressive population that’s diverse, that cares about its state. I’m wondering what do you think the misconceptions are from the national press covering Trump or Trump voters in West Virginia.

I think it’s just trying to put the whole situation into a nice little box to explain it, and you can’t do that with West Virginia. There’s been just way too many changes here and too much poverty and too many missed opportunities to be able to explain it so easily. A lot of those teachers out there on the picket line protesting at the Capitol were surely Trump voters. But that doesn’t mean that they are not going to try to stand up and fight for what’s right, whether that be through a union or some other kind of peaceful protest out there at the Capitol.

Trying to make it a neat little package is impossible in West Virginia. The big change from the blue state to the red state, the decline of the UMWA, all of those things make it hard. So people just need to understand that West Virginia is a complex place. It’s not something that can be easily explained.

How has the paper’s relationship with its readers evolved since you first started there in the early ’90s? Has it changed?

You know, I don’t think it has changed all that much. Obviously the way we produce news and the way we deliver news has changed, but we were always seen as a watchdog over state government, a watchdog over big industries, and an advocate for the people, an advocate for workers’ safety, for coal miners’ health, all of those things. We’re still doing that. That’s still who we are, and that’s what people talk about in the community. When they read about the bankruptcy, they say: “Well, we can’t lose that. We have to hold on to that. You have to continue to do that. We don’t have anybody else. You need to do that and be that advocate for West Virginia, for Appalachia.” We feel a great responsibility, but that responsibility hasn’t changed in the 25 years I’ve been here, 26 years.

But I’m wondering, in the age of fake news, or in the last year or so, people have been pretty angry at anybody who has questioned the narratives that Trump or your governor have pushed. And so I’m wondering if you’ve seen that in the comments section or in the letters, any kind of pushback against the paper.

Not any kind of big, organized thing. Any newspaper, you can look in the comments and see people saying fake news or they don’t believe this or that. What happens a lot of times is, we have a lot of loyal readers out there and they’ll come to our aid in the comments section and say, “Well, actually, this is the truth. Here’s what they printed, and here’s why it’s true,” and kind of come to our defense. There’s a certain amount of that, but it’s always been that way. It’s just easier to see that now. Like I said, when I first got here, it was always “the communists from the Charleston Gazette,” and Don Blankenship kept that going by calling us communists.

People in West Virginia who know us, who see us all the time, they think of us as, “That’s my newspaper.” When we won the Pulitzer, we heard a lot of, “Hey, my newspaper won a Pulitzer.” It’s not, “Those guys over there won some award.” It’s: “My newspaper did it. It’s great for West Virginia.” Even though it was about the horrible problem in West Virginia, it meant a lot to people around here that right here in town, we have a Pulitzer Prize winner that lives right here in town.

At one point, you guys brought in a consultant. Did you have to pivot to video?

We’ve had an on-again, off-again relationship with video over the past several years. Ownership, or the advertising department, decides that we need more video, and we can sell ads on video, so let’s do more video, and then we’d go great guns on video for a while, and then it doesn’t seem like it’s really getting all the hits that it should and the ads aren’t there, so let’s back off video for a while. It kind of comes and goes. We had a multimedia position here that we staffed for a while, for a couple of years, and had two really good people in here doing some nice video work, but yeah, as you pull back, you realize that the in-depth reporting is more valuable, and stuff like video is just gravy for a story like that. If we can get some, that’s great, but it’s not anything that looks like it’s going to rescue us.

What was the advice you gave to your staff after the bankruptcy was announced? Did anybody come to you and say: “What should I do? Should I look for a job?”

I didn’t try to turn anybody off from finding greener pastures somewhere else. I’m not going to do that, because I don’t know how this is all going to turn out, and I don’t want to stop anybody. But I did say, you know: “Let’s wait and see what happens here. Let’s give the new ownership a chance. Let’s see how they want to operate, and if they want to keep doing what we’re doing here, that’s great. But you’re not going to know that if you’re not here.”

Our digital content manager, the minute the bankruptcy was announced, he started looking for a job and found one in the governor’s office, actually. His last day is tomorrow, and we’re not going to hire anybody right now, obviously, so that makes it really difficult for us, to be without the point man on our social media, on our analytics, on our website. All that stuff, we’re losing because of the announcement.

How pissed are you that he went to the other side? He went to the governor.

Apparently he’s getting a decent raise. I didn’t know that the governor’s office needed analytics and things like that, but apparently, yes, so more power to him.

Have you worried about keeping your own job? New ownership, sometimes they bring in a new editor. Is that something that you’ve been worried about, just being able to stay on?

Well, certainly that’s definitely crossed my mind. I feel like if I sit around wringing my hands about that, it’s going to rub off on the staff. I’m going to just keep that to myself. I mean, you know, talk to my wife about it, and see how things turn out. But I’ve got to follow my advice to see this process through and not jump to any conclusions. Obviously, I’m thinking about that in the back of my mind, like other things for myself, what other opportunities there might be for me, but that opportunity might be right here, so I need to see this thing through.

Would you want to stay?Fresh off his Oscar victory, Jordan Peele will tackle one of the most notorious true crimes of the 1990s.

The writer and director of “Get Out” has signed on to produce “Lorena,” a documentary series about Lorena Bobbitt, who cut off the penis of her husband, John Wayne Bobbitt, in 1993. After the penis was surgically reattached, Lorena was charged with malicious wounding.

The four-part series, which Peele will produce for Amazon, will look beyond the tabloid frenzy that enveloped the case and reframe the story around Lorena’s allegations of domestic and sexual abuse against her husband, whom she divorced in 1995.

“When we hear the name ‘Bobbitt’ we think of one of the most sensational incidents to ever be catapulted into a full blown media spectacle,” Peele said in a press release cited by Entertainment Weekly and Deadline Thursday. “With this project, Lorena has a platform to tell her truth as well as engage in a critical conversation about gender dynamics, abuse, and her demand for justice.”

Amazon officials said Lorena will directly participate in the series, which will offer a “new view into how America got her story wrong and maybe continues to get it wrong,” according to the press release.

“This is Lorena’s story,” Peele added, “and we’re honored to help her tell it.”

A jury acquitted Lorena by reason of temporary insanity in 1994. In 2007, she founded Lorena’s Red Wagon, a charity to help domestic violence victims and their children, as HuffPost previously reported.

“I realized I may as well make a good thing out of a bad thing,” she said at the time.

As for John Wayne, he was acquitted of marital sexual assault, and starred in a series of adult films in the mid-1990s before being profiled on REELZ’s “Scandal Made Me Famous” in 2016.A legal defense fund created in the wake of the Me Too movement is confronting two of the largest employers in the United States about sexual harassment in the workplace.

The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, housed by the National Women’s Law Center, on Tuesday announced new efforts to tackle claims of sexual misconduct at McDonald’s and Walmart.

Female cooks and cashiers at McDonald’s, with the financial support of the defense fund, have filed 10 charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in recent days against restaurant locations in nine cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles and New Orleans.

One McDonald’s worker in Chicago alleges that a manager asked her if she wanted to see his penis, and described “lurid fantasies” about what he would like to do to her. She said she was fired when she reported the harassment, according to a press release about her case.

Breauna Morrow, a 15-year-old cashier at a McDonald’s in St. Louis, said her supervisors did nothing when she complained of a co-worker who repeatedly sexually harassed her.

“McDonald’s advertises all over television saying it’s ‘America’s best first job,’ but my experience has been a nightmare,” Breauna said in a statement. “I know I’m not the only one and that’s why I’m speaking out, so others don’t have to face the harassment I’ve gone through.”

The lawsuits are among the first to arise following the creation of the defense fund in late 2017, amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood, the media and other industries. The Time’s Up Defense Fund, backed in part by A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington, offers financial backing for workers to effectively challenge sexual harassment.

“Sexual harassment takes a devastating toll on the women who endure it,” Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.

“The fast food industry has an atrocious record on sexual harassment in the workplace,” Tejani said. “No worker at any job ever should have to endure abuse for a paycheck.”

Fight for $15, the organization focused on establishing a higher minimum wage for fast-food workers, partnered with Time’s Up on the McDonald’s cases. Fight for $15 announced Tuesday that it has set up a hotline for fast-food workers to have their charges reviewed by lawyers.

The McDonald’s workers are demanding the company enforce the zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment outlined in its manual. They are also calling for mandatory sexual harassment trainings for managers and employees.

In a statement to HuffPost, Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s USA, said the company is “committed to a culture that fosters the respectful treatment of everyone.”

“There is no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in our workplace,” Hickey said. “McDonald’s Corporation takes allegations of sexual harassment very seriously and are confident our independent franchisees who own and operate approximately 90 percent of our 14,000 U.S. restaurants will do the same.”

The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund also announced Tuesday its role in a lawsuit filed by Gina Pitre, a former Walmart worker in Mississippi. Pitre alleges that her manager made “unwelcomed sexual comments [and] unwelcomed requests for text pictures” during her time at Walmart, the country’s largest corporate employer of women.

“For more than a year, my manager at Walmart repeatedly sexually harassed me while I was on the job,” Pitre said in a statement. “I tried to tell the company what was happening, but Walmart did nothing to hold the harasser accountable or keep me safe.”

Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, told HuffPost the company had investigated Pitre’s accusations and “could not find sufficient evidence to substantiate a violation of our discrimination and harassment policy.”

“We take this matter seriously and we will respond appropriately,” Hargrove said.

Last week, members of OUR Walmart, an advocacy group for retail workers, sent a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, demanding the company commit to stricter policies on sexual harassment. The letter, signed by several high-profile activists including actress Susan Sarandon, called on Walmart to create a streamlined, transparent process for filing sexual harassment complaints.

Hargrove said the company already has “strong policies and procedures in place to address allegations of sexual harassment.”

“We believe our current practices meet or exceed many of the requests in the letter,” he said. “Like anything at Walmart, we will continue to review our policies and enhance them as appropriate.”

Pitre and other OUR Walmart members refuse to back down until they feel meaningful change has taken place.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, President Donald Trump said he was not aware of a $130,000 payment his lawyer made to a former adult film star in 2016, marking the first time he has commented publicly on the matter.

Trump told a reporter, according to a pool report, “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen” why Cohen made the payment to Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels.

Asked whether he knew where the money came from, the president responded, “No, I don’t know.”

Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, tweeted on Thursday that he looked forward to “testing the truthfulness of Mr. Trump’s feigned lack of knowledge” about the payment.

Avenatti in March requested that a federal judge compel Trump to testify in court in a deposition regarding the $130,000 payment.

“As history teaches us, it is one thing to deceive the press and quite another to do so under oath,” Avenatti said Thursday.

Cohen, who acknowledged in February that he made the payment to Clifford, has maintained that Trump was unaware of the arrangement.

“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Cohen told The New York Times in February. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”

The payment came to light in January, when The Wall Street Journal published an article reporting that Clifford had an affair with Trump in 2006. The alleged affair would have taken place the year after Trump married Melania Knauss and a few months after the birth of their son, Barron.

Cohen reportedly paid Clifford $130,000 just before the 2016 election to sign a nondisclosure agreement and to refrain from speaking publicly about the matter.

The attorney has not offered an explanation for the payment, and insists that he paid Clifford out of his own pocket. The White House has denied that an affair between Trump and Clifford ever happened.

In January, In Touch Weekly printed a previously unpublished 2011 interview with Clifford in which she spoke at length about the alleged affair.

She delved further into her story in a “60 Minutes” interview in March, claiming she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July 2006. Clifford said she had unprotected sex with Trump and saw him regularly for roughly a year after their first encounter.President Donald Trump on Thursday turned a roundtable event on taxes into a campaign speech, rambling on about a range of issues, many of which he’d raised during his 2016 campaign, which ended 17 months ago.

In his opening remarks at the event in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, the president briefly touched on taxes and the opioid epidemic, which has ravaged that state. But for the most part, he chose to air his grievances on a variety of topics and regurgitate a string of false claims.

At one point, he physically threw away his notes, saying that his prepared remarks “would have been a little boring.”

NOT GONNA BE BORING!

Here is a summary of the president’s other head-spinning remarks.

He attacked West Virginia’s Democratic senator, Joe Manchin.

The roundtable was officially a policy event and not a campaign stop, yet Trump used the opportunity to lay into Manchin, who is up for re-election this year. He criticized the senator for not voting for the GOP tax overhaul.

“Your senator, he voted against, Joe, he votes against everything, and he voted against our tax cuts,” Trump said. “You’re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote [for] our program.”

He ranted about immigration, bringing up a series of false or exaggerated claims.

Riffing on this week’s announcement that he plans to deploy National Guard troops to the southern border ― a move that was likely inspired in part by a Fox News segment ― Trump made several spurious claims about the U.S. immigration system.

He falsely stated that the U.S. does not have merit-based immigration and exaggerated the scope of the diversity visa lottery system, complaining that the U.S. does not receive enough “good ones.”

He regurgitated some other classic lines from his campaign, such as his assertion that Immigration Customs and Enforcement agents detain undocumented immigrants by “throwing” them into “the paddy wagon.” He also suggested that the U.S. should reconsider the concept of birthright citizenship, an issue he first raised in 2015.

He suggested that because of illegal immigration, “women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before.”

Bringing up his infamous 2015 campaign announcement speech, when he referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists,” Trump claimed without evidence that migrants who have been traveling through Mexico in a large group this week are responsible for rampant amounts of rape.

“I used the word ‘rape.’ And yesterday it came out where, this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before,” he said. “They don’t want to mention that.”

Reporters traveling with the group said there were no reports of rape in the caravan.

Just asked one of the caravan organizers if there were any reports of rape on the caravan.



"No," said Rodrigo Abeja. "None whatsoever." — Adolfo Flores (@aflores) April 5, 2018

Later Thursday, White House officials claimed that Trump was not referring specifically to this week’s caravan, but to previous reports of rape involving women migrating through Central America en route to the U.S.

“There is extensive and extreme victimization of those making the journey north with coyotes/smugglers in general,” a White House official told Fox News. “This has been widely reported for years.”

A 2014 investigation from Fusion found that 80 percent of women and girls journeying through Mexico with the hopes of reaching the U.S. are raped, according to interviews with directors of migrant shelters.

In 2010, Amnesty International estimated that “as many as six in 10 women and girl migrants experience sexual violence during the journey” from “criminal gangs, people traffickers, other migrants or corrupt officials.”

Both reports say that it’s difficult to find exact statistics because of the risks associated with reporting such crimes.

He repeated his unfounded and unsubstantiated claim that “millions and millions of people” voted illegally in 2016.

“In many places, like California, the same person votes many times,” Trump said, again without evidence. “They always like to say that’s a conspiracy theory. It’s not a conspiracy theory, folks.”

There is no evidence that double voting is a widespread problem in California or elsewhere in the country, and Trump has failed to offer any substantial evidence of voter fraud.

After taking office last year, Trump convened a White House commission to investigate his claim. Many states did not comply with the commission’s request for sensitive voter information, with some citing their own public disclosure laws, and the panel faced widespread criticism and several lawsuits alleging violations of federal law. In January, Trump disbanded the panel.

He invited roundtable participants to publicly praise him.

As he often does, the president called on other people seated at the table to lavish compliments on him.

Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.), one of the GOP Senate candidates hoping to challenge Manchin this fall, described Trump as “a man keeping your promises” and told him that “I was a proud, early supporter of your candidacy.”

Another Senate candidate, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), lauded Trump for several achievements, including “focusing on the opioid epidemic with a laser beam.” Trump and his administration have actually provided few specifics on how they plan to address the crisis.

“The Trump administration is delivering,” Morrisey said.
