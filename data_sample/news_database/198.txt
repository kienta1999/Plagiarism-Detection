ABC aired its first full trailer for the upcoming “Roseanne” reboot during Sunday night’s Oscars broadcast:

The minute-long spot featured a moment where Roseanne Conner (Roseanne Barr) was worried that her husband Dan (John Goodman) was dead.

“Why does everybody always think I’m dead?” he asked, with the obvious joke being that the character actually did die, or so viewers were led to believe, in the show’s original series finale.

Along with Barr and Goodman, Laurie Metcalf will return as Jackie Harris, Sara Gilbert as Darlene and Michael Fishman as D.J. Alicia Goranson will reprise her role as Becky while Sarah Chalke, who also played Becky, will return as a new character.

The initial 1988-1997 run of the show was known for bringing a number of social issues into American living rooms, such as LGBTQ rights, domestic violence and mental illness. The reboot will reportedly include a non-binary child who’s described as “gender creative.”

The Conner family will also be politically divided: Barr, who is a supporter of President Donald Trump, will portray a Trump voter on the show. However, Bruce Helford, one of the executive producers, said earlier this year that the new “Roseanne” would not advocate a specific political stance.

“There is no agenda on anybody’s part but to get honest feelings out there within a family that’s relatable,” he told Reuters.

As in the past, the show will continue to tackle social issues, Helford said. This time around, opioid addiction and healthcare access will be highlighted.President Donald Trump reportedly didn’t reimburse longtime attorney Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to a porn star to keep her silent about an alleged affair.

Cohen told The New York Times last month that he paid Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels) $130,000 in 2016. At the time, he insisted that the money was his own but did not explain what the payment was for.

Now The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Cohen griped shortly after the election that he hadn’t been reimbursed by Trump for making payouts to Clifford.

Cohen responded to the report by sending a two-word email to the Journal: “Fake News.”

According to the newspaper, First Republic Bank, the financial institution Cohen used to wire the money to Clifford, flagged the transaction as suspicious and reported it to the Treasury Department.

The payment came from Essential Consultants LLC, a private Delaware company Cohen established a few weeks before the 2016 election for the sole purpose of paying Clifford using a bank account linked to the entity to send the payment to an account belonging to a lawyer representing Clifford, according to the Journal.

The money arrived on Oct. 27, 2016, 12 days before the presidential election, but it’s not clear when First Republic first reported the transaction as suspicious.

Cohen almost didn’t make the payment at all. He said he missed two deadlines earlier that month because he couldn’t reach Mr. Trump in the final days of the campaign, the Journal reported.

Both First Republic and the Treasury Department declined to comment to the paper.Ryan Seacrest, nary a Time’s Up pin to be found on his navy tuxedo, opened his 2018 Oscars red carpet coverage with a telling line: “It promises to be a very special evening.”

For him, it sure was.

Despite the sexual misconduct allegations leveled against him earlier this week by former personal stylist Suzie Hardy, everything was business as usual for Seacrest on Sunday. While his female co-host Giuliana Rancic set up at the nearby Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Seacrest parked on the red carpet ― no stage or special booth to prop him up, though. It was just him, a mic and enough celebrity traffic to sustain him for a few hours.

In fact, despite the Me Too mood of other awards shows this season, more than a few celebrities made their way over to Seacrest for a quick chat on Sunday. There was something eerie about watching women like Diane Warren, Allison Janney, Taraji P. Henson and Tiffany Haddish talk to Seacrest as if the recent reports just didn’t exist. No one talked about the Me Too or Time’s Up movements; no one questioned the ubiquitous TV personality.

Casey Affleck faced backlash for the sexual harassment allegations against him. As did Aziz Ansari and James Franco and Jeremy Piven. (The list goes on and on.) So why, or more so how, did Seacrest earn a pass?

On Monday, Hardy told Variety that Seacrest sexually harassed and assaulted her over the course of seven years. According to Hardy, Seacrest subjected her to many unwanted sexual advances, which allegedly included groping her vagina, grinding his erect penis on her and slapping her buttocks. She said she reported his behavior to E! News’ human resources executives in 2013 and was terminated shortly after.

“As proud as I am and as strong as a woman as I am, as smart as I am and as much work as I’ve done with therapists, it really affected me,” Hardy told Variety.

Seacrest vehemently denied the claims, which first surfaced last fall. In a statement on Tuesday, the “Live with Kelly & Ryan” and “American Idol” host said, “Yesterday, Variety published a salacious story that revealed the specific claims against me for the first time ― even though an independent third-party investigator found insufficient evidence to support the claims. Much to my dismay, Variety didn’t speak with me or bother to speak with other credible witnesses or even ask for any of the evidence that was obtained during the investigation when offered, all of which clearly challenged the veracity of the claims made against me.”

Seacrest added that Hardy repeatedly offered to step back her claims if he paid her “millions of dollars,” which he refused to do.

“I have worked extremely hard to achieve my success and I don’t take my opportunities for granted,” he concluded. “I don’t want to accuse anyone of not telling the truth but in this case, I have no choice but to again deny the claims against me, remind people that I was recused of any wrongdoing, and put the matter to rest.”

When asked if she felt Seacrest should still attend the Oscars, Me Too movement founder Tarana Burke told Variety, “We shouldn’t have to make those choices of, ‘Do we or don’t we?’ This is not about his guilt or innocence. It’s about there being an accusation that’s alive, and until they sort [it] out, it’s really on E! News and shouldn’t be on us. … It will let us know where they stand in terms of how respectful E! News is of this issue ― and of women.”

But both E! and ABC backed their prized possession, keeping Seacrest on the air even though murmurs were swirling from New York to Los Angeles. Should he still host the red carpet? Will celebrities stop to talk to him? Will he address the allegations on live TV?

He did show up; a few major celebrities did stop for him; and he didn’t address the scandal on “Live,” nor did he use his time on the E! red carpet to say a word about it. He swears he’s innocent, and it seems some people in Hollywood believe him. There were many ― both women and men ― who let him ask about their gowns, jewels and tuxedos, and smiled when he complimented their respective Oscar-nominated projects.

Interestingly enough, though, once the bigger stars started arriving to the event, Rancic and her E! red carpet cohorts, like Kristin Dos Santos, Brad Goreski and Josh Horowitz, started enjoying a bit more live screen time. Producers seamlessly jumped between Rancic and Seacrest ― perhaps to avoid airing any awkward moments as E! struggled to get bigger names and supporters of Time’s Up. The network reportedly instated a live 30-second delay to, most likely, rescue Seacrest from any unwanted, public controversy.

Awkwardness made its way into the broadcast anyway. Some comments from pre-show passersby were positive, while others were confusing, and it all made for less-than-stellar red carpet content from the typically newsworthy E!.

“Baby Driver” star Eiza Gonzalez delivered some intriguing parting words when she ended her interview with Seacrest by telling him, “Be good.” (Sure, it could’ve been a choice goodbye phrase, but either way, it was heard.) Taraji P. Henson also threw in her two cents when talking about the amazing success of her friend Mary J. Blige, telling Seacrest, “The universe has a way of taking care of the good people, you know what I mean?” She gave him a smile and some side-eye. Was it a show of support or a slight? It’s anyone’s guess.

Others continued to praise Seacrest, including double-nominee Blige, who told him she “loves” him and acknowledged his chemistry with Kelly Ripa on “Live With Kelly & Ryan.” (Ripa also popped by to tell her pal how “great” he was doing.) Seacrest also thanked Whoopi Goldberg for stopping as she smiled and said, “You know!”

Holy shit Taraji just put a curse on Ryan Seacrest 😂 pic.twitter.com/GSknn3NozF — Sara Jean Hughes (@sarajeanhughes) March 5, 2018

ABC, who aired the live award show and their own red carpet pre-show, spoke with many A-listers and Time’s Up supporters ― those who Seacrest and co. couldn’t wrangle.

Saoirse Ronan, Viola Davis, Mira Sorvino, Ashley Judd, Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Greta Gerwig, Gary Oldman, Mahershala Ali and Sandra Bullock, to name a few, chatted with the varied hosts, who asked not only about their films but Time’s Up and the current state of Hollywood.

After failing to get any more stars to stop and talk, Seacrest headed to the Roosevelt and joined Rancic for some sad fashion discussion, which included a comment about the lack of green dresses and the prevalence of the shade of “nude.”

Yet even though the Jennifer Lawrence and Laura Dern types didn’t stop for an interview with Seacrest, he still managed to do pretty well, all things considering. His first hour and change of coverage was solid enough, showing that both Hollywood and the world are torn on whether or not to believe him or his alleged victim.

One reason Seacrest, a fixture in live TV and an established producer worth over $380 million, might have earned his spot on the carpet is because he is a part of the machine that runs Hollywood. He’s a boss himself, a power player in the ranks, a bigger success than most at the Oscars and a friend of many a celebrity. Seacrest gets a pass because he’s used to handing out the tickets.

Me Too momentum seemed to building in awards season. Remember the Golden Globes? Black gowns and suits covered the carpet, and Time’s Up pins were prominently displayed as stars spoke at length about the powerful movement while standing beside impassioned activists. The tenor of discussion on the Oscars red carpet, or lack thereof, is telling. Was the movement another passing phase for Hollywood? Why did hosts and celebrities alike neglect to think discussions about sexism, pay disparity and harassment in the industry were appropriate for the night?

Unlike the pre-show, the live Oscars show addressed the impact and importance of Time’s Up with a powerful segment highlighting the trailblazers, which Harvey Weinstein accusers Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek introduced. Those sound bites are what we needed to hear from start to finish.Tiffany Haddish may not be nominated for an Oscar, but she arrived at the award ceremony on Sunday looking like royalty.

“The princess of Eritrea has arrived,” the “Girls Trip” actress said as she casually ambushed Michael Strahan’s interview with “Get Out” star Daniel Kaluuya.

After her abrupt but delightful entrance, Haddish explained to Strahan that her dress is a nod to her late father and his heritage.

“My father is from Eritrea and he passed away last year,” said Haddish, a presenter at the awards show. “And he said one day I would end up here and if I ever end up at the Oscars to honor my people, so I’m honoring my fellow Eritreans.”

Best Dressed at the 2018 Oscars

Kaluuya wasn’t the only actor Haddish got adorably aggressive with. Haddish mentioned to Strahan that she really wanted to meet Meryl Steep. So, when Haddish saw the Oscar-winning actress on the red carpet, she actually jumped over a velvet rope to seize the opportunity.

As far as her gorgeous gown, don’t be surprised if you see Haddish rocking it again.

In November, she mentioned during her monologue on “Saturday Night Live” that she doesn’t care about the taboo of wearing the same dress to more than one event.Really, it was more because Streep turned up looking like she was cosplaying the Fairy Godmother from “Shrek 2.”

Frazer Harrison via Getty ImagesThis is Camp Altiplano, where volunteers are using simple practices such as creating ponds and loosening hard earth to return the soil to health.

“When the first tractors arrived [in the 1950s and 60s], that was a big moment for the degradation here,” says Alfonso Chico de Guzman, who owns the plot of land where Camp Altiplano is located. With machinery, most farms increased their amount of productive land by cutting down trees and shrubs, which are vital for healthy soil, the farmer says.

In focusing on soil, Camp Altiplano’s ultimate goal is to learn how to bring degraded land back to life. If current rates of global soil degradation continue, it’s estimated we may only have 60 years of farming left. What’s more, restoring degraded soil worldwide has the potential to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, meaning soils can play an important role in climate change mitigation.

Camp Altiplano’s day begins with a dozen volunteers ― the current cohort are from Spain, the U.K. and the Netherlands ― gathering around a farmhouse table for a morning meeting. Tasks such as feeding the chickens, tending to the vegetable garden and making compost are allocated according to people’s skills and interests, and then the group sets to work for the day.Actress Amber Tamblyn faces backlash after Tweeting that Hasidic Jews in New York City are targeting her.

The former “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” star wrote Sunday that a Hasidic man in a van attempted to hit her in Brooklyn as she pushed her baby in a stroller.

If anyone in Brooklyn near the intersection of Washington Ave and Atlantic Ave just saw a Hasidic man in a grey van try to hit a woman and her baby in a stroller as she crossed a crosswalk, honking and touching the stroller with the car’s bumper, please DM me. That woman was me. — Amber Tamblyn (@ambertamblyn) March 4, 2018

But it was her follow-up post that sparked the controversy. Tamblyn wrote that “this is not the first time a man from the Hasidic community in NYC has attempted to harm me or other women I know. Any woman riding a bike through South Williamsburg can attest.”

Thank you everyone for your kind words of support today. We are fine. But this is not the first time a man from the Hasidic community in NYC has attempted to harm me or other women I know. Any woman riding a bike through South Williamsburg can attest. I hope this guy is caught. — Amber Tamblyn (@ambertamblyn) March 5, 2018

While some people on Twitter agreed with her, others interpreted her complaint as an unnecessary generalized attack on Hasidic Jews.

Hey @ambertamblyn this seems really scary! Unfortunately, linking it to a whole group that already has a hard time is also scary. The trouble is referencing a 'community' versus individuals. Note the 'they' versus 'our'/'us' convo that has ensued. Please consider. Best wishes 💚 — ZED Tupling (@ZEDTupling) March 5, 2018

Neither Tamblyn nor a rep immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

The actress defended herself in a tweet of support to a man who said that he, too, had been targeted by Hasidic Jews. Tamblyn, whose husband, actor David Cross, was raised Jewish, wrote she “will not be bullied or intimidated by anyone who wants to twist my words.”

I’m so sorry to hear this, Benjamin. And I completely agree with you here and will not be silenced or bullied or intimidated by anyone who wants to twist my words into anything other than what it is. — Amber Tamblyn (@ambertamblyn) March 5, 2018“Getty Images sincerely apologizes for the images of Kelly Marie Tran that incorrectly identified her as Olympian Mirai Nagasu and was licensed by customers who trusted the accuracy of the caption information.

The notoriously clumsy actress has a history of tripping and falling in public but seemed to successfully pull off the stunt.

Perhaps her success in not completely biting it was due in part to a lack of nerves.

The 27-year-old actress was not nominated for an award this year and appeared to be letting her hair down.

For instance, she was spotted being a straight-up goof on the red carpet.

Bucci had been Kansas resident for a few years, and decided to use her trip to the DMV as an opportunity to register to vote while she was there.

Bucci didn’t need to prove she was a citizen to renew her license (Kansas says an expiring license is good enough). But shortly after she registered, she received a phone call and a letter in the mail saying her voter registration was still pending because she hadn’t proved she was a citizen. Bucci, who was born in Maryland, didn’t have a copy of her birth certificate or any of the other documents, like a passport, to prove she was a citizen. She was working a minimum wage job at a correctional facility at the time and couldn’t afford the $20 to get her birth certificate from Maryland. Because she couldn’t prove she was a citizen, Kansas kicked her off the voting rolls.

Earlier in the same year that Bucci registered, Kansas implemented a law requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote. Spearheaded by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), officials said it was necessary to prevent noncitizens from getting on the voting rolls. Kobach put anyone who didn’t prove they were a citizen on a “suspense list” and purged them from the rolls if they couldn’t prove it, including Bucci.

In 2016, Bucci joined five other Kansans to sue Kobach and challenge the law. They say the law is unnecessarily restrictive and violates the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), a 1993 law that requires states to offer people the opportunity to register at DMVs and other state agencies. The NVRA says when someone registers to vote at the DMV, the state can only ask people for the minimum amount of information necessary to assess whether they’re eligible.

While the Kansas law might not pose a hurdle to anyone with easy access to a passport or other proof of citizenship documents, the plaintiffs say that it targets young people, who may move around a lot, as well as the poor and minorities who don’t have access to proof of citizenship documents or can’t pay to get them. Arizona, Georgia and Alabama have also sought to impose proof of citizenship requirements on new voters.

Trial in the case begins Tuesday in Kansas City. The Kansas law has been on hold since 2016, when a federal judge stepped in to issue a temporary injunction ordering Kobach to register 18,000 people who had tried to register at the DMV but failed to prove their citizenship. At the time of the judge’s ruling, there were over 32,000 people in the state whose registration, like Bucci’s, was in limbo. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s decision, saying Kansas and Kobach needed to show the current practice of allowing people to swear they were citizens under penalty of perjury wasn’t doing enough to prevent noncitizens from voting.

The case, which will determine whether Kansas can continue to block tens of thousands of people from registering to vote if they can’t prove their citizenship, hinges on the question at the center of the national debate over voting restrictions: Is there enough evidence of noncitizens registering to vote to justify a law that imposes a substantial hurdle to registering?

Dale Ho, the director of the voting rights project at the ACLU, which is representing the plaintiffs, said it was “not an accident” that Kobach was at the center of the lawsuit.

“This could really be in a lot of ways the case where we really put the evidence of fraud on trial in this country,” he said. “You have the nation’s chief purveyor of fraud talking about this. Well now he’s going to have to try and prove it in court, not on Fox News.”

““You have the nation’s chief purveyor of fraud talking about this. Well now he’s going to have to try and prove it in court, not on Fox News.”” - Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's voting rights project

Kobach has tried hard to get around the NVRA requirements for what officials can ask about when someone tries to register to vote. He unsuccessfully sought to amend the federal voter registration requirements to allow states to ask about proof of citizenship.

The morning after the 2016 election, Kobach wrote to a Trump transition official and said he was already working on an amendment to NVRA that would make it acceptable for states to ask people to prove they were citizens when they registered to vote. Later that month, Kobach met with Trump and brought a memo recommending changing NVRA to allow states to ask for proof of citizenship. Shortly after that meeting, Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for illegal votes and would later go on to say that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the election. The White House has failed to substantiate that claim, but has publicly pointed to Kobach as someone who can.

Kobach has suggested that 127 noncitizens in Kansas registered or attempted to register to vote in the state anytime before 2013, instances which he said diluted a legitimate voter’s ballot. That 127 number represents less than 0.01 percent of the total number of voters in Kansas. But Kobach has said there could be more than 18,000 noncitizens on the rolls. He plans to offer a series of experts during the trial to support the claim.

The ACLU says roughly one in seven voters in Kansas were blocked from voting because of the proof of citizenship law between 2013 and 2016. Because noncitizen attempts to register in the state are so rare, Ho says the Kansas law is like “taking a bazooka to a fly.”

For people who have easy access to a passport or birth certificate, Ho acknowledged it can be difficult to see how a proof of citizenship requirement is unfairly restrictive. But the fact that so many voters were blocked, Ho said, is evidence of just how burdensome the law is.

“If seven people fail to comply with this law, then you’d say, ‘Well come on guys, get your act together,’” he said. “But it’s one out of every seven registrants in the state. That tells you that it’s a problem.”

Kobach has said that one of the reasons proof of citizenship isn’t burdensome is because people have to prove they’re a citizen when they apply to get a license. But in its complaint, the ACLU said there were thousands of people in Kansas who registered when getting their license for the first time, but failed to make it onto the rolls. Kobach, the ACLU says, wasn’t making an effort to match voter registration records with DMV records, and required people to submit proof of citizenship a second time to register to vote. NVRA prohibits states from making that kind of duplicative request, according to the ACLU.

Last year, the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issed a deeply critical analysis of the proof of citizenship law. They noted that there was a correlation between where African-American voters lived and areas where high numbers of people who were on Kobach’s suspense list. The commission compared the fees people have to pay to get documents to a “poll tax” and recommended that the Department of Justice review whether it violated federal law, including the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Kobach, who is running for Kansas governor, is taking the unusual step of representing himself in the case. He has already been sanctioned with a $1,000 fine in the case for misleading the court about the contents of the documents he brought to his November 2016 meeting with Trump.

Kobach, who declined to be interviewed through a spokeswoman, has staunchly defended the proof of citizenship law and has indicated in court documents that he will defend it all the way to the United States Supreme Court (though his term ends in 2019 and he is not seeking reelection).

“The ACLU has declared war on election security laws like ours in Kansas. This war is something that is outrageous,” he said in an interview with Fox News in February. “They’re making ridiculous arguments like it’s an unconstitutional burden for you to reach into your file cabinet at home and find your birth certificate.”The stars of the record-breaking Marvel film “Black Panther” emphasized that sentiment on the red carpet of the 90th Academy Awards Sunday when they wore some gloriously royal attire.Florida billboard targets NRA as ‘terrorist organization’ pic.twitter.com/JrtGWHgrGh — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 4, 2018

A political action committee has erected a massive billboard message in Pensacola, Florida, calling the National Rifle Association a “terrorist organization.”

The message was funded by the Mad Dog PAC, which sponsors billboards across the nation calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment and attacking the nation’s largest gun lobby and select Republican politicians. The PAC is headed by Claude Taylor, a former staff member in Bill Clinton’s White House.

“With the GOP majority in the House and in the Senate, the NRA makes impossible any meaningful, common-sense gun reform. That includes background checks and assault weapon bans,” Taylor told the Pensacola News Journal.

Taylor said another anti-NRA billboard will go up soon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Political billboards have attracted new attention from activist groups in the wake of the film “Three Billboards in Ebbing, Missouri.” The movie features a mother, played by Frances McDormand, who pays for a trio of billboards that call out the local sheriff for his failure to find her daughter’s killer.

In February, three red billboard-sized messages appeared on the side of trucks in Miami, calling out Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for his inaction on gun control in the wake of the tragic school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that left 17 dead.

The signs, paid for by activist group Avaaz, read: “Slaughtered in school ... and still no gun control? How come, Marco Rubio?”

A second billboard with a similar message was scheduled to go up Sunday in Tallahassee.

Bullock was being interviewed by ABC when Kidman appeared from behind. The Oscar winners shared a warm embrace before recalling their experience playing witch sisters Gillian (Kidman) and Sally (Bullock) Owens 20 years ago.

“We were talking about when we shot together and we asked her to get the tequila,” Bullock, who looked stunning in a black-and-gold Louis Vuitton gown, said. Gesturing toward Kidman, she added, “She came back with her own tequila but we drank it anyway. We were a little drunk.”

An Italian cardinal has decided to send Vatican officials a 1,200-page dossier that claims to identify 40 actively gay Catholic priests and seminarians in Italy.

Cardinal Cresenzio Sepe of Naples announced Thursday that he is forwarding a list compiled by male escort Francesco Mangiacapra to Vatican authorities. Mangiacapra’s dossier reportedly contains WhatsApp texts and photos that offer evidence that Catholic clergy members were interested in gay sex.

In a statement, Sepe said that none of the priests on Mangiacapra’s list were part of the Diocese of Naples. The cardinal forwarded the file to the Vatican because “those who have erred must pay the price, and be helped to repent for the harm done.”

Mangiacapra describes himself as a “gay escort,” according to the Associated Press. The list he compiled, of 34 priests and six seminarians, does not involve any accounts of sex with minors. “We’re talking about sins, not crimes,” Mangiacapra said, according to the diocesan statement.

Despite the church’s unchanging stance on homosexuality, some Vatican observers claim that many secretly gay clergy do work for the Catholic Church. The gay priests reportedly form alliances, leading to rumors of a “gay lobby,” an informal network of priests who keep each others’ secrets and help influence each others’ careers.The team behind “Coco,” this year’s Academy Award winner for best animated feature, used their acceptance speech as an opportunity to stand up for Mexico and Mexicans in the face of xenophobia.

Director Lee Unkrich said on Sunday that he and producer Darla K. Anderson began making the Pixar film six years ago under “a very different political climate.”

Since then, Trump has made a number of demeaning comments about Mexico and Mexican-Americans in the past, including calling immigrants rapists. The president also claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel― an American born to Mexican immigrant parents― wouldn’t able to rule fairly in a case involving his controversial border wall (Curiel actually sided with Trump.) Remarks like these gave the film a new urgency, Unkrich said.

“A lot of things started to be said about Mexico and about Mexican-Americans that was unacceptable,” he said.

Unkrich said the team felt the need to convey “a positive message about the beauty of Mexico, the beauty of the Mexican people, the beauty of their culture and traditions into the world, and also give Mexican and Mexican American kids something to look up to, something to aspire to and to see a bit of themselves up on screen. Marginalized people deserve to feel like they belong. Representation matters.”

The film centers around Miguel Rivera, a 12-year-old aspiring musician, who travels to the land of the dead to make peace with his ancestors in order to follow his passion.

AdvertisementActresses Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino hit the red carpet together at the 90th Annual Academy Awards on Sunday night.

Both women came forward this year to accuse now-disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, making their arrival a moment to remember.

Judd, who is presenting at the ceremony, stunned in a deep purple gown with a sweetheart neckline, while Sorvino was feeling the fairytale in a one-shouldered blush dress complete with intricate floral details.

They arrived together, with the “Mighty Aphrodite” actress posting a photo of the two in the car before the ceremony kicked off.

“We’re on our way!!!,” she captioned the photo, joking about their contrasting blonde and brunette ’dos with the hashtag #normajeanandmarilyn.

A post shared by Mira Sorvino (@mirasorvino) on Mar 4, 2018 at 2:45pm PST

Judd was one of the first actresses to publicly reveal Weinstein’s sexual predation in The New York Times’ bombshell report published in October about the producer’s decades-long history of abusing women in the film industry.

The “Divergent” star said he invited her into his hotel room 20 years ago, only to ask if she could give her a massage or watch him shower.

“How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Judd recalled thinking.

The report opened the floodgates for other women, like Sorvino, to share their own accounts of Weinstein’s behavior. The Oscar-winner said the producer harassed her on multiple occasions and went on to derail her career after she rejected his advances.

Both actresses were honored as Time’s Person of the Year in the group of “silence breakers,” alongside Me Too movement founder Tarana Burke, for bringing sexual harassment and abuse to the forefront in the national conversation.

Best Dressed at the 2018 Oscars

In conversation with ABC on the red carpet, the two stressed the importance of continuing the momentum of the Me Too movement and Time’s Up, the action plan and legal defense fund that aims to combat gender and racial discrimination.

“This movement isn’t stopping, we’re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,” Sorvino said.

Fans and others watching along on Sunday immediately took to social media to commemorate their arrival, with some describing the moment as “vindication.”

VINDICATION. #Oscars90 — Duana Taha (@Duanaelise) March 4, 2018Starbucks’ plan to close more than 8,000 locations on May 29 for employees to receive racial bias education can’t come soon enough for one Los Angeles-area man.

The man, who the media has identified as both “Pedro” and “Peter,” ordered two iced coffee drinks Tuesday afternoon at a Starbucks in La Canada.

An employee called out the name “Pedro” when the order was ready at the counter. But the drinks came with something the customer didn’t expect, want or desire: On both cups, according to KNBC-TV, the word “beaner” was written.

“It’s an offensive word used towards Latinos,” Pedro told KNBC’s sister station, Telemundo 52.

The victim’s friend, Miguel Acosta, said they are both still shocked by the incident.

“He went to Starbucks, and they asked for his name, and his name is ‘Peter,’ and they wrote this ‘beaner,’” Acosta told CBS Los Angeles.

Acosta said Pedro doesn’t understand why he was targeted.

“Mi amigo está triste también,” Acosta said. “My friend is also sad.”

A store manager tried to make things right by going to where Pedro works offering free coffee and a $50 gift cards, according to local station Fox 11. He refused them.

“I didn’t accept it because it’s like an insult overall,” he told KNBC.

Starbucks released a statement to KNBC:

“This is not the experience that we want for our clients. We asked for his forgiveness and we are working to correct this. Also, we are investigating the incident to ensure this will not be repeated.”

A Starbucks representative told HuffPost that a member of its leadership team met with the customer this morning “and he accepted our apology.”

The person added: “This kind of mistake is unacceptable, and we will take additional steps to assess what happened here and how our partners can be better.”

Last month, in an incident involving a Starbucks employee that drew national attention, two black men at one of the chain’s Philadelphia outlets were arrested while they waited for a friend. A white female manager called the police shortly after the men sat down but didn’t place an order. She has since resigned.

The incident inspired numerous protests and was condemned as indicative of institutional racism. It also prompted Starbucks’ upcoming seminars on racial bias.Sandra Bullock says she “started to cry” when she saw the “Black Panther” cast on the 90th Academy Awards red carpet during an interview with “Access Hollywood” on Sunday.

“I started to cry backstage when I was telling them [the movie’s cast] how much the film meant to me as a woman, but how much it meant to me as a mother,” she said.

“That says a lot about where we are in this world and in the world of superheroes.”

Bullock is the mother of two black children, Louis Bardo Bullock and Laila Bullock. She adopted the New Orleans-born Louis in 2010, and foster child Laila, also a Louisiana native, in 2015.

Of her love for “Black Panther,” Bullock told a heartfelt anecdote that stresses the dire need for representation in entertainment:

“I’m so grateful to Marvel because about five years ago, my son asked me if there were any brown Legos,” she said.

“And I said, ‘Yes, there are,’ and I got a Sharpie and I turned Spider-Man brown, I turned the Legos brown, and I don’t have to turn them brown anymore.”

Bullock said her children were still too young to see the critically acclaimed film, but her daughter apparently really loves wearing the “Black Panther” mask:Levi Sanders listens as his father, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), speaks at a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Jan. 21, 2016. Brian Snyder/Reuters

Levi Sanders, Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign policy analyst and only biological child, is running for Congress in New Hampshire largely as an unknown. The senior Sanders is a notoriously private person, and for the most part, his son has stayed out of the public eye.

Thanks to years of Facebook postings, though, we can glean some sense of the passions that drive the younger Sanders. Because, in addition to his legal advocacy focusing on Social Security Disability Insurance, Levi Sanders is extremely mad online.

Levi (pronounced LEH-vee) has already come under some social media scrutiny for his past tweets. It seems that Twitter is where he goes to drop his iffy takes; Facebook is where he prefers to brawl.

Levi Sanders vs. The High School Reunion Establishment Elite

Take, for instance, a discussion from several years ago in a Facebook group for Levi’s high school graduating class. One alum, Daniel, started off the conversation about an upcoming get-together by saying, “I understand that there has been discussion about the increased cost of attendance this evening for those that didn’t RSVP.” The problem was that the venue was charging a penalty for anyone who hadn’t RSVP’d before the group finalized the reservation. Daniel was very sorry, but the matter was out of his hands.

Levi wasn’t having it.

Screenshot

This was followed by calls for Levi to cut Daniel some slack, and by assurances that the organizers of this get-together for Burlington High School’s class of 1987 were not in the high school reunion game for profit.

Levi again called bullshit.

Facebook

Another class member, Michelle, expressed discomfort with Levi’s tone and asked that he take his concerns to a more private forum. The voice of the people, however, would not be silenced.

Screenshot

Another classmate, Sue, followed up to suggest that Levi simply commit to observing the deadline, thus avoiding any additional fees. Classic neoliberal logic.

Screenshot

“Friday, at Nectars, was free,” classmate Leland replied, referring to a Burlington restaurant.

Screenshot

“I am not sure anyone understands your point,” Leland responded, adding that Levi was “welcome to plan the next one.”

Screenshot

Some discussion followed, in which Kristin jumped in to clarify that those who were unable to pay simply didn’t, and that “no one was turned away.”

Levi Sanders vs. ‘Simple Pepsi Brothers’

Five years ago, one of Levi’s Facebook friends decided to post a status bashing socialism.

Screenshot

To which someone named Michael countered, somewhat unconvincingly, “#2 is our biggest problem. No one wants to work, they just want handouts. Go Jets !!!!!”

Screenshot

Bart then jumped in to suggest that comparing the U.S. to Scandinavia is “like comparing a farm region in Iowa to a soon-to-be-bankrupt urban jungle in California.”

Screenshot

Bart: “HAHAHA really? you just went out of your way to defend socialism ... all I need to do is state the obvious, that Obama is more likely to move the US towards a bigger version of Cuba than Romney is.”

Screenshot

To which the simple Pepsi brother offered nothing but silence.

Levi Sanders vs. The City of Houston

Levi fucking hates Houston.

Screenshot

“But Houston is so cheap!” suggested Jonas.

Screenshot

Screenshot

Jonas noted that “this is where the money is,” to which Levi replied with devastating irony:

Screenshot

Jonas: “How do Jewish people treat Black people in Massachusetts? Let’s talk about Brighton, MASS..I KNOW YOU ARE JEWISH!!! JEWISH HIRE JEWISH PEOPLE COME ON NOW...”

Levi was oblique in response:

Screenshot

Jonas then responded, as most people eventually do, by essentially telling Levi to chill out.

Levi Sanders vs. Conservative Women (The Stupid Ones)

In a discussion of immigration reform, one of Levi’s Facebook friends, Rendy, offhandedly suggested that we don’t live in a country “with terrible human rights’ violations and poverty.”

Actually, said Levi ...

Screenshot

“Levi Sanders, I agree with you and you know it,” said Rendy.

Screenshot

At which point Andrew jumped in to counter with “Levi and his progressive BS ideas, lol.”

Levi replied to underscore that Rendy was on his side.

Screenshot

Andrew followed up to note that “the idiot philosophy of social justice” is “just code word for communism or Marxism.”

Screenshot

Levi Sanders vs. Liz Warren Fans

Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have never been particularly close, though neither seems willing to talk about their differences in public. Levi Sanders, however, is more than free to sound off.

Screenshot

In the discussion that followed, Levi uncharacteristically stayed out of it until one user casually referred to senators as working a thankless job. Not on Levi’s watch.

Screenshot

Levi Sanders vs. Farmers

One day several years ago, Vermont Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman, an organic farmer, announced to his Facebook friends that he was standing at the Burlington winter farmers’ market “selling organic veggies and meat for Christmas dinners.”

“We’re open until 2pm then we pack-up and drive home in the freezing rain,” David wrote. “Rain, snow, sleet and hail; nothing keeps us farmers from showing up at market.”

Bullshit, Levi said.

Screenshot

Wait, what?

Screenshot

Hold on.

Screenshot

“Hi Levi- Not sure what you are talking about,” David finally said. He tried to explain that people like to talk about the weather casually and thanked Levi for working to make the world a better place.

Screenshot

David noted that he is “not a vegetarian, however, I do believe that there is a difference in raising animals for consumption in a factory farming, cement floor, no outdoors environment, vs. lots of straw for bedding, indoor (shelter from elements), outdoor (free access), rotational grazing environment.” He went on to explain how he tries to raise his animals ethically.

Screenshot

David’s silence remains deafening.

Levi Sanders vs. Farmers II

It’s David again. And this time, he’s selling some special pork sausage for Mother’s Day.

Screenshot

“How many pigs have you raised in your lifetime, Levi?” asked Jason.

Screenshot

At which point, once again, Levi was basically told to chill.

Screenshot

Screenshot

Jason has yet to say whether or not he does, in fact, concur.

Levi Sanders vs. Vegetarian Liars

This one comes from our old friend Rendy, who posted a photo of a Reuben sandwich on Facebook. Levi wasn’t born yesterday, you absolute fool, you nitwit.

Screenshot

Levi Sanders vs. Bacon

Just a few years ago, a Facebook user named Flavia posted a number of photos, one of which depicted a small plate of bacon in the corner that most people likely would never have even noticed.

Screenshot

Levi, I’m sorry, it’s bacon.

Screenshot

Levi, Flavia didn’t eat the bacon.

Screenshot

Flavia, perhaps frustrated with her friend’s didacticism, countered that “kale is no better than spinach or other greens.”

Screenshot

Levi did not take the hint.

Levi Sanders vs. Disgusting Flesh

Flavia, again, decided to share a nice photo of her meal.

Screenshot

Screenshot

Levi was, as always, told to chill.

Screenshot

Technically true! Flavia countered, once again, by asking Levi not to be quite so judgmental, asking: “Do you drive a car? Because I don’t and the folks that feed oil slaughter animals on the regular.” No ethical consumption under capitalism, Lev.

Screenshot

All right, man.

Levi Sanders vs. A Frozen Food Brand

A nice meal idea, nothing more.

Take it away, my dude.

Levi Sanders vs. Yogurt Brand

Here’s a clever twist on a classic snack that everyone will love, thought Chobani’s social media manager.

Screenshot

You people make Levi sick.

Screenshot

While you probably didn’t know who this Levi Sanders was until his campaign announcement last week, you’ve definitely known a Levi Sanders. We’ve all known a Levi Sanders. Ever angry, scrapping with people who agree with him, screaming at brands when no one else will take the bait. There is a Levi Sanders in all our lives.

Have you ever fought with Bernie Sanders’ son on Facebook? Probably. In which case, let us know.“Why do we need write-in categories for sexual orientation?” one Twitter user asked. “Because ‘72-year-old Helen Mirren taking a tequila shot on the red carpet’ is never going to be a check box option.”

Another added that they would “murder for Helen Mirren” because of course.It was the first Oscars since Harvey Weinstein had been exposed, since things had supposedly changed. The first since the Golden Globes, when Hollywood’s most famous and best-dressed wore pins, discussed legal funds and said that time was up, this time would be different, forget about all that other stuff ― so sorry about the past.

Host Jimmy Kimmel addressed the industry’s harassment problem head-on in his monologue. Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek, and Annabella Sciorra ― three Weinstein accusers ― were allowed to stand together on stage and speak briefly and compactly about the Me Too movement, a polite nod to the changing world.

Yet, there they were, the accused rapist and the alleged wife beater. First, former NBA star Kobe Bryant accepted the award for Best Animated Short to raucous applause, while Mark Hamill, presenting the award, screamed “KOBEEEEEE” as if he’d just hit a game-winner in his backyard. Then, Gary Oldman, whose now ex-wife once accused him of hitting her with a phone, stood before the Academy with the award for Best Actor in hand. Bryant and Oldman had won for two projects so typical of the industry, so consonant with the basic corporate desires of powerful producers that they’re not clichéd so much as intrinsic, like a strand of DNA.

Gary Oldman (left) and Kobe Bryant (right) were two of the stars of the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday night. Getty

A John Williams-scored ode to the beauty of sports, and a World War II tale of perseverance in the face of the growing Nazi threat — it doesn’t get more Hollywood than that.

Bryant’s short film, “Dear Basketball,” which sets a poem he wrote during his final season in the NBA to orchestral music and some so-so animation, is not great. It’s not even good. Or, as IndieWire’s Chris O’Falt put it after “Dear Basketball” received a nomination, “In my opinion, it is the worst short film I have ever seen nominated for an Academy Award.”

But it does two things well. For one, it plays right into Hollywood’s long-documented love of overly sentimental sports narratives meant to unveil something larger about life, or adversity, or acceptance, or something (“I gave you my heart / Because it came with so much more”). It also stars the most beloved sports star in the Los Angeles area. Take the two together and you have a film tailor-made for a middle-aged white man in Los Angeles, otherwise known as a typical Academy voter.

“Darkest Hour” was better, and Gary Oldman made for an impressive and impressively made-up WWII-era Winston Churchill. Films about the war have become so stupendously synonymous with the Academy Awards that Kate Winslet once joked about it in a 2005 episode of the HBO show “Extras.” Dressed up like a nun who was sheltering Jews, she tells Ricky Gervais’ character, “I’m doing it because I’ve noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust, you’re guaranteed an Oscar.” And a few years later, Winslet would in fact win one for her role in the Holocaust film “The Reader.”

For all the various misdeeds of powerful men that have been unearthed in the months since Weinstein became known as the walking allegation that he is, the fundamental structures of power remain firmly in place in Hollywood. Last year, the percentage of female protagonists in Hollywood movies was down and the percentage of directors of color basically flatlined. Female directors made far below 10 percent of the highest-grossing films.

“For all the various misdeeds of powerful men that have been unearthed in the months since Weinstein became known as the walking allegation that he is, the fundamental structures of power remain firmly in place in Hollywood.”

That power imbalance was reflected in the auditorium on Sunday. After Frances McDormand asked the female nominees in the room to stand during her own acceptance speech for Best Actress, The New York Times’ Jodi Kantor, who broke the Weinstein story wide open with Megan Twohey, wrote, “The most striking thing, here in the room, about watching the female nominees stand? There were so few of them.”

Maybe men will be a bit more careful now, but the thrust of the night’s biggest moment, Frances McDormand’s Best Actress acceptance speech, was that actual power would have to be wrested away from the lords of our status quo.

Until then, until the way that movies are concocted, greenlit, produced and pushed out is changed, Hollywood will continue to have nights like Sunday — nights when people who have been accused of terrible things can win with recycled or terrible ideas amid an apparent general enwokening.

Navigating new moral imperatives in a fundamentally unchanging industry is a messy business. It is the kind of thing that causes Aziz Ansari to skip out on the SAG Awards while Ryan Seacrest ends up on air interviewing stars on the red carpet Sunday night. Arbitrary barometers end up deciding which accused bad men are fine now, and which are not. Was the accusation a while ago? How many were there? Well, he does seem a bit better now, more mature, doesn’t he? And I did love that one movie.

It’s been a year since the Academy awkwardly handed a Best Actor award to Casey Affleck, accused sexual harasser, for his performance in “Manchester by the Sea,” and quite obviously, no one has figured out anything resembling a road map for these sort of things.

Had Bryant, for example, come to “understand how [his accuser] feels that she did not consent to this encounter” in the last five years, rather than when he wrote those words roughly a decade and a half ago, it would be hard to imagine him on stage last night. (A judge ultimately dismissed the charge against Bryant after his accuser refused to testify; she and Bryant later reached a settlement after she filed a separate civil lawsuit.)

The same could be said of Oldman, whose now-ex wife said this of Hollywood’s favorite Churchill near the start of the century:

As I picked up the phone to call the police, Gary put his hand on my neck and squeezed. I backed away, with the phone receiver in my hand. I tried to dial 911. Gary grabbed the phone receiver from my hand, and hit me in the face with the telephone receiver three or four times. Both of the children were crying.

Oldman described the allegations as “replete with lies, innuendos and half-truths” and police never pressed charges. What is not up for debate is that he followed that up with an impassioned defense of Mel Gibson and his anti-Semitic rant in a 2014 Playboy interview. “The policeman who arrested him has never used the word ‘nigger’ or ‘that fucking Jew?’” Oldman wondered aloud, in front of a reporter. “He got drunk and said a few things, but we’ve all said those things.”

After Sunday’s Oscars, Oldman’s ex-wife told TMZ, “Congratulations, Gary and congratulations to the Academy for awarding not one but two abusers with Oscars. I thought we had evolved. What happened to the #MeToo movement?”

That both men won, that the Academy deemed Bryant and Oldman acceptable enough to honor with an award, speaks to the essential traditionalism of Hollywood. The alleged bad men got their Oscars because they made movies so in the vein of what Hollywood has always done that their baggage could easily be dismissed. Pander to the industry’s immutable tastes — a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die — and whatever new critical faculties it seems to have acquired all fall apart.Frances McDormand took home the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” Sunday night, but, as host Jimmy Kimmel stated, she should have also gotten an Emmy for her speech.

“Pick me up if I fall over a little bit, because I’ve got some things to say,” she said after getting onstage to accept her award, her second after winning for “Fargo” in 1997. McDormand thanked her family and then put down her Oscar and called on every woman nominated that evening to stand up with her.

“Meryl, if you do it, everybody else will. C’mon,” she implored to the clapping Streep in the front row.

“Look around, everybody. Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed,” McDormand said.

“Don’t talk to us about it at the parties tonight. Invite us into your office in a couple days or you can come to ours, whichever suits you best, and we’ll tell you all about them. I have two words to leave with you tonight. Ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider.”

Celebrities and fans were raving about the speech and the actress’ call to action on Twitter.

Many, however, were thoroughly confused about what McDormand meant by her final words, a legal term not usually heard on award shows.

An inclusion rider, as John Jay College professor Phillip Atiba Goff explained on Twitter, is “a clause in an actor’s contract that requires the cast and crew be diverse in order to retain the actor” ― essentially, it’s a commitment to representation.

McDormand also talked about representation in her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in January, where she mentioned the Time’s Up initiative in Hollywood.
