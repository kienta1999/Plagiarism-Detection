Netflix has hired television producer Ryan Murphy, known for the hit series “Glee” and “American Horror Story,” in a five-year deal to create exclusive series and films, the company announced late Tuesday.

The deal is expected to be worth up to $300 million, both The New York Times and Deadline reported, which, if true, would be one of the biggest for a producer ever made. It also reflects a major blow to 21st Century Fox, the longtime home of many of Murphy’s hallmark series over the last decade.

“Ryan Murphy’s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement about the hiring. “His celebrated body of work and his contributions to our industry speak for themselves, and we look forward to supporting Ryan in bringing his broad and diverse stories to the world.”

In his own statement, Murphy said he planned to continue to “champion women, minorities and LGBTQ heroes and heroines” in his new body of work when he starts in July after his current contract expires. Netflix said two new series, “Ratched” and “The Politician,” will premiere soon after.

“The history of this moment is not lost on me,” Murphy said in a statement. “I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.

The move is the latest star hire by the streaming behemoth in the past six months. In August, the company poached Shonda Rhimes, the creator of “Scandal” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” away from ABC. Her four-year deal was reportedly worth $100 million.

Netflix said in October that it planned to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018 in an effort to make its vast arsenal of movies and television shows 50 percent original programming. The company has steadily been increasing its subscriber base, and as of mid-January it had more than 117 million monthly customers.

Murphy will continue to produce shows for 21st Century Fox, where he has nearly a half-dozen series currently in production, including “American Crime Story,” “Feud” and a new drama called “Pose,” about the vogueing scene in 1980s New York City.LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A lawsuit accusing singer Taylor Swift of stealing lyrics for her song “Shake It Off” was thrown out on Tuesday by a judge, who ruled the phrases in question were not sufficiently original to merit copyright protection.

Swift’s 2014 song reached No. 1 on the pop charts and marked her evolution from country to pop music.

Two songwriters said in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles last year that Swift’s song was based on the phrase “players, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate,” that they coined for a 2001 song “Playas Gon’ Play” by R&B girl group 3LW.

Swift’s lyrics from the chorus of “Shake It Off” are, “the players gonna play, play, play, play, play, and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.”

Attorneys for Swift asked U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald in January to dismiss the case.

“In order for such short phrases to be protected under the Copyright Act, they must be more creative than the lyrics at issue here,” Fitzgerald ruled, according to court papers.

The songwriters who sued Swift - Sean Hall and Nathan Butler - did not allege Swift’s song stole musical elements, the judge said, and phrases about players and haters existed in pop culture before 2001.

“In short, combining two truisms about playas and haters, both well-worn notions as of 2001, is simply not enough,” the judge said in his ruling.

The judge left the door open for Hall and Butler to file a revised lawsuit.

But Gerard Fox, the attorney for the two songwriters, said he had no intention to file an amended complaint and would instead appeal Fitzgerald’s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Fitzgerald made a mistake by assessing the originality of the lyrics for himself, instead of relying on experts, Fox said.

“He cannot make himself an expert in the music industry, I’m sorry it’s actually embarrassing,” Fox said.

A representative for Swift did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment.

Hall is a songwriter and producer for artists such as Justin Bieber and Maroon 5, and Butler has worked with artists such as Backstreet Boys and Luther Vandross.Scott Pruitt, the head of the EPA, said his security detail makes the decision to book him in premium cabins due to a "very toxic" political environment. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt defended his use of first-class and business-class travel on Tuesday, saying a “toxic” political environment has created security risks that mandate his frequent use of premium cabins.

Pruitt made the comments in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, the first time he publicly addressed a recent Washington Post report that found he frequently traveled in first-class seats, often at a cost of thousands of dollars per flight, while his aides flew coach. A string of trips last June cost taxpayers more than $90,000 in total, according to agency receipts the Environmental Integrity Project obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.

Pruitt said Tuesday that his protective detail and his chief of staff made the bookings based on security assessments, and said there was a string of incidents last year that spurred his frequent use of first-class seats. It was not immediately clear what these incidents involved, and the EPA did not reply to HuffPost’s request to clarify what they were.

“We live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment,” Pruitt told the Union Leader. “We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat.”

“I’m not involved in any of those decisions,” he continued. The Union Leader noted that Pruitt traveled to New Hampshire via a first-class flight from the Washington, D.C., area to Boston.

The EPA defended Pruitt’s travel in an interview with The Washington Post on Sunday, saying ethics officials had approved the expenses. Federal regulations state that government employees must “consider the least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but security concerns do allow for more expensive bookings.

CNN reported in October that Pruitt gets at least “four to five times the number of threats” as his predecessor. He’s also the first person in the role to have a full-time security detail at a cost of about $2 million a year.

Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA has been controversial as he’s quickly moved to dismantle many Obama-era environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. Researchers have accused Pruitt’s EPA of disenfranchising scientists on the agency’s advisory boards, and senior officials have been leaving in droves, either through buyouts or voluntary departures.

On Monday, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) called on Pruitt to be fired, calling him “the wrong person at that place,” echoing the calls of many environmental groups.

But Pruitt told the Union Leader his detractors “just don’t know me.”It’s pretty much impossible to make it through Valentine’s Day without spotting those teensy, chalky candy hearts with lovey-dovey phrases on them.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― As part of a symbolic budget that would slash domestic spending, President Donald Trump this week proposed replacing some monthly food stamp benefits with a cardboard box of nonperishable goods.

The “America’s Harvest Box,” as the Trump administration calls it, is an idea that apparently nobody outside the administration has ever heard of ― and one that the administration itself may not have vetted very carefully.

On Monday, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney likened it to a “Blue Apron-type program,” referring to the gourmet meal delivery service. But the budget documents describing the program don’t mention anything about funds for shipping food to people’s homes. The documents say it would actually be up to states to handle distribution.

During a hearing on the budget Wednesday, Rep. Suzan Delbene (D-Wash.) asked Mulvaney how much it would cost to package and distribute the boxes, whether the government would set up a database of people’s dietary restrictions and how boxes would find their way to people with unstable housing.

“Have you thought through any of these things?” Delbene said.

Mulvaney didn’t answer the question directly. Instead, he said the government could save money by buying food wholesale instead of giving the money to food stamp recipients to shop in retail stores. And he said Democrats should love the food box idea.

“Democrats have actually supported this program in the past,” Mulvaney said.

That’s news to Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the House subcommittee overseeing food stamps.

“I never heard this idea broached even once,” McGovern told HuffPost. “It’s a stupid idea. It’s a cruel joke.”

The America’s Harvest Box proposal is based on the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which distributes monthly food boxes to about 600,000 seniors across the country. Democrats do like that program, though support for a tiny commodity distribution initiative is not the same as support for radically remaking food stamps in the tiny program’s image.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as food stamps are formally known, is one of the biggest safety net programs in the United States, with 42 million beneficiaries in 20 million households. The average benefit per recipient last year was about $125. The money is deposited each month on special debit cards that can be used in grocery stores for almost any food item.

In other words, SNAP is about 70 times bigger than the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which only serves people older than 60 and doesn’t necessarily deliver to homes.

In Washington, D.C., the commodity program is called Grocery Plus and is administered by the Capital Area Food Bank. A spokeswoman for the charity said that of the 5,400 D.C. seniors enrolled in the program, only about 130 get home delivery, for which they qualify due to lack of mobility. Of the remaining beneficiaries, 20 percent pick up their food box at a central distribution site and the rest receive the boxes at apartment buildings and low-income senior housing facilities.

Though Mulvaney said the food boxes would resemble Blue Apron, a USDA fact sheet said distribution would be left up to states, with apparently no Blue Apron-style requirements. “States can distribute these boxes through existing infrastructure, partnerships, and/or directly to residences through commercial and/or retail delivery services,” the fact sheet said.

There are roughly 70,000 households receiving food stamp in D.C., so in the unlikely scenario that Congress were to approve the America’s Harvest Box program, the Capital Area Food Bank would likely be called on to help with distribution.

“Scaling up to meet the need of 70,000-plus households would really overwhelm the existing system,” Hillary Salmon, a spokeswoman for the food bank, said in an interview, adding that current USDA food box recipients often say they wish the boxes came with fresh produce.

Blue Apron boxes typically have lots of fresh produce, to be used as ingredients in fancy home-cooked meals. America’s Harvest boxes would have none.

A USDA spokesman said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue himself came up with the idea for the food boxes, which had never been discussed during dozens of committee hearings on food stamps over the past three years.

Stacy Dean, a nutrition expert with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a blog post that “this new proposal to support individual households would require operational capacity and infrastructure that neither USDA nor states now have.”

The Trump budget would cut SNAP by about 25 percent, saving more than $200 billion over 10 years largely through the theoretical savings of the food boxes. According to a description of the proposal, households receiving more than $90 per month would get a portion of their benefits as a food box, “which would include items such as shelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit, vegetables, and meat, poultry or fish.”

The budget also calls for new restrictions on benefits for nondisabled adults, which Republicans on Capitol Hill have said they plan to push for this year.According to “Queer Kid Stuff” creator Lindsay Amer, you’re never too young to be an activist.

Now in its third season, Amer’s YouTube series has done an impressive job of breaking down LGBTQ themes, experiences and ideas in ways that are accessible and fun for preschool children. In the new installment, Amer and co-host Teddy show viewers that being an activist is, literally, as easy as pie.

“The filling is all about you and your activism,” Amer says in the clip. “It’s about how you want to make change and what you want to change. You can put anything you want in your pie.”

Previously, Amer has referenced a number of historical protests, like the 1969 Stonewall riots and the Women’s March, on the series ― albeit in kid-friendly, easy-to-follow terms.

“We’ve touched on activism in a bunch of our episodes,” the host, who recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the show’s fourth and fifth seasons, told HuffPost. “But I thought it was important to highlight activism in its own episode. This brings together a bunch of concepts we’ve been talking about throughout the series, and I was excited to present it in a really fun way.”Brent Laing and teammate Ben Hebert in the Canada vs. Italy in curling competition on Wednesday.

“I am totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind,” Trump told reporters. “Everyone knows that, and it almost wouldn’t even have to be said.”

Trump has come under fire for not directly addressing domestic violence victims or speaking out against Porter’s alleged behavior. In his first remarks about the scandal last week, Trump emphasized that Porter denies the allegations.

“As you probably know, he says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “He said very strongly yesterday that he’s innocent, so you’ll have to talk to him about that.”

The next day, he tweeted out sympathy for people whose “lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.”

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders rebuked reporters earlier this week when they asked why Trump had not made any statement against domestic violence, telling them she was authorized to speak for him and that his silence had no bearing on how seriously he takes such accusations.

She also danced around questions as to whether Trump still wishes Porter well, as he said he did when the secretary resigned.

“I think the president of the United States hopes that all Americans can be successful in whatever they do,” Sanders said. “And if they’ve had any issues in the past ― I’m not confirming or denying one way or another ― but if they do, the president wants success for all Americans.”While Americans shine at the Winter Olympics, some good news has emerged on the Summer Games side.

That’s basically what the U.S. as a whole will be doing in 2026, according to a new federal government report published in the journal Health Affairs on Wednesday afternoon.

If those projections hold up, Americans will be spending an even greater share of gross domestic product on health care than they do now, when roughly 18 percent of GDP goes there.

And while this report doesn’t make predictions about health care spending in other countries, it’s likely that the gap between what the U.S. and the rest of the developed world spends on health care will also expand ― even though that gap is already pretty big, because nobody else spends as much as Americans do.

This year’s projected increase of about 5 percent is still modest relative to the increases around the turn of the century, when the average was higher than 7 percent and double-digit annual increases were common. Still, the new report raises the same fundamental questions that its counterpart did last year, and the year before, and so many years before that: Why does health care spending keep rising more quickly than incomes, how much of that spending is really worth it, and what, if anything, should the government do about it?

An Acceleration, But Not A Massive One

Wednesday’s report is the annual update on national health expenditures. It comes from analysts at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and it is the most authoritative source of information about how much money Americans have been putting into health care, where that money is going, and how those patterns are likely to change in the future.

The main headline from the report is that the government’s analysts expect health care spending to rise by 5.5 percent annually over the course of the coming decade.

That’s an uptick from the recent past. From 2008 through 2013, national health expenditures increased by just 3.8 percent annually ― mostly because, during the recession and its aftermath, people spent less money on medical care because they had lost their insurance or were unable to meet their out-of-pocket obligations.

The pace of spending growth picked up as the economy strengthened and the Affordable Care Act took full effect, in no small part because so many millions of previously uninsured people suddenly had insurance. Even with that burst of coverage, however, annual growth in health care spending was just 5.0 percent on average between 2014 and 2016 ― or two-tenths of a percent less than what the government expects going forward.

“These projections show health care spending growth continuing to inch upwards, breaking with the unprecedented modest increases we’ve seen in recent years,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

Context matters, of course. The coming acceleration in health care spending still looks pretty small in the context of the 7.3 percent annual growth that the U.S. saw between 1990 and 2007. “While the estimates show health spending growth continuing to outpace the economy as a whole, the gap is still much smaller than it has been historically,” Levitt said.

But, assuming the projections are right, health care spending will rise more quickly than incomes between now and 2026. That means health care spending will place an ever greater strain on employers, government programs and eventually individuals, through some combination of higher premiums, higher taxes and higher out-of-pocket expenses.

The report suggests several factors are driving the increases. One of the biggest is demographics: The population is getting older, on the whole, and older people need more health care ― even though, as retiring baby boomers transition from private insurance to Medicare, they will be moving into a public program that pays less for services and has historically restrained increases better than private coverage.

Another factor, as always, is the price of health care, which the report suggests will rise, in part, as a function of an improving economy, which creates more demand for services.

The level of usage of medical services is also part of the story, although the government’s experts expect that to decline slightly as a factor, in part because ― with repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which imposes a penalty on people who don’t have insurance ― fewer people will get insurance.

More Spending Can Be Good And Bad

Increases in health care spending are not always problematic, although the political discussion sometimes treats them that way. As Harvard economist David Cutler notes in a Health Affairs essay accompanying the new report, “there is no economic law that governs how much money should be spent on any industry.” Even as Americans today spend far more on health care than they did a century ago, Cutler points out, they spend far less on agriculture and manufacturing ― which suggests high levels of health care spending are “sustainable” as long as they are worthwhile.

But, as Cutler also notes, there are mountains of evidence to suggest that a big chunk of American health care spending is wasteful, whether because it goes to administration or to care that doesn’t make people better. Americans also pay the highest prices for their medical goods and services, which means not just more expensive drugs and devices but also larger fees for doctors and hospitals.

And as health care gets ever more expensive in relation to incomes, not just poor but even middle-class people will not be able to afford it without greater financial assistance than they receive already ― whether it’s through tax breaks that make private insurance more affordable or government programs like Medicaid that enroll them directly. Either way, making that assistance available takes money that has to come from somebody else’s pockets.

The argument over how to address these problems has been the defining debate in American health care policy for decades.

Liberals (and Democrats) generally favor using government to force down prices, as other developed countries do, while expanding public insurance and subsidies for private coverage. Conservatives (and Republicans) generally favor deregulating industries, on the theory that market forces can reduce spending more effectively, and requiring individuals to bear a greater share of their own medical costs, so that they will shop for and consume health care with more eye to value.Gus Kenworthy proves you can go home again after all.

The freeskier reflects on his history-making journey to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in a video (above) he posted Tuesday to YouTube. Kenworthy is one of two openly gay men competing for the U.S. at the Winter Games for the first time in history. (Figure skater Adam Rippon is the other.)

That responsibility, he says, is one he now takes very seriously, even though he struggled with self-doubt before coming out in a 2015 ESPN interview after competing at his first Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, a year prior.

“It was amazing to see the support,” he says in the video, the first of three produced in partnership with Samsung. “But it was also hard because I felt like if they really knew me, if they truly knew me, maybe they wouldn’t be as supportive.”

The clip captures Kenworthy spending time with friends and family in his hometown of Telluride, Colorado, over the holidays. “I thought [coming out as gay] was going to isolate me,” he reveals. Prior to coming out, he adds, “I always thought I was going to keep inside and never tell anyone until after my ski career, and then I could have a whole new life.”

Making LGBTQ sports history, he says, poses a different kind of challenge.Following years of chronic pain and numerous surgeries, Lena Dunham says she has undergone a total hysterectomy in the hopes of finally ending her years-long struggle with endometriosis.

Dunham has spoken openly in the past about her experiences with endometriosis — which occurs when endometrial tissue, which normally lines the inside of the uterus, grows in and on other organs. She shared the news of her hysterectomy in the March 2018 edition of Vogue. The Endometriosis Foundation of America published excerpts of the article on its website Tuesday.

The 31-year-old “Girls” creator said she’d made the difficult decision to undergo the hysterectomy, which involves the removal of the uterus and cervix, following “years of complex surgeries measuring in the double digits” and alternative treatments including pelvic floor therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture and yoga.

Dunham said her surgeons found several other issues with her reproductive organs while they were performing the procedure.

“In addition to endometrial disease, an odd hump-like protrusion and a septum running down the middle, I have retrograde bleeding, a.k.a. my period running in reverse so that my stomach is full of blood,” Dunham said. “My ovary has settled in on the muscles around the sacral nerves in my back that allow us to walk. Let’s please not even talk about my uterine lining. The only beautiful detail is that the organ — which is meant to be shaped like a light bulb — was shaped like a heart.”

Dunham has been hospitalized multiple times in recent years for endometriosis. Last April, she said she was “endometriosis-free” after undergoing surgery to move her ovaries away from her rectal wall. Weeks later, however, she suffered complications from the procedure and had to be rushed to the hospital following a red carpet appearance at the 2017 Met Gala.

Those complications forced her to cancel her “Lenny Letter: America IRL” tour. At the time she said she was in “the greatest amount of physical pain that I have ever experienced.”

“After being told I was endometriosis-free after my last procedure, more disease was found in deeper spots that required immediate surgery and now physical therapy,” Dunham wrote in a note to fans on the Lenny Letter website.

A post shared by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Feb 8, 2016 at 12:42pm PST

In the recent Vogue article, Dunham expressed feeling like she finally had “choices” after feeling “choiceless” for so long. She also expressed an interest in having children in the future either through surrogacy or adoption.

“Soon I’ll start exploring whether my ovaries, which remain someplace inside me in that vast cavern of organs and scar tissue, have eggs,” she said. “Adoption is a thrilling truth I’ll pursue with all my might.”

Dunham has previously expressed hope that her openness about her endometriosis journey will benefit other women struggling with the condition.

“So many people who suffer will never have the resources I’ve had,” she said last April. “My job is to educate people, to try to change the pathetic lack of resources for endometriosis, but it’s also to seize this gift. I’ll be more useful that way.”

Worldwide, about 176 million women suffer from endometriosis, according to the Endometriosis Foundation. In the U.S., an estimated 1 in 10 women is impacted by the condition, which can cause chronic pain and fatigue, urinary and bowel disorders and fertility issues.Yuri Gripas / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions has come out swinging against a bipartisan drug sentencing reform bill that has the support of many of his former Republican colleagues in the Senate, warning that the legislation would be a “grave error” and not allow adequate punishment for “a highly dangerous cohort of criminals.”

In a Feb. 14 letter to his former colleague Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions wrote that he “strongly” urged the Senate to consider the ramifications of the bill.

“In recent years, convicted drug traffickers and other violent criminals have received significant sentencing breaks from the federal courts and the United States Sentencing Commission.” Sessions wrote. “Passing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation’s history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences.”

The Iowa senator said on Twitter Wednesday that he was “incensed” by Sessions’ letter, saying it was not the proper role of the attorney general.

Incensed by Sessions letter An attempt to undermine Grassley/Durbin/Lee BIPARTISAN criminal justice reforms This bill deserves thoughtful consideration b4 my cmte. AGs execute laws CONGRESS WRITES THEM! — ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) February 14, 2018

Grassley said the “bipartisan compromise ensures that these consequences fit their crimes by targeting violent and career criminals who prey on the innocent while giving nonviolent offenders with minimal criminal histories a better chance to become productive members of society.”

On Thursday, Grassley fumed at Sessions during a Senate Judiciary Committee markup hearing.

“When I read his letter, it was almost as if Senator Sessions was back on the Judiciary Committee,” Grassley said. “But that’s the problem. He is now the attorney general and is charged with executing the laws that Congress passes, not interfering with the legislative process.”

If Sessions wanted to be involved in the markup process for the legislation, “maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama,” Grassley said.

Grassley said that both he and Sessions believe in being tough on crime. “But I also believe in being fair. This is a view shared by the last Republican attorney general, Michael Mukasey, who testified in support of this bill last Congress. So, we have one Republican attorney general who thinks this bill is good policy, and one who has some concerns,” Grassley said.

Last week, Grassley said the bill was “stuck” without support from the Trump administration.

“I think it would be like asking a Jewish person to sit down and understand where the Nazi is coming from,” Goldberg said on “The View” last week. “I think that would be a difficult thing.”

The co-host’s comments came after she read a laundry list of the ways Pence has pushed back against LGBTQ rights over the years.

“He says keeping gays from marrying was not discrimination but an enforcement of God’s idea,” she read. “In 2006 he said gay couples signal societal collapse, and in 2007 he opposed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a law that would prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ folks. He doesn’t believe the repeal of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ was good, and he rejected the Obama administration directive on transgender bathrooms.”

When it was reported last week that Rippon turned down a meeting last month with Pence, who led the official U.S. delegation to the Games, the veep tweeted out his support for the Olympian and attacked the media for spreading “fake news.”

.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Don’t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get ‘em! — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8, 2018

Rippon later clarified his decision, saying that he would be willing to sit down with Pence for an “open conversation,” but it would have to wait until after the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Warren went on to emphasize that a 10-year-old Pocahontas lived “no love story,” and that her life was one of “heroism, and bravery, and pain.”

Trump has used the name “Pocahontas” as a slur to refer to Warren on multiple occasions, beginning during Warren’s 2012 Senate race when she made claims that she had Native American heritage.

On Wednesday, Warren spoke in detail about her own supposed Native American heritage. She also pointed out that “our country’s disrespect of native people didn’t start with President Trump,” but that “it started long before President Washington ever took office.”

“We have a president who can’t make it through a ceremony honoring Native American war heroes without reducing native history, native culture, native people to the butt of a joke,” Warren said.

“The joke, I guess, is supposed to be on me,” she went on. “I get why some people think there’s hay to be made here. You won’t find my family members on any rolls, and I’m not enrolled in a tribe. And I want to make something clear. I respect that distinction. I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes — and only by tribes.”

“I never used my family tree to get a break or get ahead,” she said. “I never used it to advance my career. But I want to make something else clear too: My parents were real people.”

Warren said that her mother’s family was part Native American and her father’s parents “were bitterly opposed to their relationship.” They eloped anyway.

“They’re gone, but the love they shared, the struggles they endured, the family they built and the story they lived will always be a part of me,” she said. “And no one — not even the president of the United States — will ever take that part of me away.”

It remains unclear whether Warren is indeed part Native American, as she claims. The Washington Post’s “Fact Checker” column declined in 2016 to rate the assertion as true or false, but noted that “there is no documented proof of Warren’s self-proclaimed, partial Native American heritage, which experts have noted is difficult to prove to begin with. Warren has maintained since 2012 that this is an issue of family lore.”

Warren on Wednesday pledged to be an advocate for native people and to amplify their stories.

“I’m here today to make a promise: Every time someone brings up my family’s story, I’m going to use it to lift up the story of your families and your communities,” she said.

Near the end of her speech, Warren implored the crowd to “stand with everyone who has gotten the short end of the stick from Washington over and over and over.”

“We must weave our voices together to make them strong,” she said. “We must come together to write a new story, not just for Native Americans, but for all Americans.”

Boston Globe reporter Matt Viser tweeted that Warren received a standing ovation, and that the National Congress of American Indians’ president shouted “We’ve got your back!”

Reception in the room was all positive. — Matt Viser (@mviser) February 14, 2018Britain, France and Germany have all called for Israel to exercise restraint after Monday’s bloodshed near the Gaza border. But the Trump administration has declined to hold Israel accountable for the violence, saying that the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas was to blame.

“The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas,” White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters at a press briefing on Monday, referring to the 58 Palestinians who were killed by Israeli forces.

“Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response,” Shah added, suggesting the clashes were “a gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt” orchestrated by Hamas’ leaders.

Reporter: Given that it’s only Palestinians being killed, shouldn’t Israel shoulder some of the blame?

Shah’s remarks echoed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s insistence that Hamas was solely culpable for the violence. Netanyahu claimed that Israeli forces were merely defending their borders when they opened fire on the Palestinian demonstrators.

Alistair Burt, Britain’s minister for the Middle East, said it was “deplorable that extremist elements may have been seeking to exploit these protests for their own violent purposes.” He also said the “large volume of live fire” used by Israeli forces was “extremely concerning.”

“We will not waver from our support for Israel’s right to defend its borders,” Burt said. ”[But] we continue to implore Israel to show greater restraint.”

Clerics and leaders of militant factions in Gaza, led by Hamas, urged Palestinians to join the demonstrations after midday prayers, The New York Times reported. As the protesters descended upon the Gaza border on Monday, U.S. dignitaries ― including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and presidential advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner ― were celebrating the opening of the controversial new American embassy in Jerusalem.

The Israeli military said in a statement that some protesters “hurled firebombs and explosive devices at the security fence and Israeli troops,” and soldiers had followed “standard operating procedures” in response.

No Israeli soldier or civilian was killed or wounded in Monday’s clashes, according to Vox.

Palestinian Health Ministry officials said at least 58 Palestinian demonstrators were killed and 2,700 were injured in the violence. That brings the total number of Palestinians killed since March 30, when the six-week campaign of “right of return” protests in Gaza began, to over 100, officials said.

More protests at the border are expected on Tuesday ― a day that marks the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced during the 1948 war. The Nakba protests are expected to mark the last day of the protest campaign.“From touring, you have these little handshakes and things that you do with your co-stars in the shows, whether it’s a handshake, or a booty bump, or whatever it may be. Terry, Tara and I all have one that we do, the three of us, and we can’t do a show without doing it.”

Johnny WeirThe Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang are well underway, yet North Korea’s state media has only minimally covered the games, not bothering to feature any of the 22 athletes or hundreds of cheerleaders, journalists, artists and politicians it sent to South Korea for the occasion.

Korean Central Television hasn’t broadcast any video footage thus far, only a handful of still images from the North Korean delegation’s visit to Pyeongchang, including pictures from a hockey game Sunday in which some of the North Korean athletes participated as part of the joint Korean team, 38 North’s Martyn Williams, a North Korea analyst and journalist, told HuffPost. One photo featured Kim Yo Jong, leader Kim Jong Un’s sister whom he sent as his primary emissary.

One day before, KCTV also showcased some stills of the opening ceremony featuring the delegation, but the network played patriotic music videos while the ceremony was happening live, according to the BBC.

“The only reporting has been on the delegation and the political side of things,” Williams said. “If you look at the reporting, the athletes and the cheerleaders have hardly been mentioned.” The only video KCTV has broadcast was of them leaving Pyeongchang and arriving back in North Korea.

Korean Central News Agency did report on comments Kim Jong Un made in response to South Korea hosting officials from his government during the Olympics, according to CNN’s Will Ripley. It also issued a report heaping praise on the performance of North Korean hockey players and cheerleaders during Saturday’s game against Switzerland, failing to mention that Korea lost 8-0.

KCTV is known for not broadcasting events live, Williams noted, even in the case of major North Korean military parades in the streets of Pyongyang.

“They don’t show everything, they only show the parts [of the games] that are relevant to North Korea and provide a certain narrative about North Korea’s role there,” Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told HuffPost. “They keep it sanitized, telling people what they need to know.”

In previous years the network has featured one to two hours of Olympic programming nightly, Williams said, implying that there could be an issue this year with North Korea successfully obtaining broadcasting rights. But the Winter Games may also not be that important to North Koreans, Town said, seeing as the most popular sports in the country, like basketball and soccer, aren’t part of the competition.

The rest of the world has certainly taken note of North Korea’s presence in Pyeongchang. Some Western news outlets have even faced criticism for painting the dictatorial regime in a positive light by choosing to cover its soft power Olympics push, comprised of smiling cheerleaders and athletes walking side by side with South Koreans.

The regime, ranked last place in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index, is known for its extreme censorship, offering only one news outlet that’s entirely controlled by the state. The country’s programming is rooted in praiseworthy coverage of its leaders past and present. Attempts to seek news from elsewhere is a punishable offense.

“Under the penal code, listening to unauthorized foreign broadcasts and possessing dissident publications are considered ‘crimes against the state’ that carry serious punishments, including hard labor, prison sentences, and the death penalty,” according to a 2016 Freedom House report. “North Koreans are often interrogated or arrested for speaking critically about the government; they also face arrest for possessing or watching black-market recordings of television programs.”A dead ringer for North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un caused mischief during a historic ice hockey game at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday.

As the unified Korean women’s team took to the ice for its game against Japan, a man who identified himself only as Howard walked in front of the North Korean cheer squad and waved at the crowd.

He also waved what appeared to be a flag depicting a unified Korean peninsula.

South Korean counter-terrorism officials escorted him away to a nearby seat, reports Reuters.

Vincent Bevins, a correspondent who writes for The Washington Post, shared footage of the incident to Twitter.

According to Bevins, who was on the scene, local police then took Howard to a nearby hallway where he protested his innocence.

“I just want to see the game, so what’s the problem?” he’s heard asking in another video that Bevins shared below.

Officials then took Howard into a nearby office for questioning.

He was released a short period later and was reportedly “politely asked” to leave the ice hockey stadium:

“My face is too political,” Howard told Reuters in an apparent, and likely mischievous, effort to play down his resemblance to the North Korean despot. “I was born with this face, I’ve got to live with it.”

The International Olympic Committee Charter prohibits “the Games from being used as a platform for protests, demonstrations or the promotion of political, religious or racial propaganda.”

Howard missed the conclusion of the hockey game, which ended in a 4-1 victory for Japan. He’s believed to be the same Kim Jong Un lookalike who showed up to Friday’s opening ceremony alongside a doppelgänger of U.S. President Donald Trump. Security staff also ended up escorting them out.The New York Times has fired journalist Quinn Norton, its brand new editorial board hire, HuffPost has learned.

At around 3 p.m. on Tuesday, the paper’s communications department tweeted that it had hired Norton as its “lead opinion writer on the power, culture and consequences of technology.”

Twitter users immediately began pointing to her past tweets, in which she’s admitted she’s “friends with various neo-Nazis” ― though she says she has “never agreed with them.” In other tweets, she’s called users “fag” and used racial slurs.

By 10 p.m., Quinn had been released from the company. James Bennet, the Times’ editorial page editor, told HuffPost:

“Despite our review of Quinn Norton’s work and our conversations with her previous employers, this was new information to us. Based on it, we’ve decided to go our separate ways.”

Norton didn’t respond to a request for comment, though later she posted a series of tweets defending her work, her relationships and use of slurs.

I've been a queer activist since 1992. But when I speak to communities, I used their language to do it. I talked about the Anonymous usage of "fag" and "faggot" here: https://t.co/1hdDvcrBB6 — These are Quinn's sexy Spock eyebrows (@quinnnorton) February 14, 2018

In a blog post about her hiring, she said she was “as surprised as you are.”

“I haven’t tried to make myself look more professionally acceptable, more conventional, or any of that, for the benefit of my new employer. I plan to just be me, and bring my ideas to the table. I hope those ideas help.”

“And if that doesn’t work out, no harm no foul.”

Twitter

It’s unclear whether the Times’ editorial board knew about the tweets before hiring Norton. Many of the tweets under immediate scrutiny are from 2014 or earlier.

It’s also unclear what precisely Norton meant when she wrote that she was “friends” with neo-Nazis.

In one tweet from 2014, she states she is friends with Andrew “weev” Auernheimer, the notorious neo-Nazi hacker and the webmaster for The Daily Stormer. In another tweet last year, she wrote, “Weev is a terrible person, & an old friend of mine. I’ve been very clear on this. Some of my friend are terrible people, & also my friends.”

Norton has also written about weev.

After 9 p.m., she said in a series of tweets that she doesn’t “support weev.”

For those of you honestly concerned. I don't support weev, that's not given in how I define friendship.

Norton is known more broadly for her tech journalism and Medium posts like this one on engaging with and seeking to fight racism.

She has also written about and dated Aaron Swartz, the progressive hacker and internet folk hero who took his own life in 2013 after an investigation into his alleged plan to distribute millions of academic journals.Shane Smith, chief executive officer of Vice Media Inc., is seen in September 2016.

Vice Media, a company that has been accused of fostering a hostile workplace environment for women, is now facing a lawsuit from a former employee over alleged equal pay violations.

In a case filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday, former Vice Media employee Elizabeth Rose accused her onetime employer of a pattern of paying female employees less than their male peers. The practice, the lawsuit argues, is in violation of the Federal Equal Pay Act and similar state acts in New York and California ― the two states where Rose lived while working for Vice from 2014 to 2016.

According to the filing, Rose obtained an internal memo in 2015 showing her the salaries of about 35 other employees. She allegedly discovered that overall, the men were being paid significantly higher salaries than their female counterparts for essentially the same work.

Rose says she discovered a particularly egregious pay discrepancy between herself and a male employee she’d hired. Per the lawsuit:

Plaintiff hired her male subordinate, but she learned that this male employee earned approximately $25,000 per year more than her. This male employee quickly rose through the ranks and was later promoted to a position as Plaintiff’s supervisor by the male executive overseeing the Live Nation joint venture, who told Plaintiff that the male employee was a “good personality fit” for male clients at Live Nation.

The lawsuit alleges that hundreds of women employed at Vice Media were affected by the equal pay violation. Rose’s lawyers are seeking class-action certification.

In a statement to HuffPost, Vice said it’s still reviewing Rose’s complaint, and noted that it’s studying workplace equality concerns.

“We have just been made aware of the complaint and are reviewing it,” the statement read. “As a company, we have made a significant commitment to a respectful, inclusive and equal workplace. That commitment includes a pay parity audit started last year, a goal of 50/50 female/male representation at every level by 2020, and the formation of a Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board.”

Former Vice News writer Alice Speri tweeted in support of Rose’s claims on Tuesday:

When VICE hired me in 2014 they offered $35K, which I negotiated to $40K. For months I was practically the only staff writer (+ many abysmally paid freelancers). There was technically another "head" writer but he

had less experience & barely wrote—he made nearly twice my salary https://t.co/d8G32iWdIO — Alice Speri (@alicesperi) February 13, 2018

In December, a bombshell New York Times report explored the toxic workplace culture for women at Vice Media. Two men alleged in the report to have engaged in sexual misconduct at work, company President Andrew Creighton and Chief Digital Officer Mike Germano, were subsequently placed on leave the following month. After the launch of an internal investigation, Germano was permanently dismissed. The company is still investigating claims against Creighton.

AdvertisementA top attorney with Immigration and Customs Enforcement reportedly resigned this week after being charged with stealing several immigrants’ identities to obtain money and property.

Raphael A. Sanchez, the agency’s chief counsel in its Seattle branch, was charged Monday with one count wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, court documents show. During a four-year period, he allegedly attempted to defraud American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, Discover, and JPMorgan Chase by using the personal information of seven people whose cases were being processed by ICE.

He even sent emails from his official ICE address to his personal email containing a copy of someone’s energy bill, as well as photos of a U.S. permanent resident card and a Chinese passport, prosecutors say.

Sanchez submitted his resignation Monday, a Department of Justice official confirmed. He’s scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.

The DOJ declined to comment for this article. Sanchez’s attorney, Cassandra Stamm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.WASHINGTON — During Tuesday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders attempted to explain the apparent contradictions between FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony before Congress earlier the same day and the West Wing’s evolving public account of the handling of domestic abuse violations against former staff secretary Rob Porter.

At issue is Wray’s assertion that the FBI had completed its background check on Porter in late July and sent its findings to the White House. Previously, the White House had claimed that a background investigation into Porter was ongoing when allegations of spousal abuse against him surfaced last week in the media, and that it had received no information from the FBI that would disqualify him for a security clearance.

But a source familiar with how the White House personnel process was handled in prior administrations told Yahoo News that Sanders’s story “doesn’t add up.”

“It would be highly irregular for something like this to happen,” said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation and the limited number of people familiar with the process.

Last week, two of Porter’s ex-wives went public with allegations he verbally and physically abused them. Porter, who has vehemently denied the accusations, resigned from his position on Feb. 7. His position was one of the most sensitive in the White House and essentially involved being a key gatekeeper for documents for the Oval Office.

Both of Porter’s former wives said they told the FBI about their experiences as part of the background check procedures for his position. This raised questions about when exactly the White House first found out about the accusations against Porter and how, absent a security clearance, he was allowed to work in a high-level position that involved handling classified information.

In press briefings in recent days, Sanders and her deputy, Raj Shah, said Porter had an interim security clearance and that his background check process was “ongoing.” They also insisted no one in the White House was aware of the allegations against him, which could have disqualified him for a clearance.

Wray, who was handpicked to lead the FBI by Trump, seemed to directly contradict the White House’s explanations in testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Wray said the FBI completed Porter’s background check late last July and sent a report to the White House. That was one of three instances where Wray said the bureau gave the White House information on Porter. In addition to the completed background check, Wray also claimed the FBI issued a partial report on Porter in March at passed on additional information about him in November after the White House requested a follow up inquiry.

At the daily briefing on Tuesday, Sanders was asked by reporters how Wray’s testimony that Porter’s background check was complete squared with her prior claim the procedure was ongoing. Sanders said “both” were true because the FBI passed along its reports to the White House Personnel Security Office, which still “had not finished” its own review.

“The White House Personnel Office staffed by career officials received information last year and what they considered to be the final background investigation report in November, but they had not made a final recommendation for adjudication to the White House because the process was still ongoing when Rob Porter resigned,” Sanders said.

According to Sanders, the Personnel Security Office believed the report submitted by the FBI “required significant additional investigatory field work.”

The source familiar with White House personnel procedures told Yahoo News that it’s possible the personnel office received the report from the FBI and decided to “keep kicking the decision down the road.” However, they said this would be unlikely and “pretty reckless” for them to receive that information without notifying White House staff close to the president because Porter’s problems could have compromised him as a “source of extortion.”

“Even if Mr. Porter denied everything, it’s still a vulnerability to the president,” the source said.

At the briefing, Sanders declined to address questions about how the White House’s prior claims that top officials only discovered the allegations against Porter when they were reported in the press. The source who spoke to Yahoo News said it would be extremely unusual if no one at the White House was aware of issues with Porter after the FBI completed its report.

“Someone in the White House would have had to have known,” the source said. “The White House personnel office is the White House. They’re saying the left hand didn’t talk to the right hand.”

It would be especially odd, the source went on to say, if the chief of staff and White House counsel had not been informed at all about the allegations against Porter. They explained that these top White House officials would likely be regularly inquiring why someone in a sensitive role was still using an interim security clearance. While staffers have interim clearances in the early days of an administration, the source said that while the process of obtaining one is thorough, it’s usually completed quickly due to the importance of security issues.

The source also claimed that, in past administrations, the counsel would have been involved in the hiring of a staff secretary throughout the process, including sitting in on interviews. They said the White House counsel’s office typically communicates with the personnel office throughout the hiring process on the “handful of senior staff positions.”

“There is an individual in the White House counsel’s office who has the function of being clearance counsel. That’s all they do,” the source said.

While the clearance counsel is typically more focused on political appointees outside the White House, the office usually engages in the vetting of candidates for senior West Wing staff, the source said. They stressed that it would be “highly irregular” that neither the FBI or the personnel office would have notified the counsel about a “flag” in Porter’s file that could have been “existential” to his ability to get a clearance.

“The whole thing is a little bit crazy,” the source said. “And by the way, crazy can happen, I guess, but that is a tough narrative to hold on to.”
