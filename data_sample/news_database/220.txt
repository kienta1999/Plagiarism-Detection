Rome was greeted on Monday morning by its first snowfall in six years.

With 1.2 to 1.6 inches on the ground, the mayor of the Italian capital, Virginia Raggi, ordered public schools closed and many private schools followed suit. Authorities opened several train stations as emergency shelters for the homeless.

The uncharacteristic weather for the city stems from a massive cold front moving over Europe, dubbed by much of British media as “The Beast From the East.” The chilly temperatures span from the U.K. to Moscow, and nearly five feet of snow has fallen in areas of Croatia.

A car carrying Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven skidded into a guardrail north of Stockholm during a blizzard, but no one was hurt.

The cold snap is expected to continue for the next few days, peaking on Thursday, U.K. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell told CNN.

The wintery scenes in Rome have made for gorgeous pictures in photos and videos that have been cropping up all over, with the city’s most scenic and historical locales ― the Colosseum, the Vatican, etc. ― often serving as the backdrop.

Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire, a war monitor said on Monday.

Health authorities in opposition-run eastern Ghouta said late on Sunday that several people had suffered symptoms consistent with chlorine gas exposure, killing one child, after an explosion.

“Eastern Ghouta cannot wait, it is high time to stop this hell on earth,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, calling for the implementation of the 30-day ceasefire sought by the Security Council.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has steadily clawed back control of areas where his opponents rose up against his rule in 2011. Eastern Ghouta is the last major insurgent stronghold near Damascus, the seat of his power.

The bombardment of eastern Ghouta over the past week has been one of the heaviest of Syria’s seven-year war, killing at least 522 people in seven days, according to a toll compiled by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor.

It said two bodies had been pulled from the rubble of a home destroyed by an air strike in the Ghouta town of Douma, with seven others from the same family dead underneath.

The U.N. Security Council, including Russia, approved the resolution demanding a 30-day truce on Saturday. The intensity of the bombardment has diminished since then but has still killed two dozen people, the Observatory said.

Rebel shelling has caused 36 deaths and a number of injuries in Damascus and nearby rural areas in the last four days, Zaher Hajjo, a government health official, told Reuters.

In eastern Ghouta, people were making use of the relative lull in the bombardment to find provisions, said Moayad Hafi, a rescue worker based there.

“There is less bombardment relative to recent days. Civilians rushed from their shelters to get food and return quickly since the warplanes are still in the sky and can hit at any moment,” he told Reuters in a voice message.

Iran’s military chief of staff said on Sunday that pro-Damascus forces would press ahead with the offensive in the Damascus suburbs, saying the ceasefire did not cover parts of the Damascus suburbs “held by the terrorists”.

The main rebel factions in eastern Ghouta are Jaish al-Islam and Failaq al-Rahman. Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadist groups including the former al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front, also has a presence there.

ACCUSATIONS OF CHEMICAL USE

Syrian state television reported that army units had directed strikes and advanced against militants near Harasta in eastern Ghouta. State news agency SANA also reported that the army had stopped a car bomb being driven into Damascus.

The Nusra Front has consistently been excluded from ceasefires in Syria, and the opposition says the government has used this as an excuse to keep up its bombardments.

The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons in the war, which will soon enter its eighth year having killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced half of Syria’s pre-war population from their homes.

Russia, which backs the Assad government, accused rebels of preparing to use toxic agents in eastern Ghouta so they could later accuse Damascus of employing chemical weapons.

In recent weeks, the United States has accused Syria of repeatedly using chlorine gas as a weapon. Rebel-held areas of the Ghouta region were hit in a major chemical attack in 2013.

Last year, a joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found the Syrian government was responsible for an April 4, 2017, attack using the banned nerve agent sarin in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, killing dozens.

The inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.

Elsewhere in Syria an air strike by the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State killed 25 people - more than half of them women and children - in the militant group’s last enclave on the Euphrates River in Syria, the Observatory said on Monday.Rachel Azaria, the lawmaker who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement she agreed to delay the committee’s discussion by a week so that “we could work with the churches” to try to resolve the dispute.

The churches’ protest was also aimed at the recent cancellation by Israel’s Jerusalem municipality of a tax exemption it has granted to church-owned commercial properties in the city.

“This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe,” the church leaders said.ABUJA (Reuters) - One hundred and ten girls are missing after an attack on a school in northeast Nigeria by suspected Boko Haram insurgents, the information ministry said on Sunday, in what may be one of the largest abductions since the Chibok kidnappings of 2014.

The Islamist militant group attained international notoriety after abducting more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok. That case drew global attention to the insurgency and spawned high profile social media campaign Bring Back Our Girls.

Boko Haram, whose name translates as “Western education is forbidden” in the Hausa language widely spoken in northern Nigeria, has killed more than 20,000 people and forced two million to flee their homes in a violent insurgency that began in 2009.

President Muhammadu Buhari, the 75-year-old former military ruler elected in 2015 after vowing to crush Boko Haram, has described the disappearance of the girls after Monday’s attack in the town of Dapchi, Yobe state, as a “national disaster”.

The insurgents drove into the town of Dapchi on Monday and attacked the girls’ school, sending hundreds of students fleeing. Some of the attackers were camouflaged, with witnesses stating that a number of students thought they were soldiers.

“The federal government has confirmed that 110 students of the Government Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State, are so far unaccounted for, after insurgents believed to be from a faction of Boko Haram invaded their school on Monday,” the information ministry said in a statement.

There had been confusion over the number of those missing, with estimates ranging from about 50 to more than 100. State police, Yobe government and others had given different figures while a parent representing families of girls who disappeared on Friday told Reuters 105 were missing.

Yobe state government added to the confusion when it said on Wednesday that dozens of the girls had been rescued, only to issue a statement the next day saying the schoolgirls were mostly still unaccounted for, sparking anger among locals.

The Nigerian Air Force on Sunday said the chief of air staff had “directed the immediate deployment of additional air assets and Nigerian Air Force personnel to the northeast with the sole mission of conducting day and night searches for the missing girls”.

“The renewed efforts at locating the girls are being conducted in close liaison with other surface security forces.”

Information Minister Lai Mohammed, who was part of a delegation of ministers who met parents and teachers in Dapchi and announced the number of missing girls, also said police and security officials had been deployed to schools in the state.Pennsylvania is all but certain to finally have a woman in its 20-member congressional delegation next year.

Right now, Pennsylvania is the largest state without a woman in either the House or the Senate. The state’s never had a female senator, and the last woman to serve in its 18-member House contingent was Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a Democrat who retired in 2015.

But Tuesday’s primaries brought big wins for women politicians in Pennsylvania. In the newly drawn 5th Congressional District, Republican Pearl Kim will face Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon in November, meaning that barring an unforeseen circumstance, at least one woman will be going to Congress from the state in 2019.

The 5th district seat is being vacated by Rep. Pat Meehan (R), who announced he would be resigning after one of his female staffers accused him of sexually harassing her. Six women ran in the 10-candidate Democratic primary, more than in any other House district in the country. The seat leans Democratic.

Kim is a former state prosecutor and Scanlon is a public interest lawyer.

State Rep. Madeleine Dean (D) won in the 4th Congressional District, which is considered a safe Democratic seat.

Elsewhere in the Keystone state, Democrats Chrissy Houlahan (6th Congressional District) and Susan Wild (7th Congressional District) won their primaries. They will face off against male Republicans for seats that Democrats are targeting to flip.

Pennsylvania also lags behind in its female representation at the state government level, with women comprising just 19 percent of the members of its legislature.Oprah Winfrey is continuing to rally behind the young survivors of this month’s deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, calling them “warriors of the light” and comparing them to the activists of the civil rights movement.

Winfrey made that powerful comparison on Saturday when asked about the students’ determination to end gun violence in schools and push for stricter firearm regulation following the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead.

“It’s a proud moment; it’s an evolving moment for our country,” she told The Associated Press of the students’ persistence for change. “These young people get to be literally warriors of the light.”

Similar determination for change, Winfrey noted, was seen in the 1950s and ’60s during the civil rights movement.

“Young people said, ‘We will not tolerate what our ancestors have tolerated. We’ve had enough and we’re willing to fight for it and we’re willing to march in the streets for it and, if necessary, die for it,’” Winfrey said.

Winfrey said she hasn’t decided whether she will attend the March 24 March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington that the students are organizing. She said she wants the students to “be the leaders of this march.”

“You want to hear from them,” she said. “This is their march.”

She said she will do whatever she can to support them.

Winfrey, who made her comments while promoting the film “A Wrinkle in Time,” said last week that she would donate $500,000 to the students’ march.Chance the Rapper is defending comedian Mo’Nique in her battle with Netflix over wage equality.

In January, Mo’Nique called for people to boycott Netflix. She said the streaming service revealed “gender bias and color bias” when it offered her millions of dollars less for a comedy special than it gave other comedians for their performances.

“I’m with Mo’Nique,” the Chicago rapper stated in a series of tweets Saturday. He highlighted Mo’Nique’s clout and accomplishments, declaring that the Oscar-winning actress and other black women “deserve better.”

Im with Mo’Nique. — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) February 24, 2018

Black women, you deserve better. — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) February 24, 2018

He also shared his support on Instagram with a photo of Mo’Nique, demanding that Hollywood “give her her coin” in the caption.

A post shared by Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) on Feb 24, 2018 at 1:34pm PST

Last month, Mo’Nique claimed that Netflix offered her only $500,000 for a stand-up special while Amy Schumer received $11 million (and then negotiated a bit more) and Chris Rock and Dave Chapelle each got $20 million for their own specials.

Mo’Nique called for the boycott of the streaming service to last until black women are paid fairly for their work. Comedian Wanda Sykes tweeted in support of the boycott at the time.

.@moworldwide, thank you for speaking out. @netflix offered me less than half of your $500k. I was offended but found another home. #EPIX — Official Wanda Sykes (@iamwandasykes) January 21, 2018

As critics debated whether Netflix’s offer was fair, Mo’Nique posted a screenshot of an email that appeared to be the offer on Instagram. The email shown states that the deal would constrain the star’s usage of the material in the special for two years and deals for future stand-up specials for at least one year. Her 2006 special, “I Coulda Been Your Cellmate,” is currently available on the service.

A Netflix spokesperson told Variety the company doesn’t “comment on contract negotiations.”

Mo’Nique has said she has been “blackballed” by the entertainment industry since her 2010 Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress in “Precious.”

She said she fulfilled her obligations for her contract on the film, but the industry lashed back at her after she didn’t join additional appearances related to the film.

Mo’Nique recently went on both “The View” and Power 105.1′s “The Breakfast Club” to defend her stance on Netflix and status in the industry. In both interviews, she pointed out the barriers she has faced because she refused to play the game.The largely unsuccessful push to ban bump stocks, the device the Las Vegas shooter used to maximize casualties, is a cautionary tale for those who think the killing of 17 at a Florida high school might prompt states to enact tougher gun laws.

Gun rights supporters rally in Olympia, Washington, against several gun-control bills, including a ban on bump stocks, being considered by the Washington state Legislature. Lawmakers in at least 30 states introduced legislation to ban bump stocks in the wake of the Las Vegas mass shooting last October, but only two have been approved. Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press

In the wake of the Las Vegas concert massacre last fall, lawmakers in at least 30 states introduced legislation to ban “bump stocks,” which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons and which were used by the gunman. Only two of the bills passed.

President Donald Trump this week said he’ll direct the Department of Justice to outlaw bump stocks nationwide. But the lack of state action on a device that allowed one man to shoot more than 500 people in a quarter-hour serves as a cautionary tale for those who think the latest tragedy — the killing of 17 at a high school in Florida — might finally prompt states to enact tougher gun laws.

In fact, the Florida House voted not to move ahead on a proposed ban on assault-style weapons just days after the school shooting with an AR-15 — as tearful students from the school looked on from the House gallery.

As Congress continues to resist taking action to restrict firearms — and the National Rifle Association suggests arming more teachers as an answer — some are looking to state legislatures for change. This week, high school students and others in Florida, Georgia, Colorado and North Carolina marched on state capitols to demand more restrictions.

Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he expects that states will take some action on firearms, perhaps pairing some tighter gun regulations with other measures that make it easier to own a weapon.

Following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, for example, the state of Oregon closed the gun-show loophole that allowed people to buy guns in private sales or at gun shows without background checks. But it also made it easier for people with concealed-carry permits for guns to prove they have the right to carry them.

“Politicians make deals,” Webster said. “They are appealing to fear. One group feels more comfortable with more regulations and the other feels more comfortable with a gun at their side. I suspect something like that will happen in Florida.”

After the Florida high school shooting, areas of possible action include increasing the age at which residents are allowed to buy semi-automatic weapons and tightening restrictions on gun ownership for those with mental health issues.

But the bump-stock debate over the past few months illustrates how difficult it will be for gun-control advocates to enact other changes state by state. The challenge goes beyond the National Rifle Association, which is among the top outside-money spenders on the federal level and wields significant influence in statehouses. In each state, gun control supporters must navigate labyrinths of special interests, geography and partisan politics in order to succeed.

That was the case in Massachusetts and New Jersey — two Northern, relatively liberal states with Republican governors but Democratic legislatures — that approved bump-stock bans late last year. Outgoing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, signed the legislation just before he left office, without comment.

In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, also a Republican, allowed his lieutenant governor, Karyn Polito, to sign the bill, also with no comment. The governor’s office later issued a statement that the two leaders support the “Second Amendment to the Constitution and Massachusetts’ strict gun laws.”

Advocates for the bump-stock bans were successful in those two states because the NRA is not particularly strong in either one, said Adam Winkler, author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,” and a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. And, in the case of New Jersey, Christie had nothing to fear from the gun lobby because he was on his way out.

The strength of the NRA and other gun groups, Winkler said, is that its supporters vote on guns as a single issue and turn out to vote. The gun-control community, by contrast, is not as single-minded, he said. He and others suggested that might be changing with the grass-roots movements that are developing after the Florida high school shooting.

“The student involvement is remarkable,” said Kristin Goss, a Duke University professor of public policy and author of “Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America.”

“Their involvement at critical-mass levels,” she said, “and their formal incorporation into national gun control organizations, is probably the most significant development on the pro-regulation side that I’ve seen since I began studying this issue two decades ago.”

Days after high school students demonstrated in his state, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam told Stateline early Friday that he would support a ban on bump stocks. There’s such a bill pending in his state Legislature.

Still, political analyst Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said recent mobilization of high school students is important — but not game-changing — because of the political entrenchment regarding guns.

“The parties are in their foxholes on so many issues, and this is a basic issue,” he said. “People think Republicans will be crawling out of their foxholes, and making their way across the DMZ to visit the Democrats. It’s not going to happen.”

In Virginia, for example, a House subcommittee in late January defeated a bump-stock ban, along with several other gun-control bills, on a party line 4-2 vote with Republicans in the majority, despite testimony from a state resident who had survived October’s Las Vegas shooting.

The subcommittee chairman, Republican Del. Thomas Wright of Amelia County, said that while he was sympathetic to the survivor, he did not think banning bump stocks was the answer.

“Until the evil in people’s hearts changes, the laws we pass cannot fix that,” he told a local news outlet.

Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, suggested that Trump’s support for a ban on bump stocks would be “helpful” but not necessarily enough in the states.

A bump-stock ban passed in the Washington state Senate, but it may not pass the House, where opponents argue it amounts to a path to “gun seizure.” Proposed bump-stock bans failed in Mississippi and New Mexico, states with high rates of gun ownership, according to a 2015 analysis published in the journal Injury Prevention. They already were illegal in California before the Las Vegas massacre.

Other states weighing bump-stock bans include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Wisconsin.

Consider Georgia, where Democratic Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver introduced a bill last fall to ban bump stocks. The bill is still pending. Gun regulation supporters marched on the Georgia Capitol in recent days, but the outlook for stiffer regulation there is still bleak.

Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry, the predominant gun-rights group in the state, said he does not believe that there will be changes to gun laws this year. Henry said group members work to contact every state representative and senator each year to push their issue, demonstrating their single-minded commitment. Henry said they are less about giving money and more about personal contacts, reminding lawmakers of their presence.

Notably, the Pew Research Center (the Pew Charitable Trusts also funds Stateline) found last year that about 21 percent of gun owners have contacted a public official about gun policy, while just 12 percent of non-gun owners have.

“We do represent people who strongly believe in the Second Amendment,” Henry said. “If you start giving up one right, even a portion of a right, you will eventually lose all of them.”

Florida has some of the most lax gun laws in the nation, and legislators resisted efforts to tighten them after earlier shooting tragedies, including the massacre at an Orlando nightclub in 2016. The only laws Florida has passed recently are ones to expand concealed-carry rights or further loosen gun regulations.

Nevertheless, after high school students demonstrated and met with lawmakers in the past few days, the Florida House and Senate are readying a package of gun bills.

Those efforts include raising the minimum age to obtain and buy assault-style rifles from 18 to 21, providing more mental health counselors and security at schools, and enacting a waiting period for semi-automatic weapons purchases.On Monday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled prior decisions and said that a worker’s sex is necessarily a factor in discrimination based on sexual orientation. Lucy Nicholson / Reuters

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in Manhattan on Monday ruled that a federal law banning sex bias in the workplace also prohibits discrimination against gay employees, becoming only the second court to do so.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled prior decisions and said that a worker’s sex is necessarily a factor in discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The ruling went against a court brief filed by the Trump administration in 2017 that said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not intended to provide protections to gay workers.

The 2nd Circuit revived a lawsuit by the estate of Donald Zarda, a former skydiving instructor who said he was fired after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. Zarda’s estate was backed in the appeal by dozens of large companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, CBS Corp and Viacom Inc.

Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident after the lawsuit was filed.

Zarda’s former employer, Altitude Express Inc, and companies that have faced similar lawsuits have argued that when Congress adopted Title VII more than 50 years ago, it did not consider whether the law’s ban on sex bias included discrimination based on sexual orientation.

But lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender groups and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have increasingly argued that sexual orientation is a function of a person’s gender.

The 2nd Circuit agreed on Monday in its 10-3 decision.

Last April, the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit became the first court to find that Title VII bans gay bias in the workplace.

The U.S. Supreme Court in December declined to take up a different case out of Georgia that posed the same question.The Weinstein Company reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy protection after last-ditch talks to sell the studio collapsed.

The company board of directors said late Sunday that bankruptcy is the only “viable option” after negotiations “concluded without a signed agreement,” according to Reuters. The board said it “has no choice but to pursue the only viable option to maximize the company’s remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process.”

The move comes months after the departure of chairman and co-founder Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused by more than 70 women of sexual misconduct, including rape.

The board had been in talks to sell the Weinstein Company to an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet and backed by billionaire investor Ronald Burkle for $500 million. That deal was derailed in early February, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing the Weinstein Company of “repeatedly” turning a blind eye to the sexual harassment allegations against its co-founder.

According to Variety, a deal still seemed possible as of Wednesday, when Schneiderman met with Contreras-Sweet and members of the Weinstein Company board in Manhattan.

On Sunday, however, the Weinstein Company board broke off the talks.

“We must conclude that your plan to buy this company was illusory and would only leave this Company hobbling toward its demise to the detriment of all constituents,” the board said in a letter to Burkle and Contreras-Sweet, according to Variety. “Despite your previous statements, it is simply impossible to avoid the conclusion that you have no intention to sign an agreement ― much less to close one ― and no desire to save valuable assets and jobs.”Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is seen in the House chamber during President Donald Trump's State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on January 30, 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court appeared divided along ideological lines on Monday in a high-stakes case that could deprive unions representing police, firefighters and certain other public employees of a key source of funds ― millions of dollars in fees they can collect annually from non-members.

During about an hour of arguments, conservative justices appeared sympathetic to the challenge brought by anti-union groups arguing that the fees that workers who are not members of public-sector unions must pay to help cover the costs of collective bargaining with state and local governments violate workers’ free speech rights.

Liberal justices asked questions indicating support for maintaining the fees.

The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court’s newest justice and the likely deciding vote, did not speak during the argument.

Fellow conservatives Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito were particularly forceful in questioning the lawfulness of the fees, based on the notion that collective bargaining is in essence a political activity. Unions argue that their political activity is separate from negotiating contracts.

“Does this case affect the political influence of unions?” Kennedy asked union lawyer David Frederick.

“Yes,” Frederick said.

“Isn’t that the end of this case?” Kennedy said.

Liberal Justice Elana Kagan stressed how disruptive a ruling against the unions would be, leading to thousands of labor contracts being renegotiated and striking down laws in more than 20 states.

“When have we ever done something like that?” Kagan asked.

Dueling groups of protesters gathered outside the white marble courthouse ahead of the scheduled one-hour argument.

Union-backed protesters held signs saying “America needs union jobs,” while those supporting the challengers had signs saying “stand with Mark,” a reference to the plaintiff in the case, Illinois state worker Mark Janus.

Two dozen states require payment of these so-called agency fees, covering roughly 5 million public-sector workers. A Supreme Court ruling disallowing these fees would deal a setback to American organized labor at a time when the movement already is in a reduced state compared to the past.

Depriving unions of agency fees could undermine their ability to spend in political races. They typically back Democratic candidates over Republicans.

SIMILAR CASE IN 2016

The justices considered a similar case in 2016, and after hearing arguments appeared poised to overturn a 1977 Supreme Court precedent that let unions force non-members covered by contracts negotiated by organized labor to pay fees in lieu of union dues to help cover non-political union expenditures.

But the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia the following month left the court with an even split of conservatives and liberals, and its 4-4 decision in March 2016 failed to settle the legal question. The Monday’s argument did not illuminate whether Gorsuch will, as expected, join his conservative colleagues in ruling against the unions.

Republican President Donald Trump’s appointment of Gorsuch last year restored the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

The 2016 case was brought by non-union California public school teachers. Janus, the plaintiff in the current case, is a child-support specialist for the state of Illinois who opted not to join the union that represents employees like him, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).

In both cases, the challengers argued that being forced to pay the agency fees to unions whose views they may not share violates their rights to free speech and free association under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.

Unions in both cases contended that mandatory agency fees are needed in order to eliminate the problem of what they call “free riders” ― non-members who benefit from union representation, for example through salary and working conditions obtained in collective bargaining ― without actually paying for it.

More than a hundred people loudly demonstrated outside the courthouse.

Jeralee Smith, a retired teacher, came out to support Janus in the case. “To force a person to pay for something with which we disagree is a travesty for democracy,” she said.

Dexter Guptill, a computer support technician for the American Federation of Teachers, said that if the justices rule against the unions, “my co-workers would wind up being forced to spend their effort representing essentially free riders.”

Twenty-four states have agency fee requirements. While 28 states have so-called right-to-work laws that prohibit mandatory agency fees, Wisconsin and Michigan have exceptions for police officers and firefighters that permit agency fees covering those workers. In those right-to-work states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower.

Federal employee unions cannot collect agency fees.WASHINGTON ― In a major setback for the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a lawsuit over the future of an Obama-era program that protects so-called Dreamers from deportation.

The decision all but ensures that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will remain in effect for recipients after the March 5 deadline originally set by the White House. It also takes some of the pressure off Congress to act to pass its own legislation to protect young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, something lawmakers have repeatedly failed to do.

President Donald Trump rescinded DACA in September, putting its nearly 700,000 recipients at risk of losing two-year deportation relief and work permits. He said he wanted to put in place permanent protections for Dreamers, but demanded major policy changes on legal immigration, asylum seekers and border security that senators rejected earlier this month.

The Trump administration has the power to end DACA, which President Barack Obama had implemented through executive action. But a spate of lawsuits in California and New York have argued that the White House flouted procedures required by federal law and violated the equal protection rights of DACA recipients.

Several lawsuits filed in the Northern District of California were consolidated into one and resulted in the first nationwide, preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from ending the DACA program while the lawsuit proceeds. The order, issued in January, requires U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to keep processing DACA renewals for people who have been approved for the program in the past, but doesn’t require them to process first-time applications.

The Trump administration appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, but also took the unusual step of asking the Supreme Court to immediately consider the lawsuit rather than waiting for the appeals court to rule first.

White House spokesman Raj Shah responded to the Supreme Court’s decision Monday by criticizing the California judge who issued the injunction reopening the DACA program. He said the administration “fully expect[s] to prevail” in the end, and said the program “is clearly unlawful.”

“The district judge’s decision to unilaterally re-impose a program that Congress had explicitly and repeatedly rejected is a usurpation of legislative authority,” Shah said in a statement. “The fact that this occurs at a time when elected representatives in Congress are actively debating this policy only underscores that the district judge has unwisely intervened in the legislative process.”

The Supreme Court’s decision Monday concerned the California lawsuit. A separate judge issued a nationwide injunction earlier this month based on another lawsuit, this one heard in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York.

Congress has thus far been unable or unwilling to pass legislation to help Dreamers, though lawmakers in both parties claim they want to fix the issue. The Senate voted down multiple proposals this month, with Trump’s plan garnering the least support of all.

The House hasn’t taken up any legislation. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has repeatedly said he will bring up a bill the president would sign ― signaling that he might not allow votes on measures that lack Trump’s explicit endorsement.

Ryan told reporters earlier this month that the March 5 deadline was “not as important as it was before, given the court rulings.” However, he said, “I think this place works better with deadlines, and we want to operate on deadlines.”WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump insists he will unilaterally ban “bump stocks,” the gun accessory used to simulate automatic fire, even if lawmakers decline to take up the issue.

“I’m writing that out myself. I don’t care if Congress does it or not. I am writing it out myself,” Trump said Monday at an event with state governors at the White House.

A gunman used weapons retrofitted with bump stocks to kill 58 people and injure more than 500 others at a country music festival in Las Vegas last year. Last week, after a high school mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take steps to ban the firearm accessories.

It’s doubtful, however, whether the Trump administration can outlaw something that may not be subject to regulations in the first place.

The Department of Justice has said congressional action would be needed to regulate sales of the gun modifications. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is already exploring the possibility of regulating bump stocks, in 2010 and again in 2012 said it does not have the authority to regulate firearm parts and accessories under current law because they are not considered “machine guns.”

The administration may decide to write a regulation simply deeming firearm accessories like bump stocks as parts of illegal “machine guns.” But such a move would likely draw legal challenges.

The gunman who opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida used an AR-15 assault-style rifle to kill 17 and wound others. The weapon was not modified with a bump stock, officials said.

Several GOP lawmakers last week expressed interest in banning bump stocks, as well as toughening gun background checks, in the wake of the Parkland shooting.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), a chief sponsor of a bipartisan bill that would strengthen the national background check system, said he supports using legislation to address bump stocks.

“It may be as simple as just providing explicit authority to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to regulate bump stocks,” Cornyn said Friday.

A law permanently banning bump stocks outright is opposed by groups like the National Rifle Association. The nation’s largest gun lobby has said it would rather see the matter addressed via existing regulations.

Trump told a bipartisan gathering of governors on Monday not to worry about the NRA because “they’re on our side.” The president also expressed confidence bump stocks would be banned.Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a senior adviser to the White House, said she isn’t sure if teachers should be given firearms after the massacre at a Florida high school earlier this month that left 17 people dead. But she remained open to the proposal, saying such plans were “not a bad idea.”

Trump, the mother of three young children, made the comments in an interview with NBC News that aired Sunday during her visit to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Host Peter Alexander asked Trump about her father’s recent proposal to arm some highly-trained educators to prevent school shootings. Such teachers, the president later said, would be given “a little bit of a bonus,” and the new system would help turn schools into “a hardened target.”

After Alexander asked about Trump’s support for the proposal, she said: “To be honest, I don’t know.”

“Obviously, there would have to be an incredibly high standard for who would be able to bear arms in our school,” she said. “But I think there is no one solution to creating safety.”

She continued: “I think that having a teacher who is armed, who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed,”

The Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida has launched a fervor around the notion of arming educators after President Donald Trump floated the idea during a listening session with survivors of the attack.

“A teacher would have a concealed gun on them. They’d go for special training and they would be there and you would no longer be a gun-free zone,” the president said at the event, suggesting armed teachers would be able to subdue a shooter faster than law enforcement. “You’d have a lot of people that would be armed, that’d be ready.”

The proposal, however, has drawn severe condemnation from teachers, parents and lawmakers who have argued that gun control would be a more effective means to keep school shootings from happening.

“We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators,” Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, said last week. “Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that.”

During Sunday’s interview, Alexander also asked Trump about comparisons made in the media between her and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, who was at the Opening Ceremony. She said she didn’t feel like the two were that similar.Students who survived the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month don’t blame Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for missing various red flags in the shooter’s behavior.

Even though almost every Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives has asked Gov. Rick Scott (R) to suspend Israel, high school student Brandon Abzug thinks Israel should absolutely keep his job, he told CNN’s “New Day” on Monday.

The sheriff’s office reportedly received almost 20 phone calls between 2008 and 2017 reporting concerns with shooter Nikolas Cruz, according to The Naples Daily News, including specific worries that he wished to carry out a school shooting.

“We know about this one time where they dropped the ball but we don’t know about the 999 other times where they did do things to save us,” Abzug said.

Israel isn’t the only one who should be held accountable, he continued. “It’s a whole bunch of people and we need to move forward and make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” he added.

Scott is the one who should bear the responsibility since he ultimately oversees Israel, argued another shooting survivor, David Hogg. The governor ordered an investigation into law enforcement’s response to the shooting on Sunday.

“Just like the president is the boss of the FBI, Gov. Rick Scott is essentially the boss of Scott Israel, the sheriff,” Hogg said Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” And as such, he should be held accountable. He can’t just blame the bureaucracy and expect to get re-elected.”

He doesn’t blame law enforcement in general, he added, but laments the fact that a handful of individuals “did not conduct their job correctly.”

Israel attempted to defend himself on Sunday, fielding questions from angry news anchors.Donald Glover’s latest film “Solo: A Star Wars Story” hasn’t even been released, but his character is already stirring talk of his own spin-off.

Glover portrays Lando Calrissian in the film, a role originated in the original “Star Wars” trilogy by Billy Dee Williams, and has received much praise for his performance already.

Talk that Glover-as-Lando’s journey might continue was stirred on Wednesday, when French publication Premiere reported that Lucasfilm studio chief Kathleen Kennedy said Lando will get a spin-off.

“We think that the next spin-off will be dedicated to Lando Calrissian,” Premiere quoted Kennedy as saying. “Of course, there are still many stories to tell about Han and Chewbacca, but Lando will be next.”

The publication later adjusted its article with the note: “Lucasfilm informs us that there would have been a misunderstanding between our journalist and Kathleen Kennedy.” Her comment should have read, “We would love to tell a story about Lando Calrissian one day, but it’s not relevant,” Premiere wrote.

The next “Star Wars” film is slated to be 2019′s “Episode IX.”

LOIC VENANCE via Getty ImagesMichael Feldman and Michael Rachlis don’t want to redefine marriage, but they’ll happily give traditional unions a satirical spin.

The actor-comedians wrote and star in “Michael and Michael Are Gay,” a new web series that explores what marriage looks like for two “lovable, sex-positive” gay men in the 21st century. The men dropped the series’ debut episode, “Threesome Night,” on Tuesday. The clip, which can be viewed above, finds the couple’s attempts to invite a third man into their bedroom ending on a decidedly unsexy note. (Warning: As you really should expect, the episode contains graphic language.)

Feldman and Rachlis, who are based in Los Angeles, told HuffPost they felt inspired to explore “the expectations [of] what a marriage should be” after they tied the knot in 2015. Although “Michael and Michael Are Gay” is loosely based on their own experiences, they stress that their onscreen characters are “exaggerated versions of ourselves,” with a “magnifying glass on each of our flaws and neuroses.”

The result, they said, is a bit like “Broad City” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” ― with a queer twist, of course.

A post shared by Michael Rachlis (@michaelrachlis) on Feb 12, 2018 at 1:47pm PST

“We were so excited to start this new chapter of our lives together being both in love and unapologetically ourselves,” the men said in an email. After three years of domestic life, they discovered that “marriage, and the way you express your commitment, means a lot of different things to different couples. And a lot of straight couples feel that way, too.”

“So that became a big part of our mission with the show ― to open up people’s minds to what makes a ‘model’ marriage ― whether you’re gay or straight,” they said.

The men hope to pick up where “Threesome Night” leaves off by expanding “Michael and Michael Are Gay” into a full season of six episodes, and they’ve launched an online fundraiser to finance the production. They’re mostly tight-lipped on what viewers can expect from the remaining five episodes, but a Feb. 16 teaser features cameos by “EastSiders” stars Kit Williamson and John Halbach, as well as YouTube comic Michael Henry.

In real life, Feldman and Rachlis have an open relationship and “don’t want to apologize for the way we construct our marriage.”“Black Panther,” on its second week in theaters, just surpassed $700 million worldwide at the box office.

The Marvel blockbuster earned $108 million over the past weekend in the United States and Canada. Behind “Black Panther” ― way behind ― was “Game Night,” starring Rachel McAdams and Jason Bateman, which grossed $16.6 million in its debut weekend.

Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said last week that “Black Panther” is the best film the company has ever made. The movie maintains a 97 percent critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva appeared in an Instagram video this month wearing a sweatshirt declaring “I don’t do doping.”

Three days later, she tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. Sergeeva denied taking the drug that triggered the positive result.

The video showing Sergeeva wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, “I don’t do doping. I am ZASPORT,” a reference to the official clothing supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee, has since been deleted from Instagram, according to The Guardian.

The clip was reportedly posted to Instagram on Feb. 15 by Russia-based videographer Roman Bibishev. ABC News said the video was produced last year to promote the clothing brand.

Sergeeva was spotted in a similar shirt in Pyeongchang earlier this month. The Associated Press said she wore a white T-shirt with the words “I Don’t Do Doping” under her racing suit during a training session.

Sergeeva — who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event in Pyeongchang — tested positive for an angina medication with performance-enhancing properties on Feb. 18, the Russian bobsleigh federation announced on its Facebook page. She passed a drug test five days earlier.

Sergeeva denied taking the drug. The federation’s president, Alexander Zubkov, said the athlete had not been prescribed any medication.

Sergeeva was the second Russian athlete to fail a doping test at the Pyeongchang Games. Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic curler, was forced to return his bronze medal last week after testing positive for meldonium, a potential performance-enhancing drug.

The International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Games over its state-backed doping program, but allowed a group of athletes to compete under the Olympic flag.LGBTQ rights groups are speaking out against Australia’s new deputy prime minister, who expressed homophobic views during his years as a newspaper editor.

Michael McCormack was chosen by the Nationals ― the junior partner in the governing Liberal-National coalition ― to take over as party leader and deputy prime minister from Barnaby Joyce. Joyce, who had been in office for less than three months, resigned Friday after confirming he’d had an affair with a former staff member, Vicky Campion, who is pregnant.

Though McCormack isn’t as high-profile as Joyce, a disturbing editorial he wrote during his time as a newspaper editor has resurfaced on social media in the wake of his accession.

The 1993 article, which McCormack wrote while serving as editor for Wagga Wagga’s Daily Advertiser, appeared to blame the “sordid behavior” of gay people for the HIV/AIDS crisis.

Needless to say, LGBTQ rights advocates in Australia and around the world quickly condemned McCormack’s words.

The Guardian points out that McCormack has apologized for the piece, which sparked several complaints to the Australian Press Council, on more than one occasion.

McCormack voted in favor of same-sex marriage in Australia last year, and has said his views on the LGBTQ community have evolved in the 25 years since he wrote the piece.

“I have grown and learned not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique,” he said in August 2017.

Still, one of the country’s most prominent LGBTQ activists believes McCormack needs to “walk the talk” if he wants queer voters to look beyond his hateful rhetoric.

Agreed.



Croome: “The apologies Mr McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he may step in to, he needs to walk the talk,”

To celebrate the record-breaking success of the film, The Walt Disney Co. announced Monday that it plans to donate $1 million to the BGCA to expand the organization’s science, technology, engineering and math programs.

BGCA’s STEM Centers of Innovation give kids the chance to learn from advanced technologies like 3D printers, robotics and high-definition video production equipment.

“It is thrilling to see how inspired young audiences were by the spectacular technology in the film,” CEO Robert A. Iger said, “so it’s fitting that we show our appreciation by helping advance STEM programs for youth, especially in underserved areas of the country, to give them the knowledge and tools to build the future they want.”

The grant from Disney will be used to open 12 new STEM centers in Atlanta; Baltimore; Chicago; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Harlem, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn.; Memphis, Tenn.; Oakland, Calif.; Orlando, Fla.; Washington, D.C.; and Watts, Calif.Silent Bob was nearly silenced for good this weekend.

Kevin Smith, the acclaimed director of “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy,” suffered a massive heart attack on Sunday.

Smith, 47, announced the incident on Twitter with a selfie from his hospital bed:

After the first show this evening, I had a massive heart attack. The Doctor who saved my life told me I had 100% blockage of my LAD artery (aka “the Widow-Maker”).

Smith was slated to perform two concerts on Sunday, one at 6 p.m. and one at 9 p.m., at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, California. He felt ill in between the shows and went to the hospital where doctors saved his life.

Smith is always busy doing something creative. When he’s not writing and directing movies and TV shows, he’s performing concerts featuring spoken word stories and Q&A sessions with fans. Smith hosts and produces the reality TV series “Comic Book Men” for AMC, co-hosts numerous podcasts and hosts the new online show “The IMDb Show.” He’s also the author of “Tough Sh*t: Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good,” and the co-owner of the Red Bank, N.J., comic book store Jay and Silent Bob’s Secret Stash, which is named after two of his most famous characters.

Fans and colleagues took to social media to wish Smith a speedy recovery:

The “Last Week Tonight” host on Sunday announced that he should be Italy’s next leader.

“Italy is in turmoil and is dabbling with fascism and that should worry everyone,” Oliver said during a segment on the nation’s wild election season. “The last time they did that, they wound up with Mussolini. The, to put it nicely, Turner to Hitler’s Hooch.”

The slate of candidates was so unsettling that Oliver said the country should just choose him. It could actually do so, too. Italian law allows the nation’s ruling coalition to choose a “random jackass that Italy has never heard of” to run the country, he said. Plus, there’s no citizenship requirement in that scenario.

When asked about the allegations during an interview that aired Monday on NBC’s “Today” show, Ivanka appeared agitated and defended her father.

“I think it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he’s affirmatively stated that there’s no truth to it,” Trump told NBC’s Peter Alexander.

“I don’t think that’s a question that you would ask many other daughters,” she continued. “I believe my father. I know my father. I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father.”

At least 21 women have publicly accused President Trump of sexually harassing or assaulting them, some from as far back as the early 1980s. The accusations range from forcible kissing to groping and other unwanted sexual advances.

The president has vehemently denied all accusations of sexual misconduct.

Ivanka Trump, who has been tight-lipped about the allegations against her father, was hit with backlash last month when she tweeted in support of #TimesUp, a movement focused on eliminating inequality and sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.“My gender is something I’ve been actively questioning over the last year or so,” Amer told HuffPost. “I’ve always had the inkling that something was a little off in my pronouns and identifiers, and with nonbinary identities becoming more represented within the queer community, I felt like I finally had the language to name it. I wanted to come out to Teddy and to my audience because I felt it was important to represent that change is OK, and to show my whole authentic self to them. If I’m not being authentic and sharing myself fully, how can I expect them to do that in their lives?”WASHINGTON ― Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D) on Monday urged President Donald Trump to lay off Twitter and instead listen to Americans and back away from one of his suggestions for dealing with mass shootings.

Trump has suggested that arming 20 percent of the nation’s teachers could help prevent school shootings like the one that occurred earlier this month in Parkland, Florida, that claimed 17 lives. The president also has said that those teachers trained to use firearms could even receive extra pay.

I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening." (via ABC) pic.twitter.com/o0DKz6UyDX — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 26, 2018

Inslee directly challenged Trump as he and other governors met at the White House with the president and several senior administration aides.

“I’ve listened to the biology teachers and they don’t want to [be armed] at any percentage,” the former U.S. House member said. “I’ve listened to the first-grade teachers who don’t want to be pistol-packing first-grade teachers. I’ve listened to law enforcement, who have said they don’t want to train teachers [on firearm use]. ... Educators should educate, and they should not be foisted upon this responsibility of packing heat in first-grade classes.”

Inslee ended his remarks by saying, “So I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here, and a little more listening, and I just suggest we take [Trump’s proposal] off the table and move forward.”

Trump responded by noting that “a number of states right now” allow educators to bear arms while in the classroom.

At least eight states allow teachers in some capacity to carry guns on K-12 school campuses. But law enforcement groups and teacher organizations have expressed opposition to the president’s proposal to arm certain teachers, arguing it could lead to accidental loss of life.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s top gun lobby, thinks it would be a good move.

“Evil walks among us and God help us if we don’t harden our schools and protect our kids,” NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said last week.

The public seems divided on the matter. Fifty percent of Americans oppose allowing more teachers and school officials to carry guns, while 44 percent support the idea, according to a recent CBS News poll.

Some notable Republicans are among those opposing equipping more teachers with guns, including Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio, both of Florida.
