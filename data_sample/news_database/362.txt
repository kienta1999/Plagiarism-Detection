LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin tumbled 18 percent on Tuesday to a four-week trough close to $11,000, after reports that a ban on trading of cryptocurrencies in South Korea was still an option drove fears grew of a wider regulatory crackdown.

Bitcoin’s slide triggered a massive selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23 percent on the day, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next-biggest, Ripple, plunging 33 percent.

South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government would be coming up with a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.

South Korea had said on Monday that its plans to ban virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalized, as government agencies were still in talks to decide how to regulate the market.

Bitcoin slid on the latest news, trading as low as $11,191.59 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, down 18 percent on the day, for a short period putting the digital currency on track for its biggest one-day fall in three years.

“It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting the cryptocurrency, with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.

“But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible,” he said.

Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-biggest digital unit.

The latest tumble leaves bitcoin down more than 40 percent from the record high around $20,000 it hit in mid-December, wiping about $130 billion off its “market cap” - the unit price multiplied by the total number of bitcoins that have been released into the market.

The news from South Korea came as it emerged a senior Chinese central banker had said authorities should ban centralized trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services, according to an internal memo from a government meeting seen by Reuters.

Bloomberg reported on Monday that Chinese authorities plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralized trading.

″(It) seems like it’s uncertainty spooking the markets,...with regulations unclear,” said Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare. ”(Traders) are taking profits on the increased risk scenarios going forward.”

A director at Germany’s central bank said on Monday that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual, borderless community.Nearly 60 percent of Americans disagree with President Donald Trump’s reported comment about immigration from “shithole countries,” a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with most considering the statement to be racist.

Just over half of those polled last Thursday and Friday said they’d heard about the comment. Attention was concentrated among the president’s opponents, with more than 70 percent of Clinton voters, but just over half of Trump voters and less than 40 percent of nonvoters and third-party voters saying they were familiar with the remark.

Just over one-quarter of Americans said they agreed with the comment, while 58 percent said they disagreed. By a 20-point margin, 53 percent to 33 percent, Americans said it was racist to call African countries and Haiti “shithole countries.”

The survey question read, “According to a recent news report, President Trump asked ‘Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?’, referring to immigration from African countries and Haiti.”

The survey began the evening The Washington Post first reported on the remark, at which time the Trump administration had issued a statement that did not deny the president had made the comment. Since then, there’s been extensive back-and-forth from the White House and other meeting attendees about what, exactly, the president said, which remains in dispute.

Trump allies and others familiar with the meeting have argued, at varying times, that the president said nothing of the sort, that he actually said “shithouse,” that he used the word “shithole” to describe African countries but not Haiti, and that Trump did make the “shithole countries” comment as reported, but that the comment was acceptable.

After the story first broke, some White House staffers reportedly predicted the remark would resonate with Trump’s base, much like his earlier attacks on NFL players. But Trump voters, who enthusiastically agreed when he slammed the football protests, were somewhat less supportive of the alleged “shithole countries” remark: Sixty-two percent agreed with the statement, but only about one-third did so strongly, and 23 percent disagreed. Just 11 percent, however, considered it racist.

A near-universal 94 percent of Clinton voters disagreed with the statement, most of them citing strong disagreement, and 92 percent said they considered it racist. A slight majority of nonvoters and third-party voters said they disagreed with the statement, and about the same amount said they believed it was racist.

HuffPost

A broad majority of Americans, regardless of whom they voted for in the last election, still believe that the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, and just over half said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country. But while 84 percent of Clinton voters said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country, and just 4 percent said it’s a bad thing, Trump voters said 40 percent to 34 percent that immigration is a bad thing for the U.S. (The rest said it’s neither good nor bad, or that they were unsure.)

A closer look at opinions on different groups of immigrants to the U.S. shows little public concern over an influx of people from some of the countries Trump reportedly maligned, although Trump voters were roughly twice as likely to say Africa sends too many immigrants than to say the same about Europe.

Overall, between 36 and 41 percent polled said immigration has been too high in recent years from “Mexico and Central America,” “predominantly Muslim countries” and “the Middle East.” Under one-quarter of respondents said the same about “China, India and other parts of Asia,” or about African nations, with even fewer respondents saying the U.S. admits too many immigrants from Europe or from “predominantly Christian countries.” (A 2016 poll from PRRI and the Brookings Institution, which asked a similar question, found concerns even more substantially focused on Mexico and Central America.)

HuffPost

Just under half of the country, including three-quarters of Clinton voters and one-tenth of Trump voters, said that immigration was not too high from any of the countries or regions listed.

Pence and his wife, Karen, were guests at the Metropolitan Baptist Church, a historically black church in Largo, Maryland. The church’s pastor, Maurice Watson, told his congregation that he felt “led by God” to speak out against the president’s comments, which he called “dehumanizing” and “ugly.”

Trump reportedly told lawmakers last Thursday that he preferred immigrants from places like Norway instead of “shithole countries” like Haiti and nations in Africa ― remarks the president has subsequently denied.

Watson noted that many of his congregants come from Haiti and Africa.

“I stand today as your pastor to vehemently denounce and reject any such characterizations of the nations of Africa and of our brothers and sisters in Haiti,” Watson said as the audience stood and clapped, according to a video posted to the church’s Facebook page.

A post shared by RiShawn Biddle (@rishawnbiddle) on Jan 14, 2018 at 9:32am PST

“And I further say: Whoever made such a statement, whoever used such a visceral, disrespectful, dehumanizing adjective to characterize the nations of Africa, whoever said it, is wrong. And they ought to be held accountable.”

Local station WUSA-TV reported that Pence was red-faced during the sermon.An Oregon school district is being accused of discriminating against LGBTQ students who reported harassment.

In one case, an LGBTQ student was allegedly forced to read Bible passages as punishment from a school administrator, according to The World newspaper in Coos Bay.

The district initially denied the allegation. However, during an investigation by the Oregon Department of Education, the administrator in question and his supervisor admitted it happened.

The North Bend School District noted in a statement to The World that the alleged events occurred over the course of several years but that most “had not been brought to the district’s attention.”

“[The student] had little choice but to comply with the building administrator’s established form of punishment,” Mark Mayer, the complaint and appeals coordinator for ODE, said in a March 6 letter that revealed the allegations to the district superintendent. The district told Newsweek in a statement that it received two complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation from students but insists the Bible reading was a one-time occurrence.

Mayer says it appears the Bible was being used to punish the LGBTQ student and there was “substantial evidence to support the allegation that the district subjected LGBTQ students to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment.”

The choice of punishment also had a “chilling effect on LGBTQ students’ use of the district’s complaint process,” according to the letter.

Although the March 6 letter triggered a 30-day reconciliation period where the student and district were supposed to work out a settlement over the charges, that didn’t happen, even after an extension was granted, according to The Oregonian.

Now, the ODE will hold a hearing on May 24 to determine if the district complied with state anti-discrimination laws.

Investigators need to determine whether the Bible readings violated the students’ First Amendment rights, violated the establishment clause of the Constitution and crossed the line separating church and state.

The American Civil Liberties Union is supporting the student and involved in the case, according to a tweet it posted.

This is blatantly unconstitutional and @ACLU_OR is already on the case. https://t.co/ZL25i7Rr3Q — ACLU (@ACLU) May 10, 2018

If it is determined the administrator violated state law and discriminated against the student, the district could lose funding, have district teams banned from interschool activities and be forced to pay daily fines, according to The Oregonian.Democrat Joseph Kopser's website and candidate questionnaire contained plagiarized material from multiple outside sources. Joseph Kopser campaign

The campaign of Democrat Joseph Kopser, an Iraq War veteran and entrepreneur running to represent Texas’ 21st Congressional District, repeatedly used sentences from news sites and other sources without attribution, in several cases lifting them word for word.

As part of a response to a question about climate change in a Science Debate questionnaire, Kopser’s campaign used a sentence taken verbatim from the news site Vox.

“From 2007 to 2015, wind and solar in the US reduced SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 by 1.0, 0.6, and 0.05 million tons respectively. Reducing those local air pollutants has helped avoid an estimated 7,000 premature deaths (the central estimate in a range from 3,000 to 12,700),” read Kopser’s response.

Another response from the questionnaire that also appears on Kopser’s campaign site addressed the importance of energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs).

“ESPCs and UESCs save money and increase energy productivity; they are becoming more common in military applications in a time of dwindling budgets and resources,” it read.

The line comes directly from a blog post on the website of the Alliance to Save Energy.

On other occasions, there are extremely minor changes from the original source, like a sentence about Texas’ wind energy industry that mirrors a Wikipedia entry titled “Wind power in Texas.”

“Wind power has also created over 24,000 jobs for local communities and for the state,” a section of Kopser’s site on clean energy alternatives notes.

The original sentence from Wikipedia differs only in that it also uses the article “the” and the word “industry,” as in “the wind power industry has also created over 24,000 jobs for local communities and for the state.”

Derrick Crowe, an environmental activist running against Kopser in the Democratic primary, discovered the examples of plagiarism using the website Quetext and shared them with HuffPost.

Crowe also found dozens of more ambiguous cases, in which a majority of the words in the Kopser campaign’s sentences match those in other sources.

“You cannot copy and paste a true commitment to progressive values,” Crowe said in a statement publicizing his research. “This plagiarism is a troubling act by Joseph Kopser, and it is part of a pattern that will spell certain defeat in a general election. Democrats in this district deserve better.”

Crowe previously denounced Kopser for a Facebook event invitation that had a sentence identical to one of Crowe’s own Facebook invitations. At the bottom of the invitation, the Kopser campaign had asked invitees to “sign up for email updates at electcrowe.com/join” ― Crowe’s campaign website.

There are some very serious issues being dealt with today, but it's nice to know we must be doing something right at Team Crowe 😜 pic.twitter.com/atn5xKYw9v — Derrick Crowe (@electcrowe) July 26, 2017

Ian Rivera, a spokesman for the Kopser campaign, expressed regret for the instances of plagiarism that he said had escaped the campaign’s vetting.

“Deliberate steps were taken to prevent this from happening but, unfortunately, they were insufficient,” Rivera said.

The Kopser campaign relied on a staff of 15 volunteers to draft its detailed policy responses and used a free online service to check for plagiarism, according to Rivera.

“We’ll be shopping around for alternatives this week and we will make appropriate adjustments to the written text as formatted,” he added.

Crowe and Kopser initially got into the race to unseat Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a climate change denier who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. In November, Smith announced that he’d retire at the end of his term, ending a long stint in Congress that began in 1988.

Smith’s retirement significantly increases Democrats’ chances of winning the seat in a district that Republicans gerrymandered to include parts of Austin, San Antonio and rural areas in between.

President Donald Trump won the district by 10 percentage points. But his margin of victory was significantly smaller than Mitt Romney’s approximately 22-point win in the district in 2012.

In an ordinary year, flipping the 21st District would likely be a long shot for Democrats. However, Smith’s retirement and the higher-than-normal level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters have made the race competitive.Andy Savage, a teaching pastor at Memphis' Highpoint Church, has been placed on a leave of absence. Highpoint Church / YouTube

Chris Conlee, lead pastor at Memphis’ Highpoint Church, announced on Thursday that pastor Andy Savage was taking a “mutually agreed” upon leave of absence effective immediately.

Conlee said that while the audit is being completed, Highpoint “will continue to support Andy and his family.”

“We want to maintain trust in both Andy and our church leadership that we are not only doing things right, but we are doing right things,” Conlee said in his statement.

The decision to place Savage on leave now marks an apparent shift for the Tennessee church. On Jan. 5, Conlee said that the information about Savage’s past behavior wasn’t new to him or to Highpoint’s leadership. Still, Conlee said he had “total confidence in the redemptive process Andy went through” after the alleged assault took place.

Highpoint drew criticism online after Conlee’s support of Savage seemed to be echoed by members of his church. In a video of a Jan 5. worship service, Savage admitted to having a “sexual incident” with a high school senior more than 20 years ago. After he read out his apology, Highpoint members in the church’s front rows could be seen rising up to give Savage a standing ovation.

Informing your congregation about past sexual abuse by a church leader is not the time for standing ovations for the abuser or patronizing statements about the abused. — Boz Tchividjian (@BozT) January 11, 2018

Ed Stetzer, a writer at Christianity Today, called it the “standing ovation heard around the world.”

“No one should ever receive a standing ovation when it comes to alleged abuse—unless it’s directed at a victim with the courage to speak out,” Stetzer wrote in a piece about Highpoint.

In addition, Stetzer said that it was important for Highpoint to be truthful about Savage’s behavior. The pastor had called what happened between him and the teenager a “sexual incident.”

“It’s not an incident. It’s abuse,” Stetzer wrote.

Savage’s behavior drew national attention after Jules Woodson, the woman who alleges she was the victim of Savage’s assault, came forward with her story earlier in January. Woodson wrote about the 1998 incident on Christian blogs, saying that Savage, then a youth minister, had driven her to a private location and forced her to perform sexual acts.

Woodson has said that Savage’s apology wasn’t enough.

“Number one, he’s lying about how he handled it,” she told Memphis’s Action News 5. “He never came to me, the church told him he couldn’t talk to me and they told me I couldn’t talk to him.”

Highpoint's lead pastor Chris Conlee prays for Savage. Highpoint Church / YouTube

Highpoint Church told HuffPost that it is taking steps to examine all aspects of Savage’s ministry at the congregation and reevaluate the church’s policies on child safety.

“Highpoint Church is prayerfully considering the direction God has for ministry at Highpoint and particularly how Highpoint can be a better witness of God’s love for the hurting,” the church said in an emailed statement.

In addition to placing Savage on a leave of absence, Highpoint has also asked MinistrySafe, a legal group that seeks to help churches set up sexual abuse prevention protocols, to conduct an independent audit of the church’s current child protection practices.

Kimberlee Norris, an attorney for MinistrySafe, told HuffPost that leaders at Highpoint approached her organization for the “limited purpose of assessing and enhancing existing child protection protocols.” MinistrySafe will review current training, policies and screening practices for Highpoint ministries that serve minors, she said.

“Our consulting services to secular and ministry clients are unabashedly victim-centric,” Norris said.

“We already know that as a pastor Andy Savage betrayed the trust of a minor in his care and abused her. An audit should not be required to do the right thing and demand his resignation as pastor.”mallmo via Getty Images

Whether he’s meticulous about his beard, needs some decorations to make his space more homey, or needs a wardrobe refresh, these gifts are sure to delight him on the cheesiest day of the year.

See below for 18 Valentine’s Day gifts for him that aren’t cheesy:Serena Williams recently graced the cover of Vogue with her baby girl, Alexis Olympia, and opened up about her traumatic post-delivery experience. And a few days after sharing her story, she wrote a Facebook post.

The tennis superstar, who had to undergo an emergency C-section after her heart rate skyrocketed during delivery, faced multiple, terrifying complications after giving birth to her daughter. Williams, who has a history of blood clots, even had to advocate for herself and alert doctors that she was having a pulmonary embolism (blockage that occurs in the lungs, usually due to blood clots). Sure enough, tests showed clots in her lungs and she began treatment.

Williams’ Facebook post says she was overwhelmed at the “outpouring of discussion” from women, and black women in particular, who shared how they faced similar complications during birth and after delivering their children. She also posted an adorable video of Olympia, which sweetened the serious message.

“These aren’t just stories: according to the CDC, (Center for Disease Control) black women are over 3 times more likely than White women to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes,” Williams said. “We have a lot of work to do as a nation and I hope my story can inspire a conversation that gets us to close this gap.”

“Let me be clear: EVERY mother, regardless of race, or background deserves to have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth,” the 36-year-old said.

Williams added, “I personally want all women of all colors to have the best experience they can have My personal experience was not great but it was MY experience and I’m happy it happened to me. It made me stronger and it made me appreciate women ― both women with and without kids ― even more. We are powerful!!!”

Williams ended her message by thanking those who spoke up and shared their stories and pushed more women to discuss their own situations.

“This helps. We can help others,” she said. “Our voices are our power.”

Williams sits on the board of advisers to Oath, HuffPost’s parent company.LeBron James believes the best way to honor Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy is to continue fighting for racial equality.

In a Monday press conference, the NBA star discussed King’s memory and how America can’t let itself be divided by racism.

“You know, the state of racism will never die, but what we cannot do is allow it to conquer us as people,” he said. “We can’t allow it to divide us.”

James also called out “the leader of our country” for stoking racism, without naming President Donald Trump directly:

“The guy in control has given people and racism, and negative racism, an opportunity to be out and outspoken without fear,” James said. “And that’s the fearful thing for us, because it’s with you, and it’s around every day, but [Trump] has allowed people to just come out and feel confident about doing negative things.”

James also said that citizens have a duty to make things better.

“We all have to continue to come together and shine a brighter light on — I don’t want to use the word stupidity, but that’s basically what it comes down to.”

He added:

“We can’t allow that to stop us from continuing to be together and preach the right word of living and loving and laughing and things of that nature. Because would we want to live anywhere else? I don’t think so. We love this place.”

The NBA is playing 11 games on Monday, and James said he believes it’s a worthy tribute to the national holiday.Actress Jane Fonda said Monday she had a cancerous growth removed from her face.

At the start of an AOL Build interview to promote the fourth season of her Netflix comedy “Grace and Frankie” with Lily Tomlin, Fonda quickly addressed why she was wearing a bandage across her lower lip.

“I just had a cancer taken from my lip,” the two-time Oscar winner said about three minutes into the segment, above. “I thought it was going to heal in time before I came before you, but it’s fine. I just wanted to explain it. I don’t normally go around like this.”

Lauded for making a public appearance anyway, she responded: “Well, the world is falling apart. What’s a lip, right?”

The cast and crew behind the Netflix series “Dear White People” are honoring Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old killed by police in April 2017, with a scholarship fund.

The show’s lead actress, Logan Browning, shared a series of images on Monday when she announced the news via Instagram, writing, “His dream will live on through another deserving student, and #JordanEdwards will live on as more than just a hashtag.”

The Jordan J. Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund, to be set up at the University of Alabama ― Edwards’ dream school ― aims to carry on the teen’s legacy by providing a deserving student with better access to education. The scholarship is being offered in partnership with the Black Alumni Association and Edwards’ family.

Edwards, who dreamed of earning his degree and becoming a pilot, was gunned down by a former Texas cop, Roy Oliver, as he and a group of friends were leaving a party. Oliver shot Edwards, who was sitting in the passenger seat of his brother’s car, as the group drove away. Oliver was charged with murder and his trial is set to begin in June.

“The circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,” the scholarship’s website reads. “We will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan.”“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” got the inside scoop on President Donald Trump’s (spoof) Twitter beef with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday night.

In honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, host Jimmy Kimmel sent a camera crew to ask people to take sides in the feud (which of course wasn’t real, due to Dr. King’s death in 1968).

“I’m totally unaware of this ever being done before,” Jackson said Tuesday when asked whether such a test had ever been given to a president as part of his routine exam. “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time.”

According to Jackson, who was first appointed presidential physician in 2013 by Obama, the 71-year-old president was administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a well-known screen. Out of 30 possible points, Trump scored a full 30, and Jackson said he does not believe the president should undergo any further mental testing.

Here’s what the MoCA is all about:

1. The test typically takes 10 minutes.

Its 11 sections are designed as a quick screen for mild cognitive impairment, useful in detecting conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s. Points are earned by successfully completing each section. It’s intended to test a patient’s attention, concentration, memory, language and conceptual thinking, among other skills.

The whole test is easy to find online, although mental health professionals would prefer to administer it themselves.

2. Tasks include copying a cube, drawing a clock, remembering a series of words and repeating sentences.

During his medical evaluation, the president would have been asked to name a lion, a rhinoceros and a camel based on drawings. He would have been required to repeat the words “face,” “velvet,” “church,” “daisy” and “red” twice, and again after five minutes as a memory test.

Other tasks include repeating a sequence of three numbers backward and describing the similarity between a train and a bicycle. Sentences the president would have been asked to repeat are mildly complex, for example: “The cat always hid under the couch when dogs were in the room.”

3. It’s reliable, although not definitive.

“It’s a brief exam that assesses general cognitive function, but it lacks sensitivity to subtle cognitive decline,” according to Dr. David Knopman, chairman of the Alzheimer’s Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council and a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine.

Knopman called the test “reliable and valid,” noting that it’s been around about 10 years, but said it doesn’t tell us everything.

“Because it’s a brief examination, it is not considered a definitive assessment of cognitive function,” Knopman told HuffPost. “More detailed neuropsychological testing should be performed if there are suspicions that a person has cognitive dysfunction despite their store on the MoCA.”Shawn Colvin

“If that mockingbird don’t sing…” croons singer/songwriter Shawn Colvin on the instantly recognizable “Hush, Little Baby” from her upcoming release, The Starlighter. God, she sounds great.

The album’s 14 tracks are delicate and whimsical adaptations from the children’s book, Lullabies and Night Songs, which feature composer Alec Wilder's arrangements with the magical artwork of author/illustrator Maurice Sendak. The resulting album showcases Colvin’s gorgeous voice, which is as clear and soothing as it has ever been. Starlgihter is an exceptionally easy listen, quaint and intricate. But she’s not aiming to put you to sleep...not really.

Known as much for her exceptional musicianship as she is for her powerful lyrics, the South Dakota native was reluctant to put together something that could be billed as a children’s record. Last year she celebrated the 20th Anniversary of her landmark album, A Few Small Repairs and is already looking ahead to a new collection of original material. Then why the foray into lullabies?

The pieces from Lullabies and Night Songs that she selected for The Starlighter range from the gently shuffle of “Raisins and Almonds,” which utilizes lyrical text by Tennyson, to the glowing “Cradle Song,” with words by famed English poet William Blake.

“There wasn’t a dud among them,” she says. “But we wanted to give the record some dynamics in terms of the feel, so we made sure to choose some upbeat songs, because I sort of tend toward the melancholy, slower, more hypnotic tunes.”

On a call from Austin, Texas, where she makes her home, she muses about The Starlighter and how it was an unlikely passion project for her.

Lullaby albums are obviously not a new idea. Jewel had one out a few years ago and you yourself have put one together yourself. What inspired you to make this one?

I was asked to make a children’s record by Amazon and my first reaction was ‘no.’ I didn’t feel inspired to do that. But then I remembered the book that I used nineteen years ago to make my other lullaby record and that book is precious to me. It was given to me when I was eight-years-old. Children's songs or not, the arrangements were exquisite. I took piano since I was six and I learned to play them. They were a revelation to me. Arrangements and chord structures that I had never heard before. Sort of Copland-eqsue. Modern classical, I guess is how I would describe them. I said, if you’ll let me do the children’s album with the remaining songs on this book, I’m in.

And they were down for it?

Yeah. Totally.

Take me through the process of putting this together in the studio. How many of them were done from the way you found them? How many were done on your own terms?

There were some we did on our own terms. The song “The Cuckoo is A Pretty Bird” is kind of sad. Melancholy. It’s in a minor key. So we wanted to put together an offering or two that was just me on acoustic guitar. I think people expect that and I enjoy doing it. But by and large, we stuck to the arrangements as they were written. We only extended some of them because there were a few that were very short. I can’t play piano very well but a guy named Doug Petty, who was on tour with me about twenty years ago plays piano on the record. He also got the book when he was a kid. My challenge was to sing them. Some of them were demanding. They’re not three-chord folk songs.

What do you hope listeners take away from this album?

It’s a lullaby record, but it’s not necessarily my intention for people to fall asleep, you know? It’s beautiful. It’s calming. I think that given that it inspired me way back when, I don’t think it’s too sophisticated for kids to love. We’re going to make eight or ten videos that’ll be companion pieces to it. I hope parents and kids will be moved to listen to it again and again.

You’re about to go on tour with Lyle Lovett. Will you play these new songs live?

Not a lot of them. Maybe one or two, but I won’t have a piano with me, even if I could play them well. The show will be about Lyle’s and my history. The songs we know together. How we can really best work with each other on stage. That’ll determine what we play.

As a singer, do you write to challenge your voice?

I think I stay in a comfort zone. Every so often I push it. With standards especially and this lullaby record has a sophistication that standards have. I definitely had to dig down to get those songs right, vocally.

In the wake of the #metoo movement, as a solo female artist, have you faced sexual impropriety in your career and how did you navigate it?

Sure I’ve faced it. I didn’t have traumatic experiences, thank God. But it’s a boys club and there were insinuations of certain males in the business wanting ‘more.’ Flirtations and talking down to women because it is a boy’s club and they have power.

Is there anything you wish you could say to your younger self about that?

I don’t think so. I feel like I navigated those situations well. I was afraid to challenge them, I accepted the power system, but did my best to outsmart it. To work around it. I had people representing me that helped me because they listened to what I wanted. When the system in the record company I was at was no longer supporting me, I got out of it. When I made A Few Small Repairs and it did well, I followed that up with having a baby and that was not received well at my record company. I was written off and that had a bearing on my career. But I don’t think this movement is going away. It’s reached a tipping point and hopefully the abusers and perpetrators are becoming frightened for their own careers. It’s not going to stop. My hope is the money will be raised to defend the women who’ve been molested and assaulted to seek retribution. That the boy’s clubs will simmer down and give women more opportunities. To recognize them for their achievements. I’m not just talking about Hollywood. I hope that we can take it one step further that certain people with extremely important jobs will be called out for their misogyny and disrespect.

The first trailer for the new “Trading Spaces” reboot is here, and our hearts (and homes) are ready. So is America, it seems: The clip has already been viewed more than 4 million times.

Paige Davis, Ty Pennington, Hildi Santo-Tomas and the rest of the gang are all back for the beloved TLC show, which premieres Saturday, April 7. A one-hour reunion special will take place before the first show, so we can hear what everyone’s been up to, according to TLC.

Hearing Davis say “Are you ready to trade spaces?” in the trailer just gives us all the nostalgic feels:

A few new faces will make guest appearances on the series, but the show’s crazy reveals are here to stay.

“What one of our designers does with eggshells is shocking. Dozens and dozens of eggs were harmed,” Howard Lee, TLC’s executive vice president of development and production, said in a recent interview with TV Guide. “Not every episode has a happy ending.”

“Trading Spaces” returns to TLC on Saturday, April 7, at 9 p.m. EST.WASHINGTON ― Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) tore into Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday, calling her “complicit” in President Donald Trump’s bigotry for saying she doesn’t remember him making racist comments about Africa and Haiti in a recent White House meeting.

Nielsen, who was testifying under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the panel she didn’t recall the president calling Africa a “shithole” or asking why the U.S. needs more Haitian residents, expressing instead a preference for immigrants from Norway. The White House hasn’t denied those comments, and Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who were in the meeting, have publicly confirmed them.

Nielsen said she may not have heard the remarks because senators were talking over each other and making it hard to hear. Booker didn’t buy it.

“I’ve got a president of the United States whose office I respect, who talks about the country’s origins of my fellow citizens in the most despicable manner. You don’t remember? You can’t remember the words of your commander in chief?” asked the New Jersey senator. “I find that unacceptable.”

Booker, who just joined the Judiciary Committee last week and is only its second-ever African-American member, said he had “tears of rage” when he heard what Trump had said. It made him think about the time his family was denied housing for being black, he said.

“Why am I, frankly, seething with anger? … You’re under oath. You and others in that room suddenly cannot remember?” Booker said. “The idea that the commander in chief of this country can, with broad brushes, talk about certain nations and thus cast a shadow over the millions of Americans who are from those communities, and that you could even say in your testimony that Norwegians were preferences because they are so hard-working.”

“I didn’t say―,” Nielsen began.

“Excuse me,” the senator interrupted, his voice rising. “Let me finish.”

Booker, who may be eyeing a 2020 presidential run, said tens of millions of Americans are worried about the racism coming out of the White House and asked Nielsen why she wasn’t doing more to stem an uptick in white supremacist violence in the country. He cited quotes by Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi and Elie Wiesel about the dangers of staying quiet in the face of bigotry and hatred before turning back to Nielsen.

“Your silence and your amnesia is complicity,” Booker told her.

After that hung in the air for a bit, the homeland security secretary said she abhors violence “in all its forms.”Unhealthy parental smartphones use can trigger behavioral problems in kids and intimacy issues between partners while also limiting sleep and paving the way for addiction. The research is clear: Smartphones cause dumb behavior when they aren’t used smartly. But how to get out of bad habits when you can’t — for professional or personal reasons — put down the phone. How to slip the digital tether?

“We have a finite amount of willpower — every second your phone is in the corner of your eye, blinking, it’s chipping away at that resource,” explains Abby Thompson, a psychotherapist who treats tech addiction. “As you try to white-knuckle your way through avoiding it, you’re actually investing more energy in it and adding to that pressure.”

Dana Corriel, a family physician, confirms this assessment. “This is the same reason I ask patients to throw out all cigarette packets from their home before their quit date. You can’t always trust the ‘pull’ of the addictive substance.”

Fortunately, you probably don’t have to accept you’re powerless over your smartphone in order to trick your brain into having a healthier relationship. The solutions for non-physical addiction are subtle. Both Thompson and Corriel say that certain behaviors can help engender a better relationship. These are their recommendations.

1. Have No Phone Zones

Stop charging your phone in your bedroom, because that’s where you recharge yourself. More importantly, it’s where you have sex, Thompson notes. The kitchen table is another popular no-phone zone, particularly for parents who want their kids to reap the research-backed benefits of family dinners, for one. They might also learn an important lesson about not touching their gross phones before shoving chicken fingers into their face. “I recommend prioritizing places you want to be relaxed or present,” Thompson says.

2. Institute No Phone Times, Too

Just like there are places to set limits on smartphone use, they should be avoided during playtime and bedtime, Thompson recommends. Once you’re home from work and have your family in one space, there’s really no need for it after you’re off the clock. Everything from your sleep, to your marriage, to your work-life balance, to your kid will benefit from unplugging as much as possible anytime you don’t have to be, which is often evening hours.

3. Go on a Social Media Cleanse

After completing her own, Corriel became a huge advocate of social media cleanses — finite breaks from social media. Although there’s no one “right” way to do this, Corriel suggests a week or so to see how difficult it may be to quit. To prepare, she recommends alerting people of your temporary virtual absence, which may mean posting one of those statuses that you’ve rolled your eyes at before. Rest assured, you don’t have to be as self-congratulating about it as your brother-in-law was.

“Looking to your phone to curb a problem with your phone is a little too ironic to work.”

4. For the Love of God, Turn off Your Notifications

“With the exception of children, most of us don’t let people in our lives who bother us at all hours with unimportant nonsense or thoughts,” Thompson says. Notifications are the digital version of that person always bothering you and unlike a human being, you don’t have to feel any remorse for telling those nerds to take a hike. More importantly, Corriel says that notifications are uniquely invasive and can actually fuel potential symptoms of addiction.

“Notifications can cause a person’s heart rate to increase and anxiety to heighten, as excitement builds waiting to see just what the message actually says,” she warns. “Not tending to this immediately can physically affect us, as we yearn to see what we’re missing out on. It is truly like an addiction.” The goal is to be able to get the information you need from your phone on your own terms, not the other way around.

5. Don’t Rely on Apps to Fix the Problem

As the body of research grows regarding the risks of problematic smartphone overuse, so has a niche industry of apps geared towards helping people track and limit this. While this may be helpful in the short term to help recognize the problem and specific triggers “I wouldn’t expect them to be great long-term solutions,” Thompson. Looking to your phone to curb a problem with your phone is a little too ironic to work.

6. Try to Make More Time for Friends

It’s challenging to maintain friendships now that you have kids, but failing to have quality relationships outside of your family might be part of the problem. “Parenting can be so frustrating and isolating, so it’s normal to want to have your phone close by,” Thompson says. Sure, you need your phone to call your buddy up and make plans, but that’s far more productive then liking their statuses to let them know you’re still alive. Make plans, try to keep them, then put the digital middle-man away — only to be answered in case of emergencies.

7. Make More Time for Your Family too

It’s rarely healthy to use your kids as the solution to your personal problems, but in the case of smartphone overuse, they’ll actually benefit from it. This solution is simple. Anytime you want to look at your phone and don’t have to, look at your kid and/or partner instead.The birth of a child is a beautiful, unique experience that frequently ends with tears of joy and one simple, plaintive question: “Is the head supposed to look like that?” A child’s head shape when they first enter the world — oblong and vaguely alien — may be jarring, but it’s normal and no cause for concern. With vaginal birth specifically, a baby’s skull shape initially tells parents little beyond how cozy mom’s birth canal was. As kids age, that changes.

“The head is often misshapen from the pressures of being born, so babies come out cone-headed and looking like little baby aliens,” Kathleen Rowland, a physician and professor at Rush Medical College, tells Fatherly. For these tiny coneheads, their skulls typically adjust on their own within 24 to 72 hours.

From there, an infant’s head shape starts providing clues if they have an underlying congenital issue or if they’re getting enough tummy time. While phrenology, a popular 19th-century pseudoscience that claimed skull shape dictated aspects of intelligence and personality, is now regarded as unscientific, racist, and generally ridiculous, the same principles kind of work when applied to little kids. Just don’t think that you’re going to be able to use bumpology to locate a criminal impulse.

Most infants are born with soft spots, otherwise known as fontanels, which most parents know are not cause for concern. But these gaps in a baby’s skull, which close completely within two years, are not just normal, they’re necessary. The absence of them, a genetic condition known as craniosynostosis, does not allow enough room for the brain to grow and can result in a permanently misshapen head, as well as visual and sleeping impairments, challenges eating, and mental development problems including a reduction in IQ.

“If you don’t have soft spots, that’s a medical condition,” Rowland says. “The absence of soft spots is a big problem.”

Craniosynostosis is relatively rare and affects only one out of every 2,000 to 3,000 children, according to estimates. However, it is a great deal more common issue for babies to have heads that are flattened, typically on the back, a condition known as plagiocephaly. This occurs in up to half of infants and rates have gone up in recent years as parents have learned to diminish SIDS risk by having babies sleep on their backs. Flat spots can form at any spot of the head (known as positional plagiocephaly), but frequently flatness occurs because infants are spending too much time on their backs outside of sleeping and not engaging in enough tummy time. Rowland explains that supervised tummy time not only helps babies develop their head, neck, and upper body muscles, but also helps their heads form a normal shape.

In some cases, parents have told Rowland that their babies hate tummy time, but there are plenty of things moms and dads can do to make it more enjoyable for the child — the most effective being getting on the ground and on your stomach, too. It might feel stupid, but meaningful for children who might want to someday wear hats.

Though there is some research suggesting kids with plagiocephaly have a greater risk of developmental delays, studies are not conclusive. Helmets are sometimes used to treat this, but researchers are divided about whether they interfere with skin-to-skin bonding or if they work at all. Surgical treatment is more controversial, and doctors usually prescribe repositioning babies while awake so they’re not putting pressure on the flat side.

It’s important to note that just because flatness is common doesn’t mean it’s normal. Rowland notes that parents shouldn’t assume an odd head shape is not a problem or that more tummy time is the solution. Flatness is sometimes a symptom of torticollis, another congenital problem with muscles in the neck that could make kids incapable of rotating their heads when they grow up. Whether it’s craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, torticollis, or nothing at all, moms and dads will be best positioned to make decisions if they share their concerns with their pediatrician. (Not a specific head shape insight, but true nonetheless.)

“It’s important to note that just because flatness is common doesn’t mean it’s normal.”

There are ways to reduce the likelihood of a baby having a flat head, but it’s imperative for parents to be kind to themselves if and when it does happen, Rowland notes. In her experience, this represents the first time many parents encounter a “this is all my fault” moment. She recommends parents do their best to reframe this as an opportunity to practice the kind of resilience needed for raising kids.

AdvertisementTwo California parents were arrested over the weekend when police found 12 of their 13 children in filthy conditions, some chained to beds and starving.

Neighbors and acquaintances told news outlets that they’re shocked by the allegations and horrified that such abuse was allowed to continue unchecked so close to other neighbors. The parents have been charged with child endangerment and torture.

But this story isn’t just one of child abuse and endangerment; it’s also one about an education system that allows home-schools to operate with relatively little oversight, say education advocates who are pushing for stricter home-school rules.

David Allen Turpin, 57, and his wife, Louise Anna, 49, were jailed in lieu of $9 million bail after police found 13 children and young adults living in deplorable conditions in their Perris, California, home. Riverside County Sheriff's Department

The grandparents of the couple’s children, who range in age from 2 to 29, told the Los Angeles Times that they hadn’t seen the family for several years and that the children were home-schooled. Public records back this up. The father, David Turpin, is listed in the California School Directory as the principal of a school located in the family’s home. The school, called Sandcastle Day School, is listed as serving students in kindergarten through 12th grade. State records show that the school was listed as non-religious, with six pupils in a range of grades, the L.A. Times reported.

Beyond giving this basic information to the state, though, the so-called school wasn’t required to do much else.

Parents in California who decide to home-school their children can operate as a private school. These parents are required to notify the state of their decision, providing information on such things as their home address, enrollment practices and courses of study, according to information collected by the Coalition for Responsible Home Education.

Schools should give instruction in English, cover the branches of study required in public school and keep a record of attendance, according to state rules, but there is no specific mechanism to make sure requirements are enforced

Private school employees must generally undergo criminal background checks, but parents who teach family members are exempt from this rule. These parents are not required to have any specific teaching or education credentials.

Students at these schools aren’t required to take any specific assessments or show evidence of academic progress.

Rachel Coleman, executive director of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, has been tracking cases of child abuse in home-school settings. She says this case shows the type of abuse that can flourish when children are isolated from the outside world.

“While there are many home-schooling families who provide an excellent education, there’s nothing in the law to ensure that happens. So a family like this could completely isolate their children,” said Coleman.

Coleman’s group wants states like California to require mandatory doctor visits for home-schooled students, or at least some form of contact with someone who would be required to report signs of abuse. Public school employees can often act as first responders to evidence of child abuse, but home-school students don’t always have access to adults outside the home.

“Kids in these situations don’t have the resources as kids who attend public schools, like a guidance counselor they can go to, or a teacher they can go to,” said Coleman. “In most states you can be convicted of child abuse and go on to home-school your children.”

HuffPost reached out to the Home School Legal Defense Fund, a group that advocates for home-schooling parents, for comment on the case. They did not respond by Tuesday evening.

There are advantages to home-schooling. Some research suggests that home-schooled students score higher on college-entrance tests than do other students.

Home-schooling has been on the rise, and home-school families report a wide array of reasons for their decision. Parents might use home-schooling as a way to help a child with special needs or a child victimized by school bullying.Actress Leah Remini is defending screenwriter and director Paul Haggis against allegations of sexual misconduct by suggesting Scientology involvement.

Remini, in an open letter with Mike Rinder, her co-host on “Scientology and the Aftermath,” published on Rinder’s website, suggests that the Church of Scientology, which she abruptly left in 2013 after practicing since an early age, may have had a hand in accusations against Haggis.

Haggis, also a former church member and now prominent critic of Scientology, has been accused by four women of sexual misconduct and assault. The director’s former publicist, Haleigh Breest, said he raped her in December 2013, which led to a $9 million lawsuit against the “Crash” director. Haggis later counter-sued, claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress.

“Paul Haggis deserves, based on his record as a gentleman and humanitarian, to be judged when all the evidence has been taken under penalty of perjury in a court of law,” Remini and Rinder write. “Because claims of anonymous accusers who have NOT gone to law enforcement are not credible.”

Remini and Rinder don’t explicitly attribute the sexual misconduct claims to active Scientologists. But they note that the church collects potentially damaging information on followers, and speculate that material collected on Haggis could be used against him to “conjure a string of accusers.” Haggis has publicly slammed Scientology on Remini’s series, as well as in the documentary “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.”

“We expect the next ‘revelations’ about Paul Haggis in this campaign to destroy him to be based on information culled from his scientology files in the form of more ‘anonymous’ accusers, hiding behind a lawyer who will never have to disclose who is paying their bill,” Remini and Rinder write.

“Those who accuse without going to law enforcement, those who seek hush money to keep their stories secret, those who make accusations to the media anonymously – they are suspect,” they continue. “And when the target of these tactics is someone who is a prominent critic of scientology, it is very suspect.”

Haggis vehemently denies sexual misconduct. A representative said the church has “been attacking him for years with false accusations.”

After news of the sexual misconduct claims against Haggis, actress Kirstie Alley, a Scientologist, wrote alongside a report on Twitter, “This is gonna be an interesting year for the bad guys.”

The Church of Scientology has denied the insinuations by Remini and Rinder of church involvement in the allegations against Haggis.

“Leah Remini, Paul Haggis and Mike Rinder have predictably thrown up a reprehensible smokescreen to turn horrific sexual assault and rape allegations made against Haggis by four women into a bigoted attack about their former religion,” a representative for the church told Deadline in a statement. “To be clear, the Church has never met the women in this case nor their attorneys and knows nothing about the accusations against Haggis other than what has appeared in press reports and public court documents.”The man suspected of murdering Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old college student from Orange County, California, told police he believed the victim had been hitting on him, according to a court document obtained by a local newspaper.

Samuel Lincoln Woodward, a 20-year-old who had attended high school with Bernstein, was arrested Friday on suspicion of homicide after DNA evidence linked him to Bernstein’s death, The Associated Press reported. He is being held in Orange County Jail.

Investigators discovered Bernstein’s body, which had been stabbed more than 20 times, on Jan. 9 in a park in Lake Forest, California ― nearly a week after his parents reported him missing. Bernstein had been home on winter break from the University of Pennsylvania at the time.

No weapon was recovered at the scene and detectives are investigating whether the killing was “an act of rage,” reported The Orange County Register.

Police interviewed Woodward shortly after Bernstein’s disappearance was reported. The victim’s Snapchat led investigators to believe Woodward picked up Bernstein around 10:30 p.m. the night he went missing, reported the Los Angeles Times.

Woodward told investigators that they had driven to Borrego Park that night, when Bernstein exited the vehicle and walked away, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the Register.

After waiting an hour for Bernstein to return, Woodward said, he left the park to meet a girlfriend, whose last name and address Woodward told police he could not remember. He said he returned hours later to look for Bernstein.

According to the affidavit, Woodward had clenched fists as he claimed Bernstein had kissed him on the lips during their time together that night. He told investigators that he pushed Bernstein away and “wanted to tell Blaze to get off of him.”

Text messages reviewed by investigators indicated Bernstein had discussed his previous interaction with Woodward with friends, according to the Register.

Woodward was going to “hit on me,” Bernstein reportedly said in one text conversation. “He made me promise not to tell anyone … but I have texted every one, uh oh.”

The 16-page affidavit suggested Woodward was known at his former high school for having conservative political beliefs and often made his love of the Bible and guns known through his social media posts, the Register reported.

On Monday, hundreds of people gathered to mourn Bernstein’s death at a memorial service at the University Synagogue in Irvine. Bernstein, who was the managing editor of Penn Appetit, a student-run food magazine, and a columnist for the university’s student newspaper, was remembered for being a talented writer and a passionate cook.
