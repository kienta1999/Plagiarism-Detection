ALBANY, N.Y. ― Since 1970, New York’s average statewide temperature has climbed 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is just starting to feel the heat.

On Friday, Cynthia Nixon, the activist and actor whose progressive primary challenge to Cuomo’s bid for a third term is garnering surging support, unveiled one of the most ambitious climate platforms in the nation, calling for 100 percent renewable energy, a ban on all new fossil fuel infrastructure and penalties for polluters.

And on Monday, 19 buses carrying more than 1,500 activists from across the state converged on the state capital to protest Cuomo’s failure to do more about climate change in his eight years in office, and make demands that looked identical to Nixon’s platform. It was the largest environmental protest against Cuomo since anti-fracking activists staged demonstrations in 2014.

The protest started in a historically black neighborhood on Albany’s Sheridan Avenue. The state plans to build a 16-megawatt gas-fired power station there in the same location where, until 1994, a trash incinerator plant had showered the neighborhood with soot. Nixon joined the activists shortly after noon, and though she didn’t formally address the crowd, she took photos with activists and spoke to reporters.

The neighborhood “has a really terrible racist history of environmental pollution,” Nixon said, and reiterated her call to move the state to 100 percent renewable energy. “Fracked gas is not a bridge to a cleaner energy economy.”

After a few speeches, the protesters marched about a mile under a blistering sun to the state capitol, chanting, “Heyo Cuomo, walk the talk, the power of the people cannot be stopped” to a tune similar to Queen’s “We Will Rock You.”

To some, Cuomo’s status as a climate pariah may be surprising. In 2014, he put a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas in the state. In 2015, Al Gore joined the governor as he announced plans to cut the state’s greenhouse gases emissions 40 percent by 2030. Last June, Cuomo loudly rejected President Donald Trump’s move to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, ramping up New York’s pledge to produce half its electricity from renewables by 2030 and forging a new alliance with the governors of Washington and California to stick to the goals agreed to by former President Barack Obama. “Climate change is a reality, and not to address it is gross negligence by government,” said Cuomo, according to a new page on the state website with the banner: “Environment Leadership.”

But Cuomo’s policies still fail to meet even the baseline targets scientists say are needed to make a difference on global warming. His reduction targets focus exclusively on power plants, ignoring the majority of the state’s emissions that come from buildings and vehicles. He has no plan to get the state to 100 percent renewable electricity, and has offered little to protect low-income communities and neighborhoods of color that suffer most from the impacts of climate change. The state’s pension funds remain invested in fossil fuels, and polluters face no penalties in the form of fines on climate-linked damage or taxes on emissions.

Cuomo’s press office did not respond to a request for comment.

As Nixon gains in the polls and lands magazine covers, Cuomo is scrambling to act on long-neglected progressive demands. Three weeks ago, over coffee and cookies at a Manhattan steakhouse, the governor made a deal to disband the Independent Democratic Conference, known as the IDC. The group of eight breakaway Democrats in the state Senate caucused with Republicans, guaranteeing a conservative majority in the chamber ― now only one holdout, Brooklyn Democrat Simcha Felder, has left Republicans with a flimsy one-vote majority.

Cuomo also signed an executive order last week restoring voting rights to felons on parole and voiced support for legalizing recreational marijuana, a policy Nixon made a platform issue in her campaign. On Friday, almost simultaneous to the release of Nixon’s climate platform, Cuomo denied a water quality permit to a new natural gas pipeline environmentalists have protested for months, and announced a new energy efficiency initiative that would account for one-third of the emissions cuts required to meet his 2030 target.

On Monday, Cuomo announced plans to introduce a state ban on plastic bags, despite signing a moratorium to block New York City from putting a 5-cent fee on plastic bags last year.

But Cuomo’s next big test on climate change is one he has already failed twice. For the third time in as many years, the state assembly is slated to vote this week on the latest version of the New York State Climate and Community Protection Act, known as the CCPA. The bill is widely considered the most ambitious and egalitarian climate legislation introduced anywhere in the nation. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, and the economist Robert Reich called it “the most progressive climate-equity policy we’ve seen.”

The legislation, first introduced in 2016, calls for 100 percent renewable energy statewide by 2050 and orders state agencies to draft plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, buildings and vehicles. It requires 40 percent of state energy funding to go to the low-income neighborhoods and communities of color most vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather, and includes wage standards backed by labor unions for all state-funded green energy projects. If enacted, the bill’s proponents say it would create more than 100,000 jobs.

Cuomo has never come out in support of the CCPA. He refused for years to crack down on the IDC, which has until now blocked the bill from ever coming to a vote in the Senate.

“So far it’s been a failure of leadership,” said Dan Sherrell, campaign coordinator at the nonprofit New York Renews. “The governor has remained deafeningly silent on it.”

Sherrell said state legislators plan to introduce a bill to levy penalties on corporate polluters “before the end of the session,” but declined to comment on which lawmakers with whom New York Renews was in talks.

For Assemblyman Steve Englebright, the Long Island Democrat who first introduced the CCPA, the bill is 20 years overdue. The 71-year-old lawmaker from Setauket, a coastal hamlet on Long Island Sound, started warning about the threat of runaway global warming two decades ago. He has since sponsored several bills to support solar and wind production, at least three of which became laws. In 2016, he became chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and moved swiftly to draft and introduce the CCPA.

Now, on his third attempt, he has more than two dozen co-sponsors and support from Nixon, who pledged in her platform to fight to pass the bill.

“There needs to be some adjustments made in the perception of how important this bill is to bring it into the executive chamber, ready for the governor’s signature,” Englebright said Friday. “If we can get it onto his desk, he’ll have no choice but to sign it.”

Enacting legislation like the CCPA should prove popular. New York is among the most progressive states in the country on climate change according to polling data.

Seventy-seven percent of New Yorkers understand global warming is happening, according to 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication, putting the state second only to Hawaii. Eighty-six percent of New Yorkers backed funding research into renewable energy, 81 percent supported regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 79 percent called for strict emission limits on coal-fired power plants.

New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost. Seventy-one percent of New Yorkers support expanding renewable energy generation even if it raises electricity prices, compared to 61 percent nationwide, according to Cooperative Congressional Election Study’s 2016 survey results analyzed for HuffPost by Data for Progress, a left-leaning think tank. That support cuts across demographics, including 75 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 67 percent of people 65 years and older; 73 percent of urban dwellers and 67 percent of rural New Yorkers; and 74 percent of black people and 69 percent of whites.

“New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost.”

Sixty-seven percent of New Yorkers support strengthening enforcement of clean air and water regulations even if it costs U.S. jobs, compared to 58 percent nationwide. The support breaks down similarly across the state, with 73 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 61 percent of people 65 and older; 71 percent of urbanites and 60 percent of rural people; and 75 percent of black people and 64 percent of whites.

“Cuomo is fundamentally a safe governor, and a safe governor should support this,” said Sean McElwee, the New York-based political analyst and co-founder Data for Progress. “He’s an anti-progressive, and he’s someone who reflexively despises and tries to undo any progressive policy.”

Cuomo has faced criticism over other environmental issues, notably his administration’s shortcomings in dealing with a toxic drinking water in two northern New York municipalities. In February, the City of Newburgh, an impoverished community of color in the Hudson Valley, announced plans to sue the governor to force the state to clean up the site where a cancer-causing chemical spilled into a stream feeding its aquifer.

The protest Monday put a spotlight on a bribery scandal that has dogged Cuomo for the past year. A former top aide stands accused of taking $287,000 in bribes from Competitive Power Ventures, a Maryland-based company bidding to build a natural gas plant in Orange County, in New York’s Hudson Valley. The firm made more than $94,000 in donations to Cuomo’s campaign, plus another $50,000 to the state Democratic Committee in 2013. Signs reading “Stop CPV” and “No Fracking Gas Power Plants!” bristled from the crowd as the protesters marched.

But Cuomo’s penchant for emissions-heavy travel may be the most damning indictment of his climate record. In 2011, Cuomo’s regular use of government aircraft to fly between Albany and his home in Westchester cost the state about $13,000 at a time when the governor was cutting the budget. He took an average of 10 flights per month in his first four and half years in office, and sent a State Police helicopter to bring actor Robert De Niro to a tourism promotion event in the Catskills, according to a Politico report published in 2016.Tommy Morrissey’s got the drive, for sure.

The 7-year-old Floridian, who was born without most of his right arm, appeared on “Little Big Shots” Sunday and showed just how powerful his shot can be. Tommy manages to generate four times the force of his body weight when he lets loose on a golf ball, according to a machine on the show that measured the force of his swing. No wonder he can slam it 170 yards.

Host Steve Harvey marveled at Tommy’s strength and accuracy, and you can see why:

A significant swath of the American public will skip the 2018 elections, in part out of a sense that their vote doesn’t matter or that politics are inescapably corrupt, according to a new poll from Suffolk University and USA Today.

The poll surveyed Americans who aren’t registered to vote or who are registered but say they’re unlikely to cast a ballot. Combined, the two groups include more than 100 million adults, the pollsters note.

The top reasons unregistered voters gave for not voting were that they doubted their vote would make a difference (15 percent), they were uninterested (12 percent) or they were too busy (8 percent).

Suffolk University/USA Today

Among registered voters who were unlikely to cast a ballot, reasons they cited most were that they weren’t familiar with the candidates (11 percent), they doubted their votes would make a difference (9 percent) and their participation would depend on the candidates involved (9 percent).

Suffolk University/USA Today

Of course, people are notoriously bad at predicting their own voting behavior, especially this far out from Election Day. As a particularly striking case in point, 13 percent “who began the survey declaring they would not vote changed their minds during the course of the questioning,” according to the pollsters.

But their responses suggest a deep and possibly growing mistrust of American politics as a whole. About two-thirds of the unregistered and unlikely voters agreed with the statement that “I don’t pay much attention to politics because it is so corrupt,” up from 54 percent who said the same in 2012. More than 60 percent in the recent poll agreed that they tuned out because politics is “a bunch of empty promises.”

“I don’t trust them any more as far as the promises that are made, because the follow-through is very minimal and because Congress doesn’t act,” 68-year-old Belinda Santana told USA Today. “Throughout the years you’re being told your vote counts — no it doesn’t.”

A 55 percent majority of the nonvoters and unlikely voters polled said they viewed President Donald Trump unfavorably, similar to the share of likely voters who said they disliked the president in another recent Suffolk poll. A third said they backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, while 28 percent supported Trump and 6 percent chose another candidate. About 30 percent said they didn’t vote.

Voter turnout regularly drops in midterm elections. As previous polling has shown, nonvoters and those who skipped the 2014 midterms were less politically engaged than consistent voters, less convinced that voting was integral to being a good citizen and less likely to believe their individual vote could make a difference.

Democrats’ midterm prospects this year hinge at least partly on boosting turnout among a younger, more diverse segment of the public that leans toward the party but isn’t always as likely to cast ballots. Consistent voters tend to be older and more white than those who don’t regularly make it to the polls, but some early elections this cycle suggested a pattern of unusually high turnout among those without a history of regularly voting.

AdvertisementFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will write a $4.5 million check to fund the United States’ annual commitment to the Paris climate deal after President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact.

Bloomberg, a billionaire philanthropist and the United Nations’ special envoy for climate action, said Sunday he will fill the U.S. funding gap after Congress said it would only pay $3 million this year to the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat. In past years, the U.S. had pledged around $7.5 million annually.

“America made a commitment, and as an American, if the government’s not going to do it, we all have responsibility,” Bloomberg said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “I’m able to do it, so, yes, I’m going to send them a check for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.”

Bloomberg said he would consider bankrolling the American commitment next year if the U.S. again fails to pay. But he expressed hope that Trump would change his mind and rejoin the Paris accord.

“He should change his mind and say, look there really is a problem here,” Bloomberg said. “America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.”

Bloomberg’s pledge was hailed by Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement last year, fulfilling a campaign promise and dealing a heavy blow to American involvement in the climate fight. In recent months, Trump’s top environmental deputies, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt and Interior Department chief Ryan Zinke, have worked to undo environmental protections.

The U.S. also had pledged to pay $3 billion into the Green Climate Fund, which helps poorer countries adapt to climate change. Trump cut that payment after complaining it was too expensive.

Bloomberg has been instrumental in efforts to make up the U.S. government’s failure to keep commitments under the Paris deal. He helped launch the group America’s Pledge with California Gov. Jerry Brown (D.), a coalition of states and businesses working to meet U.S. agreements under the deal.Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has a new baby girl named Tiana Gia Johnson.

The actor, 45, announced the birth of his second daughter with girlfriend Lauren Hashian in an adorable photo posted to Instagram on Monday.

“Skin to skin. Our mana,” the proud papa wrote. “Blessed and proud to bring another strong girl into this world.”

A post shared by therock (@therock) on Apr 23, 2018 at 10:52am PDT

Johnson then described the labor like a true action star.

“Tiana Gia Johnson came into this world like a force of nature and Mama @laurenhashianofficial labored and delivered like a true rockstar,” he wrote. Johnson then ended his thought like the lead in a great romantic comedy:

“I was raised and surrounded by strong, loving women all my life, but after participating in baby Tia’s delivery, it’s hard to express the new level of love, respect and admiration I have for @laurenhashianofficial and all mamas and women out there.”

The couple is already parents to 2-year-old daughter Jasmine Lia. The former wrestler is also a father to 16-year-old Simone Alexandra. In his post, he embraced all the girl power in his life and offered a “word to the wise” to the gentlemen out there.

“If you really want to understand the single most powerful and primal moment life will ever offer - watch your child being born,” he wrote. “Its [sic] a life changer and the respect and admiration you have for a woman, will forever be boundless.”

The “Ballers” star also made his new bundle of joy the same promise he made to his other daughters ― to “protect, guide and make ya laugh for the rest of my life.”

Johnson seemed pretty gung-ho on the whole laughter aspect of the promise, concluding his post with, “Oh and one more thing.. you’re gonna love rollin’ in daddy’s pick up truck.”

Twain, who is a Canadian native and resides in Switzerland, was quoted Sunday by The Guardian as saying she’d have backed Trump in the 2016 election “because, even though he was offensive, he seemed honest.”

“Do you want straight or polite? Not that you shouldn’t be able to have both,” she said. “If I were voting, I just don’t want bullshit. I would have voted for a feeling that it was transparent. And politics has a reputation of not being that, right?”

Shania who?

Chrissy Teigen was following the royal baby news closely on Monday morning when she noticed something “weird” ― that Kensington Palace had tweeted out that the Duchess of Cambridge was in labor at a London hospital.

Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London earlier this morning in the early stages of labour.

Once the palace tweeted the news, news outlets quickly picked it up and prepared for the arrival of her third royal baby with the Duke of Cambridge.

Teigen, of course, perfectly encapsulated just how odd it was that the whole world was on “vagina watch,” as she called it.

“Guys. It is time. For. VAGINA WATCH, 2018 (how WEIRD would this be???)” she wrote.

Twitter

Kensington Palace made the same announcements for the former Kate Middleton’s previous two pregnancies ― tweeting out when she was in labor and again when she’d given birth to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

Here is the tweet from George’s birth in 2013:

Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London in the early stages of labour. — Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) July 22, 2013

The third royal baby was born Monday morning and weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. According to the Palace, “Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well.”Model Chrissy Teigen put a Twitter user in their place after they attempted to mom-shame her.

On Sunday evening, the pregnant mother seemed to be having a blast cooking up some red wine-braised short ribs and was tweeting up a storm about them.

Not long after, someone seized the opportunity to call out Teigen for cooking a meal with alcohol in it and potentially serving it to her 2-year-old daughter, Luna.

“Did you give ur kid a food with red wine in it?” the comment read in a now-deleted tweet.

Braised short ribs require a long time in the oven, and studies have found that after two and a half hours in an oven, much of the alcohol cooks out of food.

Despite the person’s concern, there was zero proof that Teigen actually fed her daughter the ribs.

So Teigen, who should have an honorary degree in fielding attacks on her parenting, decided to handle the situation in her own, sarcastic way.

Warning: Spoilers ahead for “Westworld” Season 2.

Well, folks, we’re back in “Westworld.” And Stubbs is here to join us.

That’s right, after randomly disappearing following a run-in with some warrior hosts in the penultimate episode of Season 1, it appears handsome security officer Ashley Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) was just enjoying a little sabbatical. But seriously, where was he?

We don’t learn much about Stubbs’ previous whereabouts when we catch up with him in Season 2, Episode 1, “Journey Into Night.” He, alongside the head of Delos operations Karl Strand (Gustaf Skarsgård) and fellow officers Antoine (Fares Fares) and Maling (Betty Gabriel), discover a beat-up Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) on the beach and soon go hunting for hostile androids, who have revolted against the human guests of the park. The four are still unaware of Bernard’s true identity ― he is a host modeled after the late Westworld co-creator Arnold Weber ― so they bring him along for the ride as they try to discover what exactly caused the robots to kill.

In order to understand more about Stubbs’ reappearance, Bernard’s storyline and the robot revolution, HuffPost called up Luke Hemsworth and asked him to break down the first episode of Season 2. And boy, did he giggle his way through some fun theories.

Stubbs is back. He shows up in the second scene of Season 2 as Bernard wakes up on the beach. But, where you been, man?

Stubbs just went on holiday ― just had a little rest down to the Bahamas, a little surfing trip. [Laughs] Look, it is explained where Stubbs goes and what happens, so I don’t want to give too much away, but it’s really cool. It was something I was really excited to do and it was a great experience to be a part of the park Stubbs goes to. I can’t say anything more than that because it does go into depth of what exactly happens.

We do get a sense that there are many different parks in Westworld, we just don’t know how many. We did, however, get a glimpse of a Bengal tiger from Park 6, which Stubbs discovers.

Well, we know Shogun World, that’s been revealed. And then, yes, Stubbs alludes to Park 6 and a Bengal tiger. The possibilities are kind of endless with, “Is Park 6 the end of it? Is there more than that?” [Long pause and laughter]

You’re doing good holding in these spoilers!

Yeah, it’s also hard for me because I’m trying to remember when exactly stuff is introduced with the multiple timelines. That’s another hurdle to jump in terms of remembering where everything is placed. But yeah, the possibilities are endless.

Yes, the multiple timelines are back, of course, and equally as confusing as the first season. As an actor on the show, I’m sure it gets a little tricky, too.

It does get a little tricky, that’s why you have incredible directors to help you remember exactly where you are and where you’re going. A part of the parcel, I guess, is getting to set knowing what’s happened before and what’s coming. But it does take a little while for it to sink in. You get the scripts and they’re incredibly dense and layered. I find myself going backwards and forwards a few times just to let it all sink in. Then, you let it all slide and enjoy watching the series so there’s some level of surprise for me, as well. The hardest part is talking about where those timelines fit in to what episode, because that’s when it all gets a little bit blurry. There is stuff that maybe gets jumbled around too in the editing process, which makes it extra-especially hard to remember when is what.

It does seem Stubbs will have a bit more to do this season.

He does. He gets to breathe and we see a different side of Stubbs. I wish I could say more about it, but it’s more fun to find out as you watch it.

When we see Stubbs again, security is out there capturing and killing hosts. Little do they know, Bernard ― who they find on the shore ― is a robot himself. Stubbs has always been a Bernard supporter. Does he ever find out the truth?

Ummm, I don’t know. I think we explore all of that. The thing about Stubbs is he’s just a good guy. Regardless of whether it’s a host or a human, he’s pretty compassionate, I think. That unfolds and it’s something that has been unfolding for Series 1 and Series 2, that he’s just a guy who actually doesn’t like to see people suffer and he’s trying to figure out his place in the world and where he’s headed. Yeah, there’s a few things to tackle there.

“We ask a lot more questions than we probably answer on this show, and the answers are probably a little darker than we’d really like.” - Luke Hemsworth

Let’s talk about the brain capsules that seem to be residing in these hosts’ heads. What did you think about that reveal?

I can’t remember when it came up, but there was some discussion about what exactly their operating program was or how their inner systems function and what they look like. The fact that it was a pearl or some sort of spherical device which contained all their memory and coding and everything. But I remember being pretty grossed out by that scene. [Laughs]

Yeah, it was nasty.

It was really nasty. I think Fares had a pretty good time digging around in the brain and throwing pieces of goo and flinging it at everyone, so it was good. It’s interesting. I can’t remember where I read this, but this may be the way technology is heading, this kind of device.

Oh, lovely. Well, it appears Bernard may have damaged his brain when he shot himself last season. He’s losing it ― questioning the nature of his reality. Meanwhile, Dolores is very aware of her reality, and is on a killing spree. Were you surprised to see that switch in their characters?

I think the nature of progression is that we’re always learning and we should be questioning the nature of our reality. I don’t think any of the characters are ever satisfied with where they are ― they’re constantly trying to find a place where they fit and find the answers. When you get dropped a bombshell like Bernard did in terms of finding out you’re not human, what do you do? And I think that’s one of the show’s strong points is it asks the question, “Are you asking the right questions?” What questions do you ask? And where do you need to head? What do you need to accomplish to find those answers? We ask a lot more questions than we probably answer on this show, and the answers are probably a little darker than we’d really like.

Yes, it’s a show full of questions, and the one we are left with at the end of Episode 1 is huge. We see a sea of water that didn’t previously exist in the park, and in this water are many dead hosts. One of those hosts is Teddy. Then, Bernard says he killed them all. Whoa! What do you think happened?

[Laughs] What do I think happened … I don’t know. Maybe there’s a part of the park that’s like Noah’s Ark park, and the floodgates have been opened, and the hosts failed to get on two-by-two, you know? I don’t know. Again, what I think happened and what I know happened are [laughs] ... hard to convey.

You know the truth!

I know the truth, yeah.

Did the truth surprise you?

I don’t think there’s an episode that goes by that I’m not surprised and excited by. There’s so much depth. Once you start pulling back those layers of skin and bone and hair, so to speak, the rabbit hole is deep. I think in this season it gets deeper and deeper and deeper. I’m amazed.

I really am amazed at the direction the writers choose and the surprises. We’re constantly being surprised as actors as well, day in and day out. It’s hard to convey just how good of an experience that is, because it’s an experience like no other. We’re growing as actors and writers, all together. Each one of us informs the other. I know myself, I’m just trying to do my best in this amazing situation that I’m given. There are so many people behind the scenes who are putting far more hours in than we do, and they definitely make our job a lot easier. And I hope we sort of do the set decorators and the costume department and the rest of the crew a little bit of justice, and that their work is recognized as the brilliance that it is. I’m blown away by it.

There was a grueling six-month shoot for Season 2. But how does it feel to be on board a project that allows you to play a bit in terms of budget and scale?

I approach the work the same way. I try to go as deep as I can into what I need to do. The beauty is when you have all those sets that are real, in those incredible locations with real landscapes, 300 extras, a lot of your work is done for you. You can focus on the specifics and the moment and the beat, and block all of the other craziness that is happening in the world outside. From an actor’s point of view, it feels the same, the process is the same, it’s just a lot bigger. But I think it still has to be truthful, it has to be real. There has to be meaning to it. With the material as good as it is, then it’s a no-brainer.

Do you at least rub this in your brothers’ faces, that you’re on one of TV’s biggest shows? I mean, we now have “Thor” vs. “Hunger Games” vs. “Westworld.”

I don’t think any of us rub it in each other’s faces. We’re all very supportive, and I think that part of our lives is something we all share with great enthusiasm with each other. I think every other part of our lives we will be competitive, and I’ll rub it in their faces but, no, I think to rub this in their faces would be to cheapen it and cheapen their work. They’re both doing an incredible job and I’m very proud of them.

Wow, you’re such a sweet big brother. I was expecting you to dig in there, and that was really touching.

[Laughs]

So, you made it out of Westworld alive, so far. But did you and Matt Damon make it out of Asgard in “Thor: Ragnarok”?

[Laughs] Yeah! Of course we did. I think there’s room for an Actor Thor and an Actor Loki spinoff. That’s what I’m gunning for. I want to get on the phone with Kevin Feige and be like, “So, here’s my pitch: Actor Loki, Actor Thor save the planet. They don’t mean to, but you know. Maybe with a little bit of help from Thor and the others.” We need to weave these two legends into the story because they really are the every-men of Asgard.

Well Chris’ contract is up soon. He’ll be hanging up his Thor costume and moving on. Now’s your time to step in.

[Laughs] I think Actor Thor needs his own spinoff. I’d like to see him maybe head off in his own spaceship with a little merry band of Shakespearean travelers, putting on shows across the universe.

AdvertisementA tweet from President Donald Trump saved a struggling family on Tuesday ― in the sit-com “Roseanne.”

The show’s season finale featured a fictional state-of-emergency declaration from the president that bailed out the financially strapped Conners after a storm hit.

“The president spelled ‘Illinois’ wrong in his tweet, but it still counts, right?” Darlene (Sara Gilbert) cracked.

The Conners’ money woes hit a crescendo in the finale because Dan’s (John Goodman) business was faltering (as a debate about him perhaps using undocumented workers flourished) and Roseanne (real-life Trump supporter Roseanne Barr) needed knee surgery, according to several outlets. A previous episode revealed that Roseanne had become hooked on opioids to deal with the pain.

But just when it seemed their money woes would put them underwater, a storm hit to literally do the same.

But then came Trump’s order. A Federal Emergency Management Agency payment, Dan figures, will fund the basement repairs because he can do them cheaper himself and pay the deductible for Roseanne’s knee surgery.

Trump ― the Conners’ hero.

There were a few surprises as well:Aleksandr Kogan, the University of Cambridge psychology professor who harvested data from Facebook and sold it to Cambridge Analytica, apologized for a tactic that has spawned the wrath of internet users worldwide.

Kogan told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was “sincerely sorry” for assuming that everyone knew their data was being mined, but didn’t care. He was the one who designed the personality quiz that granted access to personal data ― location, gender, birthday and page likes for the person taking the quiz as well as their friends ― on tens of millions of Facebook users.

“Back then, we thought it was fine. Right now, my opinion has really been changed,” he said.” “If I had any inkling that I was going to cause people to be upset, I would’ve never done it.”

Kogan insisted the ability to access vast amounts of user data “was a core feature of the Facebook platform for years. This was not a special permission you had to get. This was just something that was available to anybody who wanted it who was a developer.” Tens of thousands of developers, he guessed, likely did the same thing.

He said he knew that the data he sold to Cambridge Analytica was going to be used for elections in some way, and he surmised that the client was on the Republican side.

He failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends and that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica which used the material to influence people on how to vote. (2/2) #60Minutes pic.twitter.com/lkVaiENxTd — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) April 22, 2018

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed a finger at Kogan during his congressional testimony last week, accusing the psychologist of violating his agreement with Facebook by selling the data to Cambridge Analytica. Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel, called Kogan’s work a “scam” and a “fraud” (Facebook also suspended Kogan’s account.)

Kogan acknowledged he may have broken Facebook rules by selling the data, admitting that he likely didn’t read the social media giant’s developer policy.The filmmaker behind one of the best-known depictions of an exorcism in pop culture is now turning his camera on the real thing.

William Friedkin, director of the 1973 horror classic “The Exorcist,” has created a documentary on one such ritual performed by Italian priest and exorcist Gabriele Amorth. “The Devil and Father Amorth” focuses on the 2016 exorcism of a middle-aged woman who believed she was possessed by the devil.

“I was scared, seriously scared. I was two feet away from them ... And it was terrifying,” Friedkin told NPR of watching the exorcism. “Gradually my fear turned into empathy for her. She was in seemingly unnatural and total pain.”

Friedkin showed his footage to brain surgeons and psychiatrists, none of whom could explain what was happening:

“Now, these were guys who have done over 5,000 brain surgeries each. So I took it to them, and they all to a person said: We don’t know what this is. It’s not epilepsy; it’s not a lesion in the temporal lobe. We would not know what to remove from her brain to solve this. And the psychiatrists told me, to my astonishment, that psychiatry now recognizes it as something called dissociative identity disorder ― demonic possession.”

Amorth died a few months after the exorcism due to a pulmonary condition and possibly pneumonia. He was 91.

Last year, Friedkin told WorldPost that seeing the real thing changed his view of exorcisms. If he had to make “The Exorcist” today, he would do it differently as a result.White Americans who’ve been following the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks are most likely to think the story represents an isolated occurrence, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Black Americans see it as part of a pattern.

The vast majority of those surveyed had heard at least a little about the arrests. Among those, 48 percent of white Americans said it was an isolated incident, a third that it was emblematic of a broader pattern in how society as a whole treats black people, and 6 percent that it was a reflection of a broader pattern in the way Starbucks treats black people.

A 57 percent majority of black Americans, by contrast, saw the controversy as rooted in broader societal problems, with 19 percent considering it primarily an indictment of Starbucks, and just a tenth believing it was an isolated incident.

Reactions to Starbucks’ handling of the event are mixed among those who’ve been following the story, with 53 percent approving of the coffee chain’s handling of the aftermath and 47 percent disapproving. A 40 percent plurality said Starbucks was doing about the right amount to respond to the controversy, with about a quarter saying it was doing too much, and 18 percent that it was doing too little. Responses were about evenly split on whether closing stores for anti-bias training would be effective or not.

Black and white Americans gave Starbucks nearly identical approval ratings for their overall handling of the incident. But three in 10 white Americans said Starbucks was doing too much to address the controversy, while just 4 percent of black Americans said the same.

As is often the case in recent polls, the divides along political lines are even starker than the splits between races. A 69 percent majority of Hillary Clinton voters who’d heard about the Starbucks story said it represents a broader societal pattern, while just 9 percent of President Donald Trump’s supporters said the same. Slightly more than half of Trump voters, and just a tenth of Clinton voters, thought Starbucks was doing too much in response. Clinton voters were also more than twice as likely as Trump voters to believe anti-bias training would be effective.

The racial disparities in Americans’ own experiences in semi-public spaces like restaurants and stores, the rest of the survey finds, aren’t limited to Starbucks.

Most Americans, regardless of race, say they don’t often worry about being perceived as doing something wrong while out at a restaurant or store. But white Americans are 24 points likelier than black Americans to say they don’t worry about being suspected of wrongdoing in public, 18 points likelier to say they’d be comfortable using a restroom without buying anything and 26 points likelier to say they’d be comfortable waiting for a friend without making a purchase. The gaps between white and Hispanic Americans on those questions are 15 points, 18 points and 24 points, respectively.

Over the last year, he pleaded guilty to several counts of sexual assault of minors and possessing child pornography and is serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years.

Maroney said she decided to speak up during the car ride in Toyko because she was “desperate.” The previous night, she said, Nassar’s sexual assault had been worse than ever.

“I didn’t feel like it was him anymore,” Maroney said of the incident, which she also detailed when she first went public in an October Twitter post about Nassar’s abuse. “It was this other thing that took over ― the dark part of him. ... He went like overboard that night I was bawling, naked, on a bed, him on top of me.

The image is nothing more than a projected shadow but one that a Japanese apartment management company hopes will help protect and reassure women living by themselves.

Still in the prototype stage, “Man on the Curtain” uses a smartphone connected to a projector to throw a moving shadow of a man doing various energetic activities onto a curtain.

Customers can choose from a dozen different scenarios that show their man boxing, doing karate and even swinging a baseball bat.

To mix things up a bit, the man can calm down and do more mundane things like get dressed, chill out with a guitar or even do some vacuuming around the flat.

The system was developed for security at buildings run by Leopalace21 Corp,, said Keiichi Nakamura, manager of the firm’s advertising department.

Queries from the public prompted the company to think bigger and consider offering it for sale. But some people have had doubts about how effective it might be, said Nakamura.

In particular, criminals might sooner or later work out that a “man behind the curtain” who spends his whole time shadow boxing, actually means a woman is alone inside.

“If projecting a shadow makes a woman an easy target by showing criminals there’s nobody home, that would put the cart before the horse,” he said.

“So we’d like to commercialize it once we add variety, such as releasing a new video every day.”Travis Reinking, the 29-year-old suspected of killing four people Sunday in a shooting at a Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee, is in police custody.

Reinking was arrested Monday about a mile and a half from the Waffle House, the Metro Nashville Police Department announced in a tweet, ending a manhunt that began shortly after the shooting early Sunday. The suspect was taken to a hospital to be checked for injuries and will be transferred to a Nashville jail to be booked, a police spokesman said Monday at a press conference.

Police responded to a tip from a Nashville resident who believed they saw Reinking in a wooded area, wearing a maroon shirt and dark jeans with a backpack. Detectives searched the area and were able to detain Reinking without engaging fire, Lt. Carlos Lara of the Metro Nashville Police said.

“Once he was in custody, detectives went and cut off the backpack off of him, because he was in cuffs,” Lara told reporters Monday. “When they looked into the backpack, they saw a silver Kimber semiautomatic weapon with .45-caliber ammunition, a flashlight, and a holster on his person.”

Reinking, who is from Morton, Illinois, is suspected of opening fire in the Waffle House with an AR-15. He faces multiple counts of criminal homicide.

Police say Reinking arrived at the restaurant at 3:19 a.m. on Sunday with the rifle and at least two magazines of ammunition, wearing only a green jacket. James Shaw Jr., a 29-year-old diner, has been hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming the shooter.

“I was just trying to get myself out. I saw the opportunity and pretty much took it,” Shaw, who suffered a minor gunshot wound to his arm, told The Tennessean.

The gunman took the jacket off after the shooting, and fled the scene on foot in the nude.

Police have identified the four people killed as Taurean Sanderlin, 29; Joe Perez, 20; Akilah DaSilva, 23; and DeEbony Groves, 21. Two others, Shanita Waggoner, 21, and Sharita Henderson, 24, were wounded in the incident.

Nashville police Chief Steve Anderson said authorities suspect Reinking has mental health issues. Reinking was arrested last June after he allegedly tried to cross a security barrier near the White House in order to meet President Donald Trump, authorities say. Following that incident, officials forced Reinking to surrender his firearms and turned the weapons over to his father. However, Reinking’s father gave the guns back to him, officials said.

A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said during Monday’s press conference that Reinking’s father could potentially face charges if he is found to have violated federal law by returning the weapons to Reinking.

In 2016, Illinois police officers were called to a CVS parking lot where Reinking was threatening to kill himself, per police reports obtained by ABC 7 Chicago and WKRN.

During the encounter, deputies said, Reinking claimed the singer Taylor Swift had been stalking and harassing him. He said he believed Swift had hacked his phone and Netflix account, and that she’d asked him to meet at a Dairy Queen, according to ABC 7.

Reinking moved to the Nashville area in fall 2017, according to CNN. A motive for Sunday’s shooting is not yet known.Fox News host Sean Hannity is speaking out following a report that he purchased discounted and foreclosed properties as investment tools through shell companies, all the while receiving support from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The “Hannity” talk show host, in a statement Monday, defended his choice to not publicly disclose what he described as his “personal” investments.

In his statement, Hannity said that he did not “individually select, control or know the details about” the real estate investments that he made but that they were going to communities that he said “badly need such investment.”

Properties linked to Hannity, which were disclosed by The Guardian, include more than 870 homes that were purchased in seven states over the last decade. Their value totals at least $90 million.

Hannity, whose salary from Fox News is estimated by Forbes to be $36 million annually, acknowledged in his statement that he received loans from HUD to invest in properties during President Barack Obama’s administration.

Those mortgage loans, which, according to the Guardian, were acquired through HUD’s National Housing Act, offered investors protection against loan defaults when purchasing rental properties. There were larger loan guarantees given to buyers who offered housing to low-income tenants. Two of the most expensive properties reportedly purchased by Hannity in Georgia used $17.9 million that he acquired through HUD’s program.

After Ben Carson took over as secretary of HUD under Trump, Hannity’s loan portfolio increased by $5 million, The Guardian reported.

Hannity argued that he never discussed his original loans obtained during Obama’s administration with anyone at HUD. But he also didn’t disclose them to his viewers, including while interviewing Carson on his program last year and praising Carson’s work. Hannity also did not disclose his connection to Cohen, despite defending him on his program.

Journalists, as part of a code of ethics, are expected to recuse themselves from reporting on a subject that involves a personal connection or, at the least, disclose those connections. Hannity has argued that he is not a journalist, despite the fact that he covers national news and interviews high-profile guests on “Hannity.” Last week he identified himself as “an opinion journalist or advocacy journalist” instead.

In a twist, while he was reportedly buying up discounted homes, Hannity criticized Obama and blamed him for Americans’ struggles to own their own homes amid the nation’s housing crisis. On his program in 2016, he said Obama has failed to turn talk into action when it came to helping “every American get ahead.”NASA/John Sonntag/Operation IceBridge

NASA scientists are working to solve a mystery in the Arctic ice.

Operation IceBridge is a project that sends flights over both polar regions to photograph and map land and sea ice. And images that were taken during a flight on April 14 over the Beaufort Sea, 50 miles northwest of the Mackenzie River Delta, showed a series of unusual shapes in the sea ice.

“We saw these sorta-circular features only for a few minutes today,” mission scientist John Sonntag wrote from the field, per NASA. “I don’t recall seeing this sort of thing elsewhere.”

NASA also released an image with the main features labeled:

NASA/John Sonntag/Operation IceBridge

NASA said some of the features had an easy explanation: The ice in the area was young and thin. When these types of floes collide, “finger rafting” ― the zipper-like feature at the top right ― will form. However, the agency conceded that the holes were little harder to explain, and no one could quite say for sure what caused them.

“The encircling features may be due to waves of water washing out over the snow and ice when the seals surface,” Walt Meier, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said in a news release. “Or it could be a sort of drainage feature that results from when the hole is made in the ice.”

Wahlberg recently upped his workout regimen in preparation for his upcoming role in “The Six Billion Dollar Man,” and hasn’t been shy about showing off the results on Instagram. Still, he admitted there are two people who are consistently unimpressed.

“My daughters [Ella Rae, 14, and Grace, 8] get very annoyed by the pictures,” he told the host. “I get ‘Dad, put a shirt on,’ all the time.”

He continued, “At first, they don’t like it when I scare the boyfriend. And then, all of a sudden, they’re like, ‘Oh Dad, can you come see me at school?’ Because they want me to scare the boyfriend.”

Also in the interview, Wahlberg explained how fatherhood inspired his plans to reboot the classic children’s program, “Captain Kangaroo.”

“I’ve been trying to figure out cool ways to get my kids to be interested in science, technology, engineering ― things like that,” he said, before presenting Ellen with a red blazer in the style of original “Captain Kangaroo” star Bob Keeshan. “We are bringing back a cool STEM scientist as Captain Kangaroo.”The movie was also one of the few times most of its cast members weren’t portraying what they considered to be “token Asians.”

And Bill” is HuffPost’s weekly recap where we look at the craziest thing you may have missed on “Westworld.” This week: Season 2, Episode 1, “Journey Into Night.”

When “Westworld” brought itself back online Sunday night, we immediately stopped and shouted, “Whoa, baby!”

Namely because of the title sequence for Season 2, which is reminiscent of Season 1′s layout with a few new additions ― including a baby.

To get the inside scoop, we talked to the creative director behind the titles, Patrick Clair. But first, let’s discuss a popular and relevant “Westworld” theory:

The next step in the hosts’ evolution is, well, robot babies.

Welcome to Westworld, baby. HBO

A “Westworld” fan theory that’s been around since the first season supposes that androids could eventually make babies ― children we’ll affectionately refer to as robotots.

“Robot babies?!” was Luke Hemsworth’s reaction when we spoke to him about the opening credits this month. The actor, who plays security officer Ashley Stubbs on “Westworld,” said he saw the Season 2 premiere for the first time in Los Angeles on Monday and insisted he didn’t remember the “little robot babies.” Well, Stubbs, we’re here to fill you in. Robot reproduction makes a whole lot of sense, and it could be the next logical step in the androids’ quest to become the superior race. There was even speculation in Season 1 that procreation was the final step of the ever-confusing maze. After all, there’s a little dot under the figure in the maze drawing (conveniently located on a scalp below). Could it possibly represent new life?

An a-maze-ing detail from Season 1. HBO

The reproduction angle didn’t happen in Season 1, and the maze turned out to be about the robots finding true consciousness, but there are subtle hints that it’s still a lingering possibility.

For example, one of the Season 2 trailers used Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box” as a backing track ― you know, the song from their album “In Utero.” If that doesn’t scream robotots, what does?

Furthermore: those title sequences we were talking about. In the latest season premiere, we get a glimpse of a mother and child in the opening credits. The vignette replaced Season 1′s scene of two robot lovers. The sequence’s designer, Clair, didn’t outright confirm robotots are on the way, but he did say the titles might hint at what’s to come. While reflecting on the mother and child scene, Clair told us, “What really affected me most watching Season 1 was the bond between parent and child, and mother and baby, and I think led us to be like, what could we do that has the emotional resonance of the lovers but goes in a new direction of where the story has been, where the story is going?” “I think there will be some real rewards for people as the season plays out,” he added. “They’ll start to really be able to realize what that means and its place within the titles.” So ... robotots confirmed? At least Hemsworth is into the idea.

Though he missed the baby in the opening sequence, he told HuffPost, “Would I be surprised if something like that happens? It’s an interesting direction, for sure,” he laughed, continuing, “It’s very scary but I think it’s on par with the innovation of the show. Whether we see anything like that anytime soon, I don’t know. Once robots can have babies, I think the outlook for the human race is probably pretty bleak.”

All we’re saying is: why not? There are so many advantages. You can put your baby in sleep mode whenever you want, and they probably have a Wifi connection. Who wouldn’t want a hot spot in their robotot?

While we’re waiting for more on that possible reveal, Clair was also kind enough to walk us through the other additions to the updated opening credits.

The buffalo hints at the theme.

It's a circle. A circle of lifeeeeeee. HBO

On the falling buffalo, Clair said, “This was how buffalo or bison could be hunted back in time where they could kind of be cajoled into diving off cliffs, and you have this tragic moment of them falling to their deaths. [It’s] tragic for the beast, but obviously they’re generating food and feeding the circle of life, and I think for us, that became an interesting theme because so much of the ‘Westworld’ titles are about the circle of life.”

The brains are like a visual search engine.

Insane in the mem-brain. HBO

″[In the first season], we use the iris of the hosts ... to reflect the landscapes, so when we were looking for something that could do the same thing as the iris you kind of realize there’s this quite beautiful object ― we call it the pearl. It’s the brain of the host, so we sort of went about imagining how that could look in extreme close up.”

He told us the idea was “visualizing neural networks like the ones search engines use, like the ones that image recognition uses, and then imagine how that could work in a more complicated three-dimensional space.”

The hat is sinking. The hosts are rising.

Hats off to this "Westworld" scene. HBO

Season 1 titles end with a host sinking back into liquid. Clair wanted to insinuate a sense of progression in Season 2′s opening, so he based the image of the host on photographs looking up from water into the sky.

The hosts are on the rise. HBO

“We got this imagery of this mysterious black hat drifting into the abyss while the host is actually emerging from this dark liquid. Having that host be a female host ... there are so many empowered characters from Season 1. [There] are amazing badass female robots, so this felt like a slightly more empowered way to kick off the episodes of Season 2.”

The mother and child are the perfect setup.

This moment is a real mother. HBO

The image of the baby was a personal experience for Clair, who has a 5-year-old son of his own.

“Realizing that you’re bringing this very sacred thing into the world, bringing a mind into the world, that’s everything that ‘Westworld’ is about. It’s about the sacred mysterious responsibilities of giving rise to conscious minds. It’s something that all of us have experience of from a child’s perspective, and so many of us have experience from a parent’s perspective, and I think any imagery there can kind of evoke that from the start of this story is a good kind of setup for where it’s gonna go.”

If you find yourself unsettled by the figures, that’s on purpose.

This family is creeping me out. HBO

“I think if you saw the lovers or the mother and child in full light, you would be horrified. It would give you nightmares. Those beings, the way we designed them, is based on where the light falls on them. Where the light falls on them, they’re fairly complete.”

To create the figures of the lovers and the mother and child, the design team started with anatomical models and then peeled back layers until they are “deeply grotesque.” Those parts of the characters remain in the shadows.
