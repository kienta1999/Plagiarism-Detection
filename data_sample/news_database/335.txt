James Franco acknowledged sexual misconduct accusations against him earlier this month, and said “if” he has “done something wrong,” he will do whatever he can to make it right.

Two of his accusers are now offering suggestions: Apologize, and start offering better opportunities for women.

“Please just apologize,” comedy writer Violet Paley said on “Good Morning America” Tuesday.

Paley decided to share her past experience with the actor after spotting him at the Golden Globes earlier this month wearing a #TimesUp pin in support of the anti-sexual-harassment initiative. Over Twitter, she said Franco had pursued at least two underaged girls, and once tried to force her to perform oral sex on a date.

“I just didn’t want him to hate me, so I did it,” she told the Los Angeles Times.

Filmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan, an accuser who appeared with Paley on “Good Morning America,” suggested Franco use “his power to give opportunities to women that are real and valuable.”

Franco has many roles in the entertainment industry, including director and acting teacher, that have allowed him to support up-and-coming talent. Tither-Kaplan was one of his students.

She said Franco exploited female performers in a class on sex scenes by adding sex and nudity to scripts without fully explaining the artistic value. Women who felt uncomfortable were “asked to leave or just not asked to be in the projects.”

Still, Tither-Kaplan said she sees a path to redemption for the actor, who briefly stepped out of the limelight after a handful of women spoke out against him.

“He’s not an unforgivable person, at least for me,” Tither-Kaplan said, adding that Franco “is absolutely not a Harvey Weinstein.”

“It’s a pyramid. At the top is rape and sexual violence and at the bottom are other abuses of power that, when they continue to happen, build and build and build until they create a culture that allows the most heinous examples of sexual violence and misogyny and discrimination to happen,” Tither-Kaplan said.

The women’s comments come as the discussion on sexual abuse, sparked by a series of bombshell reports on former producer Weinstein, has widened to encompass a nuanced variety of unwanted behavior by high-profile men.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was questioned last week by the special counsel’s office investigating potential collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The interview marked the first time that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office is known to have interviewed a member of Trump’s Cabinet, and is another milestone in an investigation that has hung over Trump’s year-old presidency.

Mueller’s office also interviewed former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey shortly after Trump fired Comey in May 2017, a person familiar with the matter said. Comey’s firing led to Mueller’s appointment by the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, Rod Rosenstein, to take over the FBI’s Russia investigation.

Sessions was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s candidacy and served as a campaign adviser before the Republican president appointed him as the top U.S. law enforcement official. Trump has openly criticized Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the Russia probe last March after media reports that he had failed to disclose 2016 meetings with Moscow’s then-ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.

Mueller’s team is expected to be interested in meetings between Sessions and Kislyak during the campaign, as well as the attorney general’s involvement in Trump’s firing of Comey, an episode central to the question of whether Trump may have committed obstruction of justice.

Trump, asked by reporters about Sessions’ interview, said, “I’m not at all concerned.”

Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman, confirmed a report in the New York Times that Sessions met for hours with Mueller’s team last week. Prior did not provide additional details. An attorney representing Sessions declined to comment. Comey could not be immediately reached for comment.

The source familiar with Comey’s interview said it was part of his handover to Mueller of the Russia investigation and questions whether Trump sought to obstruct justice by firing him. The handoff, the source said, also included Mueller’s team collecting all the material Comey had gathered during the initial stages of the investigation.

In a memos Comey wrote about his meetings with Trump, Comey recounted how the president asked him to end an FBI probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to a charge brought by Mueller of lying to the FBI.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign using hacking and propaganda to attempt to tilt the race in favor of Trump. Russia has denied it. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia, and has called the Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and “hoax.”

Asked about Mueller’s investigation, White House spokesman Raj Shah told Fox News, “We believe it will end soon and find what we’ve known all along, which is that there was no collusion during the 2016 campaign and no findings of wrongdoing.”

The Washington Post reported Tuesday Mueller is seeking to question Trump about Comey and Flynn’s departures.

Later Tuesday, the Washington Post also reported that, according to current and former officials, Trump asked then-acting FBI director Andrew McCabe whom he voted for in the 2016 election shortly after he fired Comey.

‘HONEST AND CORRECT’

Democrats have accused Sessions of lying to Congress by failing to disclose meetings with Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions has now acknowledged meetings with Kislyak including one in his Senate office and another at a event at the Republican National Convention, and did not rule out a “brief interaction” with Kislyak at an event at a Washington hotel.

His public account of other matters related to Russia also has evolved. Sessions initially testified to Congress he was unaware of any Trump campaign contacts with Russia, but in November modified that assertion, saying he was aware of contact between the campaign and Russian intermediaries.

Sessions has denied lying, saying he was “honest and correct” and not trying to mislead Congress. He has frequently said he has trouble remembering some of the meetings.

Trump fired Comey after Sessions and Rosenstein penned a memo recommending his ouster over his prior handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Clinton was the Democratic presidential candidate who lost to Trump in 2016.

Trump later said he fired Comey over “this Russia thing,” a comment that raised questions about whether he was attempting to obstruct the FBI’s investigation.

Sessions’ participation in a March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump’s national security campaign advisers could be of interest to Mueller.

At that meeting, which Sessions led, former campaign volunteer and adviser George Papadopoulos offered to help broker a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and is now cooperating with Mueller.

Sessions has said he now recalls the proposal by Papadopoulos, and told Congress he pushed back against the idea.

Sessions was the latest high-level current or former Trump administration figure to be interviewed by Mueller’s team. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon also has agreed to be interviewed by Mueller’s investigators.

Trump this month refused to commit to being interviewed by Mueller, saying “I’ll speak to attorneys” about the matter.

Mueller has charged four people in his wide-ranging investigation. In addition to Papadopoulos and Flynn, Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s business partner, Rick Gates, have been charged with counts including failing to register as foreign agents and conspiracy to launder money.Dave Grohl handled a stage crasher like a rock star.

A fan at the Foo Fighters concert in Perth, Australia, Saturday jaunted up to the stage on a long runway and hugged the frontman while the band performed “Everlong.” Security converged, but Grohl turned him into part the act, Billboard reported.

He asked the interloper’s name, got it wrong, and then told him, “Sorry, Jevon with a J. Get the f**k off my stage.”

But Grohl wasn’t finished. He dedicated the rest of the song to “Jevon with a J.”

Grohl has asked fans up onstage before, but he sure seems to know how to handle the uninvited, too.The Mexican director's "The Shape of Water" earned 13 nominations on Tuesday. JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX via Getty Images

Guillermo del Toro is poised to sweep the 2018 Academy Awards with his fantasy thriller “The Shape of Water.”

The Mexican director’s film led the list of Oscar nominees announced Tuesday morning, with an impressive 13 nods ― including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Del Toro reacted to the nominations in a press statement, dedicating the recognition to young Latino filmmakers.

“It is a great honor and joy to be here today, with a picture that remains faithful to all my convictions and the images I have loved since infancy,” he said in the statement, which was sent to HuffPost. “I want to thank the Academy and my professional colleagues for their kind disposition towards ‘The Shape of Water.’ I share these nominations with all the young filmmakers in Mexico and Latin America who put their hopes in our craft and the intimate stories of their imagination.”

Del Toro also spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the Oscar nominations. The director remarked on what a landmark moment it was see two fantastical, frightening films ― “The Shape of Water” and Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” ― be recognized by the Academy.

“I say this because Jordan Peele and myself, through different alchemies, have taken the genre and each brought a very different, very personal take,” he said. “I have always been interested in the dark poetics of the genre. And Jordan has evidently been incredibly compelled to tell the story from a different point of view and has elevated it to a parable of social power that I think is unrivaled.”

“This is the year in which the genre takes its place on the stage without being backed by a best-selling book or a literary classic,” he added.

If del Toro takes home the Oscar for Best Director in March, he will be the third Mexican director to win the category in the last five years. Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro G. Iñárritu won the coveted prize in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Del Toro told the Los Angeles Times that Cuarón and Iñárritu gave him pointers about possibly being nominated over dinner on Monday night.(Reuters) - U.S. comedian Bill Cosby performed his first stand-up gig since being swept up in sex scandals, joking in Philadelphia on Monday about his blindness and fueling criticism on social media, according to video posted online.

The 80-year-old entertainer’s appearance at the LaRose Jazz Club marked his first show since 2015 and came ahead of an April retrial for an alleged 2004 sexual assault in suburban Philadelphia.

Cosby, who starred in the 1980s TV series “The Cosby Show,” has seen his family-friendly reputation destroyed by dozens of sexual assault allegations. He has denied assaulting anyone, saying any encounters with his accusers were consensual.

Online video footage showed Cosby wearing a sweatshirt and seated on a stool in the club. Describing people’s reactions when he walks into things he cannot see, Cosby said: “There’s a perfectly good word called ‘stop,’ not ‘oh-oh-oh-oh-oh’,” drawing laughs from the crowd.

Cosby’s show was widely criticized on Twitter, with novelist Terry McMillan saying: “If you gave me front row seats to see Bill Cosby I’d burn them.”

Jeff Romaine tweeted: “NO ONE should ever go see him publicly without bringing a sack full of rotten fruit to throw. I would just feel bad for the fruit.”

Cosby is scheduled go to trial on April 2 on charges that he drugged and assaulted Andrea Constand at his home in the Philadelphia suburb of Cheltenham. His first trial ended in a mistrial in June.

Pennsylvania prosecutors asked the judge in the case last week to allow the testimony of 19 other accusers, including 12 women who were not allowed to testify in the entertainer’s first trial.

During the interview, Williams was asked if she was “bidding for a role as bridesmaid” in her “Game of Thrones” co-star’s big day.

“Oh I’ve already got it!” Williams replied, rolling her eyes at the idea that she wouldn’t be asked. “It’s very, very exciting — but it’s kind of bizarre, though.”

Turner and Jonas announced their engagement in October, but no other details, such as a date, have been announced yet.

Williams added during her interview that Turner will likely wait until after they’re done shooting the upcoming and final season of “Game of Thrones” before she starts making any official wedding plans.

But that doesn’t mean Turner isn’t totally amped about her special day.

“I think she’s already letting her little heart wonder and imagine,” Williams said.

The two actresses, who play sisters on the HBO fantasy series, grew up together on set and have developed a well-documented friendship.

When Republicans passed a historically unpopular tax bill last year, they were banking on the legislation gaining support before this November’s midterm elections.

Several new polls seem to suggest that support for the law is modestly increasing, although the finding is by no means unanimous. Most surveys show opposition to the tax overhaul still outstripping support

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll found about 37 percent of Americans backing the law, up from 28 percent in December. And although it didn’t ask about the legislation directly, a recent CNN/SSRS survey found President Donald Trump’s approval rating on taxes rising to 42 percent, an 8-point increase since December.

“The tax overhaul that Mr. Trump signed into law just before Christmas remains relatively unpopular and highly polarizing. ... But support for the law has grown significantly over the past month, and more Americans believe that they will receive a tax cut,” Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote in The New York Times last week. Their survey found one of the largest shifts.

But other tracking surveys found less movement.

“So far, there has been little overall change in Americans’ majority disapproval of the law or in their views of Congress,” Gallup’s Frank Newport reported earlier this month. “The law’s passage did appear to spark a modest improvement in Republicans’ views of Congress, although it did nothing to affect the quite negative attitudes of Democrats. Similarly, Republicans’ views of the law itself edged up from a month ago when it was still being debated, but a majority of all Americans continue to disapprove.”

HuffPost

After the bill was passed, many pollsters changed their wording in questions about it. The SurveyMonkey/New York Times poll, for example, switched from asking about “the Republican tax reform proposal” to asking about “the tax plan that was passed in December.”

To test whether shedding the word “Republican” could help nudge support for the law upward, the HuffPost/YouGov poll divided respondents into two groups, with half asked about the “tax reform law recently passed by Congress” and the other half about the “Republican tax reform law recently passed by Congress.” The overall results were inconclusive, suggesting that if the word “Republican” has a partisan effect in this context, it’s not a particularly substantial one. Although the group that didn’t get a partisan cue rated the law a few points higher, perceptions of the effect the law would have on them personally were about the same in the two groups.

Averaging the results between the two groups, the HuffPost/YouGov survey found that just 21 percent of Americans expect the law to make things worse for them, down from nearly one-third in December. About one-third now expect it to make things worse for average Americans, down from 41 percent.

Still, public polling this January shows the tax law viewed unfavorably overall, with about 37 percent approval and 43 percent disapproval ― numbers that don’t appear auspicious enough to give Republicans much of a boost in November. The Affordable Care Act, which passed with about 42 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in March 2010, went on to bedevil Democrats in that year’s midterms.

Meade, a former felon who was stripped of his voting rights in Florida, has been leading an initiative to get a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would automatically restore voting rights to former felons. Florida election officials on Tuesday certified that the initiative had garnered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot.

If approved by 60 percent of Florida voters, the measure could have significant consequences in the state, where more than 1.5 million people are disenfranchised because of a felony conviction. That number accounts for about a quarter of the nationally disenfranchised population.

After the announcement, Meade, who was once homeless and now has a law degree, posted a video on Facebook to share his excitement. He described his journey from “being in front of the railroad tracks, getting ready to kill myself, high on crack and homeless” to potentially restoring voting rights to a huge population.

“I know I’m getting a little emotional right now, because only God knows the hard work that was put in to getting to this point,” said Meade, who is the chair of Floridians for a Fair Democracy. “No one thought we would get here, but we’re here. We’re one step closer to liberating and giving over 1.68 million people a shot at redemption, a shot at restoration, a shot at citizenship, regain their citizenship. To know what it feels like to be an American citizen and have their voice heard. Whether they choose to or not, they will have that opportunity. Whoever they vote for, it don’t matter, as long as they have the opportunity to vote.”

Florida is one of just four states that permanently disenfranchises felons. Under the current system, felons who have completely finished their sentences can apply to have their rights restored, but the process is cumbersome and has moved at a glacial pace under Gov. Rick Scott (R).

AdvertisementPeople in Limerick, Ireland, honored local hero Dolores O’Riordan in the most beautifully fitting way Monday night.

Some 200 people gathered in Arthur’s Quay Park to remember the Cranberries’ lead vocalist with a singalong of the band’s biggest tracks. O’Riordan died last Monday at the age of 46. The cause of death has not yet been made public.

Mourners sang the group’s 1993 smash hit “Linger,” as seen in touching footage shared by the “ILOVELIMERICK” Facebook page.

Limerick-based singer Emma Langford defied folks not to “get a little choked up” at a video of people singing the group’s 1996 song “When You’re Gone.”

Because the former *NSYNC member just ruined the hopes and dreams of fans hoping the 1990s boy band would reunite at the Super Bowl during Justin Timberlake’s halftime show.

Fatone threw cold water on that possibility when talking to TMZ over the weekend outside of Delilah, a swanky West Hollywood nightspot.

“I’m here,” he says in the video below. “If I was doing something, I’d be in rehearsals, so, obviously, there’s your proof ― nothing!”

It should be noted that Fatone was wearing an *NSYNC T-shirt during the interview, so maybe he’s not given up the dream just yet.

Still, the “no reunion” song is a different tune than the one Fatone sang in October when he hinted that *NSYNC could reunite on stage at Super Bowl LII.

To be fair, Fatone qualified things by saying all the pieces would have to fall into place, but promised, if everything worked, “Then we do it ... it’s pretty simple.”WASHINGTON ― Democrats in the Senate agreed to reopen the government Monday because, they said, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised that the legislative chamber would take up an immigration bill next month.

But it remains unclear how much of a concession McConnell has actually made.

Many beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― a Barack Obama initiative deferring deportations for immigrants illegally brought to the U.S. as children ― say Democrats simply caved.

“We actually got nothing,” Adrian Reyna of the United We Dream advocacy group said on the HuffPost Politics podcast.

President Donald Trump rescinded the DACA program in September, but gave Congress until March to come up with a legislative solution before the undocumented immigrants ― also known as Dreamers ― would begin losing status in large numbers. If Congress does nothing, some 700,000 Dreamers will lose work permits and face deportation.

McConnell said on the Senate floor Monday that if lawmakers haven’t struck an immigration deal as part of a spending agreement before the current short-term funding bill expires on Feb. 8, he would bring immigration legislation to the Senate floor.

“It would be my intention to take up legislation here in the Senate that would address DACA, border security, and related issues – as well as disaster relief, defense funding, health care, and other important matters,” McConnell said.

McConnell’s remarks amounted to a historic promise, at least according to Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other senators who voted to reopen the government. “This is the first guarantee that the Republican majority will give a DACA bill fair consideration and an up-or-down vote on the floor,” he said.

But it’s a promise McConnell had already made. In December, partly to win him over on the tax bill, McConnell assured Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) that he would bring a DACA bill to the Senate floor this month, which now seems like it won’t happen.

Reporters asked Flake on Monday how he felt about McConnell promising to do something in February that he’d already promised to do in January.

“We didn’t expect to have a government shutdown or this kind of funding crisis,” Flake said. “We’ll be a week off if we get this, and I can live with that.”

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), an immigration hardliner, said McConnell hadn’t really conceded anything.

“Senator McConnell has been perfectly clear since September [that] he will bring an immigration bill to the floor at the right time,” Cotton said, though it’s not clear if McConnell had ever promised a vote before doing so in December.

The fact that McConnell included “related issues” in his promise, Reyna said, means Republicans could pair legal status for Dreamers with something highly unfavorable, such as restrictions on what Republicans call “chain migration” ― the ability of legal permanent residents to sponsor family members still living abroad.

“The other ‘related issues’ is an intentionally broad piece,” Reyna said.

Dreamers maybe shouldn’t have had such high expectations of Democrats, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told HuffPost.

“Particularly when you have a party that supports you controlling no part of government, it is impractical to expect that you’ll be able to dictate terms, so that means what we have to look for is progress,” Whitehouse said.

Still, Whitehouse said Dreamers should be glad that Democrats will get a “winnable vote” on the Senate floor and also “the extent to which Democrats put themselves out there to try to make progress.”

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who voted against the funding bill, pointed out that McConnell could promise Senate floor votes, but that any bill would still need to get through the House of Representatives before it could become law.

“The real question is what will be the commitments from the other chamber, from the House,” Wyden said.The people of Haiti are letting President Donald Trump know exactly how they feel about him reportedly describing their country as a “shithole.”

In the above video, stars Jim Parsons, Matt Bomer, Zachary Quinto and Andrew Rannells give fans a sneak peek at the 50th anniversary production, which opens May 31 at the Booth Theatre.

When it debuted off Broadway in 1968, “The Boys in the Band” broke fresh ground for its portrayal of gay men in the pre-Stonewall era. Written by Mart Crowley, the play follows Michael (Parsons), who is hosting a birthday party for his friend, Harold (Quinto), at an Upper East Side apartment. The celebration begins to go awry with the arrival of Donald (Bomer), who has left New York in hopes of spurning the homosexual “lifestyle,” and Michael’s college friend, Alan (Brian Hutchison), who claims to be straight.

“The Boys in the Band” ran for 1,001 performances in its original incarnation and drew the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Marlene Dietrich. The hotly anticipated 2018 revival is being produced by Ryan Murphy (“Glee,” “American Horror Story”), and marks the first time the play has been staged on Broadway.

Though the play takes place before same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ social advances, Quinto said he believes its inclusive message will resonate with modern audiences at a time when queer rights feel threatened in America’s political climate.

“We’ve come so far in the last five years just legislatively, and yet, there’s been this explosion of backward and harmful thinking and political ideology that swept our country,” the actor said in the video. “We’re responsible for standing up and being acknowledged and celebrating ourselves and celebrating our community in a way that shows these people who are trying to undo the progress we’ve made that we’re not going anywhere.”

Bomer, who is making his Broadway debut, echoed those sentiments. “It’s this group of guys who do have this anger that’s just boiling to the surface,” the Golden Globe winner said. “I think that there are a lot of undercurrents of that particular emotion in our society right now.”A Republican senator accidentally broke a glass elephant with a toss of a “talking stick” during government shutdown negotiations, and people on Twitter can’t get enough of the symbolism.

Collins reportedly asked attendees to speak only when they were in possession of a “talking stick.” But when Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) interrupted Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Alexander threw the stick to him across the room. It inadvertently crashed into Collins’ glass elephant ornament, and chipped it.

Most senators in attendance saw the funny side, according to CNN. Collins ended up swapping the stick with a rubber ball to prevent further damage.

People online couldn’t resist poking fun at the incident — with some citing the breaking of the elephant (the GOP’s symbol is an elephant) as “nicely symbolic.”

Trump over the weekend blamed Democrats for the three-day government shutdown. But during the 2013 shutdown, Trump held former President Barack Obama responsible.

“For each Trump quote, there is an equal and opposite Trump quote,” Meyers said. “And the question of who’s to blame for government shutdowns is no exception, because when Obama was president, Trump was very clear about who was to blame.”

Meyers also noted that there was “literally not one situation where there isn’t an old Trump quote that completely contradicts his current position.”The 2018 Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday morning, and while there were many snubs, one that felt like a dagger through the heart was Michael Stuhlbarg.

Stuhlbarg received nary a nomination this year, most notably in the Best Supporting Actor category, where he seemed like an obvious choice.

You’ve almost certainly seen Stuhlbarg in something, even if you don’t realize it. He had roles in three Best Picture nominees this year ― an achievement so rare that Vulture has named it “Stuhlbarging” (though John C. Reilly, and a few other performers, have done it too).

In just the past year, Stuhlbarg played New York Times executive editor Abe Rosenthal in “The Post,” the duplicitous spy/scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler at a top-secret government lab in “The Shape of Water,” and the impassioned, warm-hearted professor giving his family glorious summers in Italy in “Call Me By Your Name.”

His performance in “Call Me By Your Name” left many weeping ― particularly in one of the film’s final scenes, where he delivers a gorgeously sage speech to his heartsick son, played by Timothee Chalamet.

But despite his incredible cinematic achievement this year, Stuhlbarg went unnoticed by the Academy.

In fact, Stuhlbarg has now been in seven films nominated for Best Picture, with his leading role in Joel and Ethan Coen’s “A Serious Man,” appearances in Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln” and Martin Scorsese’s “Hugo,” and a turn in last year’s alien flick “Arrival” ― all without a single Oscar nomination for himself.

To add insult to injury, Stuhlbarg was cast in 2016’s “Doctor Strange,” much to the excitement of cinephiles ― but then he barely had any screen time, raising the question of why Marvel chose an actor of his caliber for what was essentially a bit part.

Stuhlbarg’s exclusion from this year’s Oscars wasn’t just noticed by us. Fans on Twitter were upset as well:

Stuhlbarg was to have a significant part in “Gore” ― a biopic about author Gore Vidal, starring Kevin Spacey in the title role and Stuhlbarg as Howard Austen, Vidal’s longtime partner ― but that movie has been scrapped following allegations against Spacey of sexual harassment and assault.

But there’s always “The Looming Tower” ― Hulu’s upcoming 10-part series based on Lawrence Wright’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book ― where Stuhlbarg will play former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke.

At some point, we suspect, he will finally manage to Stuhl-barge his way into a nomination himself.SpotMini, the doglike robot that struck fear into the hearts of many when a viral video showed it opening a door, is slated for commercial sale in the not-so-distant future.

Marc Raibert, founder of the company Boston Dynamics, which created the robots, made the announcement Friday at the TechCrunch Sessions robotics conference at the University of California, Berkeley. Raibert said the company intends to manufacture 100 SpotMinis this year as a “prelude” to a “higher rate of production” in preparation for selling the product next year. He didn’t say how much the robot might cost.

The SpotMini made headlines in February after Boston Dynamics published a video titled “Hey Buddy, Can You Give Me a Hand?” The video shows one of the four-legged, yellow-and-black robots with an extendable claw opening a door to allow its companion, a fellow bot lacking the claw, to go through.

The video came just three months after a Wall Street Journal article, headlined “How to Survive a Robot Apocalypse: Just Close the Door,” noted that no robots in a government-sponsored contest had been able to open doors.

Raibert said at the conference that the company designed SpotMini “by thinking about what could go in an office — in a space more accessible for business applications — and then, the home eventually.”

The robot can also navigate spaces autonomously, Wired notes. Basically, once a human operator manually drives the robot around a particular area, the bot can create its own “map” and figure out how to walk over the same location on its own.

A not-at-all-terrifying Boston Dynamics video posted Friday showed the robot doing just that.

So how might people use SpotMini, other than freaking out their neighbors?

Raibert said that the company is developing various applications for the bot, including a “surveillance package” involving “special cameras” that can be mounted on the robot.

Additionally, he sees consumers customizing the bot with their own hardware and software to meet their needs.

“Third parties can develop applications for it,” he said.Jay-Z and his mother Gloria Carter will be honored at the GLAAD Media Awards this year following Carter bravely coming out in her son’s critically acclaimed track “Smile,” GLAAD announced last week.

The Special Recognition category for the awards, which recognize “fair, accurate and inclusive representations” of LGBTQ individuals over the past year, is typically quite varied.

Along with Jay-Z, the animated short “In a Heartbeat” will be honored this year. Last year, honorees included “Her Story,” a short form dramedy series about two trans women in LA, “We’ve Been Around,” a series of short films highlighting trans figures throughout history, and “Sin ir más lejos,” a song by Gema Corredera about queer love.

The song from Jay-Z’s Grammy-nominated album “4:44” was the first time the rapper and his mom openly discussed her lesbian identity. In centering LGBTQ representation, “Smile” stands apart from a genre with an embedded history of homophobia.

Following a sample from Stevie Wonder’s “Love’s in Need of Love Today,” Jay-Z raps the lines, “Mama had four kids, but she’s a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that she’s a thespian” and “Cried tears of joy when you fell in love / Don’t matter to me if it’s a him or her.”

Toward the end of the track, Carter recites a poem about her experience. She writes: “No harm for them, no harm for me / But life is short, and it’s time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn’t guaranteed.”

In September 2017, Carter also spoke about the song and coming out to her son in an interview with the “D’USSE Friday” podcast. For her, the conversation was a long time coming.

“I just finally started telling Jay who I was,” she said. “‘Besides your mother, this is the person that I am. This is the life that I live.’ So my son started actually tearing. He’s like, ‘That had to be a horrible life, ma.’ I was like, my life was never horrible.”

“I was never ashamed of me,” she added.

“Smile” isn’t the first time Jay-Z has spoken out about LGBTQ issues. In 2012, he expressed his support of same-sex marriage during an interview with CNN.

“What people do in their own homes is their business and you can choose to love whoever you love,” he said. “That’s their business. [It] is no different than discriminating against blacks. It’s discrimination plain and simple.”

The song, and much of “4:44,” was presented as an exploration of truth. In other tracks, Jay explores his relationship with toxic masculinity and opens up about his infamous affair. The album currently leads the Grammy pack with 8 nominations, including one for album of the year.Workers on a rubber glove assembly line at a factory in Shandong Province, China. Aly Song/Reuters

Automation will further widen the divide between men and women in the workplace, with more women than men at risk of seeing their jobs displaced, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum.

Released at Davos ― the annual gathering of politicians and business leaders ― the report analyzed nearly 1,000 jobs across the U.S. economy, and its conclusions are bleak.

A predicted 1.4 million U.S. jobs will be at risk from technology and other factors between now and 2026. A shocking 57 percent of these are jobs currently performed by women. It’s yet more bad news for women who are already dealing with a growing gender gap and facing a 217-year wait to have the same job and wage opportunities as men.

While much emphasis has been put on the threat automation poses to men, especially due to the decline in manufacturing jobs, WEF argues this has skewed the view of automation from a gender perspective.

“The narrative tends to focus on male, blue-collar factory workers, for example,” Saadia Zahidi, head of education, gender and work at WEF, told HuffPost. “But there are also a number of very female-dominated roles like secretaries and administrative assistants that are facing displacement.”

Nearly 164,000 female secretaries are at risk, according to the report, compared with 90,000 at-risk male assembly line workers.

Automation is not some distant prospect, of course. It’s already happening, and not just on factory lines and in administrative roles. Robots are expanding into the service sector too. They are already running hotels and delivering take out.

While there are no confirmed plans for a national rollout of the stores yet, this development poses a potential threat to retail jobs. Retail salespeople and cashiers are the top two most common U.S. jobs, employing 7.8 million people collectively. Nearly 74 percent of cashiers are female.

Reskilling is the answer to these tectonic shifts in the job market, according to the report, which says learning new skills will increase workers’ chances of re-employment, likely lead to wage increases and improve their social mobility prospects.

Retraining has the potential to tackle the gender gap too, said Zahidi: “If we took a very deliberate approach to reskilling in which we tried to ensure some of these gender gaps were closed, we’re actually sitting on an opportunity where we can actually accelerate gender parity.”

While the study focused on the U.S. economy, a similar story is unfolding across the world. Emerging economies in Southeast Asia, for example, rely on labor-intensive manufacturing like the garment industry, where women make up the majority of workers. In Cambodia, for example, as many as 88 percent of garment workers ― 81 percent of whom are women ― face displacement through automation, according to an International Labour Organization report.

“Worryingly, many of these female workers come from rural areas and are breadwinners of their families,” said Jae-Hee Chang, co-author of the report.

“Our study showed that technology would impact vulnerable groups of society the most: low-skilled, women, youth and less educated,” Chang said. She called on policymakers to urgently consider what automation will mean for workers and how to ensure they have the skills and education to move into other jobs, for example in retail and tourism

Education is vital, agreed Johannes Moenius, chair of the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis, which released a report last year mapping out who would be hit hardest from automation.

“It’s absolutely key that people are aware that we have entered a time where continuous education, lifelong education is not just political lip service... it’s a requirement for people simply to earn a living,” he told HuffPost.

Days after learning her husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, had been killed by a man who questioned his immigration status, Sunayana Dumala poured her pain out in a widely read Facebook post. She wrote about the love and light her husband had brought into the world and all the dreams they’d had about building a new life in the United States together. But there was a question pulsing underneath all these reflections, an existential anxiety about her place in America’s social fabric that she could not shake. So she ended the post with a question she believed was on every immigrant’s mind after the shooting: “DO WE BELONG HERE?”

Nearly a year after the shooting, Dumala’s answer to that question is a resounding “yes.”

The overwhelming support she has received from her local community, her employer, her congressman and other well-wishers has convinced her that she couldn’t answer it any other way, Dumala told HuffPost.

“I’ve received emails, letters. My Facebook was flooded with messages,” she said. “People have come forward to say, ‘You do belong here, you’re equally a part of us.’”

Now Dumala said it’s her mission to make sure that every immigrant to the United States feels that same assurance of welcome and acceptance.

She has teamed up with her employer, the Kansas-based marketing company Intouch Solutions, to launch a social media campaign that highlights immigrants’ dreams and accomplishments.

On Jan. 16, the volunteer team at Intouch Solutions launched a Facebook page, Forever Welcome, where they plan to feature the stories of immigrants, past and present, who have contributed to American society. So far, the page spotlights two businessmen ― Faruk Capan, a Turkish immigrant who is CEO of Intouch Solutions, and Hamdi Ulukaya, another Turkish immigrant who founded the yogurt company Chobani.

In a video created for the campaign, Dumala’s question ― “Do we belong here?” ― is posed in five different languages. Her response, “Yes,” is shared in the same languages, followed by the affirmation, “You do belong here.”

Dumala said that she hoped highlighting these stories will alleviate people’s insecurities and fears about immigrants and bridge cultural gaps.

Watch Forever Welcome’s video below.

Kuchibhotla was killed on Feb. 22, 2017, during a shooting at a bar in Olathe, Kansas. The suspect, Adam Purinton, reportedly shouted, “Get out of my country,” and yelled ethnic slurs before shooting Kuchibhotla to death and wounding two other men.

Purinton is currently facing state murder charges and federal hate crime charges for his actions. The state charges may lead to life in prison, the Kansas City Star reports, but the federal charges could carry a death sentence.

In the months following her husband’s death, Dumala became an activist in the Indian American community. She has spoken out on the topic of immigration reform and has tried to spread a message of love and unity.Jake Tapper, the CNN host who often calls out President Donald Trump and politicians of both parties, went further afield on Monday to offer his views on the Super Bowl. Well, on one team in particular.

“The Patriots are cheaters, Brooke,” he told CNN colleague Brooke Baldwin. “The Patriots cheat. This is just a fact as established by investigations. They’re a cheating team. .. I mean, the facts speak for themselves.”

Forget about TRUMP, @JakeTapper is FINALLY speaking truth to power on THE most important issue of the day: "The @Patriots are cheaters, @BrookebCNN. The Patriots cheat.

Tapper posted a photo of him in team garb attending the Philadelphia Eagles’ NFC title win over the Vikings with his father on Sunday. So clearly the guy has his bias as his favorite team prepares to face the Patriots in the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.

I want to thank the @Eagles for inviting me and my pop, who turns 78 this year, to that AMAZING game last night.

But using his national television platform to presumably call out the Patriots over their major cheating scandals, Deflategate and Spygate?

Heck, why not.

His CNN associate, Patriots fan John Berman, hit back on Twitter and a fun little social media scrimmage ensued.A little over a year ago, the Rev. Franklin Graham offered a Bible reading at President Donald Trump’s inauguration. He took the rain that fell that day as a sign of God’s blessing on the new president.

After Trump’s first tumultuous year in the White House, Graham is still firmly on the president’s side.

Graham, son of the famous evangelist Billy Graham and president of the international Christian relief organization Samaritan’s Purse, appeared on Fox & Friends on Sunday to tout what he believes Trump accomplished during his first year.

Graham painted Trump as a defender of Christianity, someone who is standing up for Christians at a time when, the 65-year-old pastor said, the religion is being persecuted around the world.

“The world is attacking Christians because they hate the name of Christ. And President Trump has been defending Christians,” Graham said. “I find this refreshing to have a president who’s not afraid to say Jesus, he’s not afraid to have prayers where people end in the name of Jesus.”

“We’ve never had this, not in my lifetime, and he defends the Christian faith more than any president in my lifetime.“

“Whether you’re an atheist, whether you’re a Catholic, whether you’re a Protestant, a Jew, it doesn’t matter. We all are benefiting from this man,” Graham said.

He also applauded the president for being able to work under intense scrutiny from the “left,” which Graham claimed is trying to force Trump out of office in a “digital coup d’état.”

Graham’s conservative religious views and his support of Trump have sparked criticism from some of his fellow Christians. He’s made inflammatory remarks about Islam, calling it an “very evil and wicked religion.” In a 2015 Facebook post, he proposed banning Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. Months later, Trump proposed his own ban.

Graham also has defended Trump’s plans to drastically curb refugee admission to the U.S. Asked last year by HuffPost about reconciling Trump’s temporary ban on refugees with the Christian commandment to welcome, clothe and feed the stranger and to be a good Samaritan, Graham replied that he did’t see a conflict.

“It’s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that’s not a Bible issue,” he said.

More than 500 prominent evangelical leaders disagreed with that interpretation of Christian charity and signed a letter denouncing Trump’s executive order on immigration.

In addition, Graham holds deeply conservative Christian views on sexuality and often rails against the “sinful, destructive, anti-God agenda of the LGBTQ” on his Facebook page.

But if his appeal of a July corruption conviction is upheld, he'll likely be banned from the race. Ricardo Moraes / Reuters

He was, as former President Barack Obama once said, “the most popular politician on Earth.” But now, former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva finds himself locked in a battle to save his legacy and preserve his future ― which he hopes will soon include another stint as his nation’s chief executive.

On Wednesday, da Silva and his lawyers will return to court to appeal his July conviction on charges of political corruption ― a case that threatens to derail his potential candidacy in elections later this year.

But da Silva and his legal team are confident they will win, with one of his top lawyers arguing that the former president is the victim of a political witch hunt.

“Lula is not being prosecuted but persecuted ― politically persecuted,” Valeska Zanin Martins, da Silva’s co-counsel, told HuffPost. If his conviction ultimately stands, “we are absolutely certain that it is an international legal scandal that should be reviewed internationally and historically,” she said.

From 2003 to 2011, da Silva held watch over one of the world’s fastest-growing economies that ― coupled with his enactment of ambitious social welfare programs ― helped lift nearly 40 million Brazilians out of poverty.

But since he left office, Brazil has fallen into a state of perpetual crisis: under his hand-picked successor, former President Dilma Rousseff, the economy collapsed. And one of the world’s largest and broadest corruption scandals ― known as Operation Car Wash ― erupted, engulfing hundreds of Brazilian politicians in the process.

Da Silva ― known to Brazilians simply as “Lula” ― was among them. He is facing four separate corruption charges. Only one case has gone to trial, however, and in July Judge Sérgio Moro, who has spearheaded the Car Wash probes, convicted da Silva.

Moro alleged that the former president orchestrated a vast bribery scheme involving da Silva’s leftist Workers’ Party, the Brazilian construction firm OAS, and Petrobras, the country’s state-owned oil giant. Da Silva, according to prosecutors, took more than $1 million in bribes and personally benefited by gaining access to a beachside apartment in Guarujá, a coastal town in São Paulo state.

During the hearing on Wednesday, a panel of judges in the southern city of Porto Alegre will hear ― and could rule on ― da Silva’s appeal. The decision could have sweeping ramifications not just for him, but for Brazil. Da Silva’s the front-runner in early polls for Brazil’s 2018 presidential election. Brazilian law, however, bars anyone convicted of corruption from seeking office.

Zanin Martins argued that da Silva’s appeal of the corruption conviction is less about his future political ambitions than about clearing the stain it has put on his name and his record.

“He’s an innocent man,” Zanin Martins said. “He wants his biography cleared, of course. He said he will run for president. But it’s even more about clearing his name and making sure that history will see him for what he is, and not for what the Car Wash Operation invented.”

Still, the political ramifications of da Silva’s case are impossible to ignore. The 2018 elections have loomed over Brazil since Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016 — a takedown her leftist allies saw as a “legislative coup” by centrist and conservative lawmakers eager to put an end to more than a decade of Workers’ Party rule.

President Michel Temer, who inherited the top office from Rousseff, has quickly gone about eroding the left’s accomplishments: He has gotten passed drastic austerity measures that have cut health and education spending, pushed broad labor reforms the left derides as attack on workers, ended certain social welfare programs, and sought major reforms to Brazil’s generous public pension system.

Couple that with the economic collapse, and much of the Brazil that da Silva helped build has disappeared: the unemployment rate has improved of late but remains above 12 percent, 4.5 million have been cut from the rolls of one popular social welfare program, and the country is at risk of sinking back onto the United Nations World Hunger Map, which would erase one of da Silva’s proudest achievements.

In part because of his policies, and in part because of his own link to the corruption scandal, Temer’s comically low approval numbers place him among least popular politicians in the world — and have bolstered da Silva’s standing and chances of reclaiming the presidency next fall.

Da Silva’s conviction, however, sent a shockwave across Brazil. It was a sign, many observers said, that a new era had dawned in which no one, not even a popular former president, could engage in corruption and get away with it.

“It’s the president that took Brazil to relevance,” Alana Rizzo, a U.S.-based Brazilian journalist, told HuffPost at the time. “That’s the figure that [internationally] people know. When you have this guy getting convicted, now anyone can get convicted.”

But da Silva and his rabid base of supporters saw it differently. Though Car Wash and other corruption investigations have implicated politicians from across the political spectrum, they alleged that this was not indicative of a strong, independent judiciary hellbent on forcing good governance on Brazil. It was, along with Rousseff’s impeachment, instead an opportunistic power play: a chance for Brazil’s political and financial elite to thwart the nation’s primary leftist party and its strongest leaders whose only crime, in this version of events, was redistributing too much of their money to the poor and working classes.

Zanin Martins said the facts of the corruption case support da Silva’s innocence. Da Silva and his wife never owned the apartment that factors into the case, the lawyer argues. She also noted that more than 70 witnesses absolved da Silva of guilt during his trial. His lawyers also assert that Moro tainted the trial by illegally leaking da Silva’s phone conversations to the media.

“If you look at the overwhelming evidence of innocence that we have produced in the files, it is impossible for an impartial or independent trial not to acquit Lula, or at least to declare the entire procedure null and void.” Zanin Martins said.

Da Silva’s opponents have blasted him for his zealous appeal efforts, suggesting that he is undermining the judiciary’s political independence and the anti-corruption efforts. But Zanin Martins said da Silva, whose previous presidential campaigns were rooted in opposition to corruption, still supports broad efforts to fight the sort of political bribery that Car Wash has exposed as rampant across Brazil.

It’s just that this case, she said, is the wrong way to do it.

Da Silva is “not above the law, but he’s not beneath the law,” Zanin Martins said. “He wants a fair trial, because a fair and impartial trial would lead, again, to his acquittal.”

Da Silva’s corruption conviction has polarized Brazil: Protests erupted against the decision after it was announced it July, and were followed by counter-protests supporting Moro’s actions and the Car Wash investigations, which remain broadly popular.

But even some of da Silva’s most vociferous political opponents have suggested that he shouldn’t face jail time, or a ban from future elections. In 2016, former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a long-time da Silva rival, said that voters, not judges, should determine da Silva’s fate ― an assertion da Silva’s supporters have used to bolster their claims that his conviction should be overturned and he should be allowed to run.

“We cannot politicize the judiciary, or judicialize politics,” Zanin Martins insisted. “Politics are disputed in the ballot box, and should not be disputed in courts.”

Brazilian political observers have reached nothing near consensus about how the panel of judges may rule.

Whatever the outcome, it is clear that da Silva’s time as Brazil’s most prominent political figure won’t end quietly. He and his legal team have already filed a complaint with the United Nations human rights committee, alleging that Moro and Brazil have violated his right to a fair trial. They’ve lobbied, successfully, for global political support: over the weekend, a group of U.S.House Democrats sent a letter to Brazil’s ambassador to the United States on da Silva’s behalf.

If his conviction is upheld, da Silva is prepared to exhaust his legal remedies both “nationally and internationally,” Zanin Martins said.

And no matter what, the former president ― for the moment, still the most popular politician in Brazil, if no longer on Earth ― intends to continue his latest pursuit of the presidency.
