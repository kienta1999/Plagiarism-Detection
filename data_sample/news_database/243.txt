Canadian ice dancing power duo Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir broke a world record on Sunday at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earning the highest score ever in the short program.

The couple, skating to a saucy routine that featured The Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil,” an acoustic version of the Eagles’ “Hotel California” and Santana’s “Oye Como Va,” received a score of 83.67.

That score broke their previous world record, 82.68, set at Skate Canada last year.

Virtue and Moir are in first place in ice dancing at the 2018 Olympics. A win would be their second gold medal at this year’s games. They also took home gold at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, and silver at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Of their achievement on Sunday, Moir said to NBC: “To go out and connect and perform like that, that’s why we came back.”

Moir showed his happiness post-skate with a leap:

Twitter also took part in joy for the ice dancers:

The charismatic figure skater will not be joining NBC as a contributor, the network confirmed to HuffPost, after Rippon clarified the news during a Monday morning interview from Pyeongchang, South Korea.

“I am so flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent,” Rippon said on NBCSN. “But if I took this opportunity, I would have to leave the Olympic team and I would have to leave the [Olympic] Village.”

He continued, “It’s so important to me, you know, I worked so hard to be on this Olympic team, and my teammates and my friends were there for me during my events, and that meant so much to me, that I really feel like I need to be there for them during their events as well.”

He echoed the comment later on Twitter.

I am flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent for them here in PyeongChang. Doing this would require me to leave Team USA and move out of the Olympic Village. I don't want to do that so I had to declined the opportunity. — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 19, 2018

I love being on Team USA and representing our country. My teammates were there for me during my events, and now I NEED to be there for them. I look forward to being with them, and I’m very excited for the rest of the competition. Go Team USA!!! — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 19, 2018

I actually found everything out about the offer via twitter HAHA 😂😂 2018 is wild girl — Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 19, 2018

USA Today’s Christine Brennan, who previously reported Rippon was joining the network, tweeted a similar sentiment, saying a source told her Rippon didn’t want to “relinquish his official Olympic standing ... and miss the closing ceremony.” According to Brennan, Rippon agreed to the gig but later turned it down after learning how he’d have to separate from the team.

After agreeing to an offer to work for NBC, Adam Rippon @Adaripp decided overnight that he would rather remain as an Olympian, source telling me. Didn’t want to

NBC did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Interior first adopted a flag in 1917. Over the last 100 years, the bison seal, and presumably the flag, have twice been replaced — first with an eagle in the 1920s, and later to an image of hands holding the sun, mountains and water in the late 1960s. But both times the flag has reverted to the bison.

The last person to make a change to the seal was James Watt, President Ronald Reagan’s controversial, pro-drilling Interior secretary, who in 1982 temporarily turned the bison so that it would face to the right — a move The New York Times described at the time as “a partisan posture in keeping with his conservative views.”

In a speech to staff his second day on the job, Zinke said he wanted to restore the public’s trust in Interior and for the agency “to be the best department in the government.” He stressed the importance of teamwork and said he doesn’t care about his employees’ political beliefs, only that they love America and the department.

But internal emails and interviews with current and former employees have done little to paint a picture of a happy workforce.

Zinke came under fire in September when, during a speech to an oil industry group, he said: “I got 30 percent of the crew that’s not loyal to the flag.” The comment was met with outrage, including from a trio of groups representing retired Interior employees, who called the remarks “disrespectful,” “divisive,” “ludicrous” and “deeply insulting.”Marvel’s “Black Panther” is not just a movie, it’s a cultural moment. So it’s not surprising that a Brooklyn man in a full “Black Panther” costume proposed in the middle of the theater minutes before the movie started on Thursday night.

Fans across the country have flocked to the movie theaters on opening weekend to watch their favorite superhero come to life. Some have even dressed in traditional Wakanda attire, but this “Black Panther” superfan made his girlfriend’s screening one she will remember for the rest of her life.

Moviegoers at Brooklyn’s Alamo Drafthouse caught the moment just as the man got on one knee.

Wow I'm at @alamodrafthouse in #Brooklyn and dude just proposed to his girl, just wow only #InWakanda #WakandaForever — Seven, the Tenth Man (@7Akil) February 16, 2018

Akil Kamau was at the theater to see the film when it all went down. He shared details with Yahoo Lifestyle about the exciting moment of the surprise proposal.

“The atmosphere in the entire place was straight Black love and pride from the lobby to the theater, nothing but hugs, smiles, natural hair, and dashikis,” he says.

“Then the sister to my left was ‘OMG he’s proposing!’” says Kamau. “I look further to my left and see dude and his girl standing up, and the phones start coming out flashing and recording.”

Another Twitter user was able to capture the special moment:

Kamau continues: “Folk were ‘awwww-ing’ and the excitement was building,” he adds. “Then someone said, ‘she said yes!’ and everyone started clapping and taking more pics.”

Here’s the touching video after she said “yes.”

So this couple just got engaged in my #BlackPanther viewing!

“There were some funny, positive, comments made and the entire audience was fully supportive,” says Kamau. “Nobody was expecting it at all.”

According to one witness, the boyfriend knew his woman would be there with her friends, leaving soon after the proposal because he did not have a ticket to watch the movie.

But the girlfriend wasn’t left to celebrate alone. “She was there with her friends receiving hugs and whatnot,” says Kamau.

Although the couple’s identity has not been revealed yet, we do know the entire theater exploded in cheers and applause congratulating them for their engagement.

Mike Sampson is the marketing manager of Alamo Drafthouse Brooklyn. He tells Yahoo Lifestyle that they did not catch either of their names but are in the process of reaching out.

“She accepted and we brought the happy couple some Champagne for a toast,” says Sampson. “The gentleman wanted to let her continue to enjoy her girls’ night, so after a quick kiss, he left the theater as the movie was about to begin.”

Kamau summarizes the sweet proposal: “It was surely a great moment in black love history.”

Congratulations to the newly engaged couple!Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has given Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther” the highest possible praise.

“The movie finished, and I looked over at Ryan and said, ‘That’s the best movie we’ve ever made,’” Feige recalled in an interview with ABC News’ “Nightline” that aired last week.

No “Black Panther” sequel has been announced yet, but Feige has said he “absolutely” wants Coogler to return to direct one.PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The Alpine skiing team event looks like lacking in star quality when it makes its Olympic debut in Pyeongchang this week after Lindsey Vonn became the latest high-profile athlete to say she probably won’t be taking part.

The inaugural team event is scheduled for Saturday as the climax to the program and will bring mixed sex competition, knockout racing and parallel skiing to the Olympic Alpine slopes for the first time.

Marcel Hirscher, who has claimed two gold medals in Pyeongchang, ruled out competing for Austria before the start of the Olympics because he felt it would compromise his bid to win a seventh successive World Cup overall title.

Norwegian speed racers Aksel Lund Svindal, the men’s downhill champion, and Kjetil Jansrud have headed back to Europe after the completion of their individual events.

American Teg Ligety said he would race in the event if overall World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin did, but on Sunday he confirmed his run in the men’s giant slalom had brought an end to his Pyeongchang Olympics.

“I was an absolute no before but I was thinking about it,” Vonn said on Monday.

“But now Ted’s gone and Mikaela is not doing it and so I don’t really think we have a strong chance of getting a medal since none of our top athletes are doing it so I probably won’t.”

Hirscher, favorite to win a third gold in the men’s slalom on Thursday, had said competing in the team event would allow him insufficient time to get to Slovenia for the resumption of the World Cup next week.

“It would be a big honor to start for Austria but... it is not possible,” the 28-year-old said.

“If you do the team event, four days later you are back in Europe at Kranjska Gora in the giant slalom, no time for preparation, no time for recovery, no time for getting used to European time.

“So, it would be great to be there but if I’m professional, it is not possible.”

The team event, an attempt by the governing International Ski Federation to refresh the Alpineprogram, will be contested by 16 teams on a knockout basis with the winners of the final round taking gold."Just take the damn meeting and pretend you’re disarming so we can keep this stooge in the White House for another term. When democracy is dead we’ll give you a seat at the grown-up’s table. You'll be even more famous than the Kim with the big ass." pic.twitter.com/cnDGi6jGYtNothing quite prepared Andy Slavitt for the pile-on that he endured from the online left earlier this month.

For years, Slavitt had enjoyed a technocrat’s exemption from personal political drama. The 51-year-old Minnesotan founded a successful digital health care company, held a top post at a health insurance giant and went on to lead the rescue of the Affordable Care Act’s website.

Most recently, the former Obama administration Medicare and Medicaid chief served as de facto point man in the public and private fight to protect the ACA from Republican repeal efforts.

But when he unveiled the United States of Care, a bipartisan health care initiative that would advance the cause of universal coverage by “putting health care over politics,” progressive activists pilloried him.

Slavitt’s critics saw the new nonprofit organization as, at best, yet another naive attempt at transcending partisan politics and, at worst, a corporate-backed Trojan horse designed to suck the air out of the nascent movement for single-payer health care. It certainly didn’t help matters that the group’s founding council included insurance and hospital executives, former Republican lawmakers and veteran conservative policy experts.

I shared many progressives’ suspicions about the strategy and motivation undergirding a group whose three principles included a rule that affordable health care policies must be “fiscally responsible and win the political support needed to ensure long-term stability.”

So I decided to press Slavitt on some of these questions in an interview.

“We can work alongside advocates of all stripes.” - Andy Slavitt, the United States of Care

Slavitt claimed that he had no illusions about overcoming the political or ideological barriers to universal coverage in Congress or Donald Trump’s White House.

“It doesn’t make any sense to spend any energy right now at the federal level,” Slavitt said. “There is a logjam that’s not going to get broken before 2020.”

Instead, the United States of Care aims to serve as a kind of brain trust and troubleshooting resource for state governments seeking to expand coverage. A potential target audience for the group’s work might include Republican governors who have proved less inimical to Medicaid expansion. Some states are also struggling to forge health care compromises between Democratic governors and Republican legislatures, and vice versa.

Thus far, the United States of Care’s modest body of work reflects this mission. The group’s first paper is a nine-page primer on efforts to expand health insurance coverage in Massachusetts, Vermont, Colorado, California and Nevada. The pamphlet analyzes what made each effort fail or succeed from a policy and political perspective. For example, it claims that the single-payer bill that passed the California Senate last year faced political opposition because of the lack of a concrete plan to finance it.

Slavitt maintains that it is not his intention to get in the way of the “Medicare for all” movement, and he sees his work as a complement rather than a substitute for all kinds of universal health care advocacy.

“We can work alongside advocates of all stripes.”

He envisions the group being as willing to provide supportive policy and political advice to the effort to pass a state-level single-payer plan in Washington state as it is to help implement more modest coverage expansion initiatives in places like Virginia.

To achieve this goal, he hopes to hire a staff of experienced policy experts and political hands to advise state governments. The people on the founders’ council, he emphasized, will help open doors for the group but not conduct its research.

“The reality is there’s unsexy hard work that hasn’t happened on the ground to get these things passed, and those are things that the people we’re hoping to hire, and have hired already, understand well,” he said.

I asked whether he could be trusted not to rule out certain policy options, given the blessing that health care industry players and Republicans have bestowed on his group.

Slavitt maintained that the group was “not beholden to anyone.” To that end, he said, it would not take money from insurance companies, for-profit corporations or political action committees.

The assertion is hard to verify, however, since United States of Care is declining to name its donors unless they choose to identify themselves. Thus far, Slavitt; Dr. J. Mario Molina, CEO of Golden Shore Medical Group; and the Catholic nonprofit hospital Providence St. Joseph’s Health have disclosed their financial support for the organization.

I also asked him to respond to skeptics who believe that a fund he has started to invest in health care innovations for low-income people represents a conflict of interest.

“I don’t think [my investment fund] has anything to do with my role as a board member of the United States of Care,” he said.

Ventures that try to get beyond partisanship are almost a kind of cottage industry in D.C. No Labels is probably the best example. Many people would argue that those ventures either die a natural death or they stick around but don’t have a major effect on the policy conversation. Why is your venture different?

Andy Slavitt: I would actually agree with that characterization. I’m no fan of bipartisanship for bipartisanship’s sake.

What I am a fan of is trying to figure out how we move the country past where we’ve lived [during] the past year, which is having constant needs of the American public that are ignored while, at the same time, no ability to have any way to break past the politics of the issue. And so we’ve never been further apart as a country from what the people of the country demand and what the politics are delivering.

So, to be clear, this is not an organization that is about assembling people from all points of view and siphoning out the lowest common denominator of ideas. This is about a commitment to putting the tangible ideas behind the passion that Americans have for health care and trying to get policies changed.

OK, so you come up with a policy with a group of folks. It might not be a policy that Bernie Sanders or other members of the progressive left think is awesome or ideal. But it’s a bipartisan policy. But there’s a reason that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell aren’t on the board of your organization ...

You’re asking questions without having listened to my prior answer, which is this is not a group that is coming out with policies. Go back and listen to the first thing I said. This is not a group that is a policymaking body.

If you’re referring to the founders’ council, this is a group that said, “We need to break this jam.” They have a wide variety of their own opinions and solutions of which we couldn’t even chronicle, from the first lady of New York to people who have very different types of solutions. There is no possible way, nor is it our desire, to get that group to come to a consensus on policy. What we hope they will be is experts and resources for us when we need them, when we’re trying to get things done.

We may be, for example, working in a state that has a Republican legislature or a Democratic governor, or vice versa. We may be working in a whole variety of settings, and we want to demonstrate to people that we are focused on their interests and then turn them into good policy ideas.

I think a lot of people bring a lot of passion to health care. It is the most personal of all issues. And I think people are reading into the formation of our group some things that they’re reading into because they were unclear [about the group’s goals], which is understandable. And some are things that they’re reading in because they have passion for the issue and think that it’s set up to do things that it’s not intended to do.

To be very clear, our aim is to get every American health care coverage. And you can say that, but people will parse everything you say to say, “Well, that’s coverage, that’s not care,” or you can say, “It should be affordable,” or you say the word “access,” and everybody reads into all these words.

But go back and look at my Twitter feed for the last year. It’s not hard to figure out what I believe in.

You talk about states experimenting with this stuff, but Congress seems like a totally different animal.

And I think the reason this gets under people’s skin is that they basically saw eight years under Obama where people talk about this metaphor of “Lucy and the football” ― where Democrats would try to operate in good faith, whether it was on Obamacare in the [Senate] Finance Committee and how long that sat there, or on the Grand Bargain on the deficit and the debt. And the second Democrats would move to proverbially kick the football, it would get pulled away.

I wonder how effective taking politics away is when you have a Republican Party, at least in Congress, that refuses to take politics out of the equation and really doesn’t share the fundamental end goals?

And not only that, there’s been asymmetric polarization, so if you’re trying to reach a compromise with them and they’re continuing to move to the right, then compromise continues to move to the right as well.

Those are very fair questions, and it’s one of the reasons why it doesn’t make any sense to spend any energy right now at the federal level. There is a logjam that’s not going to get broken before 2020. Let me be clear: We don’t think we’re going to change that underlying politics for the moment.

Here’s the exciting thing: Over 70 percent of the people in both parties, or independents ― forget politicians, forget Washington for a second ― believe that every American should be able to have access to affordable health care coverage. That is very far from where the conversation in Washington is.

Our message is not that politics are not important. Our message is that when politics work, politics represent the needs of the public. And there’s a variety of reasons why they don’t right now. And we could probably go through a litany of them, and they include things that are far outside of health care. It has to do with things that you and I could probably both identify: the way money works in politics, the way districts are drawn ― all these things that are making us more polarized.

My perspective is that we can’t afford to live in that situation. I’ll give it to you numerically: There were 22 Republicans that voted no on the House bill [to repeal the ACA]. There were three senators. Imagine if that 22 were 40? Imagine if that three were 10? And those aren’t unimaginable things. Now they’re unimaginable in the next two years. But they’re not unimaginable over the long term, particularly if the populace of the American public makes it very, very clear that that’s where we need to go.

We’ve seen this happen in other areas. We’ve seen this happen with marriage equality. We’ve seen this happen with lots of things that have changed over time, which is that the politics won’t change on their own. In fact, you could make the case that they’ll get worse on their own. But what I think is quite possible over the next medium term, not near term, is that we have a fundamental shift over how politicians are forced to think about these issues because the public is pretty firmly in this camp.

Will you campaign for Democrats in the 2018 midterms?

Yes, I am. I am hosting something for [Randy Bryce, an ironworker who seeks to challenge Ryan in his Wisconsin House district this November] at my house shortly. I just wrote a letter for [Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke] in Texas. I just wrote a letter for a candidate in Georgia.

I’m personally very active. Now that’s of course separate from my role as head of a nonpartisan organization. But who I am doesn’t change at all. Look at my Twitter feed the last few days? I haven’t changed who I am.

But I do believe that we need to get a force multiplier if we are going to change the equation in this country. I personally am very excited by all of the energy on this topic. I want to digest it and understand it all and figure out how to turn that into real victories.

So you do see taking back Congress and ultimately taking back the White House as a part of the policy solution here?

No one’s confused about what political party I’m in. No one’s ever been confused about that. No one’s ever going to be confused about that. And I’ve never given anyone a reason to be confused about that, so there you go.

It’s interesting that you mentioned marriage equality as a model you want to emulate. “Chapo Trap House,” a popular left-wing podcast, spent a lot of time criticizing your group. And they likened the push for ‘Medicare for all’ to the same-sex marriage fight ― that if you continue canvassing and building grassroots support, and educating people on the need to at least treat health care as a human right and, in their opinion, to make it free at the point of service, that, maybe not in two years or in four years but in 10 or 20 years, you’ll ultimately achieve your goal. And, in the meantime, you’ll move the Overton window, or range of politically acceptable views, to the left.

You’re someone with an enormous platform, and it seems like there’s an opportunity for you to also participate in this moving of the Overton window by backing a specific set of policies and maybe ones that are too radical for the current spectrum.

I don’t disagree with where [Chapo Trap House and other leftist groups are coming from]. I mean, I hesitate to understand why they are criticizing an organization that’s three days old. But that’s fine. I think the organization will learn from its critics.

But ultimately wanting to get to a place where everybody has coverage ― the way I think about it is, if my kid was lost in the park and I called the police, they would immediately start searching for him. They wouldn’t ask for my insurance card and my co-payment or any of those sorts of things. That’s the world that I think most Americans believe we need to live in ― where they’re not risking their financial security because of health care.

OK, well, what are the precursors to making that happen? I think there’s a couple. And everyone is free to agree or disagree with these, but one of them for us is indeed tapping into that body politic. A second is building models in states that can be replicated at the federal level much in the same way that [the Massachusetts health care law under then-Gov. Mitt Romney] was in the ACA.

And we see loads of opportunities and, quite frankly, loads of threats. If I look at what Sprinkle Care [a Medicaid buy-in proposal] was in Nevada last year, if I look at what’s potentially going to be on the ballot in Washington state, if I look at what potentially Virginia’s going to be considering, if I look at what New Mexico is trying to do ― if we can get some of those things done in the short term, then they can be helpful to the longer term.

And I think the one thing that this organization is wise to do is not say that there’s a single answer. Because the reality is I’ve assisted Sanders’ staff on their bill, I’ve read [H.R.] 676, I’ve read the [Sen. Tim] Kaine’s bills. I’ve read all the bills [pending in Congress that would expand health care coverage]. And nobody would say we’re yet at a point where we have a single answer.

And that’s the great news: Because we’re probably years away from looking at what’s going to be considered, we have time to mold it, we have time to shape it.

Right, but it takes time to build a political movement. So people have a rallying flag [in “Medicare for all”] they think is very exciting to people, and they see that laying the groundwork for a whole variety of different things.

I don’t think this works against it. The reality is, there’s unsexy hard work that hasn’t happened on the ground to get these things passed, and those are things that the people we’re hoping to hire, and have hired already, understand well.

I think we can work alongside advocates of all stripes.”

One of the things that progressives look at in the Affordable Care Act is that they see something like the Medicaid expansion as the most successful part of the law precisely because it was unafraid to circumvent the private insurance industry. You talked about those 22 House Republicans who voted against repeal and the three in the Senate ― it was basically because of Medicaid expansion, and that was the most progressive part of the law.

Isn’t there at least a policy lesson there that the old RomneyCare/Obamacare, private insurance marketplace that is now being so viciously torn apart by Republican majorities is less politically sustainable than kind of a straight, liberal reform that people understand, that’s simple, that hasn’t been unaffordable for people?

I think that’s right. But look, if you want to tell your readers that Medicaid expansion is a public program and not private sector, go ahead and tell them that. You know that’s wrong.

But I do think there is truth to the fact that governors saw how well this worked in their states and understand that going backwards on that would be a horrible mistake. And I think that’s exactly the kind of momentum that needs to be built.

You don’t think that provides any policy lessons about the sorts of expansion that work best?

I do, I absolutely do. And look, I’m not, in the context of my prior comment, I wasn’t defending the ACA per se as the ideal. I actually think it’s kind of moved beyond where we’ve been.

We have to begin with what we have to do to get the outcome we want. And I think there should be participation and debate that we haven’t been able to have over the last seven, eight years because we’ve been playing defense against keeping the law standing up. It’s time to move past that and try to create a positive vision.

Your point is an excellent one, which is not one the United States of Care is in any way in opposition to, which is to say: What are the best ideas? What are the simplest ideas? What are the ones that make the most sense? I think it would be completely wrong to characterize the United States of Care to be against something that has those kinds of features.

Those have been wins. I’ve spent a lot of time with governors of both parties who would agree with you. The question is, how do you take that consensus, how do you take that lesson and how do you turn it into larger-scale wins and what’s applicable in the states, what’s applicable in different states, what’s applicable at the federal level? Those are all battles to be fought. And I think this is an organization that can hopefully be useful to that.

But keep in mind, this is not an organization that is in place of any of the other efforts. I think it hopes to assist in helping to get some of these things done.

One of the reasons that people are concerned that United States of Care will at least be constrained in terms of the sorts of options it will be able to promote is because of the presence of people from the private insurance industry who might not have a stake in certain kinds of solutions.

Yeah, so, well, we made a couple of important decisions. First of all, I understand the concern. So that’s something we are supportive of ― to make sure that we address that to people’s satisfaction.

The best 501(c)(3)s [the IRS designation for nonprofits] have highly diverse sources of funding. They’re not dependent on anybody. Nobody gets a chance to sway policy. And, you know, you’ve got to give the organization time to demonstrate that, but we’re taking lessons from the best of them. We felt it’s important not to take money from insurance companies, not to take money from for-profits, from PACs. Those are important.

And I think what’s important is to see the proof in the pudding. So, people are concerned ― they’re going to remain concerned until such time as the organization has the opportunity to do its work.

You said the proof will be in the pudding. What would the pudding look like in a few of the states where United States of Care is going to be active?

We still have a small number of people, and they’re still around getting outreach from states.

In the past three or four days, one of the really good things that’s happened is that a bunch of the people in states who are working on really exciting initiatives have sent us a bunch of information about it. I haven’t had a chance to evaluate it all. The team is still evaluating it.

But there are exciting things going on in Washington state. There are exciting things going on in New Mexico.

I will tell you that what Oregon did with their Medicaid program was highly innovative. I thought personally what [Assemblyman] Mike Sprinkle did in Nevada had shown a lot of promise.

The devil’s in the details. These are all things that sound good, but most of them don’t get over the finish line for one reason or another. We have to study why that happens and make that work.

The truth is most of this stuff is not that controversial. Most Americans want everybody to have the health care they need. It still isn’t happening. It still is not easy. So this organization has got to be about figuring out why.

It ultimately will be less defined by the policy positions, because I think the policy positions it’s going to support are going to be very much in line with where the public is. It’s going to be successful in changing our track record where most things just aren’t seemingly able to get done for one reason or another. [The group] helps them get done, and of course that means in partnership with all of those great advocates out there.

One of the principles of United States of Care references fiscal responsibility. The GOP just blew a $1.5 trillion hole in the budget. Fiscal hawks have also been warning about deficit issues for years, and the Fed keeps missing its 2 percent inflation target.

Isn’t fiscal responsibility as a static concept or end in itself dead as a political goal? And, if not, shouldn’t it just depend on whether inflation is a problem at a given moment?

Here’s the thing with the economics of it: We spend $10,000 per person in this country on health care. And so we have to recognize that the way we pay for prescription drugs, the way we do Medicare Advantage bidding, the way we do lots and lots of things are done in ways that aren’t necessarily getting the best deal for the taxpayer or the consumer.

That’s not meant to be an exhaustive list. We published a paper, which I’m sure you’ve read, that looked at the five or six efforts toward either single payer or universal coverage, we published last week, and looked at what went well, what didn’t go well and are there any lessons to learn. One of the lessons to learn was unless you have a financing strategy, [passing reforms] becomes [a challenge].

So, I think what we’re saying here is not Washington-speak for “everything must be paid for,” but it’s the fact that we can’t provide our citizens and our residents of our country what we want if we don’t focus on costs, if we don’t focus on the fact that an emergency room visit costs several thousand dollars, etc., etc.

Do you think antitrust is a part of that toolkit? Because people look at how concentrated the drug industry, the hospital industry, the insurance industry are, and they say that that is one of the key drivers of costs.

Let me just say this, because I think it’s important to say this clearly: We’re not beholden to anybody except the right answer for the American public.

What I would tell you is, when you end up, as you had with the ACA and almost every other law, where ... the insurance companies and pharma companies are sitting around the table quote-unquote bargaining for the end game, who represents the American public in that bargain?

And the reality is that we felt like that voice wasn’t strong enough. I spent this last summer doing town halls across the country ― I did 15 town halls in districts where congresspeople had refused to hold town halls ― in order to bring information to the American public. And what I saw is enormous unanimity around what it is that people want.

... It’s important for everybody to know that United States of Care will support the best answers and it will often be different answers in different states, and work on the solutions and [it] won’t be beholden to anybody.

Another thing that people are frankly a little bit suspicious about is your own startup investment fund and this idea that a solution to the health care problems facing low-income people is a for-profit investment fund.

I believe that we as a country innovate in entirely the wrong way when it comes to health care. And the reason I say this is because the vast majority of venture capital investors and private equity investors are 35-year-old white guys. And that’s why we have 14 Fitbits and investing in things like artificial intelligence and all these high-end things that people who are really not in great need of care ― I mean, people who generally are getting good care ― are getting all kinds of innovations.

And I can tell you from running the Medicaid program and the [Children’s Health Insurance Program], where we need to be focused on is: Are we investing in housing? Are we investing in mental health? Are we investing in transportation and nutrition in the community in ways that can help people get better access and care and stay healthier?

So I absolutely believe that we ought to be productively trying to solve those problems. I do believe there is a role to play for innovative people, and there are young companies, innovative millennials that are trying to solve these problems. I think that’s a good thing.

I don’t think [the investment fund] has anything to do with my role as a board member of the United States of Care. I suspect every board member and every participant is going to have their own set of activities. I happen to have a core belief that we need to refocus investment in underserved communities. And I’ve walked my talk, by the way, for a number of years, so you can take a look back at my track record.

Is there no situation you could imagine with this fund where an experiment is tried that is profitable for the company but does not have the results that were promised? Because sometimes when these things get started, it gets hard to walk it back. Would you sort of pack your things up and quit if you thought it wasn’t working that way?

If an innovation wasn’t working?

Not working in the sense of not meeting social goals, not in the profit sense.

Look, I’m 51 years old. I only want to work on the things that matter. I’ve been exposed to a lot of great things. I believe there are a lot of really critical things that need to be shown to work, like [the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly] and other kinds of things that would be good for treatments in different communities. Separately ― this is a different interview ― I could name you a couple companies that I have seen that I am impressed with.

Not all of them are going to work. But my interest is only in the ones that I believe are going to move the needle in that direction.Elizabeth Swaney, the American skier who figured out how to compete (after a fashion) at the Winter Olympics as part of Hungary's team. Mike Blake / Reuters

Depending on who you ask, Olympic skier Elizabeth Swaney is either an embarrassment to the Winter Games or the unsung hero of mediocre athletes everywhere.

Swaney, an American competing for Hungary in the women’s halfpipe event in Pyeongchang, South Korea, caught viewers’ attention on Monday not for her skills but for her, well, complete lack thereof.

NBC has the full clip of her performance here on its site.

Even NBC’s commentators struggled to describe what Swaney was doing on the slopes as she made run after run with no attempts to catch any air or try complex tricks.

She placed 24th ― dead last.

Swaney ― a 33-year-old from Oakland, California, who qualified for Hungary’s team through her grandparents’ heritage ― didn’t just get cold feet.

To put it bluntly, the software engineer recruiter with big athletic dreams just isn’t up to Olympic standards, and she essentially gamed the system, taking advantage of rules at qualifying events. She often finished within the top 30 ― and thus met the qualifying cutoff ― because there weren’t that many competitors.

“The field is not that deep in the women’s pipe and she went to every World Cup, where there were only 24, 25, or 28 women,” ski halfpipe and slopestyle judge Steele Spence told The Denver Post in a profile this week about Swaney, whose competitions are completely self-funded

“She would compete in them consistently over the last couple years and sometimes girls would crash so she would not end up dead last,” he said.

Spence added that there is some plan in the works to change the qualifying rules.

Swaney got lucky with a few other loopholes, as Deadspin reported:

Because a few competitors pulled out of the Olympics with injury, because of limits on how many skiers from a single country can compete in the same event, and because of some arcane reallocation rules within the Hungarian ski federation designed to balance men’s and women’s competitors, Swaney got to go do her fake run in Pyeongchang.

Swaney’s scheming her way into the competition has apparently peeved other athletes, sources told the Denver newspaper, but let’s hand it to her for shameless perseverance.

Don’t hate the player, Olympic skiers, hate the game.Gerard Batten was chosen as interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party on Saturday. Dominic Lipinski - PA Images via Getty Images

The new interim leader of a far-right nationalist party in the U.K. stands by his use of hateful rhetoric to describe Islam and British Muslims.

Gerard Batten, who assumed leadership of the U.K. Independence Party on Saturday, reiterated his belief that Islam is a “death cult” in an interview with Sky News.

Batten initially invoked the phrase in a blog he wrote after a terrorist attack near London’s Palace of Westminster in March 2017.

“It glorifies death,” Batten said in the Sky News interview about the religion followed by 1.8 billion people in the world.

Asked by Sky News anchor Niall Paterson to clarify whether he believes all 3 million British Muslims are adherents of a death cult, Batten said it’s “not all of them” but a “significant minority.”

Batten also defended the idea of having all British Muslims sign a charter renouncing violent passages from the Quran and rejecting “dark-age ideologies” that he believes many Muslims “bring with them” when they come to the U.K.

In response, Paterson said, “There’s some fairly heinous stuff in the Old Testament ... Leviticus is filled with things that frankly would lead to Christians being forced to sign a charter of understanding by your logic.”

Batten is one of the founders of UKIP and is a member of the European Parliament. He became interim leader of Ukip after his predecessor, Henry Bolton, was ousted from the post on Saturday. Bolton was removed amid controversy over racist comments his girlfriend made about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s fiancée.

Nick Lowles, chief executive of the anti-racism campaign Hope not Hate, said that the choice of Batten to lead UKIP was a “death knell” for the party.

“The party is now a bad joke, haemorrhaging support and money,” Lowles wrote in an op-ed for The Independent. ”[Batten’s] election is a disaster for any hope UKIP might have of resurrecting its political fortunes.”Team USA will once again face Canada for gold in women’s hockey, extending an Olympic rivalry with roots stretching back to the sport’s first appearance at the Winter Games in 1998.

The two teams have played each other for gold in every Winter Olympics final since then with the exception of 2006, when the U.S. failed to make the gold-medal round.

Canada has won four straight gold medals in the event. The U.S. won its sole gold in 1998.

This year, both teams dispatched rivals in the semifinal 5-0 to advance to the gold medal game in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Finland will play the Olympic Athletes from Russia for the bronze.

In the women’s hockey round robin last week, Canada narrowly beat the U.S. 2-1, thanks to an outstanding performance by Canadian goaltender Geneviève Lacasse, who stopped 44 of 45 shots on goal. Team USA outshot Canada 45-23.Some people’s idea of justice is an eye for an eye, but China wants “severe punishment” for a man who stole a clay thumb.

Michael Rohana, 24, was charged last week for allegedly breaking a thumb off the left hand of a 2,000-year-old terra-cotta warrior on display at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. The incident is said to have occurred in December while he attended the museum’s ugly Christmas sweater party.

The FBI said Rohana snuck away from the party and used a cellular telephone as a flashlight to look at exhibits that were displayed in a closed-off showroom.

At one point, he stepped up onto a platform supporting one of the statues on display and took a selfie, according to China’s Xinhua News Agency.

Security cameras show Rohana putting his hand on the left hand of the statue, and then appearing to break something off from its left hand and put it in his pocket before leaving the room, according to an arrest affidavit.

The museumgoer allegedly took the clay digit to his home in Bear, Delaware, as a souvenir. He is now accused of theft of an artwork from a museum, concealment of the artwork and interstate transportation of stolen property, according to The New York Times.

The statues featured in the Franklin’s “Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor” exhibit are some of thousands discovered in China’s Xi’an city in 1974 by a group of farmers, according to the BBC. They are considered one of China’s most important archeological finds.

The vandalized statue is worth quite a thumb, er, sum: $4.5 million.

The broken-off thumb wasn’t reported missing until Jan. 8, at which point the FBI’s Art Crime Team was contacted. The agency used the video as well as credit card information from the party to finger Rohana as the thumb thief.

Rohana allegedly attended the party with five friends, one of whom told investigators she heard the suspect mention the thumb on the ride home, according to USA Today.

Another friend said Rohana posted a photo of “a finger” from a terra-cotta warrior on Snapchat a day after the party.

Investigators interviewed Rohana on Jan. 13 and asked if he had anything in his possession that he wanted to turn over to the FBI. That’s when Rohana allegedly took an agent to his bedroom and grabbed the terra-cotta thumb from a drawer in a desk.

The Franklin Museum has apologized for the incident. An official from the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Centre, the agency that arranged for the loan of the statues, seeks a “severe penalty” for the perpetrator, according to the South China Morning Post.

“The terracotta warriors are national treasures of our country,” an unnamed official told the paper. “Their historical and artistic value are impossible to value … We express strong resentment and condemnation towards this theft and the destruction of our heritage.”

Franklin Institute spokeswoman Stefanie Santo told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the warrior and its thumb will be repaired. She blames the incident on a contractor who did not follow security protocols the night of the theft.

Rohana is currently out on bail.Francesco Friedrich (far left) and Thorsten Margis of Germany shared gold medals on Monday with Alexander Kopacz (far right) and Justin Kripps of Canada in the two-man bobsled race at the Winter Olympics. Edgar Su / Reuters

Germany and Canada both were winners in the two-man bobsled race at the Winter Olympics on Monday in the first gold-medal tie in the event since 1998.

Both teams finished four runs with identical combined times ― down to the hundredth of a second ― of 3.16.86 in the dramatic competition in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Latvia came in a close third place, with a time of 3:16.91.

The bobsled event’s last first-place tie was between Italy and Canada, when both teams finished with times of 3.37.24 at the games in Nagano, Japan. That was also the last time that Canada won gold in the event.John Oliver says President Donald Trump has failed at the one thing he’s supposed to be good at: salesmanship.

“America’s reputation overseas is under attack from its own president,” Oliver pointed out on Sunday’s broadcast of “Last Week Tonight.”

So Oliver, who describes himself as an “immigrant who has fallen in love with this country,” delivered a message to the rest of the world.

“Donald Trump does not reflect America,” Oliver said, but with a disclaimer: “I mean, to be completely honest, he does reflect it a bit, but the point is America is not one thing. It’s a beautiful mess of contradictions where good and bad are mixed together.”

Then he delivered a stirring defense of all that was good ― and bad ― about his adopted home.Jonathan Ernst / Reuters

New York Magazine is laying out a case for the possible impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

The cover story, penned by former executive editor of The New York Times Jill Abramson, described Thomas’ rise to power and his apparent immunity to scrutiny during the height of the #MeToo movement. Citing conversations with three women who worked with Thomas, Abramson also detailed a history of lies told by the judge, beginning during his confirmation hearing.

His dishonesty, not the allegations of impropriety, “raise the possibility of impeachment.”

“Lying is, for lawyers, a cardinal sin. State disciplinary committees regularly institute proceedings against lawyers for knowingly lying in court, with punishments that can include disbarment. Since 1989, three federal judges have been impeached and forced from office for charges that include lying. The idea of someone so flagrantly telling untruths to ascend to the highest legal position in the U.S. remains shocking, in addition to its being illegal,” Abramson wrote.

Abramson is the co-author of “Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas,” a 1994 book about his controversial confirmation hearing. During the 1991 hearing, former employee Anita Hill accused him of sexually harassing her. Hill alleged that Thomas talked about pornography in the workplace and regularly commented on the bodies of female coworkers.

Thomas claimed he never talked to Hill about porn or to other women who worked with him about risqué subject matter.

The hearing quickly turned into the epitome of a he-said, she-said, and despite the allegations, Thomas was later confirmed by a vote of 52-48. Since then, more women have come forward with similar claims about his behavior.

Abramson said Thomas’ tenure on the court has been “devastating for women’s rights,” and highlighted his votes on cases involving equal-pay protections and employers’ religious objections to supplying birth control.

“His worldview, with its consistent objectification of women, is the one that’s shaping the contours of what’s possible for women in America today, more than that of just about any man alive, save for his fellow justices,” Abramson wrote.

It moved another 52,000 units in traditional album sales. The album is the second soundtrack in 2018 to debut at No. 1 after “The Greatest Showman” did so in January.

In January, “Black Panther” director Ryan Coogler announced Kendrick would team up with label executive Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith to produce and curate an album for the movie. The result was a hip-hop-focused soundtrack, teeming with celebrity features.

The first single, “All the Stars” with K. Dot and SZA, sits at 31 on the charts. The Weeknd also appears on the album with Kendrick in “Pray for Me,” which debuted in the top 5 Hot Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart. Khalid, James Blake and Anderson .Paak are also featured on the soundtrack.John Oliver returned to TV on Sunday night and began his show’s fifth season with a discussion of last week’s shooting spree at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead.

Oliver said we know how it all plays out, then recapped the arguments from both sides.

“Thoughts and prayers? Fuck your thoughts and prayers,” he said. “It’s a mental health problem. Yeah, but it’s also a gun problem. And then someone says, ‘Now’s not the time to talk about gun control’ and everyone moves on until it inevitably happens again.”

But Oliver said this attack might be different.

Yes, it fucking is,” he said.WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s failure last year to disclose that he repaid his lawyer Michael Cohen for Cohen’s pre-election payout to Stormy Daniels has been referred to the Department of Justice.

The Office of Government Ethics determined Wednesday that Cohen’s payment to Daniels, which Trump repaid last year, constituted a loan that should have been reported on the president’s June 2017 financial disclosure form. Trump did disclose the liability in a footnote to the form he filed Tuesday. The note claimed he did not have to make the disclosure, but was doing so anyway “in the interest of transparency.”

In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, acting OGE Director David Apol wrote, “You may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing regarding the president’s prior report that was signed on June 14, 2017.”

Knowingly and willfully falsifying or omitting required information on the financial disclosure form can be prosecuted as a criminal offense, punishable by as long as a year in jail.

Trump and his White House staff had for months denied knowing anything about Cohen’s $130,000 payment to Daniels to buy her silence about the affair the porn star said she had with Trump a decade earlier. Trump’s newest outside lawyer Rudy Giuliani finally admitted that Trump had repaid Cohen in a Fox News interview earlier this month.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

In a Wednesday interview with HuffPost, Giuliani continued to insist that Cohen’s payment to Daniels ― which he previously described as the settlement of a nuisance claim ― was fully aboveboard.

“This is a perfectly legitimate thing,” Giuliani said. “There’s nothing wrong with it.”

When asked why an ostensibly legitimate payment had been funneled through the newly registered Delaware shell company Essential Consultants, Giuliani said: “No, it wasn’t.” He then added that there was no need to list Trump’s monthly payments to Cohen at all. “It was listed out of an excess of caution.”

Both of Giuliani’s assertions, however, are incorrect.

“OGE has concluded that, based on the information provided ... the payment made by Mr. Cohen is required to be reported as a liability,” Apol wrote in his letter to Rosenstein.

The payment to Daniels ― whose real name is Stephanie Clifford ― was made on Oct. 27, 2016, by Essential Consultants LLC to her lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, according to a copy of the wire transfer.

Essential Consultants was created by Cohen days earlier. He used it in the coming weeks and months to collect millions of dollars in consulting fees from corporate clients like AT&T, Swiss drugmaker Norvatis and Columbus Nova, which described itself as an affiliate of a conglomerate known to be owned by a Russian oligarch.

“Once again Mr. Giuliani has attempted to deceive the American people with this payment,” said Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ new lawyer, who is trying to break the nondisclosure agreement in court.

In a follow-up interview, Giuliani said that he did not know how Cohen had paid Daniels ― “Lawyers do things under LLCs all the time,” he said ― and that he had correctly anticipated that the OGE would rule that Trump had needed to disclose the $130,000 as a loan. That is why, he said, he decided to disclose it himself.

The FBI and federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York are investigating Cohen. They removed documents and electronic equipment from Cohen’s offices using a search warrant last month, although he has not been charged with any crime.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller, meanwhile, continues his year-old investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russian intelligence services, which were actively working to help Trump win in 2016.

Rosenstein appointed Mueller after Trump first fired FBI Director James Comey, and then shortly thereafter told both NBC News and Russian diplomats visiting the Oval Office that he had done so because of the FBI’s Russia probe.

Trump has repeatedly called the Mueller probe a “witch hunt” spurred by Democrats angry that they had lost an election they believed they would win. Giuliani, who was once the U.S. attorney leading the office now investigating Cohen, makes that same argument and says news outlets that cover the Mueller investigation and the Stormy Daniels payment are treating Trump unfairly.

“The guy’s making tremendous progress for us all over the world,” Giuliani said of Trump. “You guys are worse than he says you are.”

Mueller’s investigation has so far resulted in the guilty pleas of five individuals, including three former Trump campaign staffers, and the indictment of 14 other individuals and three companies. That total includes 13 Russians, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Internet Research Agency “troll farm” that was used to create and disseminate propaganda to help Trump win.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed a complaint with the OGE and the Justice Department in March asserting that Cohen’s payment to Daniels constituted a loan to Trump, filed a second complaint Wednesday.

“There is substantial evidence that President Trump had knowledge of the loan when he filed his 2017 [financial disclosure form] notwithstanding his failure to report it,” read the complaint signed by Noah Bookbinder, CREW’s executive director, and Norm Eisen, its chairman.
