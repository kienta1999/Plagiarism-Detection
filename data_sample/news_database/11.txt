At least two organizations have decided to drop Morgan Freeman after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment.

Women who previously worked with the Oscar-winning actor told CNN that he repeatedly made comments about their bodies or their clothing and frequently engaged in inappropriate touching.

In response to the allegations, Visa announced it had suspended him from its marketing campaign.

“We are aware of the allegations that have been made against Mr. Freeman. At this point, Visa will be suspending our marketing in which the actor is featured,” Visa said in a statement.

TransLink, Vancouver’s public transit system, also decided to stop using Freeman’s voice as part of an ad campaign to promote its Visa credit card and mobile payments on bus and Skytrain operations.

“In light of information we’ve learned ... of allegations regarding actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign on our transit system,” the transit system said a statement. “We will be reaching out to Visa to discuss further.”

A few hours after the report was released, Freeman, 80, issued an apology:

“Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy, I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent.”

A production assistant working on the 2015 film “Going in Style” said Morgan made numerous comments about her body, asked her several times if she was wearing underwear and tried to lift her skirt. Another worker on the set said women wore loose-fitting clothing in an effort to avoid Freeman’s attention.

Entertainment Tonight released footage on Thursday evening of two on-air interviews with Freeman that also revealed his attitude toward women. During an interview for the 2016 film “London Has Fallen,” Freeman asked a young female reporter, “My goodness, are you married? Fool around with other guys? I’m just asking.”

In 2015, he told author Janet Mock: “You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.”

Mock, who was a special correspondent for the interview, said Freeman’s treatment of her was an “exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women’s bodies.”

Freeman’s union, SAG-AFTRA, is considering what to do about Freeman’s Life Achievement Award. The award is given to actors who represent the “finest ideals of the acting profession,” CNN reported.Chinese women detained at Angel Island, California.

WASHINGTON ― In 1882, Congress voted to ban an entire ethnic group from immigrating to the United States.

The Chinese Exclusion Act, iterations of which remained on the books for over 60 years, had a lasting effect on the history of U.S. immigration, as depicted in a new PBS documentary airing Tuesday.

Filmmakers Ric Burns (brother of Ken) and Li-Shin Yu trace not only the law’s development and implementation but also its connection to other integral parts of American history unfolding contemporaneously, like segregation in the Jim Crow South, urbanization on the East and West Coasts, and trade abroad.

At a screening of the film last week, Burns called the Chinese Exclusion Act a “quintessentially American story” and described it as “the biggest part of American history that people don’t know about,” because you would be hard-pressed to find it mentioned in many history courses.

“If you want to know about immigration in America and you don’t know the story of Chinese exclusion, it would be like saying you want to know about race relations in America, but you’ve never heard of slavery."” - Filmmaker Ric Burns

In the film, several historians marvel that some Americans are shocked to learn about the Chinese Exclusion Act.

“Many Americans today cannot believe this happened. How could this country, with its culture, with its politics, with its economics, do what it did against a whole class of people?” NYU professor John Kuo Wei Tchen says.

But while watching the documentary amid today’s political climate, it isn’t unbelievable at all. Burns and Yu acknowledged that it doesn’t take much effort to see parallels to President Donald Trump’s America — though this was not their original intention, as they began working on the film six years ago, Burns said.

Central to the bill’s 1882 passage were political attacks on Chinese immigrants that labeled them “unassimilable” and portrayed them as economic threats to white Americans and a filthy scourge on society. The film shows how newspaper headlines and editorial cartoons from that period disseminated this propaganda.

Nineteenth-century politicians’ nativism and fear-mongering are remarkably similar to today’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. President Donald Trump famously began his presidential campaign by saying that Mexico was sending rapists, drug dealers, and criminals to the U.S.

Other right-wing political figures have raised the old complaint that certain immigrants are unassimilable. During an NPR interview earlier this month, Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, said that undocumented immigrants are “not people that would easily assimilate” and “don’t integrate well” — an uncanny reminder of how this political language persists.

Burns sees another commonality in the rhetoric: the “factless nature” of claims that immigrants are stealing our jobs.

“Both then and now, there’s zero truth to it,” he said. “These things almost never have any basis in reality. It becomes a function of playing to fears, playing to usually white vulnerabilities, and finding wedge issues for politicians.”

“The Chinese Exclusion Act tells us all we need to know not just about immigration, but about the story of America.”

These parallels make it particularly difficult and infuriating to watch the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act unfold in the film, including how it raised questions about birthright citizenship that were later settled in an 1898 Supreme Court case.

Trump is among those who have relitigated the issue in the decades since: During his presidential campaign, he suggested abolishing birthright citizenship.

There are also echoes of the Chinese Exclusion Act in the legal battle over Trump’s travel ban, which bars people largely from majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. It’s yet another compelling piece of evidence for the film’s central argument: The Chinese Exclusion Act tells us all we need to know not just about immigration, but about the story of America.

The events of the film intersect with another grim period of American history: the Jim Crow era in the South. According to the film, the California politicians spearheading discrimination against Chinese immigrants built support for the exclusion act by compromising with Southern politicians trying to pass measures to systematically disenfranchise black people. The political maneuvering, which Burns referred to as “horse-trading,” essentially amounted to exchanging one form of discrimination for another.

Sexism and misogyny also fueled the fire. Laws that helped lay the foundation for the 1882 bill were particularly discriminatory against Chinese women, who were stereotyped as prostitutes. As Columbia University historian Mae Ngai relates in the film, Chinese women were required to prove they were not prostitutes to be admitted to the U.S, a process so stringent that it effectively discouraged most women from immigrating.

Through these connections, the documentary effectively makes the case that the Chinese Exclusion Act is fundamental to questions of American identity.

“It is not a melodramatic or breathlessly hyperbolic thing to say that if you want to know about immigration in America and you don’t know the story of Chinese exclusion, it would be like saying you want to know about race relations in America but you’ve never heard of slavery,” Burns said.

Burns and Yu said they intend for the film to be an educational tool, and PBS and the Center for Asian American Media are distributing it to schools so that learning about Chinese exclusion becomes a given in U.S. history class.

“Just the way you know about the Fourth of July, you know about the Civil War, and you know about the Pilgrims — usually a ludicrously cartoonish way,” Burns said, “you’ll at least have a ludicrously cartoonish version of the Chinese Exclusion Act.”President Donald Trump’s online campaign store is now selling summer-themed items, including $65 beach towels and $55 “Make American Great Again” swimsuits.

“Make a YUGE splash poolside or at the beach this summer with our new swimwear!” the description for both the men’s and women’s swimsuits noted.

John Jay Smith, 60, is facing two third-degree felony charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a first-degree felony charge of burglary with assault or battery and a third-degree felony charge of trespassing, according to a police report.

Officers arrested Smith at the McDonald’s on Wednesday at 2:30 a.m. after he used a switchblade-style knife to threaten the students, who were in a parked car outside the restaurant, according to First Coast News.

One of the victims, Omar Abdelmoaty, told The Washington Post that he and four other Egyptian exchange students, all of them Muslim, were simply eating burgers and fries when Smith came at them.

“Get the f**k out of here, you don’t deserve American food,” Smith reportedly said.

At that point, Smith reportedly pulled out a stun gun and reached inside the car with it. The driver, likely very scared, accidentally backed the car into a pole.

“We thought we were going to die,” Abdelmoaty told the Post.

The police report indicates Smith might have been intoxicated at the time of the attack, and that he may have been motivated by the victims’ religion.

Smith could face hate crime charges because he “approached the victims due to their purported religion or ethnic background,” said Chuck Mulligan, a spokesperson for the St. Johns County Sheriff’s office, according to First Coast News.

The State Attorney’s Office will decide whether Smith will face hate crime charges, Mulligan said.

Smith reportedly defended his attack by telling deputies, “they killed my son” and “my son was a Marine.” Smith said his son was killed in combat in Afghanistan, First Coast News reported.

McDonald’s did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the incident.

“We didn’t do anything to anybody. We’re just students,” Abdelmoaty told The Post. “The basic idea that he charged us and attacked us for this, for our religion, for our home country and background, it’s kind of scary. In the first place, we’re just human beings — names and descriptions came afterward. We don’t hate him for what he did. We’re just sad.”Comedy Jimmy Kimmel Knows Why Iran's Supreme Leader Watches 'Tom And Jerry'

Local and state police responded to reports of an active shooter at Noblesville West Middle School just after 9 a.m. Friday, Chief of Police Kevin Jowitt told reporters at a news conference. Jowitt confirmed that two people were injured with gunshot wounds: one teacher and one student.

One adult victim was transferred to Methodist Hospital, and one child victim was transferred to Riley Children’s Hospital, Danielle Sirilla, a spokesperson for Indiana University Health, confirmed to HuffPost Friday morning.

Their families have been notified, and the school is now clear and “contained,” Jowitt said.

One male student at the school, believed to be the suspect, has been detained.

The suspect was “apprehended in the classroom or in that area,” police public information officer Bruce Barnes said.

According to police, the suspect asked to be excused from class before the shooting occurred. He returned with two handguns. The situation was “resolved very quickly,” but police are still investigating.

Police would not identify either the injured victims or the suspect.

Local news outlets identified the injured teacher as Jason Seaman, a science teacher and football coach, according to his LinkedIn profile. Parents said that he intervened to try to stop the suspect. He underwent surgery for three gunshot wounds, his mother, Kristi Seaman, wrote in a Facebook post.

Jowitt said that the school employs a full-time school resource officer, but does not know if he was involved in the shooting. Police provided few other details, citing the ongoing investigation.

On Friday morning, officers also responded to another “communicated threat” at Noblesville High School, but Jowitt said police believed that’s nothing beyond a threat.

The high school was placed on lockdown while a SWAT team searched the school, according to Richard Passey, a parent of a high school student. Passey added the threat was believed to be a “hoax.”

Parents had been instructed to pick up the middle school students at the high school. Middle school and high school students at the high school were being released to their parents shortly before noon, according to local news reports.

Vice President Mike Pence, who previously served as governor of Indiana, offered prayers for the victims.

Noblesville West Middle School, located about 30 miles northeast of Indianapolis, serves about 1,300 students, according to statistics reported to the Department of Education.

Indiana is widely known as a “gun-friendly state” for having some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country.

Abdulfatai, who lives in the Nigerian capital Abuja, told HuffPost that he realized he looked like Boseman when “Black Panther” came out.

“I didn’t watch it early like other guys did,” he told us, but when he started getting calls about the resemblance to the main character, he “decided to go watch it.”

Then this week, Abdulfatai posted his picture on Twitter with the hashtag #FineEbiraTwitter, and the first comment he got was about Boseman. And the comments about the actor and designer’s similarities have not slowed down at all:

Earlier this week, the comedian and a few of his male “Arrested Development” castmates came off sounding particularly bad during a New York Times interview about the show’s revival on Netflix.

During the conversation, co-star Jessica Walter opened up about an incident in which Jeffrey Tambor — who plays her character’s husband on “Arrested Development” — was verbally abusive and yelled at her on set. Tambor was fired from another show, “Transparent,” in February after being accused of sexual harassment.

“In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set,” Walter said through tears.

In response, Cross and castmates Jason Bateman and Tony Hale came to Tambor’s defense and were dismissive of Walter’s feelings.

The interview rubbed many readers the wrong way and sparked a backlash against Bateman, Cross and Hale. Bateman and Hale have since apologized to Walter.

On Thursday, New York news site Gothamist asked Cross about the criticism, and the 54-year-old said he understood why people were uncomfortable with his remarks and promised to “unequivocally apologize to Jessica.”

Yet just moments later, Cross couldn’t stop himself from pointing a finger in Walter’s direction.

“There’s never an excuse ever for yelling at somebody and humiliating them in front of other people,” Cross told Gothamist. “And there was no excuse when Jessica did it. To Jessica’s credit, she eventually apologized to the actress and felt bad about it.”

When Gothamist asked him to elaborate on Walter’s alleged outburst, Cross said there was an incident between the actress and a stand-in, “but it didn’t have the same kind of feeling that Jeffrey’s did.”

Some people on Twitter did not appreciate Cross’ tone-deaf attempt to divert attention from the issue at hand.

“Sesame Street” isn’t all fun and games, if a lawsuit filed Thursday by its parent company, Sesame Workshop, is any indication.

The nonprofit educational organization responsible for the beloved children’s TV show is suing STX Productions, the producers of the upcoming film “The Happytime Murders,” for using the “Sesame Street” name in the movie’s marketing, specifically the tagline “No Sesame. All Street.”

“Sesame seeks to enjoin Defendants’ deliberate effort to appropriate its SESAME STREET mark, and its trusted brand and goodwill, to promote their R-rated movie, ‘The Happytime Murders,’ by way of a violent and sexually-explicit trailer,” the lawsuit states.

“The Happytime Murders” is an R-rated buddy-cop movie set in a world where humans and Sesame Street–style puppets co-exist. Melissa McCarthy stars as a police officer who gets a new puppet partner and is tasked with solving a series of connected murders.

It appears the makers of the classic children’s program are continuing their mission of education by teaching STX Productions a valuable lesson in trademark infringement.Warning! “Avengers: Infinity War” spoilers!

There was one “Infinity War” death so shocking a Marvel executive tried to stop it, but if we’re talking about the demise that was nothing but feels, that goes to our friendly neighborhood hella dead Spider-Man.

At the end of the new “Avengers” film, Thanos (Josh Brolin) snaps his Infinity Gauntlet–clad finger and causes many of the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters to crumble to dust instantaneously. Spider-Man, however, receives an extended final moment, allowing Tom Holland to deliver a tear-jerking and mostly improvised death scene.

“I don’t feel so good. I don’t know what’s happening,” he says after Thanos’ snap. “I don’t want to go. I don’t want to go, Mr. Stark, please,” he mumbles, embracing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) as he melts away to nothing.

So why did Spidey get so much time to deliver a heartbreaking monologue, while his compatriots died on the spot?

In an interview with HuffPost, directors Joe and Anthony Russo confirmed the reason: It was due to his Spidey sense, his ability to perceive danger before it hits.

“That’s correct,” Joe Russo said after I asked if Peter Parker’s Spidey sense was behind the early warning. “He was aware of something.”

Though it’s a mainstay power of the character in the Marvel comics, Spidey sense wasn’t established in the previous Spider-Man solo film “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” In fact, it was big news among fans when “Infinity War” showed Peter had Spidey sense in his repertoire in the trailers for the film.

Now we know why.

It all led to Holland’s delivering the most emotional scene of the movie, inspiring memes everywhere:

Donkey, I don’t feel so good pic.twitter.com/upKE7HArZL — Kazoo (@KingOfKazoos) April 30, 2018

But the Spidey sense inquiry was far from the only question I had in the wake of watching and rewatching “Infinity War.” Since I had the Russo brothers on the phone, I posed a few more questions for the directors to clear up:

Why is Gamora?

A post shared by Peter Parker 🔴🕷🔵 (@spidey.marvel) on May 19, 2018 at 6:05pm PDT

It’s the question on everyone’s minds.

In “Infinity War,” the Guardians of the Galaxy crew initially assumes that the Avengers are working with Thanos and thus have custody of Star-Lord’s boo, Gamora (Zoe Saldana).

So when Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) meets the Avengers, he asks Iron Man, “Where is Gamora?” Iron Man responds, “I’ll do you one better: Who is Gamora?” Drax (Dave Bautista) follows that up with the nonsensical but earnest, “I’ll do you one better: Why is Gamora?”

Really, though: Why is Gamora?

When I asked Joe Russo about the line and whether he has pondered an answer to it, he got a little philosophical. “Why do you think is Gamora?” he asked me, inscrutably. “I don’t know if there is an answer in Drax’s twisted brain.”

Anthony Russo said, “No, sometimes [you] just wonder, has he made a connection there?”

“Remember, this is a man who thinks he can stand so incredibly still that he’s invisible,” Joe Russo said.

What was the secret behind Captain America’s phone number?

Chris Evans as Steve Rogers in "Avengers: Infinity War." Marvel and Disney

A gag in “Infinity War” is that Tony Stark has the number for Captain America (Chris Evans) on a flip phone if he’s needed. The movie prominently shows Cap’s number (678-136-7092) on screen.

The Marvel movies are known for Easter eggs, and this had all the markings of one. But if you were one of the many people who called the number after seeing the film, you know the number doesn’t work and appears to be random. So what’s the point?

“We actually had intended to create a fake voicemail from Steve Rogers,” Joe Russo said. “For the people that left the theater and called that number, they would get a voicemail from Steve Rogers.”

“And that number was the actual number that we were going to use. We were sort of given that number,” said Anthony Russo.

Sadly, the movie’s affiliated legal department got in the way.

“We had it all ready to go, but legal took that away from us,” he added.

Can Groot regenerate from the handle of Stormbreaker?

The end of the first “Guardians of the Galaxy” gave us a new Groot (Vin Diesel), showing us that the treelike creature can regenerate after pretty severe injuries. So given that Groot spared some of his body to create the handle of Thor’s new Stormbreaker weapon, some people have been wondering: Can that handle eventually turn into a new Groot?

Joe Russo left it up in the air.

“I don’t know if every piece of him that detaches ... can grow a future version of him, but who’s to say? That’s an interesting question.”

Was “dad” really Groot’s last word in the script?

Rocket and Groot poster for "Avengers: Infinity War." Marvel and Disney

Before Groot disappears at the snap of Thanos’ finger, he lets out one last “Groot” to Rocket (Bradley Cooper). “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn said the last word translates to “dad.” Was that word actually in the script?

“It was, and it was ‘dad,’” said Anthony Russo.

Why did everyone’s clothes disappear too?

When peeps start disappearing in “Infinity War,” so do their clothes. But clothes don’t die. Clothes are forever, until you shrink them in the laundry. That’s how it works for me. So what’s going on here?

Joe Russo explained that the clothes disappear because they are “part of their identity.”

“Whatever was elemental to somebody’s presence went with them,” Anthony Russo said.

Should people blame Star-Lord?

Chris Pratt as Star-Lord in “Avengers: Infinity War.” Marvel and Disney

The Avengers devise a plan to get the Infinity Gauntlet off Thanos’ hand by slipping it off after Mantis (Pom Klementieff) incapacitates him with her empathy/mind-controlling capabilities. It almost works, but Star-Lord ruins everything by punching Thanos in the face after he learns Gamora is dead.

Thanos gets out of Mantis’ grasp, and the destruction of half the life in the universe ensues.

Star-Lord has been getting a lot of hate since the movie was released. Does he deserve it?

The directors said no.

“His mother was dying of cancer when he was kidnapped by pirates at the age of 10. He was raised by pirates. He had to murder his father to avenge the death of his mother. His girlfriend, who he was in love with, was murdered by another corrupt paternal figure ... He made a very emotional choice,” said Joe Russo.

Anthony Russo reiterated that the shock of Gamora’s death just lets Star-Lord’s emotions get the better of him, adding that Thor also makes this mistake.

“Thor also let his emotions get the better of him. Thor could’ve killed Thanos more quickly than he tried to with the ax. He showed up, and he took a moment — because of his anger, because of his motivation — to tell Thanos that he told him he would die ... and finish him off in a very deliberate way. Thor sort of got lost in his emotions in a similar way as Star-Lord and could also have been responsible for Thanos.”

According to Joe Russo, the mistakes the characters make are all about relatability.

“They make very human choices. I think if we learn anything from narrative is to put yourself inside the POV of someone — or the character itself — you should be able to empathize with that character, understand the choices that they make,” he said.

Was the movie inspired by “The Leftovers”?

It doesn’t take a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist to see the connections between HBO’s “The Leftovers” and “Infinity War.”

Not only do the projects both involve a bunch of people vanishing to some unknown fate, but they both also star actress Carrie Coon, who plays Nora in “The Leftovers” and Proxima Midnight in “Infinity War.”

Is there any inspiration?

Joe Russo said Coon was in the project just because “she’s one of the best actresses working today.” It had nothing to do with a “Leftovers” connection.

He also said he believes “The Leftovers” might have been inspired by the Marvel comic writer Jim Starlin’s ‘Infinity Gauntlet’ story (a source for “Infinity War”) “in the first place.”

“It’s just a cyclical loop there. But we’re just drawing from the original source material,” said Joe Russo.

Did Drax really disappear, or is he just standing still?

Drax disappeared along with half the other heroes at the end of the movie, but as the directors mentioned, he believes he possesses the ability to stand so still, he becomes invisible.

Did he really disappear? Or was he just standing reallllly still?

“That’s a spoiler,” joked Joe Russo.

“That’s to be decided,” Anthony Russo said, laughing. “All we know is what we can gather from the film. Anything more than that can potentially be addressed down the line.”

It seems there’s a chance we may see Drax again, after all. You know, if he ever moves.A former model who accused George Takei (above) of sexual assault says the New York Observer mischaracterized comments he made recently about the incident. Tara Ziemba via Getty Images

One key detail that the Observer construed as Brunton changing his story, Brunton said, was really a matter of semantics.

The piece casts doubt on Brunton’s allegation that Takei “groped” him by highlighting that Brunton said he did not specifically remember Takei “touching [his] genitals.”

But Brunton told HuffPost the details he does remember certainly qualify as groping.

“My pants were down around my ankles, my shirt was pulled up,” Brunton said. “I’m in this bean bag chair that George had guided me to. He’s on top of me, he’s trying to wrestle my underwear down off of me.”

He added, “His hands were all over me trying to get the underwear off. And to me, that’s groping.”

Brunton was dismayed that the media had been treating the Observer story as vindication for Takei.

“It’s as if there’s a trial, and he’s been proven not guilty,” he said.

PREVIOUSLY:

Months after George Takei was accused of sexual assault, former model Scott R. Brunton, who said the “Star Trek” actor drugged and groped him without his consent 36 years ago, is walking back certain parts of his story.

In a lengthy interview with The New York Observer‘s Shane Snow published Thursday, Brunton recounts the night at the actor’s home where the alleged incident occurred but admits he didn’t remember Takei touching his genitals.

He previously accused the actor of “groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off” as he came to after having a drink Takei provided, which left him feeling dizzy and led him to pass out.

After the allegations surfaced, Takei flatly denied Brunton’s account ― he maintains that he doesn’t even remember them meeting ― and said he was “shocked and bewildered” by the allegation.

“Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago,” Takei wrote on social media in his one and only statement. “But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.”

In addition to parsing out the details of the alleged groping, Snow notes various inconsistencies in accounts Brunton shared with numerous outlets, including his alcohol consumption that night, his weight at the time, whether Takei was wearing a shirt during their interaction and whether the two met for coffee years later.

As for the accusation that Takei drugged Brunton’s cocktail, toxicologists interviewed for the story “immediately ruled out a spiked drink,” as the drugs available at the time would have impaired his ability to drive home after the incident or remember that it occurred at all.

“There are drugs today that may do this, but they did not exist [in 1981],” one toxicologist says in the piece.

While Snow describes Brunton as “a sympathetic and well-intentioned man,” he concludes that the model altered “key details and let slip that, in his effort to be listened to, he’d fabricated some things.”

Snow adds: “This and other evidence would indicate a hard-to-swallow conclusion: We ― both public and press ― got the George Takei assault story wrong.”Samantha Bee’s parents want her to come back home to Canada. On Thursday night’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” the host of “Full Frontal” revealed what her Canadian family really thinks of the United States.

“They think it’s such a dangerous and decrepit place now,” Bee told Kimmel. “My dad bought me a Kevlar vest.”

Kimmel asked Bee if her dad also bought a Kevlar vest for her husband, former Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones.

“No, just me,” Bee said. “There’s a limit to my father’s affection.”He offered up a hearty “f**k you” on Thursday to critics who questioned his ability to maintain a romance because of his borderline personality disorder. The comic’s clap-back arrived amid reports that he is dating singer Ariana Grande.

Davidson, 24, disclosed last year that he was diagnosed with BPD, which the Mayo Clinic reports can generate “a pattern of unstable intense relationships, distorted self-image, extreme emotions and impulsiveness.” But many with the disorder can improve and lead fulfilling lives after receiving treatment, the clinic’s website noted.

“Normally I wouldn’t comment on something like this cause like fuck you,” Davidson wrote on an Instagram story. “But [I’ve] been hearing a lot of ‘people with BPD can’t be in relationships’ talk. I just wanna let you know that’s not true. Just because someone has a mental illness does not mean they can’t be happy and in a relationship. It also doesn’t mean that person makes a relationship toxic.”

“I just think it’s fucked up to stigmatize people as crazy and say that they are unable to do stuff that anyone can do,” Davidson added. “It’s not their fault and it’s the wrong way for people to look at things. I may be crazy but at least I’m aware of it and not afraid to be honest about it and I’m not hiding behind a Twitter or Instagram account.”

Davidson, who in March declared he was sober for the first time in eight years, wrote that getting therapy for BPD has helped.

“I love you,” he wrote to others who may be struggling.

InstagramActor Morgan Freeman spoke out again in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him, saying Friday that he was “devastated” by the turn of events.

Several women accused the Oscar winner of inappropriate behavior, including lewd comments and unwanted touching, according to a CNN investigation.

“I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,” Morgan said in a statement sent to media, according to outlets. “All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor.”

Credit card company Visa and Vancouver transportation company TransLink (in a Visa promotion) suspended campaigns featuring Freeman after the accusations surfaced.

In the CNN report, one unidentified woman who worked on the film “Going in Style” in 2015 accused Freeman of repeatedly trying to lift up her skirt and asking her if she was wearing underwear.

Freeman initially apologized for unintentionally making anyone feel uncomfortable or disrespected and reiterated those sentiments in part of his statement on Friday.

But, he added, “I also want to be clear: I did not create unsafe work environments. I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false.”James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” has become a staple of the “Late Late Show.” But the segment that aired on Thursday night went a little off-script when he was stopped by a deputy from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department while filming with Adam Levine of Maroon 5.Wait till next year.

Emilia Clarke had a few intriguing things to say about her character Daenerys Targaryen’s final moment on “Game of Thrones,” set to air in 2019.

“It fucked me up,” the 31-year-old actress told Vanity Fair. “Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone’s mouth of what Daenerys is ... ”

And if that’s not enough to whet your appetite for the HBO fantasy, she said of the entire farewell season: “I’m doing all this weird shit. You’ll know what I mean when you see it.”

She gave no hint as to whether Daenerys will win dominion over all seven kingdoms of Westeros, so we’ll just have to stay tuned.

“It really is the most heartbreaking thing to be filming the last of anything,” Clarke told “Good Morning America” on Wednesday. “I’ve become an emotional wreck on set. They’re like ‘Emilia…it’s OK,’ and I’m like, ‘But it’s the last time!’”

The boys club is alive and well in Hollywood ― and it’s so entrenched that male celebrities will unwittingly go on the record about it.

This week a New York Times interview with the “Arrested Development” cast went viral after matriarch Jessica Walter opened up about how her co-star Jeffrey Tambor (who was also present during the interview) used to verbally abuse her on set. In a stunning, but wholly unsurprising, turn of events, her other male co-stars jumped in ... on behalf of Tambor. Jason Bateman suggested that Tambor’s behavior occurred in part because the cast was like a “family,” suggesting that the entertainment industry was simply a “breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.”

The backlash was swift, and Bateman and co-star Tony Hale have since publicly apologized for not supporting Walter during the interview. And the conversation raised a few questions: Are all sets truly “breeding grounds for atypical behavior,” including verbal assaults? Is that simply the cost of creating art?

To find out, we asked Vella Lovell, a 32-year-old actress who has spent her fair share of time on TV sets ― specifically the set of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” a CW show on which she has played Heather over the last few years. Lovell isn’t part of Hollywood’s old boys club, though she is certainly part of Hollywood. Much of her career has been spent on sets run by and/or dominated by women ― “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Younger,” “Girls.” She’s been working for years, but is also young enough to imagine that her work culture could be different than what Bateman described.

“It maybe has been the norm,” she told HuffPost over the phone while doing her grocery shopping, reacting to Bateman’s characterization of the industry she’s a part of, “but as tides are turning, it’s kind of like, if there’s an alternative, what are we doing?”

When you first read that New York Times interview, what was your reaction?

It seemed like the women [Jessica Walter and Alia Shawkat] didn’t get to talk a lot. It seemed like the guys kind of took over the interview and I think that’s part of the problem. It didn’t seem like [Walter] felt heard ― just from that article. So that says to me that it’s not an equal playing field ... I think that can happen a lot with women and men in creative fields ― women can end up feeling a little silenced.

From your perspective, does the set dynamic that Jason Bateman described as typical of the entertainment industry ring true to you? Is that something you’ve experienced ― verbal altercations that might cross a line into feeling abusive?

The set I’ve spent the most time on is “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and it’s run all by women. Honestly, I’ve never experienced that, so I would have to say no. But I also think that all the women on set set a precedent. And I think it’s up to the people at the top to set that vibe and example of what is acceptable and what’s not.

I will say, just being in the theater and on sets, the more power someone has, the more things are dictated by them. Whoever the number-one person is on the set kind of sets the tone. It’s their behavior and their moral center that dictates how the set is gonna be. So for us, because it’s Rachel [Bloom] and because she’s a creator, the respect is kind of implied.

But I think that [verbal abuse] can happen, especially with the older men generation. They’re used to a certain amount of power and respect. And so because they’re the person in power, I do think the younger actors ― even if it’s just younger in your career ― you end up looking up to them as the norm. Does that make sense? I think that’s maybe what [Jason Bateman] is saying [in The New York Times piece], that it’s become the norm.

Let me read you exactly what Bateman said to Sopan Deb. He said: “Again, not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, ‘difficult.’... And what you learn is context. And you learn about character and you learn about work habits, work ethics, and you start to understand. Because it’s a very amorphous process, this sort of [expletive] that we do, you know, making up fake life. It’s a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes.”

OK, Emma, if you could see me right now, I’m just shaking my head. I just feel like what’s been the “norm,” isn’t actually acceptable. And I have met, in my short time on sets, too many people who are kind and respectful and inclusive for that to be acceptable. And that’s the thing ― it maybe has been the norm, but as tides are turning, it’s kind of like, if there’s an alternative, what are we doing?

There are too many incredibly talented creative people that are also kind. I’ve met so many of those people. And you meet them, and then you’re like, so why then do I need to be verbally abused to get a great performance? Do those things actually go hand in hand? And I don’t think they need to.

I think it’s probably true that someone with [Jeffrey Tambor’s] stature comes on set and dictates how people will be treated. As a younger actor, you’re just like, sure ... and then that behavior becomes the norm. But it’s just not OK.

I loved that Alia Shawkat pointed that out in the middle of the interview. “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable,” she said in response to Bateman. “And the point is that things are changing, and people need to respect each other differently.”

Right? But you hear that [argument] with all of the things that are happening [with Me Too]. With Dustin Hoffman, they’re like, no but this is normal. And it’s like… but why? Why does it have to be? And I think it’s been an accepted exchange ― that for an amazing performance, you put up with bad behavior. But I don’t think that means it’s right or that it’s how every set is at all.

Right. From what you’ve said it sounds like that hasn’t been your experience, and you’ve been working on a network TV show that’s been on for three years.

Yeah. And guest-starring on other sets. On the “Younger” set, because Sutton Foster’s number one, everyone is happy to be there and grateful. People set the tone. And so it depends who the power players are on set.

“I just feel like what’s been the 'norm,' isn’t actually acceptable. And I have met, in my short time on sets, too many people who are kind and respectful and inclusive for that to be acceptable.” - Vella Lovell, Heather on "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"

If you were to experience some sort of verbal abuse on a set, who would you go to to talk about that?

Well it depends what your role is. If you’re a guest star and you came on set and someone yelled at you, you have less authority than if someone came on to your show. But definitely the producers, the showrunner, the ADs [assistant directors] ― there are so many people there to protect you and make sure that things are OK.

If you weren’t getting the answers from your set, I guess you could go to your union rep. But I think usually your producers would want to help you. But then again, it depends on what the situation is. And I honestly feel that since a year ago, or whenever the [Me Too] stuff started coming out, people are more responsive.

So you feel like there’s been a shift that you’ve witnessed in the last seven months of this national dialogue around sexual harassment and assault?

Yeah. Because people know that it’s not just going into a vacuum. There is room for dialogue now because of the platform that’s happening.

The calculation that you spoke of ― this idea that you put up with horrible behavior because someone’s talented. Do you think that same latitude is offered to women and people of color?

I don’t know. I don’t think it’s just exclusive to white men. I think it’s dependent on the person. And sometimes because people are talented and genius, their behavior gets excused and they get into positions of power and no one is calling them out. It’s a lot about power, so it can happen across the board. Obviously it’s mostly white men, because that’s usually who’s in power.

Also, the entertainment industry is so relationship-based. There is a casualness built in, which seems to allow people more easily to brush potentially violating behaviors off as just joking around.

Yeah, I think that’s where that fine line is that gets really tricky. If you’re with a group of people for a long time who are creative artists, hopefully there is an understood sense of respect for each other and honor. And so some of those boundaries go down because you all trust each other, and you think a joke is a joke, and ultimately everyone is on the same page. And that’s best-case scenario: You all trust each other, you’re all there for each other, and then amazing creative things can happen. And people’s impulses are free and accepted.

But then there’s that fine line, where someone, it can be just one person, doesn’t hold that respect and crosses a boundary. And then the lines get really blurry and confusing. And it’s so complicated because everyone wants that creative freedom. But respect has to be the baseline. One person thinks that they can do or say something that isn’t said with love or respect, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “I don’t feel safe anymore.”

It’s such a fine line and I think it has to do with checking your privilege and actually respecting each other. I think that’s what’s underneath everything.

AdvertisementOnce the most powerful man in Hollywood, disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein surrendered himself to New York police Friday morning, a watershed moment for the Me Too movement catalyzed last fall by the countless women who came forward with sexual harassment and assault allegations against him.

Weinstein was arrested and charged with rape and sexual assault stemming from cases involving two accusers whose crimes were within the statute of limitations.

Some of the other women, including actresses who say they faced intimidation, reprisal and career consequences from the mogul, responded with both surprise and relief at his arrest.

Actress Rose McGowan, who has accused Weinstein of raping her at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, said she was “shocked.”

“I have to admit I didn’t think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him,” she told ABC News in an interview taped Thursday, when news outlets first reported Weinstein’s imminent surrender to authorities.

McGowan hesitated when asked if she would attend his trial, saying that “his face has terrorized me for so long,” but added that she may attend to join other survivors.

“I would rather be ready for that kind of coverage and his trial, than just coverage of him golfing in Scottsdale, so I will be ready for it,” she said. “And I will sit in that courtroom, and I will support the other survivors all around the world.”

Actress and director Asia Argento, who said Weinstein raped her at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, tweeted simply: “What took you so long Harvey?” She added later that “this is the only movie Harvey Weinstein will be remembered for.”

Her partner, chef and TV host Anthony Bourdain, tweeted that when she came forward with her allegations, “you were sure this day would never come, that you would be crushed, that you were alone. And yet you did it anyway.”

The outspoken actresses also warned that there are still countless other sexual predators who have not faced consequences for their actions.

Last week, at the closing ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival, where Weinstein was once a fixture and several of his alleged sexual assault incidents took place, Argento gave an impromptu speech, calling out other sexual predators.

“Even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women,” she said. “You know who you are, but most importantly, we know who you are, and we are not going to allow you to get away with it any longer.”Harvey Weinstein appeared in court Friday on three charges related to a monthslong sex crime investigation led by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Weinstein surrendered himself to the New York Police Department that morning.

Prosecutors charged the disgraced Hollywood producer with two rape charges, one first-degree and one third-degree, and one criminal sexual act in the first degree. The alleged incidents occurred against two women in 2013 and 2004, respectively.

Weinstein’s bail was set at $1 million, with a $10 million bond alternative.

Prosecutors said he will be fitted with a tracking device and must seek the court’s approval if he wishes to leave New York or Connecticut. He has surrendered his passport.

“Today’s charges reflect significant progress in this active, ongoing investigation,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement. “I thank the brave survivors who have come forward, and my Office’s prosecutors who have worked tirelessly on this investigation.”

Weinstein is expected to plead not guilty.

A lawyer for the former producer told reporters his team believes “that at the end of the process,” his client “will be exonerated.”

Reporters for the Times and The New Yorker ― Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey and Ronan Farrow ― received the Pulitzer Prize for public service earlier this year for their work. They, along with the women who shared their stories, are credited with sparking the Me Too and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct that have affected innumerable other, less high-profile industries.

After surrendering, Weinstein was taken to court in handcuffs Friday morning to face the charges, The Associated Press reported.

The investigation is still ongoing. Weinstein’s next court appearance is scheduled for July 30.

The NYPD said in a statement that Weinstein was charged with “rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse, and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women.”

One of the women is reportedly Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker the disgraced Hollywood producer invited her to a meeting about work opportunities in 2004. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex.

“I said, over and over, ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t,’” Evans told the outlet. “I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hard enough. I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.”

Eventually, she said, “He’s a big guy. He overpowered me.”

An unnamed law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the other woman has not spoken publicly.

Prosecutors say Weinstein kept her “physically against her will” in a Manhattan DoubleTree hotel room, where he raped her in March 2013. She will reportedly remain anonymous throughout the proceedings.

A culture of abuse in Hollywood enabled Weinstein’s alleged abuse to become an open secret in the industry, where the producer himself enjoyed all the perks of stardom.

He was said to hold the power to make or break a career.

One woman, a Netflix producer, said in a recent lawsuit against him that she could recall 11 separate incidents in which he sexually abused her.

Robert Boyce, now-retired chief of detectives for New York City, said in March that his department had gathered “quite a bit of evidence” against Weinstein, The Guardian reported.

As part of its investigation, the NYPD also examined the alleged 2010 sexual assault of “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, The Wall Street Journal reported.

De la Huerta told Vanity Fair that Weinstein sexually assaulted her twice. Both incidents allegedly occurred at her Manhattan apartment. The second time, the actress said she had been drinking and recalled feeling afraid of the producer, who had been repeatedly calling her since the first rape.

“I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig,” she told Vanity Fair.

Weinstein, meanwhile, has continually denied engaging in any nonconsensual sex acts.

In 2015, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. let Weinstein off the hook for an alleged sexual assault by an Italian model, deciding there was insufficient evidence to charge Weinstein for allegedly groping her. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered the state attorney general to review the decision, which Vance has defended.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also reportedly investigating Weinstein, as are authorities in Los Angeles and London. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York had opened a sex crime investigation to examine whether the producer lured any women across state lines to commit a sex crime.

Weinstein reportedly tried to silence many of his accusers by hiring private investigators to dig up information on the women and journalists aware of his alleged misconduct.

As ugly stories about his behavior continued stacking up last year, he checked into a rehabilitation facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, late last year.

The District Attorney’s office urges additional survivors with relevant information about Weinstein to contact the city’s Sex Crimes Hotline at 212-335-9373.
