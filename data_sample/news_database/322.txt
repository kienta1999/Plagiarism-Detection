President Donald Trump offered a half-hearted apology for retweeting anti-Muslim videos that were posted on Twitter by Britain First.

The far-right group is known in the U.K. for disseminating racist and Islamophobic clips online. Many of them are unverified and often fake.

In an interview with British media personality Piers Morgan on Thursday, Trump claimed his sharing of three unverified clips that were originally posted by Britain First in November 2017 “was not a big story” in the U.S.

Morgan then asked Trump if he could “get an apology” for the retweets and suggested it would “go a long way” to easing tensions with people in the United Kingdom.

Trump replied:

“Here’s what’s fair: If you’re telling me they’re horrible, racist people I would certainly apologize, if you’d like me to do that. I know nothing about them.”

Morgan also asked Trump whether he would disavow himself of “people like that.”

“I don’t want to be involved with people like that,” Trump said. “But you’re telling me about these people because I know nothing about these people.”

On Twitter, Morgan claimed Trump had “publicly apologized.”

A preview clip of the interview aired on “Good Morning Britain” on Friday morning. The full interview will be broadcast on the ITV channel on Sunday night.The U.S. Olympic Committee is giving USA Gymnastics’ board of directors six days to resign or else have the entire organization stripped of its certification as a national governing body.

The call for the board’s resignation is one of six requirements that the USOC has handed to USAG in an attempt to completely reform the organization in the aftermath of the sexual abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. The requirements were listed in a letter from USOC CEO Scott Blackmun to USAG’s board of directors.

The letter was reviewed by USA Today and obtained by BuzzFeed.

The first three requirements focus on the board’s resignation and the selection of a new board. The current board has six days to resign and an interim board needs to be established by Feb. 28.

USOC is also launching an independent investigation into USAG to find out who knew about Nassar’s rampant sexual abuse of female gymnasts, who should’ve known, and which officials failed to report the allegations.

According to Blackmun, an interim board must be selected a new board must be seated within 12 months. Requirements also include having a USOC-designated liaison present at all USAG board meetings, progress reports and an independent investigation into the extent of Larry Nassar’s abuse.

“Our position comes from a clear sense that USAG culture needs fundamental rebuilding,” Blackmun wrote to the baord. “This was the overarching finding in the Daniels report and it was demonstrated again in the recent testimony of Nassar’s victims.”

The Deborah Daniels’ Report, which Blackmun referred to, is the result of a six-month independent investigation commissioned by USAG and aimed at fixing problems within the organization. In June, Daniels, a former prosecutor, gave 70 recommendations to the organization, including prohibiting adult members from being alone with minor gymnasts.

Blackmun’s letter was submitted one day after Nassar, the 54-year-old disgraced sports doctor, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for child sexual abuse. Nassar is accused of sexually assaulting more than one hundred athletes, including many Olympic gymnasts, under the guise of medical treatment.

During a week of victim impact statements, many of Nassar’s victims harshly criticized the leaders of USAG and Michigan State University, where Nassar worked, for allowing the doctor to continue treating athletes even while he was being investigated for sexual abuse.

On Monday, the chair, vice chair and treasurer of USAG resigned. The board of directors consists of 21 members.

In his letter to the board, Blackmun said that USAG must cooperate with an independent investigation looking into “exactly who knew and who should have known of USAG athlete reports of abuse by Dr. Nassar (and when) and did not report these allegations appropriately.” The investigation will also look into “systematic failures that may have contributed to these failures to report.”

Over 140 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. Court documents revealed that Nassar used the cover of medical treatments to fondle and digitally penetrate the gymnasts while he was the team doctor for USAG and MSU sports teams. In her victim impact statement, Raisman lashed out against her abuser in a powerful speech.

“Larry, you do realize now that we ― this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time ― are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.”Since confirming her pregnancy, Khloe Kardashian has been open about her cravings, her workouts and dealing with her changing body.

On Thursday, the 33-year-old got real with her followers and tweeted about seeing a little more cellulite on her legs now that she’s almost seven months pregnant.

I now have cellulite on my legs! Cute! Cute! "Pregnancy may make cellulite look worse for a while, because the weight that you gain in pregnancy could make it more noticeable." — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

I feel like I've always had cellulite but it's way more prominent at the moment 🤦🏼‍♀️ — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

Kardashian also tweeted about not having stretch marks yet, which she joked was one of “the perks of being chubby previously.”

So far no stretch marks. So I'm happy about that 🤞🏽 the perks of being chubby previously. Lol my tummy knows how to stretch — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

A blogger known as Carmen ― who runs the site “A Side of Crunchy” ― took issue with the reality star’s remark. She tweeted that more celebrities should “embrace pregnancy” and her cellulite.

Stretch marks are tiger stripes you earn as a mom. I wish celebrities would embrace pregnancy 🤰 and not worry about their body image. Do you want to see what a real body of a mother of four looks like? — A Side of Crunchy (@asideofcrunchy) January 26, 2018

Embrace it you wanted a baby! — A Side of Crunchy (@asideofcrunchy) January 26, 2018

Khloe, who’s more than experienced in dealing with Twitter hate, sweetly shot down claims that she isn’t enjoying ― or embracing ― being pregnant.

How do you know that I'm not embracing it? I am enjoying every moment! I love it all. My body is a real body just as yours is. Everywoman has different shapes and sizes. That's the beauty of us being women — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

This isn’t the first time the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has fought back against people criticizing her for something during her pregnancy.

Previously, some on social media weren’t happy when Kardashian shared her pregnancy workouts on Snapchat and said it would hurt the baby.

I don’t understand why @khloekardashian is doing sport while she is pregnant.. It can cause some trauma for this little baby 😭😭 — M. Fouineur (@SaamStylee) December 27, 2017

“No it cannot! My doctor has instructed me to do so,” Khoe tweeted back in response. “Why does everyone on social media think they are a physician?? Why would I do anything to do that? If you don’t know mind your business.”

Kardashian and her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, confirmed in December that they were expecting their first child after months of speculation.

“My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby!” the reality star wrote in an emotional Instagram. “I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can’t believe that our love created life!”

AdvertisementThe entire USA Gymnastics board has agreed to resign in the wake of a pervasive sexual abuse scandal involving disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar.

The decision is one of six demands the U.S. Olympic Committee laid out in a letter to the organization Thursday, seeking to reform the organization and prevent similar conduct from happening in the future.

Had USA Gymnastics not conceded to the requirements, the USOC would have terminated its status as a national governing body.

“USA Gymnastics completely embraces the requirements outlined in the Jan. 25, 2017 letter from the United States Olympic Committee and appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change for the betterment of our organization, our athletes and our clubs,” the organization said in a statement Friday.

“We understand that the requirements imposed by the letter will help us enhance our ability to build a culture of empowerment throughout the organization, with an increased focus on athlete safety and well-being,” the statement continued. “Our commitment is uncompromising, and we hope everything we do makes this very clear.”

Three board members already resigned earlier this week, a move John Manly, an attorney who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, dismissed in a statement to HuffPost as “a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship of an organization.”

As a part of the USOC demands, USA Gymnastics must also seat a new board within 12 months, cooperate with an independent investigation into why it failed to escalate athletes’ reports of abuse by Nassar, and complete various organization-wide trainings.DAVOS — If robots, AI, nanotechnology, machine learning, and 3D printing are going to be doing all the work, what the heck will human beings do nine to five?

That was the front and center question of a panel I led at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. Titled, “Putting jobs out of work,” the panel—which I’m happy to report was full—included experts from around the world as we hashed out the nature and future of work.

The topic is actually at the very core of the work, (so to speak) of the World Economic Forum, not just now, but over its 48-year history and likely for years to come. Jobs and work of course are also at the root of so much socio-economic and political change around the world. Trumpism, Brexit and economic nationalism are in part a reaction to the dislocation and anxiety that accompanies this change.

Of course, technology and the digital revolution are the proximate causes of all this. How do individuals and institutions—companies and government—manage this disruption?

First, to get some background I asked Yuval Noah Harari, professor of history at the University of Jerusalem, and author of the highly-regarded book “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,” about the history of work.

“For many years, humans didn’t work,” he said. “They survived. Jobs are a modern notion. Anxiety about losing jobs is also nothing new.”

Harari points out that for the past two centuries, people have been predicting that machines were taking over. This time “it might be true,” he says. “Like the guy who cried wolf, eventually the wolf really came.” Meaning that the magnitude of adoption and the sophistication of machines today is such that a huge swath of jobs really is threatened. Indeed, McKinsey estimates that over the next decade or so, one third of all workers in Germany and the U.S. may need to find work in new occupations.

“I think we’re facing a crisis we aren’t talking about,” says Arlie Hochschild, longstanding professor of sociology at Cal Berkeley, and author of “Strangers in Their Own Land,” a book about working class whites in Louisiana.” Hochschild said that neither the political left or right was saying automation is here and that we need to address it with say continuing education. “My fear is that political leaders will use that anxiety that crisis creates to blame people who are not at fault like blacks and immigrants.”

Vijayakumar, CEO of HCL Technologies, an Indian-based outsourcing firm, disputed Harari fears. “If you look at this problem and focus on the technology industry, the wolf is not going to come,” he said looking at Harari. Vijayakumar’s point is that there are simply not enough skilled workers to fill all the jobs required in IT. “There are probably a million jobs in the technology sector that aren’t getting filled with the right level of talent,” he said.

Mary Flanagan, an interdisciplinary artist, scientist, humanist and a professor of digital humanities at Dartmouth College, has a creative perspective when it comes to thinking about work. “If we didn’t have this notion of 9-5 work before [in history], we could see changes that are unfamiliar forms of work,” Flanagan says. “For example, think of technological partnerships with groups of people working independently, like cooperatives. “I think we are going to see a lot of different formats for companies and corporations that we don’t have a good understanding for now.”

We spoke about what jobs were most threatened by tech. These included cashiers, highlighted by the opening of Amazon’s cashier-less store this week, and truck drivers with the eventual adoption of driverless trucks. Safer jobs—besides IT and STEM of course—might be gardening, dentistry and ministering. Although regarding the latter example, maybe not. There is now an app called Confession with a dropdown menu for sins!

The lively discussion continued with some great questions form the audience. Conclusions were hard to come by, except that all agreed that there would be much more thinking—and solutions to come.

Two weeks after a white woman called the police on a black family for setting up a charcoal grill in an Oakland, California, park, area residents threw a massive cookout in the same park, flooding the area with music, food, dancing and unity.

Videos taken at Lake Merritt on Thursday show people jumping rope, picnicking and even doing the electric slide while enjoying the public space.

“How Black Oakland responds to a white lady calling the cops on Black folks BBQing,” @BlakeDontCrack tweeted with a video of people gathered along the water.

The celebration followed an April 29 incident in which a woman ordered a black family grilling along the waterfront to pack up and leave because their charcoal grill was in a grilling area where charcoal wasn’t allowed. After the family refused to leave, the woman called the police and later accused one woman at the park of harassing her, video shows.

Oakland City Councilmember Lynette Gibson McElhaney was one of many who decried the incident as blatant racism.

“Police are not private security for any white person that’s offended by the presence of black folks in our public spaces,” she told HuffPost.

Police did not cite the family that was grilling, though they were detained and questioned for an hour over the incident, McElhaney said.

This is only one of the latest public examples of the cops being called on black people doing everyday things.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― A congressional committee is demanding information from major sports organizations, including USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, about policies against sexual abuse as lawmakers probe how gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar got away with preying on young athletes for decades.

Reports of Nassar’s sex crimes “raise serious concerns about protecting athletes from abuse and mistreatment in organized sports,” House Commerce Committee Chair Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said Friday in a statement announcing the investigation. He called Nassar’s actions “abhorrent.”

A Michigan judge this week sentenced Nassar to 40 years to 175 years in prison for sexual assault. More than 140 women and girls, including multiple Olympic gymnasts, have come forward to accuse him of abusing them under the guise of medical treatment. Many said they brought their complaints to USA Gymnastics or Michigan State University, where Nassar also worked, but were silenced or ignored.

The House investigation also will include taekwondo and swimming, as athletes of both sports have alleged sexual misconduct and a lack of oversight from the respective governing bodies.

“These organizations must have mechanisms in place to ensure complete oversight and prevent such abuses from occurring,” Walden said. “As we move forward in gathering the facts, this committee intends to hold a hearing in order to investigate these critical issues further.”

The committee also sent an inquiry to Michigan State University.

Nassar’s crimes have forced recent resignations from several top officials at USA Gymnastics and MSU, including the university president and athletic director. The remaining members of USA Gymnastics’ board resigned on Friday afternoon, after the U.S. Olympic Committee threatened the previous day to strip its certification as the sport’s governing body if the entire board did not resign.

Members of Michigan’s congressional delegation who serve on the Commerce Committee earlier called on its leaders to investigate the USOC, USA Gymnastics and MSU.

Senate lawmakers have also sought to address Nassar’s serial crimes, and the broader issue of sexual abuse in sports.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Tuesday plans to hold an event with several of Nassar’s victims, including Rachael Denhollander, the first gymnast to publicly accuse him of assault.

Feinstein plans to demand a House vote on legislation requiring sports governing bodies to immediately report sexual abuse claims to law enforcement officials. The Senate passed the legislation in November.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) requested earlier this week that the Senate establish a select committee to investigate the role of USA Gymnastics and the USOC, before the Winter Olympics begin on Feb. 9.

“The fact is, the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics have shown they can’t police themselves. Somebody needs to be held accountable,” Shaheen said Friday on MSNBC. “Now, Larry Nassar got his due in court, and I think that is very important. But there are a lot of other people involved, and the questions continue about ‘why did this go on for so long?’”The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making a modest initial investment in support of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate running in the special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional district.

The DCCC, which helps elect Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives, purchased $224,000 of television ads boosting Lamb, HuffPost confirmed with a Democratic source familiar with the ad buy. The ads will air for two weeks beginning on Jan. 30. Election Day is March 13.

Although the contribution is relatively small, it could kick off larger contributions from big donors and outside groups.

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which elects House Republicans, responded on Friday with a $300,000 ad buy of its own. The GOP group blocked out broadcast space from Monday through Election Day to air the campaign spots.

Lamb, a 33-year-old former assistant U.S. attorney and veteran of the Marines, has thus far mounted his underdog bid against Republican Rick Saccone, a 59-year-old conservative state representative, without any meaningful backing from the national party.

Lamb has nonetheless attracted the endorsement of the federal PAC End Citizens United and Daily Kos, a liberal site through which he has raised nearly $49,000.

The two candidates are vying to fill a seat vacated by Tim Murphy, an anti-abortion Republican congressman who resigned in October following revelations that he asked a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion.

At first glance, Saccone should be a shoo-in in the district. President Donald Trump won the southwestern Pennsylvania district, which the state GOP gerrymandered to favor Republicans, by nearly 20 percentage points.

But Lamb, a polished speaker with deep roots in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh, is the first formidable candidate the Democratic Party has fielded in the district in several election cycles. In a year of higher-than-normal Democratic enthusiasm, Lamb has drawn significant crowds at campaign events ― often in historically Democratic industrial towns that have increasingly trended conservative in national elections.

Lamb also has the backing of the steel- and coal-heavy district’s influential labor unions. Murphy, who ran uncontested the last two cycles, aligned himself enough with organized labor to secure the endorsement of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in 2016. Saccone, by contrast, is a supporter of right-to-work laws and other anti-labor measures.

Lamb’s candidacy has spooked top Republicans, including Trump, who held a thinly-veiled pro-Saccone event in the district last week that was supposedly to promote the president’s tax cut law.

Republican super PACs have also dumped millions of dollars of dark money in the race. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), announced this week that it was adding another $1.5 million in TV ads to its effort to take down Lamb.

Republicans have sought to characterize Lamb as a liberal stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Lamb has insisted he would not vote for Pelosi as leader and emphasized his traditional values and commitment to bipartisanship.

In Lamb’s second campaign ad, he fields a question from a military veteran in the district who is angry about partisan gridlock.

“In the military, as you know, when you don’t get the job done, you get relieved,” Lamb tells the man. “We need more of that in Washington.”When Donald Trump asked New York’s Guggenheim Museum if he could borrow a Van Gogh to place in the private living quarters of the White House, museum officials said no.

However, they did offer a fitting alternative: A solid gold toilet.

The Washington Post reported that the bizarre offer came up because White House decorators had hoped to cheer up the private living areas by displaying “Landscape With Snow,” an 1888 oil painting by Van Gogh.

This isn’t unusual. Other presidents have decorated their private spaces with classic works of art borrowed from great museum collections.

What is unusual is how museum curator Nancy Spector responded to the request.

First, she told the decorators that the painting is “prohibited from travel except for the rarest of occasions,” but was on its way to be exhibited at the Guggenheim’s museum in Bilbao, Spain.

Then after being exhibited, there, the plan was to return it to New York “for the foreseeable future.”

But Spector did offer an alternative she considered suitable: An interactive work titled “America” that is basically an 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet.

Of course, some might argue the Trump White House is a step down from the previous place where it was exhibited: a public restroom on the museum’s fifth floor.

A person would have to be pretty flush to privately own the toilet art work: The gold alone is reportedly worth more than $1 million.

However, it would definitely fit in with Trump’s aesthetic, since he has decorated his private residences with the shiny metal.

Spector, who has been critical of Trump, made the offer in an email obtained by the Post, explaining that the gold toilet is “extremely valuable and somewhat fragile, but we would provide all the instructions for its installation and care.”

The generous offer was made in September, but the Trump White House has yet to respond to it or to media inquiries about it.

The work is the creation of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan, and satirizes America’s love of excess wealth.

However, Cattelan is dodging direct comment about whether he wants the president to use his solid gold commode while tweeting at 3 a.m.

“It’s a very delicate subject,” he told the Post, when reporters asked him why he offered the artwork to the Trumps.

He added: “What’s the point of our life? Everything seems absurd until we die and then it makes sense.”

Meanwhile, Twitter users offered their thoughts on the matter.

Sykes, 37, who bills himself as a Trump-style populist and “constitutional conservative,” aims to face off against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November. On Tuesday, he posted his treatise about what he views as women’s place in society to Facebook.

Sykes said he doesn’t “buy into radical feminism’s crazed definition of modern womanhood” and claimed feminists “made it up to suit their own nasty, snake-filled heads.”

As for those home-cooked dinners, Sykes said he expects to have daughters one day who will serve these meals as they “become traditional homemakers and family wives — think Norman Rockwell here and Gloria Steinem be damned.”

Sykes also said he wants his yet-to-be-born daughters to “have their own intelligences and their own degrees” so they can establish “home-based enterprises.” He doesn’t want them to become “career-obsessed banshees who forego home life and children and the happiness of family to become nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.”

Sykes had lived in Missouri for less than a year when he filed to become a candidate in September, per the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. His position paper on women’s rights was part of an 11-page statement he sent to the newspaperlast year, which described him as a “mystery candidate.”

John Messmer, political science professor at St. Louis Community College at Meramec, told the newspaper that Sykes’ positions read like “Trump-inspired populism on steroids.”

“I’m 99.9 percent sure it’s not parody,” Messmer said. “I do hold back that .1 percent. This might be one of the greatest examples of political performance art I’ve ever seen.”

By Thursday night, some 3,700 comments had been posted to Sykes’ Facebook page, with almost every responder agog or appalled. People on Twitter also weighed in:

Maura Gonsalves had not seen her U.S. Navy supply officer boyfriend Noah Copeland for more than a year, after he was deployed to the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.

That was until Thursday, when daytime television host Ellen DeGeneres reunited the couple from San Diego, California, on her show.

Needless to say, things got emotional real fast.

DeGeneres set up the tearjerking segment by reading out a letter from Copeland asking for tickets to Ellen’s upcoming birthday special on his girlfriend’s behalf.

Gonsalves, who was in the audience, joined DeGeneres on stage to talk about her relationship. Then Copeland joined her, with the passes to Ellen’s party and a gigantic bunch of flowers in hand.

As if that wasn’t enough, the couple revealed how a planned vacation to Puerto Rico had been scuppered by Hurricane Maria. So, they donated their holiday cash to the Caribbean island’s relief effort instead.

As a way of saying thank you, DeGeneres gifted Gonsalves a six-night trip to Hawaii. “I can’t give you (Copeland) a gift because you’re not allowed to accept anything because you’re in the military,” said DeGeneres. But, turning to Gonsalves, she said “I can give you a gift and if you chose to include him that’s your business.”So you posed for the pictures, and now you're saying you don't trust the New York Times because they used a photo that you posed for the New York Times?

Sean Hannity on Thursday night was forced to backtrack on his own show as Fox News confirmed a New York Times report he had just attacked.

Earlier in his show, Hannity blasted a report that said President Donald Trump had tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller last year and accused the Times of “trying to distract you.”

“Our sources, and I’ve checked in with many of them, they’re not confirming that tonight,” he said. “And how many times has the New York Times and others gotten it wrong?”

By the end of the show, he was forced to admit that Fox News had confirmed the Times report.

His response?

First he said the president has the right to “raise those questions” about conflicts of interest without actually addressing Trump’s reported attempt to fire Mueller, promising to deal with it tomorrow.

Then, the man who had earlier in the show accused the Times of distraction quickly switched to footage of a police chase and car crash.Gwyneth Paltrow opened up about her divorce from Coldplay singer Chris Martin on Thursday’s “The Late Show,” and said he’s now “like a brother.”

Their “conscious uncoupling” in 2014 and official parting in 2016 was a “terrible,” “painful” and “hard” experience, the actress told host Stephen Colbert.

But with Paltrow now engaged to “Glee” creator Brad Falchuk, the exes are getting on great guns. “He’s really like my brother,” said Paltrow of Martin. “We’re very familial. It’s really nice. It’s great.”

Colbert suggested it was “hard to describe someone you had children with as your brother,” to which Paltrow lightheartedly fired back: “Which would explain the divorce.”Davos Economic Forum attendees booed President Donald Trump at an appearance on Friday in which he criticized the media as “fake.”

Trump told world political and business leaders at the annual gathering in Switzerland that as a businessman, he received positive media coverage, but once he launched his presidential campaign in 2015, he realized that reporters were “nasty” and “fake,” eliciting boos from people in the audience.

“It wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be ― as the cameras start going off in the back,” Trump said. The president frequently makes the false claim that television cameras don’t air his anti-media remarks.

Some reporters at the forum said some of booing came from foreign journalists.

Audience members also booed World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab when he introduced Trump by saying that “your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations.”

Several delegates from Africa had planned to protest Trump’s speech, in response to the president’s reported reference to Haiti and African countries as “shithole countries” during a meeting with congressional leaders this month. It was unclear if that protest occurred, as some attendees needed to leave the speech before its conclusion.

Earlier in the day, Trump met with Rwanda President Paul Kagame, the head of the African Union, which criticized Trump’s racist remarks.

According to reporters, Trump ignored questions about whether the two leaders discussed his comments.

Trump also dismissed reports in The New York Times and other outlets that he ordered the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller last summer, calling the reports “fake news.”

“Typical New York Times. Fake stories,” Trump said.

Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has had well-documented issues with his weight.

So when a fan mocked his love of doughnuts on Twitter, Barkley didn’t back down.

During a conversation about the player draft for the upcoming NBA All-Star Game on TNT’s “Inside the NBA” Thursday, the tweet came to the attention of the man known in his playing days as the Round Mound Of Rebound.

“Charles Barkley would pick Krispy Kreme donuts for the first pick,” the Los Angeles Lakers fan wrote.

The outspoken commentator bared his claws in reply, telling the tweeter, “Look at your fat ass, too” and referred to him as the “fat Laker fan.”

Fortunately, the guy didn’t appear to take it personally.

A New York Times report published late Thursday and quickly confirmed by Fox News and other media said President Donald Trump attempted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller in June, alleging conflicts of interest in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump backed off after White House counsel Donald McGahn threatened to quit, saying the firing would have a “catastrophic” effect, the Times reported.

“It’s something we have to tell you about because it is a headline in The New York Times,” co-host Ainsley Earhardt said on “Fox & Friends” before dismissing the news.

“What do you think about that? Do ya even care?” she asked.

Earhardt and her co-hosts didn’t mention that their own network confirmed the report. Instead, they immediately brought out video showing Trump denying the story.

“Fake news, folks, fake news. Typical New York Times fake news story,” the president, a well-known fan of “Fox & Friends,” said from Davos, Switzerland.

Co-host Pete Hegseth said the story “screams of a leak from the special counsel.”On Wednesday, aspiring filmmaker Jennifer Jarosik filed a $5 million lawsuit against Simmons, alleging that he sexually assaulted her.

She claims that the 60-year-old raped her at his Los Angeles home in 2016 after she refused to have sex with him.

On Thursday, Simmons released a statement in response saying, “All of my relations have been consensual.” He vowed to “relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.”Domhnall Gleeson isn’t among Hollywood’s go-to leading lads, and yet he has one of today’s most enviable movie careers.

The world took notice of the Irish actor in “Never Let Me Go” and as Bill Weasley in the final two “Harry Potter” flicks. What has followed is a medley of genre-hopping roles ― you try going from “About Time” to “Frank” to “Unbroken” ― and a playful charm defined by his floppy red mane and bashful smile. Gleeson’s nice-guy image is part of what makes him effective as the screechy General Hux in the new “Star Wars” movies; we’re scared of him, and amused by him, because we don’t quite know where all that rage comes from.

That same dynamic undergirds “A Futile and Stupid Gesture,” a comedic biopic about the satirical magazine National Lampoon that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this week ahead of its Netflix release on Friday. Gleeson plays Henry Beard, the gifted, witty, pipe-smoking misanthrope who co-founded the Lampoon after graduating from Harvard University. This is one of seven movies in the span of five months to feature Gleeson. In a couple of weeks, he’ll also star in a big-screen adaptation of “Peter Rabbit.” As usual, he’s never done anything resembling either project.

At Sundance, I gabbed with Gleeson about the polarizing reactions to “mother!” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” which of his movies he knew he’d like before seeing them, and how thrilled he is for his “Goodbye Christopher Robin” co-star Margot Robbie’s Oscar nomination.

You had a nice 2017. Between September and December, “American Made,” “mother!” (even if it didn’t do bonanza business), “Goodbye Christopher Robin,” “Crash Pad” and “Star Wars” opened. Now that we’re seeing so much of you, looking back, is there a moment when you felt your career had broken through?

Yeah, but it’s all in retrospect. It never feels like it at the moment. These are stories we tell ourselves to make sense of our lives afterward, to put it in some context — and actually it’s not the way things really were at the time. It’s funny. It’s why I think, unless they’re diaries, no autobiography can really sum anybody up.

Getting a job with the Coen brothers [in “True Grit”] was massive for me. Even though it was a small part and did not have a big effect on my career per se, working with them, I could have retired. I mean, I would have been stuck for money forever, but that was a high point. Working with Martin McDonagh [in “Six Shooter”] at the very beginning, huge. That was my first job. It was massive. And then doing “Anna Karenina” made me a better actor. Working with Joe Wright made me a better actor. And then, in 2015, I got to do an Alex Garland movie, “Ex Machina,” and there was “The Revenant” and a few things that came out around the same time that felt like, oh man, things came together, and I was in some stuff that mattered to people.

And you say “mother!” did not do bonanza business. I don’t know whether they made their money back or anything like that, but more people saw “mother!’ than have seen most films I’ve been in, and I think that’s amazing. I adore that film. To me, that’s a total success, that movie, from top to bottom.

Gleeson in "Star Wars: The Last Jedi." Disney

In terms of your public profile, I think the shift happened between “Ex Machina” and “Brooklyn.” That’s when people started knowing your name and anticipating what was to come for you.

Yeah, which is strange, though. That’s never really been the way I’ve thought of being successful as an actor, or breaking through, or anything like that. All you want is to contribute well to good pieces of work. That’s really the big thing. And I had done that before those films, and I contributed, even though it may have been small, to “True Grit” and to “The Lieutenant of Inishmore,” the Martin McDonagh play. It’s funny the way it’s perceived and the way that it feels.

So let’s talk “mother!’ for a bit. Your role is small, and you didn’t do much press for the movie when it was opening. Did you keep up with the polarized reactions that came out of it?

I loved it. I think anybody that had a problem with the movie has the right to have a problem with the movie. I understand why people would not enjoy that piece of work, in the same way that, with some of the great artists in a gallery, I will not engage with a painting that’s seen to be a masterpiece, and then I’ll walk up to the next one and maybe not everyone else likes it but I’ll spend an hour in front of it. It’s the same thing.

The experience of making it — first of all, I got to make it with my brother, [Brian Gleeson]. We got to walk into a room to rehearse with Darren Aronosky, Jennifer Lawrence, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Harris, Javier Badem ― these giants who operate at such a high level. And me and my brother are nervously standing there before we went in to take this on. Even though it was only for two minutes of screen time, it was as exhilarating as anything else I’ve done in my life when it comes to work. It was a privilege to be a small part of that.

Whatever anyone’s opinion of it, there aren’t many movies like “mother!” As you observed it, what was the technique used to create its mounting chaos?

Darren explained to us the way he was shooting it, which was on Jen the whole time, and then over her shoulder and POV’d. They were going to be the three angles used in the film. I was like, “Fucking cool! Sign me up.” And then you get him to go about that business, and you concentrate on trying to be good in the scene. All of those actors have different ways of working. They all have different energies, and then I’ve got my own thing going, and so does Brian. So it was more about how we fit into the room, you know? That was the joyful thing. And when you would really feel it sing and you would hit it, it was just brilliant. I knew in the shooting of it that I would like the film, which I never know.

You’ve never felt that on anything else?

I knew I would like “Anna Karenina.” I knew I would like “Ex Machina.” I didn’t know whether anyone else would like them, but I knew I would. For some reason, those are the three things. Oh, and “Frank,” [directed by] Lenny Abrahamson.

You’re in Lenny’s next movie, “The Little Stranger,” based on the Sarah Waters novel. As a horror fan, I can’t wait. Is it terrifying?

I don’t know. I think it will mean something — I think that’s more important. And the book is not terrifying. The book is disquieting and odd. There’s an edge to it all the time — it’s just there, and it kind of vibrates. I hope the film has something of that in it.

Will Forte and Gleeson in "A Futile and Stupid Gesture." Netflix

I don’t know if you keep up with what people say about you online —

I try not to.

The internet —and I include myself in that — likes General Hux a lot. Partly because he’s an interesting character for that universe, but also because he’s just so screamy. He’s teed up at every turn. It’s fun to watch. What were your conversations with J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson about the kind of screen presence you would bring to that role?

Well, J.J. needed him to occupy a certain place in the first movie. He needed him to be the Peter Cushing type in that film. But because they cast it so much younger, it didn’t make sense to try to give him all the gravitas that Cushing had. Instead, he gave him a kind of mania about maintaining his position. He wants to succeed Snoke, but he knows Kylo Ren is the favored son. It’s this deep insecurity, and they’re the worst bullies. The guy who gets beaten up at school then goes home and kicks the shit out of his brother, you know what I mean? They’re the worst. And I think that was the kind of thing that we wanted him to have. He knows that he’s always on the edge of losing everything. He’s just desperate to maintain position and to improve, and as a result he’s just a very nasty piece of work.

That was with J.J., and then Rian had this thing where he wanted to use that in a different way in the second film. He was really smart. The one thing I didn’t want to lose was the possibility that he could still matter to the story. He could still do something that could change things, not just be a punching bag. And Rian said, “OK, well, if a dog is kicked enough, when he eventually bites, it’s going to be hard.” So that’s what we tried to put in there, to have all the fun with it that he wanted to have but still maintain the [original concept]. We thought, if he had a knife, he would gut you like a fish. I think that’s the place we wanted to go with the second one.

I was really happy with it. If J.J. decides to use me in the third one, I just can’t wait to see what he’s got planned, because he’s so smart.

Is there a question about whether he’ll use you?

I think there’s a question about whether he’ll use anybody. You just don’t know until they send you a script.

Are you not contracted for a third movie?

Everyone had to sign up for three, as far as I know — or at least that’s what I was told. But you don’t know; it could be that you die in an explosion in a ship that nobody sees and they go, “Hux is dead!” So I’m waiting to see.

Did you keep up with the so-called backlash surrounding “The Last Jedi”?

Yeah, I’ve heard about it, of course. I respect anybody’s opinion to not be happy with something. If you pay your 10 bucks and you go and watch the movie and you don’t like it, it is your right to express that online. It’s your right to not like somebody, or to not like the whole thing, or whatever. All I know is how I feel about it, and I’m really glad that Rian changed things up and brought some of himself to it, in the same way that J.J. brought himself to it. I really like Rian’s films. I think this is a “Star Wars” film and it’s also a Rian Johnson film. And both of those things excite me equally.

Have you seen “Jupiter Ascending,” the Wachowski siblings movie?

I’ve not, no, but my friend Eddie Redmayne is in it.

Well, funny you say that. There are similarities between Eddie Redmayne’s villain in that movie and General Hux. They both have a loud, manic, bitter energy. I was curious whether you’d ever heard that comparison.

No, I have not. I haven’t talked to Eddie for ages, which is a pity because he is the nicest man and the most brilliant actor. I really hope to catch up with him soon. I’ll be sure to bring it up with him next time we talk.

Please do. Tell me if you disagree: “A Futile and Stupid Gesture” is your most traditionally comedic role yet.

Yeah, well, perhaps in terms of it being an out-and-out comedy, except really Henry Beard in this film functions as a dramatic constituent, as well as having a couple of funny moments. It was a joy to play with these people. Matt Walsh is an absolute genius. Will Forte is just amazing. All of these great people who I got to be around and do scenes with. I loved it. But I’m aware of my weaknesses, and ad-libbing genius one-liners, which is what Henry Beard would do in real life, is not my forte, if you’ll excuse the pun. Luckily, the script took care of all that for me. I loved it. The world was very distinct.

Jerry Seinfeld was talking recently about what the best sitcoms have, or the best movies, and it’s a good universe. It’s a world you want to spend time in. It understands itself. They understood the world so well, so I felt I understood it. Fitting into it was lovely.

This is one of several movies that uses meta storytelling, with the older version of Will Forte’s character narrating scenes in person without actively participating in them. I’ve seen a couple others at Sundance that break the fourth wall, and “I, Tonya” did it in a big way last year.

Oh, that was brilliant. Brilliant. Margot Robbie, fucking hell.

I’m glad she got the Oscar nomination.

Oh, I know! I just heard about it. Fucking hell! It’s like I’m excited for her, but she deserves it, you know what I mean? It’s amazing.

But here’s the thing: The meta thing I have limited patience for a lot of the time. When a genius does it, like Charlie Kaufman, he comments on the way the story is being told. He does it with soul. The whole world understands itself.

Like in “Adaptation.”

“Adaptation,” yeah. It’s beautiful what he does with that. I think when it’s used cheaply, it feels really cheap. I think “I, Tonya” uses it really, really well, reminding people that just because we’re telling you this story that does not mean that’s exactly what happened. They use it really well. And I think this film used it for all the right reasons and in all the right ways. So that makes me happy. But when a film starts to be happy with itself because it believes itself to be clever, I have very limited patience.

Gleeson in "Ex Machina." A24

“Peter Rabbit” opens in a few weeks. What is the appeal of that role for you as an actor? I haven’t seen it yet, so that’s not meant as a value judgment.

Oh, I haven’t either. Rose Byrne was attached.

That is a good appeal.

That’s a reason to do any job. Will Gluck was directing it, and I really love “Easy A.” The script was really funny, and it was just a different thing for me to try. I’d never done a kids movie, or anything like that. If it makes kids laugh, what’s purer than that?

In the same way that some people aren’t crazy about things that happen in “The Last Jedi,” I’m sure there will be people who “Peter Rabbit” means a lot to who’ll be unsure. But I will understand that. I’ve got a feeling that the limited number of young children I know will laugh at it, and if you make a kid laugh, I don’t care how you do it. I think it’s smart and clever, and it has a heart. I hope it’s funny. I want to watch it with a room full of kids. That will tell me whether it works.

Do you often have that experience, where your movie is opening in a matter of weeks and you haven’t laid eyes on it yet?

You always see bits and pieces in ADR and stuff. With “Peter Rabbit,” it’s different because all the animated stuff is in post-production, so they’re doing their own thing. Yeah, I didn’t see “The Last Jedi” until I was in the theater watching it the first night. The same with “The Force Awakens.” “Mother!” was the same. It often happens. And it’s exciting. Watching it with an audience is the way to do it.

And with the others, do you just get a screener and watch it at home?

Yeah, and you just hate yourself. It’s better to watch it with a bunch of other people who can tell you whether they hate you or not. It’s the sad reality.

The marketing campaign behind “mother!” was so enigmatic. At the press screening at the Toronto Film Festival, at 9 a.m. on a Sunday, everyone was giddy because we knew very little about the movie. It’s a stark contrast to “Star Wars,” which teases its characters and certain plot points months in advance. The “Force Awakens” trailer came out more than a year before the movie opened. That’s blockbuster culture in a nutshell, and I’m curious what you make of that saturation, compared to the mysterious “mother!” rollout, knowing that you didn’t see either until you were with an audience.

Well, I think a script is always going to be very different than a movie. I’d only read the script, and I got a sense of what was happening on the set, but no, the escalating madness of “mother!” sat me back in my seat and had me overwhelmed at times. I had felt that way reading the script. I had to put the script down, take a walk, go back to the script, because it was so full-on.

But one of the great joys in seeing something that you don’t know much about is not knowing the ending of the thing before you see it. There’s a reason that watching “The Usual Suspects” and knowing the ending is different than watching “The Usual Suspects” for the first time. Those are some of the moments that you live for, like, what the fuck is happening? And when something really takes you with it, that’s a special moment.

But when you have a train that is just barreling forward, some people are not going to stay with it. Some people are going to get off. And if it doesn’t stop, they’re not getting off politely — they’re going to be thrown and roll 17 times down the ditch and say, “What the fuck was that?” I think that’s the effect of “mother!,” but I’d rather be in something like that instead of something where you’re like, “Huh, that is lovely.”

Your episode of “Black Mirror” is often ranked among the show’s best. Have you watched the new season?

“USS Calister,” [the first episode of the season], is the only one I’ve seen. Cristin Milioti is an absolute delight in it. “Delight” sounds cheap, actually. She’s just fucking brilliant. It’s brilliant acting. And Jesse Plemons is wonderful. I thought it was a fantastic piece of work. It’s so cleverly judged as well, because when Jesse starts doing that voice [at the start], you’re like, this is amazing — am I watching this for a whole episode? And then when he walks into that office and he looks so different! Oh man, it’s just absolutely brilliant. And Cristin judged that journey, that arc so well, with such humor, in the middle of it all. When “Black Mirror” gets it right, it gets it so right.Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) has decided to retire from Congress amid reports that he secretly settled a misconduct complaint against him filed by a former aide whom he reportedly said was his “soul mate.”

Meehan told his campaign chairman that he would not seek reelection to Congress in 2018, according to a letter obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Washington Post.

HuffPost confirmed with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) office that Meehan alerted the speaker of his retirement.

“After consultation with my wife Carolyn and with my three sons, and after prayerful reflection, I write to inform you that I will not seek re-election to the United States Congress for the 7th Congressional District in 2018,” Meehan wrote to his campaign chairman.

Meehan was booted from his post on the House Ethics Committee after the Times published a story on Saturday revealing a harassment settlement reached between Meehan and his former aide.

The aide, who remains anonymous, and staffers familiar with her job told the Times that Meehan had expressed interest in the aide’s personal life, which many found to be unprofessional. Meehan reportedly attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with her after she entered a serious relationship, then acted hostile toward her after she rejected him.

Meehan’s advances made the aide so uncomfortable that she filed a complaint against Meehan, began working from home, and eventually quit.

After mandatory counseling and mediation sessions, Meehan and his former aide reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum and signed a nondisclosure agreement.

Meehan reportedly paid the settlement using his congressional office fund, which includes taxpayer money.

In an attempt to defend himself, Meehan told news reporters on Tuesday that he did not pursue a romantic relationship with the aide, but said that he did tell her last year that he saw her as a “soul mate.”

In his letter to the campaign chairman, he expressed regret for using that term to describe the aide.

“No characterization of the work relationship I shared with a uniquely close colleague could have been more personally harmful than when I described that co-worker as a ‘soul-mate,”’ he wrote, according to the letter obtained by the Inquirer.

“I truly didn’t even consider or understand the full implications of the use of that term. Quite simply to me a soul-mate means a uniquely close person who is joined with you on a daily basis, in which you both share the routine successes and strains of a work day.”

Meehan also said that he was retiring because news of the settlement had “become a major distraction,” adding that his “conduct” was at fault.

“Unfortunately, recent events concerning my office and the settlement of certain harassment allegations have become a major distraction,” Meehan wrote. “I need to own it because it is my own conduct that fueled the matter.”New York Daily News managing editor Rob Moore is seen in a photo from April 2017.

At the New York Daily News, the managing editor, Rob Moore, has been heard on more than one occasion offering a piece of advice to those around him: Don’t go to human resources to complain about me, or you’re out of here.

“I heard that with my own ears,” said a former female staffer. “It was like his motto.”

This wasn’t bluster. This was a tactic. A second former staffer said Moore for years would brag openly about punishing or firing employees who complained about him ― specifically as a warning to other would-be complainants. The message was well understood, and it reverberated around the newsroom. New York Daily News employees warned one another not to get on Moore’s “bad side,” said a third former staffer.

When people did complain about Moore’s behavior, he would publicly express his anger, said three staffers. Tabloid newsrooms are known for being crude and volatile places to work, particularly for young reporters ― another top editor at the paper is also currently under investigation ― but Moore’s brand of harassment could be “more cruel” than the tongue-lashings often delivered to young reporters, said a fourth former staffer.

“He always seemed like someone who revelled in having power and lording it over the people that he could,” said a fifth former staffer. A sixth added, “He had all the power there, and it wouldn’t be good to be on the receiving end of his fury.”

Earlier this week, the Daily News’ new corporate parent, Tronc, launched an investigation into Moore after NPR asked the company about a sexual harassment complaint lodged against him in December, soon after he reportedly interviewed to become the newspaper’s new editor-in-chief.

For many people who’ve worked with Moore, the surprise wasn’t that he had come under investigation, but that it had taken so long.

“Everyone knew about this ― like, everyone,” said the first staffer.

This is my me too. It’s hard. https://t.co/jrr6h4YqEA — Tina Moore (@TinaMoorereport) January 23, 2018

HuffPost has spoken to more than 20 current and former employees of the Daily News, many of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. “He’s an incredibly vengeful guy,” said one of them. The sources described a wide spectrum of inappropriate and threatening behavior ― both in public and in private ― by a man who abused his position of power inside the Daily News’ “frathouse” atmosphere in a way that kept many employees quiet. Moore and Tronc both did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

(Note: One of the reporters on this story, Andy Campbell, interviewed for a position under Moore in 2014, when he was offered, but did not accept, a job.)

Moore first joined the Daily News as a reporter in 2004. From the start, said several former employees, it was clear he had a big personality and plenty of ambition. He had a knack for editing, too, and soon rose up the masthead.

“He had really, really good strengths,” said one former staffer, “and really, really horrible negatives.”

In the office, he had a habit of calling employees over to show them photos of women he’d slept with, according to multiple former staffers. “When it came to his sexual harassment, it often consisted of him bragging about his sexual exploits,” one staffer said. “He would often make co-workers uncomfortable with his bragging, sometimes showing pictures — not naked pictures, but certainly suggestive pictures — of women he was with.”

One staffer said Moore commented on her appearance on multiple occasions, calling her “hot” and texting her to come out after work.

“I was just very uncomfortable each time I went to the office, because I knew I had to pass his desk and then would get a text from him,” the woman said. “Most of the time I’d ignore his text, but at times I’d say I was busy and couldn’t go out because of one thing or another, so I never gave him a chance for anything worse.”

At bars, he hit on waitresses, then insulted their looks in front of other employees when he got turned down, according to a former staffer.

Most of the behavior was out in the open and witnessed by many. Still, Moore commanded respect in the newsroom, staffers said, and expected people to express their respect for and loyalty to him.

“If they didn’t play the game, then they would be frozen out,” said one former staffer.

At least six people HuffPost spoke to used the word “bully” to describe Moore. “You’re never supposed to be afraid of your editor, but he was one of those editors who would honestly strike fear into you,” said one former staffer.

“He didn’t treat people professionally,” another former staffer said. “He would hold grudges based on stuff that had nothing to do with the office. It didn’t take him long to size you up as someone he liked or didn’t like, and it often had nothing to do with the quality of your work.”

Others noted that Moore’s behavior on social media was unprofessional and “thirsty.” He took particular interest in models on Facebook, commenting publicly on their racy photos ― a practice that doesn’t necessarily violate any workplace policies, but that staffers said made them uncomfortable and was “unbecoming” of upper management.

Considering Moore’s threats about firing or laying off those who complained about him, some employees worried that any complaint lodged against him would end in their dismissal.

“That’s why nobody reported him to HR ― you’d get in trouble,” said one former staffer. “You just kind of kept your head down and tried to keep out of his field of attack.”

In part, multiple people said, Moore was a reflection of his environment ― a male-dominated tabloid paper where women were objectified. “The whole newsroom had this really misogynistic undertone,” said one staffer. “They were all running around behaving in terrible ways, creating a sexualized environment and a toxic environment. It took a lot of people in charge to do that.”

Moore isn’t alone in being investigated. On Thursday, HuffPost confirmed that Tronc is also looking into allegations of workplace harassment against Alexander “Doc” Jones, the managing editor of the Sunday desk. Six employees HuffPost spoke to said Jones had a “pattern” of behaving creepily toward young women in the newsroom.

“As a woman starting a job at the Daily News, you’re given a card key and a warning about Doc,” a current staffer told us.

The accusations include multiple incidents of forcible kissing, and five employees told us that Jones had a penchant for bringing young women to his side of the newsroom for the sole purpose of ogling them.

“I stopped wearing dresses to work. I stopped wearing makeup, too,” another employee said. “I purposely tried to not look like myself for fear of being summoned to Doc’s desk.”

Jones was escorted out of the newsroom on Thursday by a human resources employee, but Tronc confirmed to HuffPost that he was still employed.

The paper has new ownership and a freshly minted interim editor-in-chief in Jim Kirk, the former interim editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Times. What happens next to Jones and Moore is anyone’s guess.
