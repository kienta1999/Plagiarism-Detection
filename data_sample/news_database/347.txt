WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday said it had asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling last week that blocked President Donald Trump’s move to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.

The Republican president in September rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program put in place in 2012 by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, effective in March. A variety of Democratic state attorneys general, organizations and individuals challenged Trump’s action in multiple federal courts.

(Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Sandra Maler)The Trump administration violated two court orders to stop enforcing the president’s restrictions on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries last year, the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General wrote in a report released Friday.

That’s a big deal. The constitution requires executive branch officials to obey lawful court orders. “No Department of Government is free to circumvent court orders, even when they are exceptionally difficult to enforce,” the IG report noted. But in the early days of the Trump administration, DHS — then led by Gen. John Kelly, who is now President Donald Trump’s chief of staff — did just that, the inspector general found.

Here’s how it went down.

First, “shock and confusion.”

Homeland Security was “caught by surprise” when Trump signed the hastily drafted executive order on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 27, the report said. Without a copy of the order, Customs and Border Protection officials had to rely on media accounts to predict what they’d have to do. Some CBP officers in the field “reacted with shock and confusion.” The Department of Homeland Security’s top lawyer, Joseph Maher, didn’t see a draft of the order until one hour before it was signed. No one at CBP saw it before it was signed at all.

The rushed implementation and sloppy crafting of the order led to widespread confusion over key questions, like whether green card holders were subjected to the ban. The question wasn’t resolved until well into the evening Trump signed the order.

Saturday: The Trump administration stops enforcing the ban in U.S. airports, but continues blocking people from boarding planes

The night Trump issued his order, a federal judge in Brooklyn halted the travel ban with a nationwide injunction. That case was brought by Hameed Darweesh, an Iraqi national who faced threats in his home country after working for the U.S. military. It was the first of a spate of rulings against the travel ban issued by federal judges across the country.

After the Darweesh decision, CBP stopped enforcing the travel ban at U.S. airports, where agents had been detaining some of the people from the seven countries, subjecting them to prolonged questioning and threatening them with deportation if they did not voluntarily board a flight out of the country. Instead, those stuck in limbo without valid visas were given waivers and allowed to enter the country.

Courts order the Trump administration to allow travelers to board U.S.-bound planes, but DHS ignores the orders

The day after the Darweesh order, a federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to tell airlines that travelers wouldn’t be denied entry to the United States because of the executive order.

A federal judge in Los Angeles handed down a similar order a couple of days later, telling the Trump administration to stop “blocking the entry” of people subject to the order while the lawsuit moved forward. Those straightforward words would obviously require CBP to stop telling airlines not to board citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries.

But even after the Boston and Los Angeles decisions, CBP agents continued doing “everything in its power” to block travelers who had not sued the government from boarding planes for the U.S. — in violation of the Boston and L.A. orders, the inspector general’s team found.

“By preventing individuals subject to the EO [executive order] from reaching the United States, through various methods, CBP effectively circumvented provisions of these orders,” the report said.

Those actions “reflect direction from the very top of DHS,” the report said.

DHS denies doing anything wrong

DHS denied that the Trump administration violated the court orders, writing that the independent inspector general’s report was based on “legal and factual inaccuracies and is methodologically flawed.”

“It is important for Congress and the public to know that DHS did not countenance any violation of a court order, including those specifically discussed in this Report,” DHS official Jim Crumpacker wrote in a letter attached to the report. “Any implication or statement to the contrary is unfortunate and misleading.”

But the ACLU echoed the inspector general. “The findings that the federal government violated court orders are deeply troubling,” Cody Wofsy, a staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project who worked on the Darweesh case, told HuffPost. “The report underscores that effectively the White House devised and implemented this policy without consultation with the national security experts in the government. And really the same policy is now in effect with really only minor changes.”

The fight over the report

The report’s conclusions were first made public in November, when the Department of Homeland Security’s former Inspector General, John Roth, sent a letter to the three senators who requested the investigation into the widely criticized rollout of the travel restrictions. Roth resigned later that month.

But DHS slowed the report’s release for months, arguing that some of the material shouldn’t be made public because it would reveal confidential deliberations. Several passages of the report released Friday are redacted.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who joined two of her Senate colleagues in requesting the report last January, is livid about what investigators found — and that the administration is still hiding parts of the report.People walk past the LA Times building in Los Angeles. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters

Los Angeles Times staffers have voted to unionize, defying pressure from the newspaper’s leaders to abandon the effort.

The final vote count for the @latguild: 248 in favor, 44 against. A landslide victory, and a historic day for the Los Angeles Times newsroom. 🦅✊ — L.A. Times Guild 🦅 (@latguild) January 19, 2018

The newsroom held a vote to join the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America in the first week of January, and the National Labor Relations Board tallied the results on Friday. Staffers and their union representation will now begin negotiations on a contract with management.

The announcement comes a day after an NPR report uncovered allegations of sexual misconduct against the Times’ publisher and CEO, Ross Levinsohn, increasing tensions between staffers and the executives who have long been hostile to the union campaign.

On Friday, the paper’s publisher, Tronc, announced that Levinsohn has taken a voluntary unpaid leave of absence while his conduct is investigated.

“We will not hesitate to take further action, if appropriate, once the review is complete,” Justin Dearborn, Tronc’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.

The day before the Jan. 4 vote, the paper’s editor-in-chief, Lewis D’Vorkin, and its former interim executive editor, Jim Kirk, made a last-ditch effort to quash the union campaign.

In a lengthy letter to the newsroom that day, D’Vorkin and Kirk warned that unionizing would not guarantee better compensation, and suggested that union leaders may not act in the best interest of Times staffers.

“Will they represent you, or parity for the union?” they wrote.

“So, the question to you is do you want to preserve your independence and the independence of the Los Angeles Times or do you want someone else negotiating on your behalf?” the letter read.

The letter also attempted to raise suspicion about union leaders who may say “they can protect against layoffs,” and listed unionized newsrooms where layoffs have recently occurred, including HuffPost. However, it is standard in unionized newsrooms for management to maintain the right to lay off employees.

Tronc has also firmly rebuffed the union campaign that staffers launched in October, warning that in attempts to negotiate for better compensation, union members may be forced to lose out on other benefits, such as 401(k) matching.

The Times’ union campaign organizers say the claims that there won’t be enough money to go around are baseless. Tronc is spending an outsize amount on salaries and perks for its executives, they say, including an “eye-popping” $8.1 million paid to Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn last year, more than $4 million spent on a private jet for Tronc chairman Michael Ferro and other costs on executives they say are much higher than what comparable publishers spend.Rep. Darren Soto asked for clarification on the Florida waters decision at a congressional hearing Friday. Bill Clark via Getty Images

WASHINGTON — Despite Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s announcement last week, the waters off the coast of Florida are still being considered for future offshore oil and gas drilling, according to the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

At a congressional hearing Friday, Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) asked acting BOEM Director Walter Cruickshank if Zinke was “getting ahead of the game” when he tweeted that he had taken Florida waters “off the table.”

“The secretary’s statement stands on its own,” Cruickshank told the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. “We are following the process and the secretary’s decisions will be reflected in the proposed program decision.”

“By ‘stand on its own,’ it just stands on its own but it’s not an official action? Is that what you mean?” Soto questioned.

“It is not a formal action, no,” Cruickshank said.

The acting director added later that Florida’s coastal waters “are still part of the analysis until the secretary gives us an official decision.”

Zinke has given the people of Florida a false sense of security, Soto said at the hearing.

“As you can appreciate, many Floridians now believe that we are off the table, that there is going to be no offshore drilling because of that statement,” the congressman said. “And that’s not true. We still have to go through an analysis to determine whether that’s going to happen or not.”

A few days into the new year, the Trump administration released a sweeping plan to boost America’s fossil fuel production that would make available for drilling leases roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, including huge swaths of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. The move drew instant outrage from both Democrats and Republicans.

Less than a week later, just two days into a 60-day public comment period, Zinke announced that at the recommendation of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) — whom he called a “straightforward leader that can be trusted” — he would remove the state’s coastal waters from the areas that could be leased for drilling. Zinke broke the news from Tallahassee after a brief face-to-face meeting with Scott, an otherwise staunch Trump ally who had pushed back against the offshore proposal even before it was officially revealed. In a Twitter post that same day, Zinke referenced Scott — who continues to deny the science behind climate change and has long supported drilling in and around Florida — in declaring that “local voices matter.” Many wondered if the announcement about Florida was a political stunt to help get Scott elected to the Senate this year. The governor is expected to challenge Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), a longtime opponent of offshore drilling. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, blasted the administration following Cruickshank’s contradictory remarks. “Our nation’s oceans and coastlines are being managed by an out-of-control administration with incompetent top leadership,” Grijalva said in a statement. “Secretary Zinke’s tweet either represents official policy, in which case he’ll lose in court, or it doesn’t, in which case he shouldn’t have announced it in the first place. Both options are deeply embarrassing for this administration and unacceptable to the American people who demand better environmental stewardship.”I have nothing to do with Lord Voldemort.

I wear long sleeves because it's cold in the White House. #Trumps1stYearAtHogwarts pic.twitter.com/mIdthXX7QWThe Austin City Council voted this week to prohibit its police department from selling retired service weapons back to the public, citing concerns about how those firearms might be used once they’re in civilian hands.

The resolution was a response to recent revelations that Austin police had offloaded more than 1,100 Smith & Wesson .40 caliber handguns to a Houston gun dealer in 2016 after the department secured a new contract for 9mm duty weapons.

Police made around $370,000 for those firearms, which the dealer was then free to resell. But Council Member Alison Alter, who sponsored the measure, said that revenue may have come at a much deeper cost.

“How do you compare that to someone’s life who gets killed by one of the 1,100 guns you put out there?” she said in an interview with HuffPost.

Austin’s policy change comes months after a report by Texas Standard and The Center For Investigative Reporting, which found that nearly half of the largest law enforcement agencies in Texas sell their used firearms to the public. Some of those guns end up being used in crimes, though it’s not clear how frequently because of a federal law that restricts the release of firearm trace data.

“We have no reports concretely of any APD guns being used in a crime, and why is that? Well they don’t track those statistics anywhere,” said Alter.

Previous reviews of shootings in Denver and Washington, D.C., have found examples of former service weapons being used by criminals. In more recent instances, police have sold off other confiscated weapons only to later recover them at crime scenes.

The Houston gun dealer would have been required to resell the retired APD firearms according to federal standards, which include conducting an FBI background check. But the resolution notes that this isn’t a guarantee against future criminal use.

“Existing loopholes in criminal background check laws cannot preclude the possibility that firearms initially sold by a licensed gun dealer may not be ultimately purchased by an individual who would fail existing background check standards,” the city council measure reads.

“We would have hated for one of these guns to be involved in an officer shooting or be used to kill a child.” - Austin Council Member Alison Alter

Guns can fall into the wrong hands through straw purchases ― when someone buys a gun for a restricted individual ― or secondary private sales, which don’t require an accompanying background check. Or they can simply be used by a legal owner who ends up breaking the law.

Former service weapons are also cheaper and likely more highly sought after than most new guns, said Alter.

“If you can sell a used gun that says ‘APD’ on it then people want it. It’s a former police gun that has some cachet,” she said. “We would have hated for one of these guns to be involved in an officer shooting or be used to kill a child.”

Following the passage of Alter’s resolution, APD will only be able to sell retired weapons to officers within the department. Any remaining weapons will be destroyed.

Guns can be a thorny issue in Austin, a relatively liberal college town in the heart of deep-red Texas. State law broadly preempts municipalities from passing their own laws regulating firearms, and as a result, Alter said she and other city council members have very few levers to do anything meaningful on gun control.

“I don’t want to pretend it was a huge thing, but it was one of the few things that we have within our purview as a municipality to do and to send a message that we don’t want this kind of gun violence in our community and that we don’t want to in any way be contributing to that,” said Alter.

Although Alter said Austin police had expressed some concerns about losing a source of revenue, APD assistant chief Troy Gay told KXAN that he viewed the measure as a positive step.HuffPost

The 40-year-old British actor may want to add hip-hop artist to his glittering resume after a bedroom mixtape he recorded in 1999 resurfaced online.

Hardy used the moniker Tommy No 1 for the “Falling on your Arse in 1999” album that was shared to the Bandcamp website earlier this month, per multiple media reports.

Hardy, who would have been around 22 at the time, is credited with writing and performing the lyrics on the 18-track compilation.

He raps over “The Godfather” theme tune on the fourth track, “Wiser.” He also semi-predicts his future acting career with the line “I wanna be on the TV, so people can see me” on “People Like To Boogie.”

Ed Tracy (aka Eddie Too Tall) ― who is now a British Academy Film Award-winning television writer ― wrote and produced the music. According to the mixtape’s listing, the pair made the tape “in a bedroom in 1999” but it was “never really finished.”

Tracy said he decided to release the album this month because Hardy had recently reminded him about it.

“Tom asked me whether I still had the album kicking about in the loft. Lo and behold, here it is in all its rawness, just as it sounded then,” he told Complex.

“[Hardy will] be pleased with the reception it’s had today,” he added. “We always said we’d do a Vegas tour as a joke. Maybe if this album generates enough love then we can coax Tom onstage.”

The mixtape appears to have gone over well with fans on Reddit:

Perhaps it shouldn’t come as such a surprise, considering Hardy once had a recording deal. He revealed in 2011 that at age 15 he signed with someone who had managed the Fugees.

WASHINGTON ― The federal government is facing the prospect of a shutdown by the end of Friday, an unwelcome event to mark President Donald Trump’s first year in office.

And despite the gravity of the situation, Washington is surprisingly unprepared.

“I think the most frustrating aspect of this all is the total lack of communication from anyone in management,” said a U.S. Department of Agriculture employee.

If Congress doesn’t come up with a funding agreement by midnight, the government will shut down. The last time there was a shutdown was in 2013. It lasted for 16 days.

The atmosphere in Washington now couldn’t be more different from then. In 2013, there was widespread attention and alarm about the possibility and potential effects of a shutdown. Federal agencies communicated their plans to employees and the media alike.

Not so much this time.

Of the dozens of federal employees HuffPost spoke with, many said that as of Friday morning, they had received no guidance from the leadership of their departments. Others had, but only very recently.

Mid-morning Friday, employees at the departments of Homeland Security, Interior, Commerce and State, among others, said they’d received notices telling them agency leaders were “working to update our contingency plans for executing an orderly shutdown of activities that would be affected by a lapse in appropriations.”

In other words, just 12 hours ahead of a potential shutdown, some federal agencies were still figuring out what they were going to do.

“Every agency is required to have a plan on the shelf about what they’re going to do in a shutdown. But those plans are plans,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. “There’s a big difference between having a document that says, ‘Open in case of emergency,’ and being able to do it appropriately.”

As The Daily Beast reported, of the nearly 130 agencies and offices that submit contingency plans to the Office of Management and Budget, 66 had not publicly updated their proposals since 2015 as of Thursday afternoon.

“There are some big issues that the administration’s going to have to deal with, and I don’t think they are ready for it.” - Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service

An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said her agency has been working for a while on contingency preparations ― but they have not been able to send out any of that information to employees, under orders from DHS and the Office of Management and Budget.

“We haven’t been allowed to notify them of their status or share any of the official documentation, like, ‘What happens if my benefits aren’t being paid? Do I have to pay them?’” she said, adding that it’s very different from 2013, when they let staffers know how the shutdown would affect them days in advance.

Part of the calculation, the FEMA employee explained, is that the administration doesn’t want it to look like the government agencies don’t have faith in Congress to do its job.

“It’s very bad for our employees, because they don’t get the information they need, and they’re very anxious about this,” she said.

A USDA employee told HuffPost he had to ask a human resources staffer about shutdown protocols. The answer he received was later contradicted by his boss.

Another USDA employee said that in 2011, when there were rumors of a shutdown, workers received emails with instructions on what to do. And in 2013, when it became clear there would indeed be a shutdown, there were even more detailed notices.

“This time there has been literally nothing,” the employee said. “No emails, meetings, posts to our internal bulletin board, not one thing.”

“Zero guidance so far, from high- or low-level managers (only unofficial guidance based on our past experiences with shutdowns),” an employee at the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday morning. “Usually by this time we have received at least one high-level email letting us know what to do in case of shutdown, how to report to work Monday, what to do, etc.”

Part of the reason the federal government is less prepared than it was in 2013, under President Barack Obama, is that the Trump administration simply doesn’t have the people or expertise in place to oversee something like this.

Stier’s group looks at more than 600 government jobs that require Senate confirmation. Currently, he said, there are more jobs for which the Trump administration has failed even to nominate anyone than there are jobs where someone has actually been confirmed.

“There are some big issues that the administration’s going to have to deal with, and I don’t think they are ready for it,” Stier said. “You have a group of people at the very top who have not been in government previously, certainly not been in government running the entire show, and that’s going to present a real problem.”

Many federal employees who spoke with HuffPost said they were simply going about their business as on any other Friday. They’re getting used to shutdown threats, and there is nothing they can do about the current mess.

When the government shut down in 2013, it was the first time it had done so since President Bill Clinton’s administration, when there were shutdowns in 1995 and 1996. Those shutdowns were considered massive mistakes on the part of the GOP-controlled Congress, and Clinton emphasized the harm to federal workers in his well-received State of the Union address in 1996.

But lately, it seems there’s the possibility of a shutdown every few months. And Washington is growing used to it.

“The mood isn’t really anything different than usual,” a Federal Communications Commission employee said. “Most federal government employees have been around a while and are kind of used to the ‘will we or won’t we shut down’ drama at this point ― it’s been so many years of continuing resolutions for short periods of time, it’s like we are numb to it.”

Roughly 800,000 federal employees would be furloughed without pay in the event of a shutdown. Congress typically authorizes back pay. Federal workers said they expect that to happen again if the government closes, but nothing is certain with this Congress.

Another USDA employee said she has been stocking up her emergency funds since November because of the possibility that she would have to go without pay for a period of time.

“People seem resigned to the possibility of a shutdown,” an Interior Department employee told HuffPost. “Most people seem to hope that if a shutdown happens that it does not last long. The 2013 shutdown resulted in cascading delays in getting important work done, including permitting and granting rights of way, which was distressing for tribes, local governments, taxpayers, and companies wanting to do business on public lands.”

“It is likely that a shutdown would have an even greater impact on DOI’s work this time around,” the employee continued, “because we have fewer employees to do the work.”

Stephen Colbert can’t get over some of the new details emerging from reports of President Donald Trump’s alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels more than a decade ago.

One day after an old interview surfaced in which Daniels reportedly called sex with Trump “textbook generic,” details of a new conversation about the alleged affair were published in Mother Jones.

And these new details, the “Late Show” host said, are more “magazine kinky” than “textbook generic.”

Check it out in the clip above.WASHINGTON ― Parts of the federal government were set to shut down Friday night after Republicans and Democrats in Congress couldn’t pass a funding bill, their most basic job as lawmakers.

Republicans control both the House and Senate but were adamant that a government shutdown would be Democrats’ fault, since some Democratic support was needed to get a bill through the Senate. A few Democrats did vote for the funding bill Friday night, but a few Republican senators crossed the aisle to vote against it as well.

Democrats had said they wouldn’t support a funding package that doesn’t include protections for young undocumented immigrants.

“The Democrats in the Senate are opposing a bill that they don’t oppose,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Friday before the vote. “This is purely an attempt by the Senate Democrats... to try and get a shutdown that they think this president gets blamed for.”

But apportioning blame for the shutdown drama is not so simple.

The policy problem began on Sept. 5, with President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. President Barack Obama had implemented DACA to give deportation relief to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, often referred to as Dreamers.

Trump told Congress they had until March to find a solution, and structured the end of the program so most recipients would maintain their protections at least until then.

“I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,” Trump said in September. He added that if Congress could not pass legislation to restore the legal status the DACA program provided, “I will revisit this issue!”

Days later, with lawmakers having been unable to pass a regular budget for years, Congress passed a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government through December.

On Sept. 13, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said they had struck a deal with Trump on a bill to provide permanent legal status for Dreamers. This supposed deal would establish those protections and include money for border security, excluding funds for Trump’s proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border (which Mexico is supposed to pay for anyway, according to the president’s campaign promises).

Less than a month later, Trump shot down this supposed deal. He declared that no bill granting Dreamers legal status could pass unless it funded the wall and made money available to hire far more immigration and border enforcement officers. By rescinding DACA, Trump had taken a hostage to force Democrats to vote for his wall.

Recognizing that Republican leaders might not support standalone immigration legislation ― Senate Republicans filibustered such legislation in 2010, and former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) simply refused to allow a House vote on a bill the Senate passed in 2013 ― Dreamers lobbied lawmakers to include them as part of a must-pass funding bill.

Dreamers and their allies also stressed that the situation is more urgent than Trump and Republicans imply. They estimate that about 122 DACA recipients lose protections each day, putting them at risk of being detained and deported. Plus, former government officials have warned that it will take time to actually put a deal in place.

Some Democrats promised they would oppose government funding bills that omitted DACA protections, but 18 members of the caucus caved in December when the matter actually came up.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers were working to find a legislative fix. A bipartisan group led by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) began work soon after Trump rescinded DACA to find a plan that could pass the Senate. A separate bipartisan group, led by Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), sprang up in the House. And Republicans put forward strictly partisan bills of their own in each chamber, both of which went far beyond the Dreamer issue and were immediately ruled dead on arrival with Democrats.

Earlier this month, Trump held a televised negotiation with congressional leaders at the White House. During the meeting, Trump said he’d support a deal if it included the following four things: protections for Dreamers; funding for a border wall; restrictions on immigration by family members of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents; and the elimination of a visa program designed to increase the diversity of the immigrant population.

But then, during a subsequent closed-door meeting in which Durbin and Graham laid out their group’s proposed DACA deal, Trump lashed out at proposals related to the diversity visa program.

“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump said, according to Washington Post reporting that has been confirmed by senators who attended the meeting. Trump was referring to African countries and said he would rather see more immigrants from Norway, a very white country in northern Europe.

The president’s “shithole” comment drew widespread condemnation, and the next day he announced there would be no deal. “The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards,” Trump said in a tweet last Saturday.

This week, Republican leaders in Congress pushed a funding bill that omitted any immigration provisions.

In the House, Republican leaders tried to craft a bill as attractive to Democrats as any bill without DACA could be. What they came up with was yet another continuing resolution that would keep the government running for four weeks while also supplying six years of funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which lapsed last year. But GOP leaders had to deal with a mutiny from members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, many of whom wanted to fund the military for the rest of the fiscal year.

After Democrats indicated they wouldn’t support a Republican bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) cut a deal with Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-S.C.) that gave Republicans enough support to pass the continuing resolution in exchange for future votes on a conservative immigration bill and a defense-only spending measure. With that agreement in hand, the House passed the four-week resolution, 230-197, with just six Democrats supporting the bill.

“I think the Democrats ought to be real careful,” Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a Freedom Caucus member, told the HuffPost Politics Podcast this week. “They’re putting people that are here illegally over our troops.”

Republicans control only 51 seats in the Senate, and the funding bill needed 60 votes to pass, so Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) needed at least nine Democrats to vote for the bill ― and probably more, since several Republicans, including Graham, had said they opposed the House bill on the grounds that it only funded the government for four weeks. Late Friday, 44 Democrats and five Republicans voted no on the stopgap measure; 45 Republicans and five Democrats voted for it. Sen. John McCain was not present for the vote.

In other words, it wasn’t just Senate Democrats who didn’t support the Republican bill to keep the government from shutting down.

Republicans argued that Democratic DACA demands were extraneous to the continuing resolution to fund the government, which was true in the sense that the immigration policy is unrelated to spending levels. But along with tax reform and military spending, immigration has easily been one of the top policy debates on Capitol Hill for months ― and it is ostensibly a shared priority of both parties. It didn’t come out of nowhere.

Another reason Republicans say the DACA provision was unnecessary was that most Dreamers won’t lose their protected status for another month and a half. (The government is currently accepting DACA renewal applications because of a court order, but the Trump administration is fighting that ruling in court.)

“DACA does not expire until March 5,” Mulvaney said. “So there’s absolutely no reason to tie these two things together right now.”

Dreamers themselves disagreed, since they’re already losing protections and are aware that Republican promises to act later on immigration aren’t always kept.

“Anyone who says that we have more time for this insane Congressional gridlock is lying,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, a Dreamer activist with United We Dream, said in a statement. “Delay means deportations.”

AdvertisementGlenn Simpson, co-founder of the firm behind the infamous dossier on President Donald Trump’s potential connections to Russia, told Congress that he believes the Russian government has “infiltrated” the National Rifle Association.

“It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA,” Fusion GPS co-founder Simpson said while testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 14. His testimony was part of a federal investigation into potential links between the Kremlin and Trump’s 2016 campaign associates.

“And there is more than one explanation for why,” he added. “But I would say, broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. ... They seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.”

The House committee voted Thursday to release the testimony. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) last week released a testimony Simpson made before the Senate Judiciary Committee in August.

McClatchy reported earlier on Thursday that the FBI was investigating whether a top Russian bank with ties to the Kremlin had funneled money to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign through the NRA. Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank and a former member of the Russian parliament, was reportedly behind the scheme, according to the publication.

It is illegal for a foreign national to make contributions to any election campaign of a U.S. candidate per the Federal Election Campaign Act.

While testifying in front of the House committee, Simpson described Torshin as “a Russian banker-slash-Duma member-slash-Mafia leader” and “life member of the NRA.” He also hinted at a possible connection between Torshin, one of his associates and the Trump transition team.

“I guess the last thing I will say on this is that we just started seeing this stuff when all the other Russia stuff started bubbling up,” Simpson said. “And the thing I found, you know, the most absurd about this is that, you know, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin is not in favor of universal gun ownership for Russians. And so it’s all a big charade, basically.”

The NRA broke its own campaign spending record in 2016 when the organization donated $30.3 million to Trump’s presidential campaign.

The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON ― Undocumented immigrants and their allies know that compromise will be necessary for Congress to broker a deal to help the 700,000 young people set to lose deportation protections under President Donald Trump.

But they don’t want Democrats to sell out other immigrants to make it happen.

“Our safety can’t come at the cost of our values, of our dignity and of having the back of black immigrants and standing up to white nationalist sentiment and racism,” said Greisa Martinez, a Dreamer with the advocacy group United We Dream.

Democrats are pressing for a deal by midnight to help so-called Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom the president put at risk of losing their jobs and deportation relief when he rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Many have threatened to vote against government spending until DACA is addressed, which could risk a government shutdown.

With hours to go, there is still a gulf between what the president and his immigration restrictionist allies want in a deal and what is acceptable to Democrats, and to the Dreamers they’re trying to help. The president says he won’t do anything for them unless he gets his border “wall” ― in whatever form that means ― and changes to restrict legal immigration.

Dreamer and immigrant community advocates have red lines, too. As the most visible members of the undocumented community, Dreamer activists have argued for years that their protections shouldn’t come at the expense of others. Some say Democrats should not accept a deal that would put more border patrol agents into communities or other interior enforcement efforts such as adding detention beds. Some want to protect immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and other nations who are already in the United States under temporary protected status. Some want to save family reunification visas or the diversity visa lottery.

It’s likely that any deal ― if Congress makes one at all ― will have pieces that disappoint activists and Democratic lawmakers. But there’s broad consensus between both groups on one thing: The idea that Republicans can receive a slew of immigration changes in exchange for only one from the left is a non-starter.

“Everyone has clear indication of what we’ve been saying for a while: that Trump’s policy changes have racist motivations.” - Jonathan Jayes-Green, a Dreamer and the co-founder of UndocuBlack Network.

There are two major bipartisan proposals in Congress right now. In the House, there’s a bill spearheaded by Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) that would pair Dreamer protections with various border security measures, meant to be a “narrower” approach.

That bill has concessions that Democrats and many activists are willing to swallow in exchange for DACA. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said he would probably support the bill “if it came down to it.” His main non-negotiable issue is eliminating family-based visas, he said.

“I think we’re going to cross a point where there’s going to be that balance between the 800,000 lives [of DACA recipients] and let’s say the Aguilar-Hurd legislation, and I would say Aguilar-Hurd would win that day,” he told HuffPost.

The bill lacks some of the provisions border community advocates are afraid of. Andrea Guerrero, the chair of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said their top concerns are preventing a massive increase in border agents and additional infrastructure ― or wall ― that isn’t based on any analysis or input from people who live there. Guerrero said her group thinks the Hurd-Aguilar bill addresses border security in a responsible way.

Advocates don’t see border communities as a good giveaway to get aid for Dreamers ― it’s one thing to make concessions on technology, but another to approve more agents who can conduct arrests up to 100 miles from the border, including of young undocumented people. Guerrero said she and others from her group, including Dreamers, are lobbying Congress to not throw the border under the bus.

“We’re always concerned that members of Congress are going to take a shortcut, are going to ignore the realities of our communities and are going to respond to the rhetoric,” she said.

The other bipartisan proposal on Dreamers, this one from six senators, includes border security measures and tweaks to the legal immigration system, meant to meet Trump’s demands. Trump rejected the bill when Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) presented it to him last week, but they formally introduced it on Wednesday evening anyway, and said it has support from seven Republicans in total.

Advocates and Democrats in the House have some concerns with the bill, but stressed it was still a good step. Grijalva said he does not like its changes to family-based immigration system. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that he did not see how the Congressional Hispanic Caucus would embrace it, but did not fully rule out the possibility that could change with the final language.

A potential piece of contention is the fact that the bill would make significant changes to the diversity visa lottery, as requested by Trump. The Congressional Black Caucus has been particularly opposed to past efforts to end the lottery because African immigrants make up a large proportion of the people granted green cards through the program.

Trump strengthened the resolve of supporters of the diversity visa lottery last week when he reportedly referred to African nations as “shithole countries” and dismissed senators’ proposal to help Haitians living in the U.S., said Jonathan Jayes-Green, a Dreamer and the co-founder of the advocacy group UndocuBlack Network.

His organization, which represents black immigrants, believes a deal should protect the visa lottery and grant relief to people who are losing temporary protected status, including from Haiti.

“Up until last week, partners and the general public might have been willing to compromise on it [the visa lottery],” he said. “But where we are right now is everyone has clear indication of what we’ve been saying for a while: that Trump’s policy changes have racist motivations.”

The entire bill put forward by another group of House Republicans, led by Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is a non-starter for both Democrats and advocates for reform, both from the left and libertarian-leaning side. That bill would make a host of changes to the entire immigration system, including cutting legal immigration, criminalizing being in the U.S. without legal status and mandating that employers check immigration status and provide massive funding for the border.

One of the items Democrats and advocates find most disturbing is that it would change the law for asylum-seekers. Durbin said on Wednesday that Republicans had said narrowing protections for asylum-seekers was part of border security, something he rejected.

“I told them it’s unreasonable,” Durbin told reporters. “We can’t fix the entire immigration system in a matter of hours.”

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a former immigration attorney, said Thursday that changing asylum law as part of a deal was “not going to happen.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 17, 2017. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters

In the year since he took office, President Donald Trump has challenged rock-solid assumptions about U.S. foreign policy and jeopardized relations with a series of key allies.

From insults directed at foreign leaders ― and entire countries ― to his administration’s foreign intelligence gaffes, Trump has left U.S. allies nervous as America’s global competitors gain serious ground.

Mexico And ‘The Wall’

From the day he announced his campaign, Trump adopted an antagonistic approach to Mexico. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said, adding, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

Since then, the U.S. president has threatened to blow up or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has insisted Mexico will pay for a border wall between the two countries.

The battle over the wall has come to dominate the U.S.-Mexico relationship, despite decades of closer trade and security ties. Trump’s fierce criticism of the U.S. neighbor has left Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto exposed at home, and former Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada fuming:

America’s greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald? — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 11, 2018

A Bad Start With Australia

Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have a seemingly friendly relationship in public, but it wasn’t always that way.

Turnbull and Trump’s infamous first phone call made for a shaky start. The president accused the Five Eyes ally of trying to send the “next Boston bombers” via a refugee swap deal, prompting Turnbull to confront him over the deal’s importance. Scheduled for an hour, the phone call reportedly lasted just 25 minutes. Trump eventually agreed to the deal.

Since then, the pair appear to have warmed to each other, sharing dinner and drinks on the USS Intrepid in New York City. Turnbull recently praised Trump’s rhetoric on North Korea, telling an Australian radio station it was ratcheting up pressure on the rogue nation.

“They cannot be rewarded for their rogue status and reckless conduct,” Turnbull said.

‘The Wrong Thing To Do’ In Britain

The “special relationship” between the U.S. and the United Kingdom entered a new phase with Trump’s election: awkwardness. British Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump, a signal of the security and trade partnerships the two countries have shared since World War II.

But May quickly faced pressure to change her tone, particularly after intelligence surrounding the Manchester terror attack was seemingly leaked in the U.S.

The awkwardness came to a head in early January this year, when Trump retweeted several videos from the far-right Britain First party. May called the retweets “wrong,” while several other British MPs described Trump as “fascist” and “stupid.”

An Altered Relationship With Germany

Under Trump, U.S. relations with Germany have been strained and unsettled by Trump’s controversial policy decisions, like pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and his direct criticism of German policies and its leaders.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this year that Berlin may not be able to rely on the U.S. in the future, and she urged Europe to take its fate into its own hands.

“Germany can no longer simply react to U.S. policy but must establish its own position,” Germany’s top diplomat, Sigmar Gabriel, warned policymakers at the end of last year.

“Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the U.S. will never be the same,” he added.

Trump has yet to appoint an ambassador to Germany.

Worrying NATO Allies

Trump used the 68-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a punching bag in the lead-up to the election, blasting the alliance as “obsolete” and calling out members like Germany for not paying their fair share.

He continued the practice throughout the first year of his presidency. During a speech in Brussels last May, the president refused to affirm his commitment to Article 5 of the treaty — which holds that an attack against one alliance member is considered an attack against all members. (Trump later did affirm his commitment to the article.)

But the future for the alliance isn’t entirely bleak. The number of U.S. personnel being deployed in Europe has gone up, Slovakia’s former ambassador to NATO, Tomas Valasek, told NPR. The real question is how Trump will respond when an ally is attacked.

“The honest answer is none of us quite knows,” Valasek said.

Insulting Haiti And African Countries

Trump opened 2018 by offending some of America’s key allies in Africa. After he reportedly referred to nations in Africa, as well as Haiti, as “shithole countries,” the presidents of Ghana and Senegal made their displeasure known.

“We will not accept such insults, even from a leader of a friendly country, no matter how powerful,” said Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo. Ghana has close ties to the United States.

Senegalese President Macky Sall also expressed his shock over the remarks.“I reject them and condemn vigorously. Africa and the black race deserve the respect and consideration of all,” Sall said.

Je suis choqué par les propos du Président Trump sur Haïti et sur l'Afrique. Je les rejette et les condamne vigoureusement. L'Afrique et la race noire mérite le respect et la considération de tous. MS — Macky SALL (@Macky_Sall) January 12, 2018MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian teenager attacked a group of younger students with an ax, injuring six people, before setting his school on fire, investigators said on Friday.

Russia’s Investigative Committee said the attacker, a ninth-grader, attacked a group of seventh-grade students with an ax at a school just outside the Siberian city of Ulan-Ude, then set the room ablaze.

Injured pedestrians lay sprawled out on the sidewalk, recalling recent terrorist attacks by vehicles mowing down pedestrians, but there was no indication that the Copacabana incident was deliberate.

The G1 news website reported the driver, who fled the scene but was quickly arrested by police, said he had an epileptic fit, and medicine for epilepsy was found in the car.

An officer at the Copacabana police station confirmed the baby’s death by telephone and said 15 injured people were being treated in hospital. He did not know if the driver’s epilepsy fit had been confirmed.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced she is three months pregnant, and that she and her partner Clarke Gayford are expecting their first child by the middle of the year.

“And we thought 2017 was a big year! Clarke and I are really excited that in June our team will expand from two to three, and that we’ll be joining the many parents out there who wear two hats,” she wrote on Facebook.

“I think it’s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise, but we couldn’t be more excited,” she added.

Pakistan’s Benizar Bhutto was the first elected world leader to become pregnant while in office, giving birth to her second child in 1990.

Ardern became New Zealand’s prime minister on Oct. 26, 2017, making her the third woman to take the office in the country. She said she found out about her pregnancy on Oct. 13, days before it was announced she would take office.

Ardern’s deputy, Winston Peters, will be acting prime minister for the six weeks after Ardern has her child in June, New Zealand News website stuff.co.nz reports.

“At the end of my leave I will resume all Prime Ministerial duties,” Ardern explained.

Gayford, Ardern’s partner, will be their child’s primary caregiver, Arden wrote. “Knowing that so many parents juggle the care of their new babies, we consider ourselves to be very lucky,” she added.

Ardern said the pregnancy was a surprise because she and Gayford had been told they would need help to conceive.Members of the LGBTQ community will be watching the Supreme Court closely this spring, when justices are expected to decide whether Colorado baker Jack Phillips was illegally discriminating against a same-sex couple when he refused to prepare a cake for a wedding ceremony he viewed as sacrilegious.

Many queer rights advocates believe the court’s decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission will be the most significant for LGBTQ people since the 2015 landmark ruling on same-sex marriage. What fewer people realize, they say, is just how much the ruling’s impact will resound beyond wedding-related businesses.

A new video released by the Colorado-based independent think tank Movement Advancement Project highlights exactly what’s at stake if the Supreme Court rules in Phillips’ favor. The clip, which can be viewed above, depicts a transgender man being removed from a movie theater after attempting to use the men’s restroom. It’s a nod to controversial “bathroom bills” like North Carolina’s since-overturned House Bill 2, which prohibited trans people from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, as well as the long lasting implications of the Masterpiece Cakeshop case.

The video’s release coincides with that of a new Movement Advancement Project report, “LGBT Policy Spotlight: Public Accommodations Nondiscrimination Laws.” The report, in turn, cites 2017 statistics provided by the Center of American Progress, which researchers believe are indicative of a startling disconnect.

While a 2016 Public Religion Research Institute poll found that 72 percent of Americans back anti-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ community, a survey of 1,864 people (857 of which identified as LGBTQ) found that 34 percent said they avoided public places such as stores and restaurants because they’ve experienced discrimination in the past year.

Of that same research group, 49 percent said they’d made specific decisions about where to live, and 47 percent decided where to shop, because of previous brushes with anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to the report.

Though cases like Phillips’ dominate headlines, the research shows that discrimination “happens in many facets of daily life,” Naomi Goldberg, Movement Advancement Project’s policy and research director, told HuffPost Friday. The Department of Health & Human Services’ establishment of a new agency that could reportedly allow medical practitioners to deny treatment to LGBTQ people on religious and moral grounds is particularly concerning, she said.

“This discrimination isn’t about weddings, but about LGBTQ people’s ability to live their lives ― to go to work and to care for their families,” Goldberg said. “And this discrimination has tangible effects on LGBTQ people.”

Still, the Movement Advancement Project report offered some promising statistics for the LGBTQ community as well. Though laws protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in public accommodations exist in only 19 states and the District of Columbia, at least 313 cities and counties nationwide had adopted similar legislation at the local level as of last year.

It’s an important reminder, Goldberg said, that “action is needed in communities across the country to stand on the side of fairness” ― and those efforts can have a substantial impact.

“Just because a business serves the public doesn’t mean they share all of their customers’ beliefs,” she said. “And most Americans agree that businesses that serve the public should serve everyone on the same terms.”
