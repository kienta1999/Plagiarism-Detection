Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D) has been facing criticism for the false missile alert that sent the state into a panic. Olelo

A hearing with Hawaii lawmakers on Friday revealed that Gov. David Ige knew last weekend’s missile alert was a false alarm two minutes after it was broadcast across the state, but didn’t notify the public of it until 15 minutes later.

The false alert was triggered at 8:07 a.m. on Jan. 13. Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan told state legislators that he personally called Ige to let him know that Hawaii was not facing a missile threat at 8:09 a.m.

It wasn’t until 8:24 a.m. that the governor’s office publicly acknowledged the mistake by retweeting the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, with the added note, “There is NO missile threat.”

Six minutes after that, a note about the false alert appeared on Ige’s Facebook page.

“I don’t know what the governor was doing. I wasn’t with him at the time,” Logan told lawmakers. “I know he was preparing to go to an event and this circumvented all of that.”

While this new detail prompted state lawmakers to ask more questions about that particular lapse of time, Ige wasn’t able to respond. The governor left 45 minutes into the two-hour hearing.

Ige’s spokeswoman Cindy McMillan told HuffPost that the governor didn’t alert the public right away because his staff handles his social media accounts. “It took time for the governor to contact us and give us the information before we could post it,” she said.

McMillan didn’t answer HuffPost’s question asking why Ige couldn’t publish the message himself.

People in Hawaii were in a state of panic and confusion last weekend after a state emergency employee accidentally triggered an incoming missile alert to cellphones, TV and radio broadcasts during a routine drill.

While officials called radio stations and news stations and issued corrections on social media, it took 38 minutes for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency to broadcast a correction using the same alert system.

An official with Honolulu Emergency Medical Services said 911 calls briefly spiked in the hour after the statewide alert. At least one person, a 51-year-old man, suffered a heart attack as a result of the alarm and was transported to the hospital in critical condition, an EMS official told HuffPost.

The first person to notify the public of the emergency agency’s mistake appears to be a 17-year-old who was able to call state emergency officials immediately after receiving the alert.

The high school student, William Heyler, told local news station KHON2 that he decided to check in with the agency after he noticed that there were no sirens to accompany the alarm. Within five minutes of the alert, Heyler talked to an official and tweeted that it was a mistake.

His tweet went out at 8:12 a.m.

At 8:19 a.m., Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) became the first state official to acknowledge the mistake when she tweeted that she’d confirmed there was no missile headed to Hawaii.

After Ige left Friday’s hearing, Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing told emergency officials that he was disappointed that the governor had slipped out early.

“I can’t imagine what’s more important than this right now,” Ing said.

McMillan told HuffPost that the governor had to leave the hearing early to attend to other appointments he couldn’t reschedule on Friday afternoon.

During Friday’s hearing, lawmakers probed emergency officials about the mistake and urged them to address the flaws in the response to last weekend’s botched drill.

One lawmaker blamed the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency’s entire system for the prolonged panic.

“It wasn’t just the fault of one man in a room pushing a button,” Democratic state Rep. Matt LoPresti said on Friday. “It was the entire system.”

Lt. Col. Charles Anthony, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Defense, told HuffPost on Thursday that it took more than 30 minutes to send a follow-up alert because their system did not have a feature that allowed employees to send follow-up alerts after one is already sent.

After last week’s mishap, the emergency agency has added a cancellation feature that would allow officials to correct any false alerts almost immediately. Additionally, the agency requires two people to sign off on alerts before one is broadcast to the state.Trevor Noah can’t stop vibing to President Donald Trump’s words.

“The Daily Show” host joined Jimmy Fallon on Friday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show,” and revealed how he sometimes catches himself singing Trump’s catchphrases out loud.

The Government is shut down, except for essential personnel. All crime is legal until further notice.



Your non-functioning Government thanks you.It’s 2009,

And I’m 14 and I’m crying.

Not really sure where I am,

But I’m holding the hand

Of my best friend Sam

In the waiting room

Of a Planned Parenthood.

The air is sterile and clean,

And the walls are that “not grey, but green,”

And the lights are so bright,

They could burn a hole

Through the seam of my jeans,

And my phone is buzzing in the pocket.

My mom is asking me

If I remembered my keys

’cause she’s closing the door

And she needs to lock it.

But I can’t tell my mom where I’ve gone.

I can’t tell anyone at all.

See, my best friend Sam

Was raped by a man

That we knew ’cause he worked

In the after-school program.

And he held her down

With her textbooks beside her

And he covered her mouth

And he came inside her.

So now I’m with Sam

At the place with a plan

Waiting for the results of a medical exam,

And she’s praying she doesn’t need an abortion.

She couldn’t afford it,

And her parents would, like,

Totally kill her.

It’s 2002,

And my family just moved,

And the only people I know

Are my mom’s friend Sue and her son.

He’s got a case of Matchbox cars,

And he says that he’ll teach me guitar

If I just keep quiet.

And the stairwell beside

Apartment 1245

Will haunt me in my sleep

For as long as I am alive.

And I’m too young to know

Why it aches in my thighs,

But I must lie.

I must lie.

It’s 2012,

And I’m dating a guy,

And I sleep in his bed,

And I just learned how to drive,

And he’s older than me,

And he drinks whiskey neat,

And he’s paying for everything ―

This adult thing is not cheap.

We’ve been fighting a lot,

Almost 10 times a week,

And he wants to have sex,

And I just want to sleep.

But he says I can’t say no to him ―

This much I owe to him ―

He buys my dinners,

So I have to blow him.

He’s taken to forcing me

Down on my knees,

And I’m confused

Because he’s hurting me

While he says “please.”

And he’s only a man,

And these things he just needs,

He’s my boyfriend ―

So why am I filled with unease?

It’s 2017,

And I live like a queen,

And I follow damn near

Every one of my dreams.

I’m invincible ―

And I’m so fucking naive.

I believe I’m protected

’Cause I live on a screen.

Nobody would dare

Act that way around me.

I’ve earned my protection.

I’m eternally clean.

Until a man that I trust

Gets his hands in my pants,

But I don’t want none of that ―

I just want to dance.

I wake up the next morning

Like I’m in a trance

And there’s blood.

Is that my blood?

Hold, hold on a minute.

See, I’ve worked every day

Since I was 18.

I’ve toured everywhere

From Japan to Mar-a-Lago

I even went on stage

That night in Chicago

When I was having a miscarriage.

I mean, I pied the piper

I put on a diaper

And I sang out my spleen

To a room full of teens.

What do you mean?

This happened to me.

You can’t put your hands on me.

You don’t know

What my body has been through.

I’m supposed to be safe now.

I earned it.

It’s 2018,

And I’ve realized

That nobody is safe

Long as she is alive.

And every friend that I know

Has a story like mine,

And the world tells me

We should take it as a compliment.

But then heroes like Ashley

And Simone and Gabby,

McKayla and Gaga,

Rosario, Ally,

Remind me this is the beginning ―

It is not the finale.

And that’s why we’re here,

And that’s why we rally.

It’s Olympians

And a medical resident,

And not one fucking word

From the man who is president.

It’s about closed doors and secrets

And legs in stilettos,

From the Hollywood hills

To the projects and ghettos,

When babies are ripped

From the arms of teen mothers,

And child brides cry, globally,

Under the covers,

Who don’t have a voice

On the magazine covers.

They tell us “take cover.”

But we are not free

Until all of us are free.

So love your neighbor,

Please treat her kindly.

Ask her her story,

And then shut up and listen.

Black, Asian, poor, wealthy,

Trans, cis, Muslim, Christian,

Listen, listen.

And then yell ―

At the top of your lungs ―

Be a voice for all those

Who have prisoner tongues,

For the people who had to grow up

Way too young.

There is work to be done.

There are songs to be sung.

Lord knows, there’s a war to be won.President Donald Trump addressed the Women’s Marches last year by suggesting that the hundreds of thousands of people who turned out should have expressed their feelings toward him at the ballot box.

“Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn’t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,” he tweeted, shortly before claiming to “respect the rights of people to express their views.”

This year, he tried a different, more creative approach: attempting to take ownership of the event to push his own agenda.

“Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for Women to March,” Trump wrote Saturday.

He then urged people to “[g]et out there now to celebrate the historic milestones” he said his administration had achieved, appearing to ignore that the marches largely exist to protest him, his presidency, his rhetoric toward women and his stances on a number of other issues.

The Statue of Liberty’s face cracks and Syrian child refugee Alan Kurdi’s dead body is washed ashore in the powerful clip for the Irish rock band’s politically charged single “Get Out Of Your Own Way,” which it shared online Thursday.

“Resistance, love has got to fight for its existence, the enemy has armies of assistance,” sings lead vocalist Bono in the track from the “Songs of Experience” album.

The singer and activist has previously called Trump “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.”

Israeli street art collective the Broken Fingaz Crew created the video, which it said “addresses the current political situation.”

“2017 for us was the year fascists worldwide felt confident enough to raise their heads again, encouraged by Trump and other world leaders, who use people’s fear to build more walls and segregation,” the artists wrote on YouTube.

AdvertisementA 45-year-old Rohingya man decided to flee Myanmar’s Rakhine state this month when his home was set ablaze. His 14-year-old daughter was shot dead as he and his family ran from their house.

The man’s story shows that the campaign of violence against his Muslim minority continues, even though a deal to repatriate Rohingya refugees and Hindus from Bangladesh back to Myanmar is set to begin on Tuesday. Many of those who fled their homes are apprehensive.

“I’d rather be killed here than be returned,” the man whose house was burned told UNICEF from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, choosing to remain anonymous for fear of his safety.

He’s not alone ― Rohingyas continue to cross into Bangladesh by the hundreds, fleeing violence against them led by Burma’s military since last summer.

“They will slaughter us all,” Abd-us-Salam, a Rohingya refugee who is more than 100 years old and has fled three crackdowns in Myanmar, told Al Jazeera. “Please don’t send us back as bait for the monster.”

Bangladeshi and Burmese officials negotiated the repatriation deal without the oversight of the U.N. Refugee Agency, which typically assists in such situations.

The agreement would repatriate about 1,500 Rohingyas per week and house them in temporary transit camps in Myanmar as their homes are rebuilt. Yet without any international monitoring, international organizations worry these vulnerable people will be thrown right back into the misery they sought to escape in the first place.

“The bottom line is that refugees have to decide themselves when they feel it’s safe to go back, the process of the repatriation is safe and conditions on the ground make them feel safe,” Caroline Gluck, a U.N. Refugee Agency senior public information officer, told HuffPost.

Amnesty International called the repatriation deal “alarmingly premature” and pointed to conditions the two governments have set out in the scheme. For one, Rohingyas interested in returning are required to provide proof of citizenship, something the majority don’t have. In addition, the Burmese government hasn’t indicated it’s willing to change its stance on the Rohingya, a community it has viewed with disdain for decades.

A 15-year-old refugee boy who said he was shot in the arm while entering his house, and later had the limb amputated in the jungle, told UNICEF he would only return home if his rights were guaranteed.

“We will go back if we get recognized as Rohingya, and our property, cow and house back,” he told the U.N. child advocacy organization.

Another concern is that Rohingyas who have fled to Bangladesh haven’t been informed about the potential repatriations, said a UNICEF media and communications spokesperson.

They “absolutely do not want to go back,” the spokesperson said. “They’re full of fear. If you look at past scenarios where Rohingya people have been returned, it has led to more persecution.”

The U.N. Refugee Agency hasn’t seen a list of people planning to return, according to Gluck.

More than 655,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar since August, when the Burmese military reignited a crackdown on the religious minority after Rohingya militants reportedly attacked several police posts. Rights groups have accused authorities of summary executions, as well as widespread rape and torture that amount to ethnic cleansing. More than 40 villages have been completely razed, Human Rights Watch determined.

The repatriation process, if it begins next week, would take an estimated two years, Gluck said. The U.N. Refugee Agency and other aid organizations plan to remain in Bangladesh as long as their assistance is needed.Bill Maher broke down a concern he has with the #MeToo movement on Friday’s broadcast of “Real Time.”

Maher said he was a “true supporter” of the movement, which has prompted many people to talk about sexual harassment and assault. But he lamented the rise of “distinction deniers” who “can’t tell or don’t want to see a difference between assault in a van and a back rub by the water cooler.”

“I’m down with #MeToo, I’m not down with #MeCarthyism,” he said.

“Giving up on the idea that even bad things have degrees, that is as dumb as embracing the idea of alternative facts,” said Maher. “Justice requires weighing things, that is why Lady Justice is holding a scale and not a sawn-off shotgun.”

“(Vice President) Mike Pence and ISIS are both homophobic,” he added. “But Mike doesn’t throw gay men off the roof, so he’s better. This isn’t that hard, people!”(Reuters) - The Trump administration has rolled back protections for transgender prison inmates introduced under former President Barack Obama after some prisoners challenged the policies in court.

An inmate’s “biological sex” will now be used to make the initial decision as to where transgender prisoners are housed, instead of the gender to which they identify, according to a change in guidelines announced on Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.

The move, decried by transgender rights advocates, comes after four women held at a Texas detention center filed a federal lawsuit. The inmates argued that the previous prison guidelines, introduced in January 2017 just days before Obama left office, put them at greater risk of rape because they might have to share facilities with transgender women.

Under President Donald Trump, the Justice Department said in August that it would evaluate the issues in the lawsuit.

Following Friday’s change to the guidelines, first reported by BuzzFeed News, prison authorities are instructed to consider the health and safety of transgender inmates, as well as “whether placement would threaten the management and security of the institution and/or pose a risk to other inmates in the institution.”

Bureau of Prisons officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. But Nancy Ayers, a spokeswoman for the agency, told BuzzFeed News that the new policy takes into account the needs of all federal prisoners “and articulates the balance of safety needs of transgender inmates as well as other inmates.”

The move was condemned by transgender activists, who point to official statistics that show transgender inmates are at disproportionate risk of suffering sexual violence.

“The decision to disregard a transgender person’s gender identity is harmful and disrespectful,” David Stacy, government affairs director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group, said in a statement.

The Trump administration has sought to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military and has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights.

In October, the administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position.

In February, Trump rescinded Obama administration guidance that said public schools should let transgender students use the restroom corresponding to their gender identity.Nothing has caused a greater disturbance in the Force than the untimely death of Carrie Fisher.

The actress and “Star Wars” pillar tragically died in December 2016 at the age of 60, and with that came the inevitable question: How will “The Last Jedi” handle her character moving forward.

Well, “The Last Jedi” was released in December 2017, and, as a result, we learned that Leia will live on in the franchise, despite Fisher’s death. There were, however, a few moments in the film that stood out as possible (maybe even unintentional) nods to the actress’ passing.

It all comes down to a specific request Fisher made in Wishful Drinking, a 2008 book based on her one-woman show:

I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I wanted it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.

No, there isn’t any bra-strangling going on in “The Last Jedi.” (The Porgs would’ve been traumatized.) But there are instances in which the “Last Jedi” filmmakers seem to have heeded Fisher’s request to be “drowned in moonlight.” First, when Leia appears bathed in light while briefly floating out in space after a First Order attack. And later, when she appears unconscious in a medical bay.

Director Rian Johnson, along with other “Last Jedi” crew members, told HuffPost that the scenes “didn’t change at all” following Fisher’s death ― they occur exactly as they intended them to when Fisher was alive. But they admitted that the moments have taken on new meaning since.

As for Fisher’s request to be “drowned in moonlight,” Johnson acknowledged the coincidence, adding that his team decided “not to change [the performance] even though it had some images like that, some moments we had to take a breath and say, ‘This has a whole extra layer of context now.’”

“It was, for me, a decision of looking at her performance in its entirety, and realizing that if we went in to try to alter it, we inevitably would have to lose some scenes which I thought were scenes that the fans should have ― that people who loved Leia would have,” he said. “I would never have wanted to lose her conversation with Luke or her conversation with Holdo or the final moment with Rey. Those are just things that I feel like we deserved to have from Leia in this movie, so that included the scenes where she is lying in her chamber unconscious, and [it’s] uncomfortable to watch. It’s also part of the story.”

Visual Effects supervisor Ben Morris told us that post-production effects were used very sparingly on Fisher’s appearance while she was in space (and in the medical bay), explaining that he only had minor support to add things like ice around her.

“When it needed to be, it was all Carrie,” he said.

A different Fisher moment had film editor Bob Ducsay breaking down even before her death.

“Her scene with Luke. The first time I put the scene together, it was put together and I tracked a little bit of music in it, and I watched it and I got completely choked up. I mean completely choked up. This was sort of me bringing my love of ‘Star Wars’ and thinking about what it would be like. These characters that have been apart for so long and here they are together, brother and sister again. It really affected me emotionally, and that was while Carrie was still with us,” he said.

Ducsay reiterated that audiences bring a “whole extra level of emotion” to the film now.

“Carrie is not with us any longer, and I think it really means a lot more to the audience, even though it was going to mean a lot to them as it was ... but now there’s this extra leap, and it affects me also every time I watch,” he said.When Joelle Casteix heard Pope Francis accuse sex abuse victims in Chile of slander, the pontiff’s words hit close to home.

Francis told reporters Thursday that he hasn’t seen any convincing evidence against Chile’s Bishop Juan Barros Madrid, whom victims claim protected a pedophile priest.

“The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,” Francis said during a papal trip to Chile, according to The New York Times. “But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander. Is that clear?”

Casteix, a California native and advocate for abuse victims, knows what it’s like to share a vulnerable story of sexual abuse and to have that story questioned. She is herself a survivor of abuse within the Roman Catholic Church. From 1986 to 1988, she was abused by a choir director at Santa Ana’s Mater Dei High School, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. By the time the abuse ended, she said, the teacher had left her pregnant and with a sexually transmitted disease. She was only 17.

It was proof of what she’d been saying all along ― that church officials knew about abuse taking place in the diocese and didn’t do enough to protect victims.

Given this history with the church, it’s not hard to understand why Casteix’s voice sharpened as she spoke to HuffPost about Francis’ attack on abuse victims in Chile.

“Every abuser says to his victim: You have no proof. No one is going to believe you,” said Castiex, now an activist with Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP). “What Pope Francis did was put himself in the abuser’s seat, in the power position.”

“What he’s doing is revictimizing every single child victim and putting himself in the abuser’s shoes.”

Unabashed Support For A Controversial Bishop

Francis’ comments about Barros came at the end of a papal trip to Chile that was already fraught with tensions.

Chilean abuse victims and their allies have been upset about the pope’s continued defense of Barros. Several victims claim that Barros covered up and, in some instances, observed abuse carried out by his mentor, Rev. Fernando Karadima.

The Vatican convicted Karadima of abusing teenage boys in 2011 and sent him to live a cloistered life of “penitence and prayer” in a Chilean convent. A judge found the allegations against Karadima to be “truthful and reliable” but dismissed a criminal case against the priest because the statute of limitations had expired.

Barros denied having any knowledge of Karadima’s abusive actions ― and it appears that Francis still believes him.

In 2015, the pope appointed Barros as bishop of Osorno, in southern Chile. Politicians and even some church leaders in the country vocally opposed the move and called for Barros to resign.

That same year, Francis was captured on video telling a group of tourists at Vatican City that people in Osorno who protested Barros’ appointment were “dumb” and “judging a bishop without any proof.”

Francis’ trip to Chile this week was marred by street protests and the burning of nearly a dozen churches as people voiced frustration with how the church is handling the clergy sex abuse scandal.

On Tuesday, Francis expressed “pain and shame” over the abuse scandal and begged for victims’ forgiveness. He met and reportedly wept with Chilean survivors of abuse, The Associated Press reported.

But he has also continued to show support for Barros. The New York Times reported that the bishop participated in the pope’s ceremonies in the cities of Santiago, Iquique and Temuco.

Barros told reporters that the Pope offered him “words of support and affection” during the visit.

Words Versus Action On Preventing Sexual Abuse

In the past, Francis has shown signs that he’s willing and ready to take serious steps to confront the problem of sexual abuse in the church. Still, some victims’ advocates are worried that the Vatican is not moving quickly to keep kids safe.

In December 2013, victims’ groups rejoiced when Francis decided to assemble a Vatican committee dedicated solely to fighting child sex abuse in the church. The group, the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, initially included two survivors of clergy sex abuse.

In 2017, one of those survivors, Irish activist Marie Collins, announced that she was stepping down out of frustration with Vatican bureaucracy. In an opinion piece for the National Catholic Reporter, Collins wrote about facing a number of stumbling blocks, including a lack of resources and the resistance of some in the Vatican Curia toward implementing the commission’s recommendations.

The last straw for her was the refusal of a group at the Vatican to ensure that all letters from victims received a response.

“I find it impossible to listen to public statements about the deep concern in the church for the care of those whose lives have been blighted by abuse, yet to watch privately as a congregation in the Vatican refuses to even acknowledge their letters!” Collins wrote last March. “It is a reflection of how this whole abuse crisis in the Church has been handled: with fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors.”

In December, all of the commission members’ terms formally expired and the initiative’s future is unclear.

Secular groups have also delved into the problem of sexual abuse in the Catholic church. In December, the Australian government concluded an extensive, multi-year inquiry into sexual abuse of children in the country. The commission’s final report found that 59 percent of the more than 8,000 survivors interviewed said they were sexually abused in an institution managed by a religious organization. About 62 percent of that group said that the institution was managed by the Catholic Church.

The commission came up with a number of recommendations for the church. It urged the church to end the secrecy of the confessional when it prevents or discourages compliance with mandatory reporting laws. The commission also asked the church to rethink the requirement of priestly celibacy, which, while not a direct cause, elevated the risk of abuse.

Melbourne’s archbishop has dismissed both of those recommendations, since they involve changes to longstanding church tradition.

But Kieran Tapsell, a retired civil lawyer who submitted a paper on canon law to the commission, believes there are many other recommendations the commission made that could be put into practice ― such as ensuring there’s no statute of limitations for canonical trials and requiring Vatican congregations and courts to publish reasons for their disciplinary decisions.

″[These] recommendations had more to do with church law and practice, and could be more easily implemented, if church leadership is willing to take up this challenge,” Tapsell wrote in an analysis for the National Catholic Reporter.

But, as demonstrated in Chile, much of that change starts with the pope.

The president of the Chilean bishops’ conference, Monsignor Santiago Silva, told The New York Times on Friday that it would continue to support Barros ― trusting in Francis’ opinion of the bishop.

“The pope told us what he wants, and he wants Monsignor Barros to continue,” Silva said.

Backlash In Chile And Across The Globe

In Chile and around the world, Francis’ remarks in defense of Barros have caused outrage among survivors of clergy abuse.

Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima’s most vocal victims, was particularly unnerved by Francis’ demand for “proof” that Barros had been complicit in the abuse.

“As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching everything,” Cruz wrote on Twitter, according to a BBC translation.

“These people are absolutely crazy, and [the pope] is talking about reparation to the victims. Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.”

Patrick Noaker, a lawyer who has represented dozens survivors of sexual abuse in Minnesota, said that Cruz’s testimony appears to him to be extremely powerful. That’s because when it comes to child sexual abuse, there is rarely evidence outside the testimony of the victim.

Francis’ defense of Barros is a reminder to Noaker that bishops are “the princes of the Catholic church, and they are protected at all cost.”

“The statement by the pope reveals a hard-liner position that he will protect bishops over children,” he told HuffPost in an email. “This will discourage survivors of sexual abuse from reporting their abuse because they will not have photographs or other evidence of the abuse outside of their testimony.”

Other advocates for abuse survivors have the same fear that victims will be afraid to come forward with their stories. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online database BishopAccountability.org, called Francis’ attack on the Chilean sex abuse survivors a “stunning setback.”

“The burden of proof here rests with the Church, not with victims ― and especially not with victims whose veracity already has been affirmed,” Doyle said in a statement. “Exhaustive investigations by both church and civil authorities proved the allegations of Juan Carlos Cruz [and others] in regards to Karadima. A reasonable person would consider that they are telling the truth about Barros also.”

“Who knows how many victims now will decide to stay hidden, for fear they too will be attacked as slanderers?” she added.

David Greenwood, a volunteer lawyer with the British advocacy group Ministry and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors, echoed Doyle and Noaker’s concerns.

“For the Pope to be deliberately confrontational and challenging in this way will prevent survivors coming forward to share their ordeals,” Greenwood told HuffPost in an email.

The church’s handling of the abuse scandal in Chile has disillusioned many of the country’s Catholics. A survey by the regional polling firm Latinobarometro found that only 42 percent of Chilean Catholics approved of the job Francis is doing, compared with an average of 68 percent for 18 other Central and South American countries.

Casteix told HuffPost that, in her view, there’s nothing the pope can do now to prove that his apologies to sex abuse victims are meaningful.President Donald Trump is likely not enjoying his anniversary of being sworn in. Hundreds of thousands of people across the country are attending this year’s Women’s March to protest his administration. His approval ratings are in the tank. And oh, the government has shut down.

Though nothing quite illustrates the dysfunction and vitriol of this administration as much as the Statue of Liberty ― a shining beacon for immigrants and America’s traditional values ― being closed on Saturday as part of the government shutdown.

In the last year, Trump has turned his back on the ideals Americans often espouse. The president attempted to block the passage of people from Muslim-majority countries from coming into the U.S. (he failed). He wants to build a stupidly expensive, unnecessary wall to keep out Mexicans and Central Americans. And under Trump, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up its efforts to kick out immigrants who have spent the vast majority of their lives here.

It gets worse.

Just this month, Trump reportedly described Haiti and African countries as “shithole countries” in a closed Oval Office meeting. He instead suggested the U.S. bring in immigrants from nations like Norway.

But nothing quite shows the disdain he has for immigrants in this nation like his handling of Dreamers, unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and who know no other home. Last September, Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), originally put in place by former President Barack Obama, which protected these young immigrants from deportation.

Democratic lawmakers have made it clear that they won’t support the policy many say is racist. Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, used immigrant lives as a bargaining chip for the government shutdown, which occurred after Congress was unable to reach a budget agreement by midnight on Friday.

Trump, in all his “stable genius,” has passed the blame off on Democrats for the shutdown that has also led to the closure of Lady Liberty. It is the first time in the history of this country that a government shutdown has happened despite the House, Senate, and White House all being under the control of one party.

The Statue of Liberty last made national headlines after White House aide Stephen Miller said in August that the poem inscribed on the statue, “New Colossus,” had no significance because it was added later.

“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” the poem reads. “The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― There are a few massive disconnects as Congress and the White House spar over a plan to reopen the government, but one of the biggest is whether relief for young undocumented immigrants, which Democrats are demanding in a deal, is an urgent problem.

The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress argue that it’s not, and that protecting so-called Dreamers doesn’t need to happen until a March “deadline.” Democrats, some Republicans and Dreamers themselves say otherwise.

The reality is complicated, thanks to a court ruling, a multistep process for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deportation relief process, and politicians’ apparent lack of understanding ― either genuine or feigned ― about what’s actually happening. But the idea that nothing will happen until March, or that losing DACA isn’t a big deal, is straight-up false.

This confusion was illustrated on Saturday, when Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) took to the floor to criticize Democrats for causing a government shutdown. He acknowledged that he might be wrong about how the end of DACA worked ― a surprising statement, given that he’s one of the top Republican negotiators on a deal to fix it.

Cornyn said he wasn’t trying to downplay the urgency of the situation and believes something needs to be done. But he said that his understanding was that as of March 5, “current DACA recipients can no longer register again for an additional two years and qualify for an additional work permit.”

“I think ― but I could be mistaken ― that it doesn’t mean that they are subject to deportation,” Cornyn said. “What it means is that they can’t sign up again for another two years, and they will lose ― potentially lose their work permit.”

He was mistaken.

As previously mentioned, the current state of the DACA program is complicated, but here are the basic facts.

The Department of Homeland Security rescinded DACA on Sept. 5 at Trump’s suggestion, saying it was unconstitutional after Texas and other states threatened to sue (but before they actually did). At that point, the government immediately stopped accepting new applicants for the two-year deportation protections and work permits put in place under former President Barack Obama.

But Trump said he was giving Congress six months to act, pushing off the most dramatic effects of rescinding the program to March. DHS gave current DACA recipients whose protections were set to expire on March 5 or earlier just one month to pull together a $500 fee and send in renewal applications. Those whose DACA protections expire after March 5 were not allowed to apply for renewal, so Dreamers are set to begin to lose protections in greater numbers at that point, if Congress does not act.

This has allowed the administration and many Republicans to claim that nothing is happening until March, something that isn’t true. About 22,000 eligible DACA holders didn’t get their applications in on time, meaning they have already lost or will lose protections before March 5, at an average of 122 people per day. At least 1,900 people sent in their applications in time but were rejected because of mail delays. DHS decided to consider their applications but not expedite them, meaning some will likely lapse in the meantime.

Those 122 DACA recipients per day are the reason that advocates, Democrats and a handful of Republicans argue that it’s necessary to act before March 5. Former DACA recipients ― including those whose renewal applications were delayed in the mail ― are already being detained or losing their work permits. DACA doesn’t end March 5; it already did.

“DACA doesn’t end March 5; it already did.”

That brings us to what happens when Dreamers lose DACA protections. They do not, as Cornyn said, simply lose their work permits, although that is one piece of what happens. They also lose deferred action ― the process by which the administration rules them as an official nonpriority for deportation unless they violate DACA rules.

Losing DACA doesn’t necessarily mean that a person will be deported ― the talking point that all Dreamers will be removed from the country if Congress doesn’t act is hyperbole. But some almost certainly will, and all will be at risk.

DHS officials have said that former DACA recipients would not be a priority for deportation, which Cornyn echoed. But officials have balked at the idea that they should look the other way if they come across people they can remove, even if they’re not priorities ― meaning former DACA recipients can easily wind up detained and deported.

It will also take time for any legislative solution to be implemented, three former secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security warned in a letter urging Congress to act this month. It took two months from the time Obama announced DACA to begin accepting applications. The former DHS secretaries said that even if a bill is passed this month, it would be difficult to get it up and running by March.

Republicans do have one piece of evidence on their side to argue that a DACA fix doesn’t need to be immediate, but it’s a tenuous one. Trump ended DACA, but a court resurrected it earlier this month by ruling that the administration must begin accepting renewal applications again. That means that Dreamers who hold or have held DACA can, for the moment, reapply. Depending on how the court battle plays out, that could keep DACA alive for years.

That’s not much of a comfort to Dreamers either, however. The Department of Justice appealed the ruling and is asking the Supreme Court to consider the case, showing that Trump is committed to taking down DACA. The program could shutter again at any time. And even as it remains open, it will take time for the government to review and approve renewal applications, which could cause people to lose protections and work permits in the meantime.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who voted against a government funding bill on Friday night and is pushing for a bill to grant Dreamers legal status, laid some of this out for Cornyn on the Senate floor, noting that some DACA recipients are already losing their status and that courts are considering what should happen with the program.my step mom won her US citizenship in the lottery in the 1980s. now she’s a Doctor of Education who teachers college and middle school English, is an environmentalist, and changes the world on a daily basis. we need more women like her. #WomensMarchNYC pic.twitter.com/p914bPM1dKHere's President Trump's screw-up on this crucial part in his abortion speech: https://t.co/vUxr1yAN0j pic.twitter.com/D0HEu8bZ2o — The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) January 19, 2018

Donald Trump bungled a major line in his anti-abortion speech in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, saying that it is “wrong” that state laws allow babies to be “born in the ninth month.”

Trump made the flub in his address during the 45th annual March for Life rally, which marks the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The address was broadcast on giant screens at the National Mall, where marchers were gathered.

“Right now, in a number of states, the laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mother’s womb in the ninth month,” Trump said. “It is wrong. It has to change.”

He intended to say that it’s wrong for babies to be “torn” from their mothers’ wombs in the ninth month, an apparent reference to late-term abortions. Trump called on legislators to outlaw late-term abortions in his address.

While some listening to the speech may have been perplexed by the president’s comment, Twitter was fast off the mark in attacking the president’s goof. Wags at Quartz, highlighting several of Trump’s misstatements about abortion laws in his address, admitted that, yes, it’s true that all states, indeed all countries, allow babies to be born at nine months.

The President of the United States of America, the most powerful individual on the planet, just condemned babies that were born in the ninth month, live on TV and to an anti-abortion crowd.

During a presidential campaign debate with his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump claimed that doctors can “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day.”

In fact, that is “not happening in the United States,” Dr. Aaron Caughey, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University, told The New York Times after the debate. “It is, of course, such an absurd thing to say.”

Only 1.3 percent of abortions are performed at or after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit reproductive health research organization that supports abortion rights. An estimated 80 percent of those procedures are for birth defects, according to Huffpost contributor Dr. Jennifer Gunther, an obstetrician trained in later term (16 to 18 week) abortions. Others may be done to save the life of the mother.

“After 24 weeks, birth defects that lead to abortion are very severe and typically considered incompatible with life,” Gunther noted.

And fetuses are not “ripped out” of wombs. Even if there is a crisis in the last month of pregnancy — such as a car accident — labor would be induced or an emergency cesarean section would be performed, Caughey told the Times.

In his address to the anti-abortion marchers, Trump said that “Roe v. Wade has resulted in some of the most permissive abortion laws anywhere in the world,” even though America’s laws are similar to those in several countries. “We will always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life.”Donald Trump has officially completed one full year as president, and holy moly what a year it’s been.

A photo-editing battle has erupted over this somewhat unsettling snap of President Donald Trump’s face on a stack of German newspapers:

Emergency room doctor Kenny Banh described the situation, which reportedly happened about two months ago, in this month’s episode of medical podcast “This Won’t Hurt A Bit.” The episode ― which you can listen to in full here — aired Jan. 8, but the horrifying tale started appearing in numerous news outlets this week.

Banh said he was working in an emergency room in Fresno when a young man came in, saying he had bloody diarrhea and wanted to be treated for worms. Banh was initially somewhat skeptical that the man actually had worms, but his curiosity was piqued when he saw a small plastic bag next to the patient.

When he asked the patient about it, he was told, “It’s the worm,” Banh recalled on the podcast.

“I open it up and I take out a toilet paper roll ... and wrapped around it is of course this giant, long, what looks like a flat tapeworm,” said Banh.

The patient reported that he had abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea before seeing part of the worm hanging out of his body while on the toilet, Banh said. He started pulling on the long, stringy item until it was all the way out.

“And what does it do? It starts moving,” said Banh.

The patient was actually relieved that it was a tapeworm ― a parasite that can grow in the digestive tract ― and not his organs spilling out of his body. But he was understandably curious about where the worm came from.

Banh said that when he questioned the man about possible risk factors — like whether he had traveled to any developing countries, whether he had been drinking well water — only one detail stood out as a likely explanation. The man said he absolutely loved sushi and consumed raw salmon “almost every day,” Banh recalled.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common tapeworm to infect humans is Diphyllobothrium latum. People become infected after eating certain types of raw or undercooked fish, including salmon. And The Washington Post notes that salmon from the Pacific coasts of Asia and North America can be infected with a type of tapeworm known as Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense.

Properly cooking the fish — or, in the case of sushi, flash-freezing it at a low enough temperature — kills these worms. The CDC notes that most cases are asymptomatic, though infection can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and even vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia.

Banh told ABC30 that the worm had most likely been growing inside the man’s body for about six months. And the man had eaten sushi at so many different places, it would be impossible to figure out which location was responsible.According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, Cohen was hired just days after Trump was sworn into office at a rate of $50,000 a month for all of 2017 to advise AT&T on multiple matters pending before the government. Politico later confirmed the news.

The $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger is currently pending before the Justice Department, which has sued to stop it from going forward. In an email sent to employees on May 9 and obtained by Reuters, AT&T said that it had hired “several consultants to help us understand how the president and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues important to the company, including regulatory reform at the FCC, corporate tax reform and antitrust enforcement.”

Cohen’s business dealings came under scrutiny after Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing porn star Stormy Daniels, revealed that Cohen had been paid millions of dollars to advise several major companies, including the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, a South Korean aircraft manufacturer and an investment fund linked to a Russian oligarch. It’s unclear how Avenatti obtained the documents detailing Cohen’s finances, but they have since been confirmed by multiple media outlets.

Those companies sent checks to Cohen through a shell company that was also used to issue a $130,000 payment to Daniels just before the 2016 election so she would keep quiet about allegations that she had an affair with Trump.

The Post reported that AT&T’s deal with Cohen mandated that he “focus on specific long-term planning initiatives as well as the immediate issue of corporate tax reform and the acquisition of Time Warner.” He was also tasked with spending half of his time on legislative policy and half on regulatory policy. He was specifically told not to work as a lobbyist for the telecom.

The 2018 Women’s March rallies are a follow-up to last year’s wildly successful day of demonstrations, which ended up being the largest single-day protest in U.S. history.A police community support officer’s impromptu piano playing was music to a 93-year-old crime victim’s ears.

Officer Craig Bull couldn’t resist tickling the ivories after he spotted a piano at the Mansfield, England, home of a nonagenarian whom he and a colleague were checking up on following a theft.

In a heartwarming video that Mansfield Police shared to Facebook on Thursday, Bull sat down at the piano and played some classical music for the retiree.

“It truly made me feel good about myself and the job I do,” wrote Bull. “He felt wanted and reassured.” The whole encounter gave Bull great “job satisfaction,” he added. “It made his day, as you can see in the video.”

The Nottinghamshire Police service later tweeted it was “#proud” of Bull’s actions, which have now gone viral. “It’s staggering how much interest there’s been in the video,” said Bull, who’s been playing piano for almost 40 years.

“As I was playing the piece, when I got to a couple of difficult parts, I could hear him clapping in the background and when I watched the video later, seeing him playing along with his fingers, it was wonderful to see how much pleasure he got from it,” Bull told HuffPost.Comedian Robin Williams performs in Atlanta on May 10, 1986.

PARK CITY, Utah ― Robin Williams grew up as an only child to a fun-loving mother and businessman father far outside the Hollywood machine. But the moment he witnessed his stern dad laugh out loud at Jonathan Winters’ stick routine on “The Jack Paar Show,” Williams knew he wanted to be a performer.

Nearly four years after Williams’ death, HBO is set to release a new documentary on the beloved comedian’s life and one-of-a-kind career. “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” directed by Marina Zenovich and produced by Alex Gibney and Shirel Kozak, made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday night to a sold-out crowd. Audience members diligently followed the story of the award-winning actor from his childhood experiences at home and in school to his tragic suicide at age 63.

Featuring new interviews with Williams’ first wife, Valerie Velardi, “Mork & Mindy” co-star Pam Dawber, friends David Letterman and Billy Crystal, and his son Zak Williams, the film highlights the actor’s creative genius through some of his most beloved stage and screen performances, including “A Night at the Met,” “Happy Days,” Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Aladdin,” his USO tour, “Good Will Hunting” and “Dead Poets Society.”

It also shines a light on Williams’ personal life ― namely, his three marriages, his addiction to drugs and alcohol, and his friendships with the likes of John Belushi, Bobcat Goldthwait and Crystal.

The best bit of the film involves voicemails that Williams left for Crystal, which play over a montage of photos of the close duo. Williams would try out various character impressions, like “Sam from the Sibilance Society,” to get a rise out of his buddy. Crystal returned the favor when Williams underwent an aortic valve replacement in 2009, leaving him voicemails from “Vinny the Valve Guy” to help ease his recovery post-surgery.

Crystal reiterates that he wanted to be friends with Williams since the day he met the eccentric comedian in the 1980s. “I had no agenda,” Crystal says in the film, “I just liked him.”

One of the most profound moments revolves around Belushi’s overdose ― Williams was with the “SNL” star at his bungalow the night before he died. On the “Mork & Mindy” set the next day, Dawber informed Williams that Belushi had died, making a point to tell a cocaine-using Williams that she didn’t want him to end up like Belushi. And he promised he never would.

“It sobered the shit out of me,” Williams admitted in a soundbite from one of the many interviews Zenovich and her team dug up for the documentary.

Throughout his life, Williams used humor and performance as another way to get the “high” he craved in his day-to-day, according to many of the interviewees in the film. Zak Williams reveals that his father’s calling ― his desire to get from Hollywood what he needed ― took him away from Zak and his half-siblings, Zelda and Cody.

Although Williams was a standout entertainer, behind closed doors he was a mild-mannered introvert, as both behind-the-scenes archival footage and personal videos reveal. Performer Williams was electric, while Real-Life Williams was vulnerable and quiet.

“He was really comfortable onstage and less comfortable off,” his “Waiting for Godot” co-star Steve Martin said in the doc.

Yet for most, it was hard not to fall for Williams. Every person interviewed for “Come Inside My Mind” seemed eager to share heartfelt memories and stories about the actor’s craft, humor and personality.

“He could levitate,” Letterman said.

“The urge to be funny was so innate to him,” “One Hour Photo” filmmaker Mark Romanek added.

In 2006, Williams fell back into alcohol use to numb some of the pain he endured. Though he did get clean and continued to treat his addiction until the end of his life in 2014, the effort did not protect him from a misdiagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. In truth, he suffered from Lewy body dementia, which was almost surely a factor in his suicide, Goldthwait said.

Perhaps comedian Lewis Black described Williams best in the film, stating, “[He was] the light that never knew how to turn itself off.”
