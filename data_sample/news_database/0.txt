DENTON, Texas ― Amanda Painter sat at the kitchen table in an unfamiliar apartment with an absurd dilemma: She had nothing to wear to a vigil for her three dead children.

Her clothes were at home, but her home was now a crime scene.

Less than 100 hours after her children were murdered, Amanda, 29, found herself in a Walmart, hobbling down the aisles, the gunshot wound to her neck concealed by a gauze bandage. She found a suitable purple shirt and kept her head down. She hadn’t expected to see so many children at the store, laughing and playing. For eight years, Amanda answered to “Mommy.” Now, her babies ― Odin, 8, Caydence, 6, and Drake, 4 ― were gone. Each time she closed her eyes, even to blink, they returned.

Last week, Amanda’s ex-husband, Justin Painter, 39, entered her home in Ponder, Texas, and fatally shot her boyfriend, Seth Richardson, 29, her three children and then himself. He intentionally kept Amanda alive, he told her, to live with the pain.

It was an unthinkable tragedy.

Two days later another unthinkable tragedy occurred, more than 300 miles away. A student opened fire in a high school in Santa Fe, killing 10. Both events were mass shootings ― that is, they each involved at least four fatalities ― and both were in Texas.

There’s no place worse than Texas when it comes to mass shootings. Since 2009, the state has experienced 20 incidents, the most of any state. In 65 percent of cases, the victims included a romantic partner or family member of the shooter, just like what happened to Amanda.

Yet most people only hear about the school shootings ― and not Amanda’s story.

When HuffPost interviewed Amanda, she had just been released from the hospital and was settling into an apartment 20 minutes away from her home, provided by the local domestic violence organization, Denton County Friends of the Family. Advocates stocked the apartment with comfort food, flowers, bath bombs and toiletries, and scribbled inspirational messages on the mirrors. “We are here for you!” someone had written in dry-erase marker. “This is a place to heal and feel safe.”

Amanda was visibly in pain, and moved slowly around the apartment, wincing.

She’d been asleep in bed with her boyfriend when her ex-husband showed up that morning. Seth was lying next to her, his arm wrapped around her body, his stomach pressed into her back, when Justin came in and shot Seth in the head. The bullet went through Seth’s body and into Amanda’s, fracturing her neck and breaking her ribs. Her physical injuries were nothing, she said, compared to her emotional pain. In conversation, Amanda would appear composed for a minute, sometimes two, but then her face crumpled, contorted by grief.

“Your life can always get worse,” she said, breaking down. “I don’t think mine can get any lower. Somehow, I’m still fucking standing, and I’m going to keep going, and I don’t know how, but I’m going to keep going.”

Everyone kept asking her what she needed, she said. The only thing she needed she couldn’t have.

“My kids were my coping mechanism, and now they are gone,” Amanda said. “He knew when he took them from me, he took everything. He’s won.”

The relationship

Amanda met Justin online when she was 17. They both played “World of Warcraft.” Her username was Amarella; he was Torak. She lived in Richmond, Virginia, and he lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They chatted on the internet for a year, getting to know each other’s stories.

Amanda’s was complicated: Her mother struggled with drug addiction, and Amanda and her identical twin sister, Ashley, were frequently uprooted as kids, bouncing from school to school.

Justin offered stability, and a chance at a fresh start. He was 10 years older and had a job at a Walmart distribution center in Oklahoma. When she was 19, he drove to Virginia to pick her up and bring her home with him. It was the first time they’d met in person.

Once they were in Oklahoma, Amanda recalled, it seemed like Justin wanted her to stay indoors and only play video games. Within a few months, she was stir-crazy. She planned a trip back to Virginia to see her family. While there, she discovered she was pregnant. She didn’t really want to go back to Oklahoma, she said, because she already harbored concerns about the relationship. But she also worried about being a single mother. She had grown up in poverty, and she didn’t want that for her baby.

Without much choice, she went back to Oklahoma to be with Justin. Her son Odin was born in 2009. Caydence came next, in 2012. They moved to Texas to be closer to Justin’s family. Then came Drake, in 2013.

During their nine-year relationship, Justin was not physically abusive toward her, Amanda said, but sometimes she felt afraid of him. When he was angry, he would slam things ― the television remote, his computer chair. She said he was controlling, especially when it came to family finances. She was not given a debit card until after Caydence was born. Before that, every time she needed anything ― diapers, milk, gas for the car ― she had to ask for cash.

Amanda said she often felt depressed. Every so often, she said, she would tell Justin she wasn’t happy and he’d beg her to stay, saying he couldn’t live without her.

She said he also threatened that if she did leave, she’d lose the kids.

“It’s not a huge surprise to me that there wasn’t a lot of physical violence, because it wasn’t necessary,” said Donna Bloom, director of legal services at Denton County Friends of the Family and one of the advocates who stayed with Amanda in the days after the shooting. Physical violence, she said, is just one of many tools people use to control their partners.

“Amanda is a pretty compliant person, so it didn’t have to escalate to physical violence,” Bloom said. “He could use these other tools to achieve the same objective, which is to be in control.”

The separation and the gun

Last year, Amanda finally decided to leave Justin. She was about to turn 28 and felt a growing sense of independence, thanks to a new job. “I thought, if I’m going to take care of the children and work full-time and take care of the house, I just need to get out,” she said.

On April 21, 2017, she told Justin she wanted to try separating, and that she was going to move in with a friend. That night, she said, she and Justin went to sleep together, but in the morning, he wasn’t in bed. She found him in another room, crying. She said he told her that while she was asleep, he had gotten out his gun, loaded it and planned to kill himself.

Scared for the safety of her children, Amanda decided to leave right away. Justin grew angry, she said, and starting throwing things, breaking their flat-screen television over his knees. She buckled the kids in the car and went back in the house to get the gun. It was still loaded, she said. She put it in the trunk.

“I took it because I was afraid he was going to shoot himself,” Amanda said.

She wasn’t the only one who was worried. According to a police report obtained by HuffPost, Justin’s stepfather called 911 that morning to request a welfare check on his son, and an ambulance was called. Police confirmed to HuffPost that Justin was voluntarily admitted into a mental health facility.

While he was seeking medical help, Amanda moved out with the kids. When he returned home, she said, they both took turns caring for the children. Her shifts at a nursing home were unpredictable, and she needed his parenting support. Still, she was surprised when he filed for divorce that summer. He fought for primary custody, and got it.

“I didn’t have any money,” Amanda said. She went to court without a lawyer.

Amanda was granted visitation with her children every other weekend. This worked out for a while, she said. Their relationship grew amicable. Sometimes Justin came over for dinner. Other times, they did stuff with the kids together.

But there was one point of contention: the gun.

Earlier this year, Amanda recalls, Justin’s family asked her to return his gun. Amanda didn’t want to give it back, she said, but she felt like she had no choice. Justin told her she could get in trouble for allegedly stealing it. So she reluctantly gave it back to Justin’s family, she said. At some point, Amanda believes, they returned it to him.

It was the same gun he brought to her house and used to kill her children, police confirmed to HuffPost.

Justin’s family did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The incident

On the evening of May 15, Amanda and Justin took the kids out for pizza. During the car ride, Amanda told Justin about her new boyfriend, that it was serious and he was planning to move in with her.

For the past few months, Amanda had been in a long-distance relationship with Seth Richardson, whom she knew from her teen years. They, too, had met through “World of Warcraft,” and had kept in touch for a decade.

“We just had this bond, it never left,” Amanda said. “There was so much positivity when we were together.”

Seth lived in South Carolina, and had recently decided to move to Texas for Amanda. They hoped to start a family together. At the time she broke the news to Justin, Seth was already on the road, making the 19-hour drive to Texas.

Justin’s face fell, Amanda said. Even though they’d been separated a year, he was still holding out hope for reconciliation.

“I saw him fall apart,” she said. “He kept saying, ‘I’m trying to love you, I’m trying to change.’”

He started driving erratically, she said, and screamed at her and the kids. When they got back to her house, she had to plead with him to allow the kids to stay for dinner. She promised to bring them back to his house afterward.

Amanda and her kids ate pizza on her bed (pepperoni for Odin and Caydence; black olive, sausage and mushroom for Drake; onion for her) and watched the movie “Atlantis.” They cuddled. After dinner, Amanda drove them back to Justin’s house, and gave each of them a goodnight kiss. She watched them file inside.

Once she got home, she fell asleep. Around 6:30 the next morning, she got a call from Seth. He had finally arrived at her house.

“I didn’t even hang up the phone. I threw it on the bed and ran outside,” she recalled. “I hugged him and kissed his neck and hugged him and hugged him. I was just so excited he was there. It meant our life was about to start.”

Seth was exhausted from driving, and they soon fell asleep together, spooning on her bed. They didn’t rest long. Some time around 8 a.m., Amanda woke to a loud bang next to her head.

It was unlike anything she’d ever heard, and her back was alight with searing pain. Her ears rang and she was paralyzed with confusion. Then she heard more bangs.

“Seth!” she screamed. “Seth!”

Moments passed ― minutes? Seconds? Time collapsed for Amanda. Then she heard a voice in the doorway. It was Justin.

“Seth’s dead. The kids are dead. And you’re going to have to live with it,” she recalls him saying.

He shot himself in front of her.

She managed to turn herself over, and saw Seth lying beside her. He was shot.

Amanda grabbed her phone and dialed 911, stumbling into the living room. She prayed that Justin was bluffing about the children, trying to scare her. Then she saw a shoe lying on the ground. A little leg. Closer, and she could see all three children, shot to death.

Neighbors said they saw Justin arrive at the house Wednesday morning with the children and bring them into the home.

Amanda collapsed on the ground. For some reason, her arms weren’t working. She wanted to pick up her children, but she couldn’t. “I thought my body was breaking down because of my mental state,” she said.

In reality, she had been shot. When Justin shot Seth, who was asleep cuddling her, the bullet went through him and into her body.

The ambulance arrived to take her to the hospital, but she didn’t want to go. She didn’t want to leave her children behind. Later, a female detective told her that the first responders all made a pact ― they would not let the children ride in the same vehicle as their deceased father, the man who stole their lives.

While in the hospital, Amanda posted a series of emotional videos on her Facebook page, explaining what had happened. She felt a desperate urge to share, to unload her grief for others to see and reckon with. But it backfired. In the comments, she said, people were blaming her for what happened.

Why? Because she left.

The vigil

It was a bright, clear evening at Parkview Elementary School in Fort Worth, where Odin had been in second grade and Caydence was in kindergarten. At 4, Drake was still in day care, but he’d been looking forward to attending the school when he was old enough, like his big sister and brother.

Around 100 people gathered to mourn. Parents held on to their children tightly. The crowd was quiet, save for the sounds of sniffles and subdued crying. In front of the school, people left offerings of teddy bears and bouquets of flowers.

Amanda sat near the back, on a stone bench, flanked by her twin sister. Her face was pained. She cried, on and off, and listened as student after student took the microphone to offer a memory of her children.

“Odin always used to hit my head with his locker accidentally because he had the locker above me.”

“Caydence used to play with me at recess.”

“Whenever I was on the lonely bench, Odin would ask if I wanted to play with him.”

“He was always happy. I never saw him not be happy. He always had a big smile on his face.”

Afterward, each child was handed a helium balloon to write a message on and send up to heaven ― up to their friends. One balloon popped loudly next to Amanda and she startled, jumping up and retreating tearfully to the parking lot.

It sounded too much like a gunshot.

Once the balloons were up in the air, fading into the night sky, she came back.

She sang “Amazing Grace” along with the crowd, and held a flickering white candle. The program was over, and people started to disperse, gathering up their families and walking to their cars.

Amanda stood alone. And then, one by one, children began to approach, lining up to see her. They hugged her legs, squeezed her chest, kissed her cheek. They knew what she needed.The 2018 FIFA World Cup starts June 14 in Russia, and now it has an official song.

Producer Diplo and reggaeton star Nicky Jam collaborate on “Live It Up,” which also features Albanian singer Era Istrefi and actor Will Smith, who is trying to restart his music career .

Traditionally, over the last two decades, each World Cup has had an official song. The song for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa was “Waka Waka” by Shakira. For the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, the song was “We Are One (Ole Ola)” by Pitbull.Justin Timberlake paid a visit Friday to victims of last week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas.

He dropped in at an area hospital where victims were recovering from the shooting at Santa Fe High School, in which a gunman killed 10 people and injured 13 last Friday.

The visit came a couple days after the pop icon performed a concert in nearby Houston in which he donned a “Santa Fe Strong” shirt, the Houston Chronicle reported.

A Facebook post from Sonia Lopez-Puentes, the mother of injured student Sarah Salazar, shows a picture of Timberlake with Salazar at the hospital and says he brought her a gift.Rep. Lou Barletta, one of President Donald Trump's favorites, is now a target of the Koch brothers. Tom Williams via Getty Images

A Koch brothers-backed nonprofit is targeting one of President Donald Trump’s favorite members of Congress as part of a new ad buy slamming House members who supported a $1.3 trillion spending package earlier this year.

The six-figure effort from Americans for Prosperity is set to begin over Memorial Day weekend and includes direct mail, digital, radio and print ads aimed at 10 Republicans and seven Democrats.

Among the GOP members is Pennsylvania’s Rep. Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in November. Barletta became famous for leading a crackdown on illegal immigration while mayor of Hazleton more than a decade ago and was personally encouraged by Trump to run for the Senate.

“It’s time to take a hard look at what lawmakers say and what they actually do when it comes to reining in overspending,” said Americans for Prosperity spokesman Bill Riggs. “The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March showed a complete disregard for fiscal responsibility. Both parties are responsible for putting the country on an unsustainable fiscal path, which is why AFP is committed to holding both parties accountable.”

The expansive spending package narrowly passed the House and survived a brief veto threat from the president. The goal of the new campaign is to ensure that the next spending deal includes significant cuts to government spending.

The Koch brothers’ expansive political network spent heavily to help the GOP win and retain control of the Senate in 2014 and 2016, and it’s highly unusual for them to attack a GOP Senate candidate in a swing state, even if most handicappers consider Barletta an underdog in November.

Former Koch network operatives are also ubiquitous throughout the Trump administration and the group pushed aggressively for the GOP’s tax reform plan. But the network’s leaders have become more open about their frustrations that the president and his party aren’t following the network’s libertarian-influenced policy preferences on immigration, trade and government spending. Earlier this month, the group’s Hispanic outreach arm, LIBRE, sent out mailers thanking four Democratic lawmakers for their work to protect Dreamers.

“We will be looking for allies wherever we can find them ― on the left, the right, or in the middle,” James Davis, the executive director of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a CNN op-ed last month. “We welcome all comers. And we will hold those accountable who stand in the way of progress, regardless of their party.”

This isn’t to say that the network, which has spent billions to advance conservative policies and elect Republicans over the past decade, is suddenly turning bipartisan. While they’re attacking Republicans like Barletta and vulnerable Michigan Rep. Mike Bishop, for example, they’re also slamming Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz this fall, and hitting Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.

And they’re also spending money on ads and direct mail thanking a large group of vulnerable Republicans who voted against the spending package, including Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Jim Renacci, the GOP nominees for Senate in Tennessee and Ohio; and Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado and Rod Blum of Iowa, who are both top targets for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Other members targeted by the campaign are GOP Reps. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, Mike Simpson of Idaho, John Carter of Texas, Robert Aderholt of Alabama, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, Tom Rooney of Florida and Ken Calvert of California, as well as Democratic Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Pete Visclosky of Indiana, Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania.Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.

Trump disparaged Obama at Thursday’s announcement for not issuing the pardon, but others said issuing clemency for Johnson is merely a symbolic move that falls short of addressing present-day racism in the criminal justice system.

Though Obama granted clemency to nearly 2,000 people under an initiative aimed largely at commuting sentences of nonviolent drug-law offenders, his administration was unable to address the nearly 8,000 additional petitions that remained at the end of his term, Kevin Blackistone, a professor and sports commentator, wrote in The Washington Post last month.

Unlike Johnson, ”[t]hey are of living, breathing people ... with children, spouses, partners and futures that can be regained and realized with a second chance.”

Those remaining petitions, he noted, “were left behind in a file, as is customary historic practice, for the review of the next president.”

The previous presidents to issue posthumous pardons were Bill Clinton in 1999 and George W. Bush in 2008. Clinton pardoned Lt. Henry Ossian Flipper, the first black West Point graduate who years later was convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer. Bush pardoned Charlie Winters, who had been convicted of violating the Neutrality Act by helping Israel obtain bomber planes in 1948.

The pardon of Johnson was the fourth of Trump’s term. He previously pardoned former Dick Cheney advisor Scooter Libby, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and a case of Navy sailor whose pardon request was promoted on Fox News. So far, there’s been no indication that any of his pardons have gone through the standard procedure through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which evaluates requests for pardons and clemency and makes recommendations to the president.

This story has been updated with details of the previous posthumous pardons.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated President Barack Obama pardoned nearly 2,000 people. In fact, that number reflects the total of both pardons and commutations he granted.On Wednesday, actor Ashton Kutcher made a surprise visit to “The Ellen Show” and shocked host Ellen DeGeneres by making a $4 million donation to her wildlife fund, a cause near and dear to the TV show host.

Kutcher even asked a teary-eyed DeGeneres to push the button on his phone app to officially transfer the funds.

“I would like to push it,” DeGeneres quipped. “I’d like to push it real good.”

In February, DeGeneres received an incredible gift from her wife, actress Portia de Rossi: The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund. The fund’s first initiative will be building a campus in Rwanda for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund to house and protect mountain gorillas while promoting tourism, education and scientific research.

Construction will begin on the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund this summer. Fossey, one of DeGeneres’ heroes, was an American scientist who made it her life’s work to study gorillas in Africa.Axelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images

Manchester, England, will always be with Ariana Grande.

This week marked the anniversary of the deadly bombing attack that occurred during her 2017 Manchester Arena concert.

On Thursday, the “No Tears Left To Cry” singer posted an emotional tribute to the victims of the attack, which left 22 people dead, with a photo of a bee tattoo inked just above one of her ears.

“Forever,” the 24-year-old wrote in the caption of the photo posted to Twitter and Instagram, alongside an emoji of a dark cloud.

The worker bee is a symbol of Manchester and celebrates the city’s industrious spirit. According to the BBC, it’s even incorporated into the city’s coat of arms.

In June 2017, PRI reported that many Manchester residents showed their solidarity with the victims and survivors of the devastating bombing by getting the bee tattoo.

The Sun also reported in June 2017 that after Grande’s One Love Manchester benefit concert, which raised money for those affected by the tragedy, the singer and her tour team got the bee tattoo backstage.

Though this could very well be the tattoo featured in Grande’s post on Tuesday, the Daily Beast reported that when Grande got the bee tattoo backstage after her tribute concert, she got it on her arm, not above her ear — so this could possibly be a new tattoo.

Yet regardless of how many worker bee tattoos the singer may have, Grande still feels the sting of the attack.

In a moving interview, she recently told Time that even though she’s been relatively private about her feelings about the experience, there’s a reason for it.

Anything related to Kanye West these days comes with a massive caveat due to his still-unfolding Twitter meltdown (side note: please, PLEASE stop), but if there’s one saving grace, it’s his relationship with Kim Kardashian.

It’s been four years since the couple’s lavish Italian wedding, which was somewhat surprisingly not featured on the family’s reality show. On Thursday, Kardashian threw back to the big day with a previously unseen photo of the two. Predictably, West is not smiling in the pic.

“4 years down and forever to go.... Thank you babe for giving me our family and caring so much about us,” she wrote alongside the sun-kissed photo of the couple at their wedding. “Thank you for inspiring me on a daily, I’m so lucky. I can’t wait for forever... Happy Anniversary.”

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 24, 2018 at 6:11am PDT

In case you forgot, their wedding was a gorgeous display of what money can buy.

After pre-wedding festivities in Paris at iconic locations like the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Versailles, where Lana Del Rey performed, guests were then whisked off to Florence, Italy, with no warning. There, Kardashian, stunning in a custom Givenchy gown, married West at the historic Forte di Belvedere in front of two towering flower walls.

The 200 attendees included famous types like Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Rachel Roy and La La Anthony. Jay-Z and Beyoncé famously did not attend ― a snub that would become a point of contention in the rappers’ rift later.

Kardashian’s mother, Kris Jenner, was apparently feeling the anniversary spirit as well.

“4 beautiful years and 3 gorgeous babies later, I’m beyond happy for you and so proud of your precious family. Your wedding was a memory I will never forget,” she wrote on Instagram. “Such a beautiful memory for such an amazing beautiful couple and I will cherish it for the rest of my life.”

While Kim and Kanye have certainly had their own ups and downs over the last four years, Kimye seems to be as untouchable as ever.What started as a ground breaking music video ended in a savage attack by a cowardly K9.

A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) on May 23, 2018 at 7:05pm PDTWoody Allen’s son Moses Farrow came to the filmmaker’s defense on Wednesday in a long essay that accused his mother, Mia Farrow, of child abuse.

Farrow, 40, disputed sister Dylan’s claim that Allen sexually abused her as a child and blamed their mother for years of turmoil in their household.

“I’m a very private person and not at all interested in public attention,” Farrow wrote in an entry on his blog titled, “A Son Speaks Out.” “But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.”

Allen has denied Dylan Farrow’s claims, and no charges were filed after an investigation. But the accusations have resurfaced amid the Me Too movement against sexual misconduct, and Allen has been reduced to a pariah in some circles. Some actors have denounced him or donated salaries they earned on Allen films.

Moses Farrow wrote that the abuse his sister alleges never happened, and pointed to what he said were inconsistencies in her claim. Of Dylan’s recollection that she was abused in an attic while Allen asked her to play with an electric train, Moses said there was no train in the attic and the space was too small for anyone to play there.

Mia Farrow, Moses wrote, had been telling the children for months that their father was a “monster,” he added. “None of us would have allowed Dylan to step away with Woody, even if he tried.”

It was Mia Farrow, Moses wrote, who was the abuser. He said she struck him multiple times, and once made him strip and stand in a corner. She dragged physically disabled siblings down a stairway and locked them into a closet, he claimed.

She punished her son Thaddeus, a paraplegic, by shutting him in an outdoor shed overnight, Moses said. She was especially hard on Soon-Yi Previn, Allen’s future wife, Moses wrote. Farrow threw a porcelain centerpiece at her head and beat her with a telephone, he alleged.

“For all of us, life under my mother’s roof was impossible if you didn’t do exactly what you were told, no matter how questionable the demand,” Moses wrote. “It was important to my mother to project to the world a picture of a happy blended household of both biological and adopted children, but this was far from the truth.”

Dylan Farrow responded to her brother’s claims with a statement on Twitter, calling them “beyond hurtful to me” and “easily disproven.”

Ronan Farrow also weighed in on Moses Farrow’s claims, saying Mia Farrow did an “extraordinary” job of raising them.

The actress said that as a 22-year-old, more than two decades ago, she found herself alone in a hotel room with the film executive when he attempted to massage her and invited her to his bedroom. She left immediately, but told Pitt, her boyfriend at the time, about the disturbing encounter. He later confronted Weinstein, who Paltrow said never made a pass at her again.

During an interview with Howard Stern on his radio show Wednesday, Paltrow revealed exactly how Pitt intervened, saying that he once threatened to kill the producer.

She and Pitt were at the opening of a “Hamlet” production on Broadway, “and Harvey was there, and Brad Pitt, it was like the equivalent of throwing [Weinstein] against the wall, you know, energetically,” Paltrow said. “It was so fantastic because what he did was, he leveraged his fame and power to protect me, at a time when I didn’t have fame or power yet. It was, it was fantastic. He’s a good person and Harvey was never inappropriate with me again.”

Pitt told the producer that if he ever made Paltrow “feel uncomfortable again, I’ll kill you,” she added.

But while Paltrow said Weinstein never crossed the line with her again, she later discovered he had been telling actresses that the two had sex to lure other women into his clutches.

Pitt and Paltrow, who were even engaged at one point, split for good in 1997. Shortly after, she began a relationship with Ben Affleck, which she has less fond memories of.

“How did you know not to marry him? You were never in love with him?” Stern asked Paltrow.

“It’s interesting, I think there’s certain boyfriends where you are trying to work stuff out, right? Like you’re trying to heal certain stuff from your childhood and he was very much a lesson in that way,” Paltrow said. “I’m not sure exactly what I was trying to heal in that instance but it was, he was, ya know, it was specific.”A federal judge on Wednesday ruled it was unconstitutional for Donald Trump to block people on Twitter, which the president has done to many critics, including horror novelist Stephen King. Later that night, King told “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert why he was blocked.

“I might’ve said he had his head somewhere where a certain yoga position would be necessary to get it there,” King said. “And that was it, man.”

King also took on Mike Pence, saying there was something “creepy” about the vice president.

“I think it has something to do with the hair,” King said. “The hair doesn’t look like it has strands, it’s just there.”

King then compared Pence to a TV trope.

“He’s like the mean doctor on a soap opera, the one who sells drugs, you know, or has a prostitution ring from Bulgaria or something,” King said. “He has that look.”

“I’ve always wanted to see a day devoted to how much we love Jessica Walter, but not like this. She deserves better all the way around,” said one person.

The support comes about after several stars of TV’s “Arrested Development,” including Tambor, talked with the Times about the show’s revival on Netflix. Tambor was fired from his latest show, “Transparent,” in February when one of his co-stars and his former personal assistant alleged that he had sexually harassed them.

Tambor denies the allegations, though he did admit to The Hollywood Reporter that he had “volatile and ill-tempered” tendencies. Behavior, he said, that led to a “blowup” a few years ago directed at Walter, who plays Tambor’s wife on “Development.”

In the Times interview, Walter said, “In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set.” Through tears, the Times reported, she also said,“I have to let go of being angry at him.”

Co-stars Jason Bateman, David Cross, and Tony Hale responded to her reveal by hedging about Tambor’s behavior.

Bateman said all actors have their “processes,” citing the entertainment industry as “a breeding ground for atypical behavior.” Cross said Tambor has “learned from the experience and he’s listening and learning and growing,” while Hale simply said, “we’ve all had moments.”

The only “Development” cast member to immediately rally to Walter’s defense was Alia Shawkat, who told Bateman: “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.”

Much like Shawkat, many on social media came to Walter’s side and rallied to call out the culture we’re currently living in:

This is a rather intense article. Kudos to @SopanDeb for writing it. Personally, what Jessica Walter talks about-hit me hardest 'cause I've been emotionally abused at a job before. That's hard to get over. I wouldn't work w/ Tambor ever again if I were her. https://t.co/pNhEP6zvUp — Monique Jones (@moniqueblognet) May 23, 2018

Dear Jessica Walter,



You do NOT need to let it go.



- Everyone — Laura, Social Media Participant (@lsirikul) May 23, 2018

It's true, I think the most shocking part of the interview is how Jessica Walter is just so open about how wronged she feels. That's so rare to hear/see, and makes it impossible to ignore everyone else's bullshit. — Anne Cohen (@anneesthercohen) May 24, 2018

This shouldn't happen to any actress, no matter how much experience she has, but MY GOD Jessica Walter has been working in this business since the 1960s & I assume she had to deal with a lot. She is still emotional about this incident with Tambor & that speaks volumes. — Jetgirl Says Stuff (@jetgirl78) May 23, 2018

Of all the characters on the show… of all the talent, I feel Jessica Walter is the one I watch the series for. I love her as an actress, I think she is one of the most underrated talents on TV. I love her even more in Archer. I put up with that show for her only. — Sir James The Second 🇱🇷 (@NotOnMyWatchTV) May 24, 2018

Both Bateman and Hale have since apologized to Walter via social media, but the memo has been sent.

Walter herself said in the interview, “There’s so much testosterone in this room” ― and the same can be applied to the cultural climate, despite the emergence of the Me Too movement and women being encouraged to speak up about harassment.SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday to discuss Kim’s possible upcoming summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, the South said, the second inter-Korean summit in as many months.

Moon and Kim met just north of the heavily militarised border in the afternoon to exchange views to pave way for a summit between North Korea and the United States, South Korea’s presidential office said.

Moon will announce the outcome of his two-hour meeting with Kim on Sunday morning, officials said.The co-stars of “Arrested Development” sat down together for an often-emotional interview with The New York Times as Jeffrey Tambor, who plays the family patriarch on the show, faces harassment allegations.

Tambor was fired in February from “Transparent,” in which he had also starred, after his co-star Trace Lysette and his former personal assistant Van Barnes accused him of sexual harassment. The actor denies the allegations but admitted to being “volatile and ill-tempered” in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter. He added that his temper reached the “Arrested Development” set too, prompting a “blowup” with Jessica Walter, who plays his wife on the show.

During the Times interview, published Wednesday, Walter said that Tambor had indeed verbally harassed and yelled at her. “In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set,” she said.

Walter’s comment came in response to a remark from co-star Jason Bateman, who plays Michael Bluth on the show and who seemed particularly eager to defend Tambor. Bateman had said that all actors have their “processes.”

“Not to belittle it or excuse it or anything, but in the entertainment industry, it is incredibly common to have people who are, in quotes, ‘difficult,’” Bateman said, later adding, “It’s a very amorphous process ... you know, making up fake life. It’s a weird thing, and it is a breeding ground for atypical behavior, and certain people have certain processes.”

At that point, Alia Shawkat, who plays Maeby Fünke on the show and who was the only other female star present for the Times interview, interjected: “But that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.”

Bateman later reacted to the Times interview, tweeting that he was “horrified” and “embarrassed” that he wasn’t more clued into how the incident affected Walter.

“I was so eager to let Jeffrey know that he was supported in his attempt to learn, grow and apologize that I completely underestimated the feelings of the victim, another person I deeply love - and she was ... sitting right there!” Bateman wrote. “I shouldn’t have tried so hard to mansplain, or fix a fight, or make everything okay. I deeply, and sincerely, apologize.”

The show’s other male stars, as well as its creator, Mitchell Hurwitz, have expressed viewpoints similar to Bateman’s in the interview.

“Jeffrey has never evinced that kind of behavior,” Hurwitz told Entertainment Weekly, referring to the allegations from the “Transparent” set. “Am I going to cut Jeffrey out of the show, based on allegations that he disputes ... and that we have never experienced any complaints about? No, of course I am not going to.”

Tony Hale and David Cross ― also actors on the show ― defended Tambor in the Times interview.

“He learned from the experience and he’s listening and learning and growing. That’s important to remember,” Cross said.

Hale noted, “We’ve all had moments.”

After the uproar over the interview, Hale tweeted that he apologized to Walter.

“Regardless of my intentions, it is clear that my words, both said and unsaid, served to minimize Jessica’s pain and for that I am extremely sorry,” he said.

I have reached out to Jessica personally to apologize. Arrested Development is one of my families. Regardless of my intentions, it is clear that my words, both said and unsaid, served to minimize Jessica’s pain and for that I am extremely sorry. — Tony Hale (@MrTonyHale) May 24, 2018

Walter did tell the Times she was ready to forgive Tambor and would work with him again “in a heartbeat.”

“Let me just say one thing that I just realized in this conversation,” Walter said, through tears. “I have to let go of being angry at him.”

She added, turning to Tambor: “I have to let it go. And I have to give you a chance to, you know, for us to be friends again.”Harvey Weinstein plans to turn himself in to New York City law enforcement on Friday morning, The New York Times reported Thursday citing two unnamed law enforcement officials, along with other news outlets.

The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has been conducting a criminal probe into accusations against the disgraced former Hollywood producer.

Inspired by October exposes in The New York Times and The New Yorker, dozens of women began coming forward late last year with stories about the alleged sexual abuse and harassment they sustained at his hands. Reporters for the Times and The New Yorker ― Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey and Ronan Farrow ― received the Pulitzer Prize for public service earlier this year for their effort to expose Hollywood’s culture of abuse.

Their work is credited with sparking the Me Too and Time’s Up movements against sexual misconduct.

After the Times delivered the first devastating blow, Weinstein issued a bizarre statement quoting Jay-Z to apologize for his actions. He explained that they stemmed from growing up “in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.”

Since then, Weinstein has repeatedly denied engaging in any nonconsensual sex acts through his attorneys.

A number of women spoke out against Weinstein following the lead of Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Asia Argento, who were among his first public accusers.

Hollywood stars including A-list actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie began sharing stories that started feeling grossly similar to those told by women who agreed to be named in initial media reports. A pattern of abuse quickly emerged: Much of the time, Weinstein would use his position of power to lure individual young women to his hotel rooms, offices or other private spaces under the guise of speaking about work. Sometimes he would tell them another woman would be present in order to make his female guests more comfortable; the woman would either be completely absent or quickly leave.

Their accusations have ranged from uncomfortable sexual harassment to brutal sexual assault.

The charges against him are reportedly related to an accusation made by Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker the disgraced Hollywood producer forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting ostensibly on a work opportunity.

As part of its investigation, the NYPD also examined the alleged 2010 sexual assault of “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, The Wall Street Journal reported.

In 2015, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. let Weinstein off the hook for an alleged sexual assault by an Italian model, deciding there was insufficient evidence for charges after he allegedly groped her. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered the state attorney general to review the decision, which Vance has defended.

Weinstein was fired from the studio he co-founded, The Weinstein Company, in October 2017.Samantha Bee pulled no punches as she broke down why the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency should be shut down.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “Full Frontal,” Bee joked that ICE’s job application was “just a single question asking if the real hero of ’Schindler’s List’ was the girl shouting ‘Goodbye Jews.’”

“If that criticism of ICE makes you sad, here’s a proposal,” Bee continued. “Let’s shut it the fuck down. I’m serious. It’s awful. And we don’t actually need it. You know, I’m a liberal. I don’t usually advocate for smaller government, but in this case, as I say to my barista every morning, there should be one less ICE.”

Bee explained how ICE was set up following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks “when Islamophobia was as rampant as tube tops and Rudy Giuliani.”

But “by putting the anti-terrorism people in charge of immigration, the government signaled that immigrants are a threat,” Bee said, even though “ICE’s own figures show most immigrants in detention pose no threat to the public.”

Check out the clip above, then watch Bee’s earlier segment on the Trump administration’s pro-life stance below:EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt arrives to testify before a Senate panel on May 16. XXSTRINGERXX xxxxx / Reuters

In 1999, Scott Pruitt, then an Oklahoma state senator, introduced a bill to grant men “property rights” over unborn fetuses, requiring women to obtain the would-be father’s permission before aborting a pregnancy.

Pruitt, now the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, submitted the legislation again in 2005.

The bill, which did not pass either time, faded from Pruitt’s political legacy. But the legislation merits new examination as the EPA chief faces down an avalanche of corruption accusations. As HuffPost previously reported, Pruitt’s support from right-wing evangelical Christians, a group that largely opposes abortion, has helped him keep his job amid calls from droves of Democrats and a handful of Republicans to fire the administrator.

And while his current role atop the EPA does not give him any official control over abortion policy, he has appeared alongside President Donald Trump in meetings with evangelical leaders, and his draconian history on the issue is of a piece with the administration. In one of Trump’s first acts after taking office, he reinstated and expanded the Reagan-era “global gag rule,” withholding federal funding from charities and aid organizations that counsel women on family planning options that include abortion. Last week, the White House proposed a new “domestic gag rule” that would strip Planned Parenthood of funding.

“It’s not surprising that another member of Trump’s inner circle is hostile to women,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, a senior director at the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which opposes Pruitt and supports abortion rights. “But framing a fetus as a man’s property is a new low.”

American Bridge resurfaced the legislation and shared it with HuffPost. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

Pruitt has spent his 15 months at the EPA pushing to keep government out of the private sector. He’s sought to radically deregulate the fossil fuel and chemical industries, clear the way for companies to produce more asthma-triggering pollution, allow deadly chemicals to remain on the market, and revise restrictions on teenage workers handling dangerous pesticides.

By contrast, the bill from his time as a state legislator stated that “it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” referring to a “fetus” as “property” that has been “jointly created by both father and mother.”

The legislation would have barred doctors from performing abortions without signed statements of permission from the father, or evidence that the man could not be located “after diligent effort.” If the pregnancy resulted from rape, the woman would be required to show “such assault has been reported to a law enforcement agency having the requisite jurisdiction.”

Doctors who performed the procedure without that documentation would have risked losing their medical licenses, been “civilly liable to the father of the aborted child for any damages caused thereby,” and had to pay punitive fines of $5,000.

In a statement to The Associated Press in 1999, Pruitt said a pregnant woman who were to obtain an abortion without meeting the bill’s criteria would face legal consequences. “She’ll be held accountable for it,” Pruitt said.

Pruitt also sought to restrict abortion in other ways. In 2001, when the Legislature was considering a bill to require that pregnant minors show parental permission before obtaining an abortion, he introduced an amendment to define a “fetus” as “any individual human organism from fertilization until birth.”

“He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property.” - Leslie McGorman, NARAL Pro-Choice America

The timing of the bills came nearly a decade after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which it ruled that provisions requiring a woman to obtain her husband’s permission for an abortion were unconstitutional.

“He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property and also doesn’t believe in the intellectual concept that women should have agency over their own reproductive choices,” said Leslie McGorman, deputy director at the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Frankly there’s not a whole lot more to tell except that he is the guy who his record indicates he is.”

“He carries that lack of concern for the greater good throughout all of the things he’s done in his career,” she added, referring to his rollback of environmental safeguards.

Until 2017, Pruitt served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that has said “a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband. Around the time he first introduced the abortion bill, in 1999, Pruitt served on the board of the MEND Medical Clinic and Pregnancy Resource Center. Its current executive director, Forrest Cowan, has said unwed mothers have been “failed” by a “boyfriend, who values his own selfish gratification over responsibility, and her father, who should have had her back.”

Pruitt’s crusade against abortion rights continued after he left the state Senate to become Oklahoma’s attorney general. When a district court found a law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion to be unconstitutional, Pruitt appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. After losing there, he unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.If you thought President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel his planned summit with Kim Jong Un would go unnoticed by the Internet, you were sadly mistaken.

Once Twitter saw the letter Trump sent the North Korean dictator, people immediately began mercilessly mocking what they saw as a blatant effort to save face in the face of failure.

Finally, one man had words of advice ― not for Trump, but for journalists covering him.Sen. Roy Blunt helped negotiate a sexual harassment bill that civil rights groups are giving a big thumbs-down. Leah Millis / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― Civil rights groups contend a new Senate bill that is supposed to crack down on sexual harassers in Congress is full of problems and lets lawmakers off the hook too easily.

The bill, which quietly sailed through the Senate on Thursday, makes some needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing people claiming sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and an absurd 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court.

But the American Civil Liberties Union has “grave concerns” that the bill is still too weak to be effective. It narrowly defines sexual harassment as actions that are “severe or pervasive” and requires that such harassment be “unwanted” (suggesting an alleged harasser could defend himself by claiming “she wanted it”). It lets lawmakers hide past discrimination settlements they’ve paid for with taxpayer money. It does not provide legal representation to accusers, a measure that was included in a similar House-passed bill.

“Members of Congress should be held accountable for their discriminatory conduct, but instead this bill appears to provide numerous opportunities to evade responsibility, while also failing to offer Senate professional staff the same kind of legal counsel and support that members of Congress receive,” said Vania Leveille, the ACLU’s senior legislative counsel.

The ACLU, the National Women’s Law Center and other groups outlined their concerns in a Wednesday letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Read the letter here:

Letter from civil rights groups on Senate sexual harassment bill on Scribd

The Senate has had a much harder time overhauling sexual harassment policy than the House, which unanimously passed its bill in early February. Why? Some anonymous male GOP senators did not like a provision in the House bill requiring lawmakers to pay out-of-pocket when they settle a lawsuit accusing them of sexual harassment or discrimination.

After three months of inaction, Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) finally hashed out the current Senate bill this week. It passed Thursday on a voice vote.

Lead negotiators of the House bill also said the Senate plan does little to hold harassers accountable.

“Democrats and Republicans on the House side are disappointed,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Thursday on CNN.

“The House passed a very strong bill that protects the victim,” she said. “Hopefully we can iron out some of those differences, because in the end, the balance of power has always been with the harasser and the institution. We want to equalize that so that the victim has protections as well.”

Aides to Blunt and Klobuchar did respond to a request for comment.

The next step is likely a conference committee, which involves select lawmakers from the House and Senate going into a room and trying to agree on a final bill. House and Senate leaders will have to name those negotiators.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) is a plaintiff in a suit seeking to bar the Census Bureau from counting undocumented residents. Bloomberg / Getty Images

Alabama is suing the Trump administration to force the Census Bureau not to count undocumented people as part of the decennial tally used to determine how many seats in Congress each state gets.

The suit signals a continued conservative interest in changing the way the census counts immigrants. In a statement, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the plaintiffs in the suit, said apportionment should exclude immigrants and be based on only the citizen population. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) have made similar calls. Missouri lawmakers are considering legislation to base their state legislative districts based only on citizen population.

Last week the top official in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division said the Trump administration had “no position” on whether districts should be apportioned based solely on citizen population.

Every 10 years, the census counts all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, and that tally is used as the basis to figure out how many congressional seats each state gets. The 14th Amendment says congressional seats should be apportioned based on simply the number of “persons.”

But in a suit filed Tuesday in federal court in Alabama, Brooks and the state’s Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) argue that in the 18th and 19th centuries, the word “persons” would not have been understood to include undocumented people in the country. They argue that including undocumented immigrants in the count to determine congressional representation unfairly allows states with large undocumented populations to have inflated political representation. Alabama is projected to lose a congressional seat after the next census.

In March the Commerce Department announced it would add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census ― the first time it will do so on a decennial survey since 1950. Civil rights groups say including the question will drive down response rates among immigrant groups.

The results of the census have significant consequences; in addition to determining how many House seats each state gets, the count determines how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated.

The suit seeks to block a census rule directing the bureau to count citizens and foreign nationals in the United States at the address where they live or sleep most of the time. The plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the 14th Amendment “by robbing the people of the state of Alabama of their rightful share of political representation while systematically redistributing political powers to states with high numbers of illegal aliens and their citizens.”

Legal experts and historians cast doubt on the lawsuit’s foundational claim ― that the word “persons” was previously understood to exclude undocumented immigrants.

Franita Tolson, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a scholar of the 14th Amendment, said she was “unaware of any historical support” for Alabama’s argument. She said the legislative history surrounding the 14th Amendment shows that those who passed it understood the word “persons” to apply to those ineligible at the time to become citizens.

“To say that Alabama’s argument is a stretch is being overly generous,” she wrote in an email. “The text says ‘persons’ and the history illustrates that this term applies broadly.”

Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, noted that the founders added a clause to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution to prevent slaves from being counted as people for the purpose of determining how many congressional seats each state gets. If the Founding Fathers had intended to exclude people illegally in the United States, he said, they could have added a clause to explicitly say so.

Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, pointed to information on the website of United States Customs and Immigration Services noting that immigration in the 18th and 19th centuries was “relatively free and open.” It wasn’t until 1875 that the U.S. Supreme Court said the federal government had a responsibility to regulate immigration, and it wasn’t until 1880 that Congress began to enact immigration legislation.

“At the time of the Founding, there simply wasn’t a category of ‘undocumented’ immigrants,” she wrote in an email.

John Thompson, a former director of the Census Bureau, noted that there is no good way for the census to determine whether people are in the country legally. Census officials, he said, can’t simply walk up to people and ask them if they are legally in the United States and expect to get an accurate count.

The suit offers no method for the Census Bureau to count legal immigrants but exclude unauthorized residents.

Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Marshall, dismissed the practical concerns.

“It is important to know who is here both legally and illegally. Our lawsuit is only focused on the question of counting illegal immigrants in the apportionment portion of the census,” he said in a statement. “There are a variety of proposals that would allow the census to identify immigrants without legal status. We will address the appropriate remedy in the course of the litigation.”

Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues, said the case could go to the Supreme Court. He added that it was “fiction” that the Founding Fathers intended to exclude undocumented people from the census.
