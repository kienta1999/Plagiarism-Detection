George Clooney and wife Amal Clooney’s plan to march in support of the Florida high school shooting’s survivors has inspired Oprah to match their related donation of a half-million dollars.

The Clooneys released a joint statement on Tuesday to announce they will be in attendance at March for Our Lives on March 24 in Washington, D.C. The demonstration was organized by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to push for an end to gun violence in schools.

“Amal and I are so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women from Stoneman Douglas High School,” the couple said in a statement to Variety. “Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country.”

The two also pledged a donation dedicated to their twins, who were born last summer.

“In the name of our children Ella and Alexander, we’re donating $500,000 to help pay for this groundbreaking event. Our children’s lives depend on it,” they added.

Responding to the Clooneys’ announcement, Winfrey tweeted later Tuesday, “I couldn’t agree with you more” and pledged to match their $500,000 donation.

George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to ‘March For Our Lives.’ These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we’ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard. — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) February 20, 2018

Stoneman Douglas students, including Jaclyn Corin, Emma Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky, David Hogg and Alex Wind, have come together in the wake of the shooting to ask lawmakers to reform America’s gun laws and to “demand that their lives and safety become a priority and that we end gun violence and mass shootings in our schools today.”

Celebrities like Lady Gaga, Zendaya and Justin Bieber have also expressed their support of the march on social media, with some communicating directly with the survivors.

Parkland Survivors and others that are standing up through the media are so brave and are true role models. I’m speechless at their courage. And so proud that these kids and young adults are our future. #GunControl #ParklandStudents The question now is will our leaders listen. — Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) February 19, 2018

Cameron good talking to you last night. All of your bravery is amazing. I stand with you guys. #march24 #marchforourlives https://t.co/oKG8MmhzaI — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) February 18, 2018

The Clooneys previously opened their wallets following the violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August. The couple donated $1 million to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that works to protect civil rights and combat hate groups.

At the time, President Donald Trump said protesters on “both sides” of the conflict in Charlottesville were to blame for the situation.

“Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality,” George Clooney said at the time. “There are no two sides to bigotry and hate.”Plastic bag adrift in ocean. ullstein bild via Getty Images

The pollution of oceans with plastic litter, discarded nylon fishing nets and eco-toxic microbeads is well known as one of the great scourges of the modern age ― not just entangling and choking endangered, charismatic species like sea turtles, dolphins and even great whales, but attracting long-lived organic pollutants that end up permeating the entire marine food chain, right up to the fish on our plates.

Less well known is that all this ocean plastic is illegal.

​Numerous international and regional treaties, conventions and other agreements impose binding obligations on countries to protect the oceans, their wildlife and their ecosystems from pollution. That includes pollution originating on land, like plastic bottles, shopping bags, crisp packets, cigarette lighters and cellophane wrappers.

But there is one great problem with international law: The commitments may be solemn and legally binding, but they are hard to uphold. There is no police force or prosecutor tasked with their enforcement. Only state parties to a treaty have the power to raise disputes against other parties, and they are generally reluctant to do so, for understandable reasons. They do not wish to disrupt harmonious diplomatic relations with their neighbors; they may fear the potential costs; and few governments are so perfect themselves as to have no worry of being at the receiving end of similar treatment.

As a result,​ states that disregard their legal obligations to protect the marine environment from ocean plastic and other assaults are not quaking in their boots. Even though they could in principle be hauled up before the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea, which has the power to apply substantial penalties, costs and reparations against offending parties, they see no immediate prospect that his might actually happen. And they are almost certainly right.

That does not mean there is nothing to be done. On the contrary, naming and shaming is a powerful weapon for change. No government likes to be denounced for breaches of international law and other binding promises. Ocean plastic campaigners​ around the world can use the moral force of international law to pressure governments to fulfill environmental commitments, enter into compliance, and take serious action to drastically reduce plastic pollution to oceans.

The countries most responsible for marine plastic pollution should be at least a little worried. All it would take​ to establish that international law really does have teeth​ is a single small state whose beaches, tourism or fisheries are suffering from a tide of waste plastic to take legal action against countries where it is coming from. And while such a state may be fearful of acting on its own, if backed by a wider coalition like the Association Of Small Island States and supported by a union of conservation NGOs and civil society, that could very well change as the volume and impact of marine plastic​s increase.

And change is what we desperately need ― to stop the flow of plastic into our seas, currently estimated at some 8.8 millions tons a year​; to save all the wondrous creatures and precious ecosystems the plastic tide is propelling into extinction; and to restore the wider health of our oceans, and the totality of life on Earth.

Russell Tovey is officially off the market.

The British-born “Quantico” and “Looking” star says he is “very, very happy” after getting engaged to boyfriend Steve Brockman.

Details of the proposal are scarce, but Tovey told the Daily Mail Monday it was “completely unexpected,” and that he and Brockman were “looking forward to having a proper party to celebrate when back in London.”

A post shared by Steve Brockman (@steve_the_brockman) on Dec 9, 2017 at 11:08am PST

Brockman, a rugby player who has played with the gay-inclusive rugby union club Kings Cross Steelers, is believed to have relocated to New York to be with Tovey. The actor films “Quantico” in and around the city, and also starred in the 2015 revival of “A View from the Bridge” on Broadway.

The pair have been mostly tight-lipped about their relationship, with the exception of the occasional Instagram post. They also walked the red carpet hand-in-hand at the Elton John AIDS Foundation’s 25th anniversary gala in November 2017.

A post shared by Steve Brockman (@steve_the_brockman) on Oct 22, 2017 at 5:42pm PDT

Tovey hinted at being in the “very early days” of a new relationship in a 2016 interview with the Evening Standard, noting only that his boyfriend, whom he didn’t identify by name, wasn’t “in the [entertainment] business” at all.

At the time, he also spoke of his interest in tying the knot one day, as well as having children.

“Totally, 100 per cent I will do it, when the time is right,” he said. “Yeah, all of it. But I’ve got my dog at the minute — he’s my everything, my sun and my moon and my mate.”narvikk via Getty Images

If you’re looking for some wanderlust inspiration for your next getaway, look no further.

TripAdvisor just released its list of the 10 most popular experiences in the world. Reviewing booking data from the past year, researchers were able to predict this year’s top tourism trends and what inspires the global traveler.

Researchers concluded that historic and iconic sights, from Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia to St. Peter’s Sistine Chapel, were amongst the top most desired bookings. In fact, historic and heritage experiences saw an increase in bookings by 125 percent over the past year.

While Chicago and New York City were the only US cities that made it to Trip Advisor’s top ten list, experiences in cities like Rome and towns outside Venice were repetitively listed. Rome bookings, for example, claimed three spots in the ranking.The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December and its future had been uncertain.

Its first term was marred by two high-profile resignations, that of Marie Collins of Ireland and Peter Saunders of Britain. Both were victims of clergy sexual abuse when they were young and both stepped down in what they said was frustration over lack of change and insufficient cooperation by top Vatican officials.

A Vatican statement said victims of sexual abuse were among the members but that it was up to them to decide to disclose this outside the 16-member international commission, made up of nine new members and seven returning ones.

It said plans were at an advanced stage to create a group made up of victims of sexual abuse known as the International Survivor Advisory Panel (ISAP) to offer consultation on “abuse prevention from the survivor’s perspective”.LONDON (Reuters) - The wreckage of an Iranian plane that crashed with 65 people on board was found in central Iran, state media said on Monday, but aviation authorities could not confirm the report.

The Aseman Airlines flight from Tehran disappeared from radar screens on Sunday 50 minutes into its journey to the southwestern city of Yasuj. It is believed to have gone down in a mountainous area near the town of Semirom.

No one is expected to have survived.

The deputy governor of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province was quoted by state media as saying the wreckage was found near Dengezlu city, in Semirom county, in Isfahan province.

A few minutes later, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation said it could not confirm the wreckage had been discovered.

“We are facing a total enigma. We do not know anything about the crash,” Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency shortly after his arrival in Semirom.

Iran asked European countries and China to help the search with satellite imagery, Iranian Space Agency deputy head Mojtaba Saradeghi was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency.

A member of the Red Crescent rescue team was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency that “a dark spot” had been seen near Dengezlu village that “might be a trace to the crashed plane.”

ISNA did not elaborate.

Iceland is considering legislation that would make it the first European country to outlaw male circumcision in children.

The bill proposes up to six years imprisonment for anyone who performs a circumcision on a child that is not for medical reasons, The Guardian reported on Sunday. European religious leaders say the restriction would impinge upon religious freedoms.

Male circumcision is commonly practiced by Jews and Muslims. In some countries, including the U.S., male circumcision is popular across religions and ethnicities, for health and cultural reasons. The World Health Organization estimated in 2009 that about one in three men globally is circumcised.

Male circumcision is “a non-negotiable element of Jewish identity,” a spokesman for Milah UK, a Jewish campaign group, told The Guardian, adding that Iceland’s proposed ban is “extremely concerning.”

Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the Catholic Church in the European Union, called the proposal a “dangerous attack” on religious freedom.

“Protecting the health of children is a legitimate goal of every society, but in this case this concern is instrumentalized, without any scientific basis, to stigmatize certain religious communities,” Marx said last week, according to the Catholic News Agency. “This is extremely worrying.”

The bill reportedly has strong public support. Advocates say circumcision violates the rights and bodily integrity of children. Silja Dögg Gunnarsdóttir, a member of parliament from the center-right Progressive Party, said she proposed the bill after realizing there were no restrictions on male circumcision in Iceland, even though female circumcision was outlawed in 2005.

“I see it as a child protection matter,” Gunnarsdóttir told Euronews. “In Iceland we acknowledge the right to believe but we also acknowledge the right and freedom of everyone to choose and have their opinions.”

She added: “I stand by that and I say people should be allowed to have their beliefs for themselves but you have to draw the line when it’s about other people. Children should also have their own rights for their own beliefs when they are adults.”

The bill says people who want to be circumcised for religious or cultural reasons can do so once they are old enough to “understand what is involved in such an action.” The age of consent for the procedure isn’t explicitly stated.

The potential health benefits of the practice have also been hotly debated.

Following a comprehensive review of scientific literature, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded in 2012 that there were “health benefits of newborn male circumcision,” such as lower risks of acquiring HIV, genital herpes, and penile cancer, and that these benefits “outweigh the risks.”Thirty-five years ago today, Michael Jackson took the stage and made an indelible impact on pop culture with his solo performance on “Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever,” a televised celebration of the famous label’s creation.

The May 16, 1983 broadcast was produced and directed by Don Mischer, who has helped orchestrate other historic moments over the years, including the opening ceremony for the 1996 Olympic Games, where Muhammad Ali made a surprise appearance; Prince’s iconic 2007 “Purple Rain” Super Bowl halftime show; and many Oscar ceremonies (not, thankfully for him, 2017’s Envelopegate).

Mischer spoke to Yahoo Entertainment about working with Jackson and having a front-row seat to one of the most exciting and innovative performances of all time.

Since Motown 25 was intended to showcase the label’s greatest hits, Mischer and executive producer Suzanne de Passe initially banned every artist (from Marvin Gaye to the Temptations to Diana Ross) from performing new material. Jackson pushed back, wanting to perform a solo song called “Billie Jean.” Mischer recalls the tense moment: “Look, if we let Michael do a new song, who’s going to take the phone call from Marvin Gaye on Monday saying, ‘Why did you let Michael do a new song and I couldn’t do a new song?’”

But that delicate game of politics was upended when Mischer witnessed Jackson’s rehearsal for his “Billie Jean” performance. “I think Linda Ronstadt was there, Smokey Robinson was there, Diana Ross was there, but the place was empty basically,” Mischer said. “So we watched ‘Billie Jean’ for the first time, the whole thing, the hat, the socks, the moonwalk — after that was over, we just knew this was incredibly special.”

Mischer and de Passe ended up letting Jackson perform “Billie Jean,” with Mischer volunteering to take the call from a presumably ticked-off Marvin Gaye on Monday.

For those not alive in 1983 or who may misremember the performance, Jackson’s actual moonwalk was surprisingly brief: It lasted only two and a half seconds. There are a few yelps of approval from the fans in the audience, but that moment in itself didn’t bring down the house. Like most myths, it has evolved exponentially over the years.

A couple of weeks later, Mischer began to edit the concert together. Jackson visited him to decide on what shots of his performance he wanted. “He had very clear creative ideas about what he wanted and how he wanted to see himself portrayed,” said Mischer. “There were times we disagreed about a shot or something, but I always deferred to him … I trusted his judgment.”

But while Jackson might have been an outsized presence onstage, he was the exact opposite in Mischer’s editing bay. “He was always quiet … he was a very quiet, shy human being,” Mischer said. “He would come into a room and just go into a corner. He would whisper to people. [But] when he got onstage, he was like a general.”

Ultimately, Jackson was happy with “Motown 25.” Mischer says that after it aired, he got a signed photo saying “Thanks for the magic moment.” And the rest of the country shared in that sentiment. Mischer says that days later, he was at the White House to film a Barbara Walters interview with Nancy Reagan. As he recalls, “Coming down the elevator [of the hotel], everybody’s talking about Michael. In the taxicab going to the White House, everybody was talking about Michael. In the East Wing [of the White House] … everybody’s talking about Motown 25 and Michael.”He continued, “We do these kinds of things and we never know how people are going to react, but that morning in Washington … suddenly I said to myself, ‘This show really had an incredible impact.’”

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki is attempting to make amends after delivering a controversial statement on Saturday that suggested “Jewish perpetrators” bore some responsibility for the Holocaust.

Morawiecki is now trying to make it clear that he is not a Holocaust revisionist, according to The Washington Post.

“The Holocaust, the genocide of the Jews committed by the German Nazis, was a horrific crime. Even during those dark hours of war and murder, there were individuals of all nations who bravely carried out gestures of the greatest mercy,” Morawiecki tweeted on Sunday. “Sadly, this period also exposed dark parts of human nature, which for some meant collaboration with German Nazis. Dialogue on these difficult chapters of our history is essential.”

Morawiecki’s tweets came after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had labeled Morawiecki’s original statement “outrageous.”

During the call, the Israeli leader reportedly told his Polish counterpart that “there was no basis for comparing the actions of Poles during the Holocaust to those of Jews,” according to Netanyahu’s office.

The Polish government told Reuters that Morawiecki’s comments were not intended to deny the Holocaust or claim that Jewish victims were responsible for “Nazi German-perpetrated genocide.”

Morawiecki’s troubles began during a panel on Saturday at the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, when he was questioned about Poland’s controversial Holocaust complicity bill. The measure seeks to punish people for suggesting that Poland collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. Using phrases like “Polish death camp” to refer to concentration camps that were located in the country during the Holocaust could result in fines or up to three years of jail time.

Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, the son of two Holocaust survivors, told Morawiecki that during the Holocaust, his mother’s Polish neighbors attempted to betray Jewish families who were in hiding to the Nazis.

“If I understand correctly, after this law is legislated ... I would be considered criminal for saying this,” Bergman told the Polish leader. He then asked, “What is the purpose? What is the message you’re trying to convey to the world?”

Morawiecki responded that “it’s extremely important to first understand that of course it’s not going to be punishable, not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators as well as Ukrainian perpetrators — not only German perpetrators.”

He added that many Polish families helped to hide Jews from the Nazis, and that there were many Polish victims of the war, as well.

“There were Polish perpetrators,” Morawiecki said, “But we cannot agree with mixing perpetrators with victims, because this would be first of all an offense to all the Jews and all the Poles who suffered greatly during the second World War.”

He took exception to the phrases “Polish death camps” and “Polish concentration camps.”

“Well, ladies and gentlemen, there were no Polish death camps. ... There were German Nazi death camps.”

Watch the exchange below.

Nazi ideology deemed Poles as racially inferior, according to The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). Nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians were killed by the Nazis, while millions of others were imprisoned or deported as forced laborers.

Thousands of Poles did in fact choose to help Jewish families survive the Holocaust. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust remembrance center, has recognized over 6,600 non-Jewish Poles with the distinction “Righteous Among the Nations” for saving Jews.

But many other Poles did collaborate with the Nazis. The USHMM said that the Nazis called on Polish police and railroad personnel to help guard Jewish ghettos and deport people to death camps. Individual Poles also helped identify Jewish families in hiding, or plundered their property.

According to the USHMM, there were some Jewish leaders who were forced to help the Nazis implement anti-Jewish policies. The Nazis formed local councils known as Judenrat to ensure that their orders were carried out. Before “liquidating” a Jewish ghetto, for example, the Nazis would ask the Judenrat to give them a list of Jewish residents for deportation.

Some Jewish leaders who refused to cooperate were killed by the Nazis. Others complied under duress, hoping that it would keep at least a portion of the population alive.

The Holocaust ultimately killed about 90 percent of Poland’s Jewish population, more than 3 million people.

The actions of the Judenrat must be examined in context, according to Havi Dreifuss, a professor of history at Tel Aviv University. Dreifuss told Haaretz that the phenomenon of Jews collaborating with Nazis was “marginal,” but the hostility of most Poles towards their Jewish neighbors was the “norm.”

In addition, she said, there’s a difference in motive.Danielle Cameranesi. right, of the U.S. celebrates scoring a goal against Finland during the women's ice hockey semifinal on February 19, 2018 at the Winter Olympics. She scored two goals against Finland. Grigory Dukor/Reuters

Team USA now progresses to the final, where it will meet either Canada or the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) to battle for gold.

The U.S. lost to arch-rival Canada 2-1 last Thursday in a nail-biter of a game. The team fared better against OAR, convincingly outscoring the Russians 5-0 last Tuesday.

This is the third Winter Olympics in a row that the U.S. women’s ice hockey team has made it to the finals. The U.S. clinched the silver medal at both the 2010 and 2014 games held in Vancouver and Sochi, respectively. Canada has been the Olympic champ for the past four consecutive Winter Games.

The last time the U.S. women’s team won Olympic gold was in Nagano in 1998. That year, Canada took silver.

If the two North American rivals meet in the final, a thriller of a game should be expected. Canada and OAR will play on Monday night in the semi-final.

AdvertisementAhead of the March premiere of the “Roseanne” reboot, 20/20 delved into the show’s past, including John Goodman’s original audition for the role of Dan Connor. Goodman was already a seasoned actor with dozens of credits to his name, including classics such as “Revenge of the Nerds” and “Raising Arizona,” but he wasn’t too familiar with Roseanne Barr.

“All I knew about Roseanne Barr, that she was a rising comedian and she was on a Pizza Hut commercial,” Goodman said. “That’s the only time I’d ever seen her.”

Goodman said he and Barr hit it off from the beginning and made each other laugh. He felt he had the job as soon as he left the audition — and he was right. Producer Tom Werner said they never even considered anyone else for the role. Barr also knew immediately that Goodman was the man for the job.

“We kind of bonded over making each other laugh, and he has a working-class background too — so I knew he was the guy,” Barr said. “As soon as I read with him, I knew we had a hit show.”

“Roseanne” premieres March 27th at 8 p.m. on ABC.

A new event debuted at the 2018 Winter Olympics, and it’s filled with all of the most spectacular parts of the Games.

Big jumps, incredible skill, high-flying acrobatics and the ever-present danger of massive crashes and catastrophe ― snowboard big air is an absolute adrenaline rush.

There’s already been a number of snowboarding events at the Winter Olympics, with Team USA’s Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson medaling in slopestyle, and Chloe Kim and Shaun White winning the halfpipe events. Big air, while already a highlight of the X Games, is a new addition to the Winter Olympics, making its debut in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The event consists of one massive jump, with competitors starting at the top of an 160-foot ramp before hurtling down and trying to land their most spectacular trick. With such an enormous ramp ― in Pyeongchang, they need an elevator to get to the top of the jump ― the boarders manage some serious air time, throwing down multiple flips and spins as they leap up to 100 feet in the air.

Snowboard big air debuted at the Winter Olympics on Monday with the women’s qualification rounds. Each competitor gets two jumps, and judges score their tricks. Riders advance based on their single best score. Slopestyle gold medallist Jamie Anderson scored 90 points, placing her sixth in the 26-woman field, while Japanese riders Yuka Fujimori and Reira Iwabuchi and Canada’s Laurie Blouin also impressed. Austrian world champion Anna Gasser blitzed the competition however, scoring an incredible 98 points.

“I was so excited when big air was added to the Olympics,” Gasser told ESPN. “People are going to like it because it’s spectacular and exciting.”

The first qualification round delivered everything expected, from incredible flips, unbelievable landings and even some crashes. Australian rider Jess Rich is competing after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in her knee ― usually a debilitating and season-ending injury for any athlete ― just a month ago.

Check out some footage from the event’s debut in Pyeongchang below, and tune in for the men’s qualifying on Wednesday, the women’s final on Friday, and the men’s final on Saturday.

The Cleveland Cavaliers star arrived at the NBA All-Star Game at Staples Center in Los Angeles wearing a pair of white Nike sneakers with the words “More Than An Athlete” emblazoned on them.

James shared a shot of his shoes in an Instagram story Sunday afternoon with a “FACTS” hashtag and the “100” emoji.

Reacting to the interview, Ingraham told the athletes to “shut up and dribble” and to “keep the political commentary to yourself.”

James and Durant, however, were having none of it. Durant told USA Today that Ingraham’s comments were “racist” and that while he does “play basketball, I am a civilian and ... a citizen of the United States, so my voice is just as loud as hers ― or even louder”

James stressed on Saturday that he would “definitely not shut up and dribble.”

“So, thank you, whatever her name is. ... I get to sit up here and talk about what’s really important and how I can help change kids,” James said at a media session following the All-Star Game practice in Los Angeles.

“I mean too much to society, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don’t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they’re in,” he added.

Ingraham defended her remarks in a statement sent via a Fox spokesperson. “If pro athletes and entertainers want to freelance as political pundits, then they should not be surprised when they’re called out for insulting politicians,” she said. “There was no racial intent in my remarks ― false, defamatory charges of racism are a transparent attempt to immunize entertainment and sports elites from scrutiny and criticism.”

This isn’t the first time James has used his shoes to make a strong statement. Last year, he wore sneakers with the word “Equality” embroidered in gold to at least two games.

Explaining his decision to wear the shoes at a December game in Washington, D.C., James suggested he was wearing them in protest of Trump’s divisive words and policies.

“We’re not going to let one person dictate us, us as Americans, how beautiful and how powerful we are as a people,” he said at the time. “Equality is all about understanding our rights, understanding what we stand for and how powerful we are as men and women, black or white or Hispanic. It doesn’t matter your race, whatever the case may be.”Jonathan Drake / Reuters

The mass shooting of high school students is still seemingly enough to shock Americans and spur an uptick in concern about gun violence, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.

Sixty percent of Americans currently believe gun violence is a very serious problem facing the country, up from 53 percent last November and a record high in HuffPost/YouGov polling since late 2015. Just 22 percent currently say mass shootings are an unstoppable “fact of life in America today,” down from a record 37 percent last October, following the slaughter in Las Vegas.

And a 48 percent plurality of Americans say that members of Congress should take action to try to reduce mass shootings, while just a third believe mass shootings cannot be reduced through legislation. In three surveys last fall, Americans were close to evenly split between those two options.

Whether that change will last, let alone prove an impetus to political action, remains very much up in the air.

Some of the apparent shift may simply be due to normal fluctuations in polling. Other questions show less movement: the 54 percent majority who currently favor making gun laws more strict is well within the 48-to-55-percent range where it’s been in HuffPost/YouGov polls over the last few years.

Americans also remain roughly split on whether it’s politically possible to pass any new gun control laws. And just 16 percent rate gun policies as among their top concerns.

Still, the increase in concern about mass shootings and the desire for legislative action shown in the new poll represent more movement than was apparent in three HuffPost/YouGov polls taken at the end of last year. Those surveys were taken in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre and, barely more than a month later, a mass shooting at a Texas church. As we wrote at the time:

Mass shootings in America rarely lead to political change, but they often do result in a brief spike in support for gun control. But as new polling suggests, with opinions on the topic starkly divided along political lines, it’s not clear whether two of the most recent high-profile shootings did anything to change people’s minds. In the past two months, HuffPost polled opinions on gun control three times: immediately after the Las Vegas shooting at the beginning of October; toward the end of the month, when it had largely faded from the news; and in early November, following the Texas church shooting. It’s possible that the nation is now sufficiently numbed that such tragedies are no longer sufficient to provide a jolt to public opinion; it’s also possible that the fallow time between high-profile shootings has been so brief that opinions never had time to go down from their heightened state. Either way, the consistency on many of the questions asked is notable.

Views remain marked by the deep political divides that have characterized public opinion on guns dating back to the beginning of Barack Obama’s presidency. Ninety percent of Hillary Clinton voters favor stricter gun laws, as do 52 percent of non-voters and third-party voters, but they’re joined by just 21 percent of those who backed President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

Clinton voters are 53 percentage points likelier than Trump voters to consider gun violence a “very serious” national issue, 44 points likelier to say it’s possible to enact new gun regulations while maintaining Americans’ right to bear arms and 63 points likelier to favor congressional action to help prevent mass shootings.

Last week’s Florida school shooting that claimed 17 lives galvanized some of its teen survivors, a group of whom who are planning a nationwide march to demand action on gun violence.

“This isn’t about the GOP. This isn’t about the Democrats. This is about the adults,” Cameron Kasky, a junior at the high school, told ABC. “We feel neglected. At this point, you’re either with us or you’re against us.”

The new poll doesn’t include non-adults. But it finds that younger adults, by most metrics, aren’t especially focused on gun control issues. Just 15 percent of adults under age 30 cite gun policies as a top issue, and just half favor stricter gun laws. One number, however, suggests more support among young adults for action: 56 percent believe members of Congress should work to reduce mass shootings, up from 39 percent last November.

The poll also doesn’t ask about specific proposals for new gun policies, many of which garner far greater support than the overall concept of gun regulation. In a survey taken in 2016, more than 80 percent of voters backed universal background checks, as well as preventing the sale of firearms to people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list, those who’ve been been reported as dangerous by a mental health provider, or who’ve been convicted of stalking or of violent misdemeanors like domestic assault.

According to the White House, Trump has signalled interest in a bipartisan proposal that seeks to address flaws in the national criminal background check database.

But rather than throwing his support behind an effort to expand and toughen background checks on those buying firearms, the White House appeared to be signaling its interest in a more modest bipartisan proposal introduced last fall by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).

The bill, titled the Fix NICS Act, seeks to address flaws in the national criminal background check database that were exposed after the Texas church shooting in November. It would require states to produce an implementation plan focused on uploading all gun purchaser information to the background check system, and hold federal agencies accountable if they fail to record it.

The legislation has support from both gun control advocates and the National Rifle Association ― a rarity in the nation’s divisive gun control debate ― but it has yet to receive a vote in the Senate. House Republicans, meanwhile, paired the bill with a separate, more conservative measure in December that would force states to allow people to carry concealed guns in public.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that Trump spoke to Cornyn on Friday about the bill, which she said would “improve federal compliance with criminal background check legislation.”

Murphy said in a tweet on Monday that Trump’s willingness to look at the issue of background checks is “another sign the politics of gun violence are shifting rapidly.” But, the fierce gun control advocate added, lawmakers still need to do far more to address the problem.

Interesting morning. Two quick thoughts: 1/ Trump's support for the FixNICS Act, my bill with @JohnCornyn, is another sign the politics of gun violence are shifting rapidly. 2/ No one should pretend this bill alone is an adequate response to this epidemic. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 19, 2018

Trump is expected to hold a listening session with high school students this week following the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The community is less than an hour away from the president’s luxury golf club, where he spent the weekend and reportedly polled members on whether he ought to champion gun control measures in the wake of the massacre.

A number of Parkland students who survived the shooting have been outspoken in their calls for stricter gun legislation in the wake of Friday’s shooting, pleading with lawmakers to take action to address gun violence. One group is even organizing a nationwide march next month to demand lawmakers make ending gun violence a priority.

The White House has not yet said whether the president’s listening session with students will include any Parkland teens.

In his only tweet about the shooting over the weekend, Trump criticized the FBI for missing many signals sent out by the suspect and alleged that the Russia investigation had left the agency unable to prevent the shooting.

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018GANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Russian athletes and sports officials voiced disbelief on Monday that one of their Winter Games medallists was being investigated for suspected doping, a scandal that could imperil Russia’s efforts to regain full Olympic status.

Alexander Krushelnitsky, who competes in curling, one of the Games’ least physically taxing sports, is suspected of testing positive for meldonium, a banned substance that increases blood flow and improves exercise capacity.

“It’s stupid, but Alexander is not stupid, so I don’t believe it,” Russian women’s curling coach Sergei Belanov said.

He echoed a general bewilderment among curling athletes who could not fathom why anyone would use drugs that aid endurance in a sport that is a kind of chess on ice, needing steady hands and concentration rather than physical fitness.

Krushelnitsky, who won bronze with his wife Anastasia Bryzgalova in mixed-doubles curling in Pyeongchang, has not responded to a request for comment.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has launched a doping procedure against him, but no hearing date has been fixed.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call in Moscow that it was too early to draw conclusions about the ongoing probe.

Russian delegation spokesman Konstantin Vybornov told Reuters that Krushelnitsky had surrendered his Games accreditation and left the Olympic village while awaiting the result of a second sample later on Monday.

The suspected doping violation has come at a delicate time for Russia which is trying to draw a line under years of drug-cheating scandals and is competing at Pyeongchang as neutral athletes, unable to use their own flag or national symbols.

“We were all shocked when we found out yesterday. Of course we very much hope it was some kind of mistake,” Russian curler Viktoria Moiseeva told reporters, adding that the team believed Krushelnitsky was innocent.

“With us it’s not faster, higher, stronger; it’s about being more accurate. I can’t imagine what kind of drugs you could use in curling ... so it’s very hard to believe.”

FLAG BAN

Russia has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies. As a result, its athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR).

Russia’s curling federation told Reuters on Monday it had launched an internal investigation of the doping case.

“The federation is now creating an emergency commission in which all information will be investigated and verified. We know that our athlete is not guilty,” federation president Dmitry Svishchev said.

He had earlier said that Russian curlers were tested on Jan. 22 before arriving in South Korea and the tests were negative.

Moiseeva said it would be dreadful if the case hurt Russia’s chances of regaining full Olympic status for future Games.

“It’s a catastrophe, if it’s not just one Olympics but others too - it will throw sport in our country into turmoil. It’s awful just to think about, to be honest.”

The Russians had been hoping that a clean record at Pyeongchang would persuade the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow them to march at the closing ceremony on Feb. 25 with the Russian flag and in national uniform.

The IOC said on Monday that any doping violation would be decided by CAS and that a decision would come very quickly after analysis of a B sample.

If confirmed, the violation would be considered by the IOC’s OAR Implementation panel, the body in charge of monitoring the OAR team’s behavior at the Games.

“REALLY SAD”

“I hope it’s not true ... for the sport of curling,” said Norwegian skipper Thomas Ulsrud, whose team would stand to pick up the bronze if the doping result is confirmed.

“If it’s true I feel really sad for the Norwegian team who worked really hard and ended up in fourth place and just left for Norway and they aren’t even here.”

The World Anti-Doping Agency banned meldonium with effect from January 2016, deeming it performance-enhancing because it enabled users to carry more oxygen to muscle tissue, something of benefit to endurance athletes in particular.Rick Gates, the former deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump, will cooperate with Robert Mueller's investigation, The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. Aaron P. Bernstein via Getty Images

Rick Gates, a former campaign aide to President Donald Trump, will plead guilty to charges related to fraud and is willing to testify against his longtime business partner, Paul Manafort, The Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday.

Manafort, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist, served as Trump’s campaign manager during part of the 2016 presidential race.

Speculation has grown for weeks that Gates would cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing inquiry into Russian meddling in the presidential election. Gates, who served as Trump’s deputy campaign manager, was indicted in October along with Manafort on charges ranging from money laundering to violations of foreign lobbying laws. He pleaded not guilty to all charges at the time, which carry 10 years or more in potential sentences.

The plea will reportedly change in the coming days, and Gates will likely serve about 18 months in prison in exchange for his cooperation, the Times reported.

“Rick Gates is going to change his plea to guilty,″ a source familiar with the case told the outlet.

The Mueller probe has flipped two other high-profile Trump associates in recent months ― former national security adviser Michael Flynn and foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. Both men have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about their contacts with Russian officials and have been cooperating with the investigation for months.

Gates’ lawyers have been negotiating with Mueller’s legal team for weeks, CNN reported on Saturday. According to the outlet, the special counsel’s team was finalizing a deal after Gates was allowed to give what’s known as a “Queen for a Day” interview, which typically allows a defendant to speak openly about their knowledge of an investigation without facing additional charges.

Gates could play a pivotal role in a trial against Manafort, who has stood by his own not guilty plea following the October indictment. A source told the Times that Gates’ cooperation would be a “cherry on top” of the case.

A White House official told CNN the Trump administration wasn’t worried about Gates’ cooperation with Mueller, as the president believed the flip was arranged to get more information against Manafort.

The Justice Department announced a sweeping set of charges against 13 Russians and three Russian entities on Friday, detailing a sophisticated campaign to sow discord among U.S. voters in the presidential election and in the process help elect Trump.

The president, who in the past has dismissed the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax,” again insisted after the indictments that his campaign did not collude with Russians during the race for the White House.

His current national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said at a meeting Saturday in Germany that the indictments provided “incontrovertible” evidence that Russia interfered in the election.French Alpine skier Mathieu Faivre is seen during the Alpine Skiing Men's Giant Slalom on Sunday.

French Alpine skier Mathieu Faivre has been sent home from the 2018 Winter Olympics after he suggested that he didn’t care about his teammates and was “here to race for myself only.”

The 26-year-old, who is dating Olympic women’s giant slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. team, made the controversial comments to a reporter after finishing seventh in the men’s giant slalom in Pyeongchang on Sunday. Three of his countrymen placed above him in the event, including bronze medalist Alexis Pinturault.

Faivre, who won gold in the team event at last year’s World Championships, was asked by a reporter how he felt about French skiers filling four of the top seven spots, Agence France-Presse reported.

Faivre was quoted as saying he was “disgusted with the result” and “I’m here to race for myself only.”

“If you only knew what I think about the group collective,” Faivre said. “I felt I was skiing well in the second run but when I saw where I’d finished, it was like a slap in the face.”

David Chastan, the director for the French men’s skiing program, confirmed to AFP on Monday that Faivre was sent home.

“Mathieu will return to France for disciplinary reasons,” Chastan told the news agency. “He made remarks after the race that were not in the spirit of the team and will not be retained for the team event.”

That team event is scheduled for Saturday.

Faivre has since issued an apology on Facebook, saying he meant no disrespect to anyone.

“Skiing is an individual sport that is practiced as a team. However, when we are in the starting gate, only our individual race and our own performance are important,” Faivre posted. “So yes, when it came time to give my feelings on my race, 10 minutes after crossing the finish line, only my performance and failure were present.”

Faivre has been dating Shiffrin, 22, since last summer. She recently told Us Weekly that because of the distance between them ― with Faivre living in France and Shiffrin in Colorado ― it’s been difficult for them to see each other.

Faivre was photographed congratulating her shortly after her big win last week.Pros and cons of being neighbors with Hilary Duff? If you’re nice enough, she might do that “You’re watching the Disney Channel” promo upon request.

But if you cross her, she’ll call you out on social media, rallying her millions of followers to set you straight.

The “Younger” star apparently has been feuding with a neighbor for some time, and tensions boiled over on Tuesday night. Duff aired her frustration on Instagram.

“Calling all New Yorkers with asshole neighbors. Really open to any advice you have,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories. “My neighbor smokes cigarettes and weed all night long. My apartment reeks. Seriously, what do I do?”

i'm screaming at hilary duff dragging the fuck out of her neighbor pic.twitter.com/EnJgPwoZ1t — ♢ (@luvintothelight) May 16, 2018

Apparently, her solution was to drag her neighbor by name on social media.

“We know your parents pay your rent. We know you’ve never worked a day in your life ― must be nice,” Duff said. “Have some respect for your neighbors who work hard to live in that building. Don’t be a dick dude ― and put your trash down the chute.”

Duff said she returned home from a 15-hour workday, but got no sleep that night because of the neighbor’s antics.

Hilary Duff

She drew cat faces on his profile picture, seemingly to taunt him to respond. Before she signed off, Duff slung a few more jabs at her neighbor, who she accused of “breaking all your furniture when you fight with your girlfriend or boyfriend.”

“It scares me and my kid,” wrote Duff, who has a 6-year-old son. “Therapy is cheaper.”

As for smoking, the former Disney Channel star advised her neighbor: “Get a vape.”

UPDATE: 5:45 p.m. ― Addison denies smoking pot at all and said he is hiring lawyers to deal with the fallout of Duff’s posts, according to a Page Six report.Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has scrapped plans for a business trip to Israel previously scheduled for this week, an agency official said.

News of the decision came roughly a week after The Washington Post reported on Pruitt’s expensive air travel habits, prompting criticism from government ethics watchdogs. The EPA head regularly flies business or first class, which often costs American taxpayers thousands of dollars more than equivalent seats in coach, according the report.

Pruitt had been scheduled to arrive in Israel on Sunday and planned to learn about the country’s sustainability efforts in Jerusalem and the port city of Haifa, according to the Post. But EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told HuffPost that the trip had been called off.

“We decided to postpone; the administrator looks forward to going in the future,” Bowman said in an email. She did not comment on why the trip was canceled.

EPA receipts obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project through Freedom of Information Act requests showed Pruitt and his staffers racked up at least $90,000 worth of taxpayer-funded travel expenses in early June alone.

During an interview last week with the New Hampshire Union Leader, Pruitt said he was not involved with bookings related to his travel and noted that his security team and chief of staff made those types of decisions.

The EPA’s Office of Criminal Enforcement told Politico that Pruitt’s security team recommended he book first or business class to avoid confrontations with his critics at airports or on airplanes.

“The team leader felt that he was being placed in a situation where he was unsafe on the flight,” Henry Barnet, the office’s director, told Politico. “He was approached in the airport numerous times, to the point of profanities being yelled at him and so forth.”As the first two publicly out gay men to win medals at the Winter Olympics, figure skaters Eric Radford and Adam Rippon have broken barriers and established legacies that will extend beyond the ice rink.

As a Canadian, however, Radford believes he has one major advantage over Rippon, who is American: He lives under a political administration that supports the LGBTQ community.

A post shared by Eric Radford (@ericradford85) on Feb 12, 2018 at 3:42am PST

“I feel very lucky that I’m not Adam, and I don’t have to deal with that whole political side of things,” Radford, who now plans to retire from competitive skating, said. “I got a call from [Prime Minister Justin Trudeau] ... He’s been so supportive and kind and nice.”

He then added, “I give all of my support to Adam and everything that he’s doing.”

After Radford and his skating partner, Meagan Duhamel, nabbed a gold medal in the team figure skating event Feb. 11, he said he’s received “some really, really touching messages” from closeted gay men who say that seeing a queer athlete living authentically in the spotlight “has helped make them feel a little better, and has helped sort of support them in a small way.”

Before the Winter Games officially wrap next Sunday, Radford said he was looking forward to reconnecting with Rippon at the Olympic Village’s Pride House to “soak up that really positive energy there.”President Donald Trump’s tweets not only trigger worries at home. They rattle leaders around the world.

But U.S. officials reportedly tried to reassure global policy representatives at an international conference in Germany over the weekend, urging them to pay no attention to the president’s Twitter rants.

The U.S. actually is angry with the Kremlin over interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, despite Trump’s Twitter denials, American politicians and officials told foreign policy leaders in Munich, The Washington Post reported. America also remains firmly committed to Europe. And, to be clear, the U.S. doesn’t plan on dropping a nuclear bomb on North Korea, the U.S. leaders said.

“The values are the same, the relationships are the same,” insisted Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio), the Post reported.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Saturday he no idea how to judge U.S. intentions. “Is it deeds? Is it words? Is it tweets?” he asked.

The disconnect between Trump’s tweets and U.S. government leaders often has been apparent.

Last year, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced his commitment to diplomatic efforts to ease tensions with North Korea, even though Trump tweeted he was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” Kim Jong Un.

I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said at the conference Saturday that with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictments against 13 Russians “the evidence is now incontrovertible” that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election. Trump doesn’t seem to share that position.

Trump tweeted over the weekend that McMaster “forgot” to mention that the presidential election “was not impacted” by the Russians. That’s not something Mueller’s investigation has concluded.

General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

Trump tweeted last summer that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were going to partner to form an “impenetrable cyber security unit so that election hacking and many other negative things, will be guarded.”

Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017

McMaster quipped at the conference in Germany: “We would love to have a cyber dialogue when Russia is sincere about curtailing its sophisticated form of espionage.”It’s not surprising that Obama addressed the movie’s representation of minorities, because she talked about the important issue as first lady. In a 2016 interview with Variety, for example, she explained the need for diversity in entertainment, and the crucial role it plays for children.

“For so many people, television and movies may be the only way they understand people who aren’t like them ... People who come from intact families who are educated, who have values, who care for their kids, who raise their kids — if you don’t see that on TV, and you don’t live in communities with people like me, you never know who we are, and you can make and be susceptible to all sorts of assumptions and stereotypes and biases, based on nothing but what you see and hear on TV,” Obama said. “So it becomes very important for the world to see different images of each other, so that, again, we can develop empathy and understanding.”

She added: “There are still millions of people who live in communities where they can live their whole lives not having contact or exposure with people who aren’t like them, whether that is race or religion or simply lifestyle. The only way that millions of people get to know other folks and the way they live … is through the power of television and movies.”

Representation has been no small part of why “Black Panther” has been so well received, even before its release on Friday.
