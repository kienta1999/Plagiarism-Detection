WASHINGTON ― If Donald Trump is to be believed when he claims his White House has “no Chaos, only great Energy,” this week may well be the most energetic of his presidency.

Trump has seen the departure of top National Security Council staff amid discussions of a possible military strike on Syria. His Environmental Protection Agency chief continues weathering a daily drip of ethics violation allegations. His personal lawyer was raided by the FBI. He canceled a long-planned foreign trip. And he opened a meeting with military leaders with a 700-word tirade against the prosecutor investigating him and his associates ― and then acknowledged he is considering firing him.

And it is only Tuesday.

“It’s unadulterated madness. But because it happens so often, it tends to become the norm,” said John Weaver, who joked that the last few days could set a low-water mark for an “infrastructure week” ― Washington shorthand for times when the White House has attempted to set a coherent message, only to see it descend into bedlam.

Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential campaign in the 2016 GOP primaries, was among a number of prominent Republicans who warned that a Trump presidency would be unending chaos because of Trump’s basic character. He said special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe was completely predictable, given Trump’s behavior. “So please stop with the ‘witch hunt,’” Weaver said.

Trump started using that phrase to describe the investigation more than a year ago, and last month escalated it to the all-capital “WITCH HUNT.” On Tuesday morning Trump took it up another notch still: “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”

But the president’s protestations notwithstanding, Mueller’s probe of possible collusion by Trump’s campaign with the Russian spy agencies that helped him win the election has already produced guilty pleas from five people and criminal charges against 14 others. Among those who have pleaded guilty are Trump’s original national security adviser and his deputy campaign chairman. Among those facing charges are Trump’s former campaign chairman and 13 Russians who worked to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and to help Trump.

On Monday, the probe expanded to include Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and “fixer,” Michael Cohen, whose offices were searched.

In the days leading up to the 2016 election, Cohen had worked to buy the silence of two women who say they had had affairs with Trump. Documents show that prosecutors are interested in that effort as well as, unrelatedly, Cohen’s handling of New York City taxi medallions.

“He’s got a guy who’s trying to juggle taxi medallions and porn stars and the president of the United States,” Weaver laughed. “What could go wrong?”

The staff departures from the NSC have come quickly after the arrival of Trump’s latest national security adviser, John Bolton. NSC spokesman Michael Anton resigned Sunday, and Monday saw the unexpected exit of Tom Bossert, who had been Trump’s homeland security adviser.

Bossert had told conference attendees in Sea Island, Georgia, just Sunday that the White House had actually become a relatively normal place. “I think at this point we’ve reached what seems to be a decent stability point,” he said.

Bossert’s departure came not long after the White House announcement that Trump would not be flying to Lima, Peru, on Friday to attend the Summit of the Americas this weekend. That decision came shortly after Trump resumed his complaints on Twitter about Mueller’s investigation, continuing his attacks from the previous evening.

The White House, though, said Trump’s decision to skip the South America trip was not as hasty as it seemed. The idea was first broached immediately after the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria on Saturday, one White House official said on condition of anonymity.

If there was to be a U.S. military response, the thinking went, it was better for the president to be in the White House with ready access to his full NSC staff than on a foreign trip. “It’s something that’s been considered for some days,” the official said.

“The president and his national security team felt it was best that he stay in the United States while all of these developments were taking place,” press secretary Sarah Sanders said at Tuesday’s briefing.

Whether the Syrian situation was the actual reason for the cancellation or a convenient excuse, Trump’s dislike of traveling generally and foreign travel in particular is well known.

During much of his campaign for president, Trump would almost without fail begin and end each day in New York to avoid having to spend a night somewhere other than his apartment in Trump Tower.

White House officials privately acknowledge that Trump does not really enjoy foreign trips at all, especially those in which he will be forced to interact with leaders who do not particularly like him. This was bound to be the case in South America, where Trump is widely disliked because of his comments on immigration and Mexicans. The White House had already trimmed what had originally been planned as a five-day trip down to three days.

Whatever the reason for the cancelation, not having Trump attend ― and having Vice President Mike Pence go in his place ― might actually be better for relations between the United States and the nations of South America, said one scholar.

“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert is back from his vacation, breaking the news to his audience of Monday’s FBI raid on the offices of Michael Cohen, personal attorney to President Donald Trump.

As Colbert noted, that raid may have been triggered by Trump’s own comments just a few days ago, the same day he claimed not to know anything about Cohen’s $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.

“Trump trusts his lawyer so much he lets him do stuff he doesn’t know about in his name for reasons he doesn’t understand,” Colbert said.

But something else Trump said in that same conversation may have led directly to Monday’s raid.“Did you miss me?”

Laura Ingraham returned to Fox News on Monday evening defiant and defensive, a week after advertisers fled her program over her ridicule of Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor David Hogg.

Ingraham opened her program, “The Ingraham Angle,” with a 10-minute monologue about the “squelching of free speech” by the left and deemed such efforts “Stalinist, pure and simple.”

“The left’s propaganda shaped a new generation of young adults, who then parroted all that malarkey about the ‘patriarchy,’ and then they came up with their own new phrases like ‘micro-aggressions’ and ‘safe spaces’ and ‘white privilege,’” Ingraham said. “Today, left-wing activists use these terms as bludgeons to intimidate those who disagree with them from entering the dialogue at all.”

I’m back. Tune in for a blistering Angle right now! @FoxNews pic.twitter.com/CylaSzCGfR — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) April 10, 2018

She offered no on-air apology to Hogg, whom she mocked last month on Twitter after he didn’t get into some of the colleges he’d applied to. Hogg, 17, took to his own social media account later that day and called for a boycott of those who advertised on Ingraham’s program. Nearly 20 advertisers left the show.

Ingraham did post a brief apology to Twitter a day after her initial tweet, saying that she was sorry for “any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” but the move was largely ineffective.

On Monday evening, it appeared that few companies planned to air their ads on her program in the near future. The only big-ticket advertisements came from the meal delivery service Blue Apron, the Beaches hotel in Turks and Caicos, and the genetic testing company 23andMe.

HuffPost has reached out to all three companies for comment.

The company My Pillow advertised twice during the program after its founder, Mike Lindell, said earlier this month he did not intend to take his ads down.

At the end of her program, Ingraham said she would launch a new segment called “Defending the First” meant to promote free speech and counter a “dangerous epidemic” she said was being sponsored by liberals.

AdvertisementUkrainian funds were also at the center of the indictment of Trump’s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, when a federal grand jury brought forth charges against him for allegedly laundering millions of dollars in funds he accrued while working for former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

Mueller is also reportedly asking the Trump Organization to hand over documents and communications regarding several Russian individuals whose names were not revealed.

The Times first reported in March that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents as part of his investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.

The subpoena marked the first time Mueller directly ordered Trump’s business to produce documents during the nearly yearlong investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

Trump has repeatedly blasted Mueller’s Russia probe as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.” In response to Monday’s raid of Cohen’s office, the president expressed his dismay and floated the possibility of firing Mueller.

“Why don’t I just fire Mueller?” Trump asked in response to a reporter’s question during a military leadership meeting on Monday. “Well, I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s really a sad situation ... Many people have said you should fire him. Again, they found nothing, and in finding nothing, that’s a big statement.”

The feature softly blurs the background in shots that feature people and keeps the ― you guessed it ― focus on the subject’s face, giving the finished picture a clear, professional look.

An Instagram blog post on the new feature says users can find the Focus button when they open the camera within the app, adjacent to “Superzoom” under the record button. It’s compatible with some Android devices, and iPhone 6s, 6s+, 7, 7+, 8, 8+ and X.

“Focus mode leverages background segmentation and face detection technology,” an Instagram spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Focus isn’t as great as the iPhone portrait mode at “keeping the whole face in focus,” TechCrunch noted. But portrait mode isn’t “available on older iPhones and can’t do video,” while Instagram’s new feature can, the publication said.

If you’ve updated your Instagram app and are looking for some tips and tricks for how best to use the Focus feature, we’d recommend starting with great lighting, and making sure the subject of your photograph is in the foreground ― not part of the blurred-out background.

As more and more teachers protest their states’ funding cuts, Democrats in Congress say they have a plan to restore school spending and boost teacher pay.

On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, party leaders joined teachers’ union officials to promote a slate of policies aimed at addressing the growing number of teacher walkouts that have shaken up statehouses across the country. The measure would steer $100 billion in federal funds toward schools and ensure that teachers could bargain collectively on salaries, benefits and working conditions.

“We’re here because teachers are marching on state Capitols across the country,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Teachers of America, the Democrats hear you loud and clear.”

Democrats said their plan would pay for those investments by paring back some of the tax cuts for the wealthy in the Republican tax package passed by Congress last year and signed by President Donald Trump. Parts of the plan were introduced last year as the Democratic Party’s new “Better Deal” agenda, which is heavy on antitrust and labor law reform.

The leaders didn’t specify which parts of the Republican tax plan they would target for repeal, referring only to tax breaks for the rich and special-interest loopholes. At the heart of the Republican plan was a massive corporate tax cut. Although families in all income brackets are expected to have smaller tax bills next year, independent analysts say most of the benefits from the plan will go to the wealthy.

“The very wealthiest should not have such a large tax cut,” Schumer said. “I think the odds of something like this [education proposal] passing are large in the next several years … Our day is going to come sooner than you think.”

The Democrats’ plan isn’t going anywhere for now, as Republicans still hold a majority in both chambers and occupy the White House. But the education plan helps Democrats put down a marker before the midterm elections, just as the teacher walkouts have galvanized grassroots activists and spurred a backlash against Republican austerity.

Most states pulled back on education funding when tax revenues fell during the Great Recession. Spending still hasn’t returned to 2008 levels in certain states, several of which went on to implement tax cuts that left even less money for schools and salaries. The teacher strikes have tended to hit states with the deepest cuts.

“Republicans are fighting to slash teacher and school budgets. This is one of the dumbest things Republicans have done,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

The walkouts began in late February, when West Virginia teachers went on strike to protest low pay, rising health costs and poorly equipped classrooms. The successful work stoppage prompted similar walkouts and school closures in Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona and North Carolina, all with Republican-controlled statehouses that have cut taxes in recent years while school funding has dropped, when adjusted for inflation.

The images of striking teachers and crumbling textbooks has prompted several states to increase school funding and teacher pay to varying degrees. Congressional Democrats said it still isn’t enough. Their plan would dedicate $50 billion to states to raise teacher pay and another $50 billion to states to spend on school infrastructure and curriculum.

Another, less direct way the plan could boost teacher salaries is through more union contracts. The states that have seen teacher strikes and walkouts tend to have weak labor laws, in some cases even outlawing collective bargaining by public-sector workers. In West Virginia, for instance, the unions have no ability to bargain contracts and guaranteed raises with school districts, only to lobby lawmakers for higher salaries.President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that “attorney-client privilege is dead” a day after the FBI raided the office of Michael Cohen, his personal lawyer.

A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2018

Attorney–client privilege is dead! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2018

The New York Times reported that investigators are examining records related to a payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, in addition to other unspecified topics.

The raid comes less than a week after Trump publicly denied knowing about Cohen’s $130,000 payment in 2016 to Daniels, who has claimed the money was meant to keep her quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump in 2006.

Legal experts pushed back on Trump’s claim Tuesday that attorney-client privilege ― a legal safeguard for confidential communications between an attorney and a client ― is “dead.” Attorney-client privilege may be invoked during the pretrial process of obtaining evidence, known as discovery, or when an attorney is asked to testify under oath.

Lawyers, including Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, disputed the president’s suggestion that the FBI search of Cohen’s office violated the protection. Some pointed to the very high bar the FBI needed to obtain a search warrant of this nature, including getting approval from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump appointee, was recused from the Cohen investigation, ABC News reported. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office would not comment on Berman’s role, or even say whether there was an investigation into Cohen.

I use the attorney-client privilege. I know the attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege is a friend of mine. And the attorney-client privilege is not dead. What is dead is using the privilege to hide illegal acts. And that has been dead for a long time. #basta — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) April 10, 2018

Remember, folks, this search had to be approved thru DOJ's highest levels AND by a federal judge. Given Trump's, Cohen's & Schwartz's statements about the Daniels NDA specifically, & the wealth of public info about Cohen being Trump's fixer, there would be ample probable cause. https://t.co/xLPHwYj7lq — Elizabeth de la Vega (@Delavegalaw) April 9, 2018

There are special requirements for authorizing a search warrant of an attorney's office. Both the Assistant AG for the Criminal Division & the Deputy AG signed off on this one, possibly signaling a crime-fraud exception to the usual privilege for attorney-client communications. https://t.co/lTzP2Fmp5W — Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) April 9, 2018

No, there is a crime fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, as there has been for centuries. Annesley v. Anglesea (1743), 17 How. St. Tr. 1139. https://t.co/M4J5S0o305 — Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) April 10, 2018

As tweeted by George Conway, an attorney and the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the Department of Justice defines when an attorney can legally be subject to a search.

“There are occasions when effective law enforcement may require the issuance of a search warrant for the premises of an attorney who is a subject of an investigation, and who also is or may be engaged in the practice of law on behalf of clients,” the Justice Department says on its website.

I know that for many of you, this past week has been challenging as the stations bore the brunt of politically motivated attacks regarding our news promotions. As you know, the practice of on-air personalities following a script is not unique to Sinclair, however, the blowback we received for doing so certainly is. For having to field nasty calls, threats, personal confrontations and trolling on social media, I am truly sorry you had to endure such an experience. However, as an organization it is important that we do not let extremists on any side of the political fence bully us because they do not like what they hear or see.

On Friday Scott Livingston and I had a News Director meeting to answer questions about the situation from the field. At the end of the call I did a recap regarding our commitment to local that I would like to paraphrase for the benefit of those that were not on the call.

In the TV station business, there are four core sources of value: 1) wireless spectrum, 2) programming/distribution contracts, 3) local news/content and 4) local sales/relationships. Due to our unique engineering talent and industry leadership in next generation TV (ATSC3.0), Sinclair is most known for spectrum, and often times this leads to a perception that we do not value the local aspects of the business. This perception is not consistent with the value drivers of the industry. In fact, two out of the four value drivers in this business are locally based.

As we enter into a time of unprecedented change and disruption in media, it’s more important now than ever to be focused on serving our local communities and businesses with the best programming and the best marketing services. Those that fail to do these two things well and fail to innovate will not be in business 5-10 years from now. That means we cannot be satisfied with the status quo way that TV broadcasting has historically operated. To that end, Sinclair will continue to pursue new and innovative strategies including our hybrid approach of bringing together the best of the local broadcast model with the best of the network model which will undoubtable expose us to more criticism because “no other local TV broadcasters does it that way.” However, those that do not answer the call to innovate will be sucked into the black hole that is big tech which is consuming every segment of the media universe. Contrary to much of the uninformed coverage on Sinclair we are not a monopoly and do not have any material market power, even by pre-internet standards. We simply have a seat a large table of competitors and potential substitutes. A seat that we have to earn the right to keep by focusing on the needs of our local viewers and local advertisers.

So let me be clear, service and dedication to our local communities is an absolute priority here at Sinclair. It is a key strategic advantage for our company and often the reason others value us in the media ecosystem. Once again, my apologies if you were personally affected by the attacks from last week.

Best,

Chris

Sinclair Broadcast GroupFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will answer questions from the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees Tuesday about Cambridge Analytica and security on the social network.

Zuckerberg met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Monday. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will question Zuckerberg on Wednesday, released his prepared testimony Monday, in which he admits Facebook “didn’t do enough to prevent” tools like Cambridge Analytica “from being used for harm.”Cardi B sizzled with energy Monday as co-host of “The Tonight Show,” days after confirming she’s pregnant.

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper gamely shared monologue shtick with regular host Jimmy Fallon, played “Box of Lies” and sang “Money Bag” off her just-dropped “Invasion of Privacy” album.

Fallon congratulated her on the baby and asked how she was managing it all.

“I don’t know if it’s the strength of the fetus, but I have never felt so hungry to succeed,” Cardi said in the clip above.President Donald Trump “certainly believes he has the power” to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, a spokeswoman for the White House said Tuesday.

“We’ve been advised that the president certainly has the power to make that decision,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters during a press briefing.

Mueller is head of a federal probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Many legal experts have said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the only person who can directly fire Mueller. But Sanders said the White House had been advised otherwise.

“I know a number of individuals in the legal community, and including at the Department of Justice, said he has the power to do so,” Sanders told reporters.

Sanders did not specify which individuals she was referring to. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.

“I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on,” Trump told reporters Monday. “We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s really a sad situation... Many people have said ‘You should fire him.’”

When asked Tuesday why Trump had described the FBI raid as “an attack on our country,” Sanders simply responded that “the president is clear that he feels it’s gone too far.”

Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have defended Mueller’s role in the Russia investigation and have warned Trump not to terminate him.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that it would be “suicide” for Trump to fire Mueller.

“I think the less the president says about this whole thing, the better off he will be,” Grassley said during an interview with CNN. “I think that Mueller is a person of stature and respected, and I respect him. Just let the thing go forward.”

However, while at least four bills have been introduced to Congress that would prevent Trump from firing Mueller, several prominent Republican lawmakers have declined to move such legislation forward.

“It’s still my view that Mueller should be allowed to finish his job,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Tuesday. “I haven’t seen clear indication yet that we needed to pass something to keep him from being removed.”“My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together. Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that as long as I’m running Facebook,” Zuckerberg said in his opening statement.

“I started Facebook when I was in college. We’ve come a long way since then,” he said. “I realize the issues we’re talking about today aren’t just issues for Facebook and our community — they’re challenges for all of us as Americans.”

BET is getting in on the reboot game.

The network announced on Tuesday that it has given a straight-to-series order for a reboot of the classic 1992 Eddie Murphy film “Boomerang,” along with a slew of new scripted projects, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

This time around, “Boomerang” will be reimagined as a half-hour comedy from Paramount Television exploring “contemporary workplace dynamics, including the changing role of gender, office politics, relationships and the conflicts between Generation X and millennials,” the outlet reported.

The series will follow a successful business executive, presumably based on Murphy’s character, who “finds that his lifestyle choices have turned back on him when his new boss turns out to be a bigger deviant that he is.”

No writer or producer is currently attached, and it’s unclear whether any of the film’s original cast, including Murphy, Halle Berry, Martin Lawrence, Robin Givens and Grace Jones, will appear.

Murphy is involved with bringing back another of his comedy favorites, the long-awaited sequel to “Coming to America.” The film is currently in development with a script by “Black-ish” creator Kenya Barris, and Jonathan Levine taking over directing duties.

BET also has picked up another comedy, “Peachtree Place,″ from “Girl’s Trip” producer Will Packer, revolving around a group of Atlanta-based 30-somethings, as well as the drama “American Soul,” about the life of “Soul Train” creator Don Cornelius.

“Our new focus is on shows that are dramatic, character-driven, aspirational and authentically anchored in the African-American experience,” BET’s new president Scott Mills told The Hollywood Reporter. “We are confident that content in that vein is going to allow us to more consistently pull big audiences you’ve seen us pull with “The New Edition Story,” the BET Awards, “Being Mary Jane” and “The Game.”Sandra Oh is tracking down her next assassin, and she wants you along for the ride.

The actress made her debut on Sunday in “Killing Eve,” a new crime drama from BBC America in which she plays Eve Polastri, a security operative who’s yearning for a more exciting life. She soon finds herself hunting down a female assassin named Villanell, played by Jodie Comer.

“It has this blend of drama, of thriller, but also of this demented naughtiness with an English spin on it,” Oh told HuffPost at Build Series. “I was like, ‘What is that?’ I can see it from the page. And I felt aligned to her voice. So that was really why I wanted to delve in.”

Throughout the 8-episode season, Eve and Villanelle become obsessed with each other as they engage in a large-scale game of cat and mouse.

“Our characters spend a lot of time apart but thinking of the other,” she said.

BBC America

This isn’t your typical assassin and spy show, Oh pointed out.

“Both of the characters really upend the stereotype,” she said. “Villanelle is not constantly a femme fatale. She’s devious and ridiculous. And Eve is not in a procedural hunting down a killer. The characters are layered, and it’s great to play a wide range of emotions.”

“Killing Eve” marks Oh’s first major primetime leading role since leaving “Grey’s Anatomy” in 2014 after Season 10. She had various offers since parting ways with the hit ABC series, but “Killing Eve” felt like the right fit.

“I want to make choices and actually have agency over my life. And as an actor, it sometimes takes a while for that to happen. So, I was very judicious in my choices,” she said. “It’s like falling in love. You may have to date for a while, but when you find the right one, you commit.”

She’s particularly glad to serve as a female lead on a show that celebrates inclusion and diversity. Throughout her career, Oh said she feels like she’s been part of that change on both the small and big screens, slow though it may be.

“I always have to believe that the arc bends toward long and it bends toward justice. So I have faith in that and it’s slow,” she said, adding, “It’s part of my life’s work to be a part of that bending. It’s very important to me. I’d say where we are is exactly where we are. And there’s more work to be done and there’s things to celebrate.”

“Killing Eve” certainly won’t be the last challenging part Oh will take on. When asked if there’s a role she’d like to play, she said, “I do, I just don’t know what it is yet.”

But then she thought about it for a second.

“I will say, I love sci-fi,” Oh continued. “And there are many times where I’m like, ‘I can play an alien. I can play the leader of some universe.’ And I always felt like Asians should be in space. We should be in space. I don’t know why sci-fi doesn’t have more Asians in it. It’s like, hello. We’re at the forefront of technology. That genre has always interested me.”

Until then, Oh is thrilled that “Killing Eve” has already been picked up for Season 2.

“We want to know what happens to these characters. And it’s just settled. I really wanted a second season,” she said. “And now that I know, I can relax, go into the work and go into preparing.”

“Killing Eve” airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on BBC America.A scene from the "Game of Thrones" episode "Battle of the Bastards." HBO

Fans of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” waiting for the hit show’s eighth and final season may be getting a huge reward for their patience ― an epic battle scene that tops anything the show has ever done before.

Popular fan site Watchers On The Wall reportedly unearthed a since-deleted Instagram from assistant director Jonathan Quinlan congratulating the crew for its efforts while filming in Toome and Magheramorne in Northern Ireland. Quinlan, has helped shoot 20 episodes of the series so far, shared a photo of a note from the producers that described “enduring 55 straight nights” in production. Watchers On The Wall suggested the lengthy shoot was likely a major battle scene.

A spokesperson from HBO confirmed that “a crew person posted congrats to his colleagues for finishing up a run of night shoots,” but declined to specify how long the shoot took. HuffPost has reached out to “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for comment, but has not heard back.

The “Battle of the Bastards,” an ambitious battle scene that appeared in the show’s sixth season, took 25 days to shoot.

The note also described how the crew put up with “the cold, the snow, the rain, the mud, the sheep shit of Toome and the winds of Magheramorne.”

“When tens of millions of people around the world watch this episode a year from now, they won’t know how hard you worked,” the note read. “They won’t care how tired you were or how hard it was to do your job in sub-freezing temperatures. They’ll just understand that they’re watching something that’s never been done before. And that’s because of you.”

The note is signed by “The Producer Types.”

In February, Belfast Live reported a huge blaze at a “Game of Thrones” set in Toome that was understood to be part of filming for a battle scene.

The final season of “Game of Thrones” is slated to be released in 2019. In January, HBO programming president Casey Bloys told Entertainment Weekly that the delay is meant to give Benioff and Weiss extra time to create the final six episodes of the show.Lawyers for President Donald Trump’s private company warned Panama’s president last month of “repercussions” if he failed to intervene in a legal dispute involving a Trump hotel in Panama City, The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported Tuesday.

The letter from Trump Organization lawyers is believed to be the first time since Trump’s election that his company directly pressured a head of state to help the president’s business. The ploy raises fresh questions of conflict of interest, as Trump defiantly hangs onto his sprawling business interests while in office.

Trump lawyers sought the Panamanian president’s help after the majority owner of the Trump International Hotel and Tower — investor Orestes Fintiklis — ejected the Trump Organization as the hotel’s manager under a court order. Fintiklis, backed by police, escorted Trump personnel off the property, stripped the Trump name from the building facade and celebrated by playing a Greek anti-fascism song on a lobby piano.

Trump’s company wants President Juan Carlos Varela to help it retake control. Lawyers from the Panamanian firm Britton and Iglesias wrote to “urgently request your influence in relation to a commercial dispute regarding the Trump hotel,” according to the letter obtained by the Post and the AP, which first reported the story. “This situation is currently before the courts, but it has repercussions for the Panamanian state, which is your responsibility,” the letter warned.

The letter brushed aside concerns about the separation of power between the executive branch and the judiciary, which exists in Panama just as it does in the U.S. It also suggested the hotel dispute may violate a treaty between the two nations.

The Trump Organization’s direct appeal to Varela, and its treaty reference, “implicitly traded on President Trump’s name and power,” University of Minnesota political governance expert Lawrence Jacobs told AP.

Varela hasn’t decided what action to take, a spokesman told the Post. Five days after the letter was sent, a court arbitrator ruled against reinstating the Trump Organization management team, suggesting the direct appeal had failed.

The Trump Organization said in a statement that the letter was “routine” and “common.”

“We categorically reject any assumption or assertion that the letter sought to ‘pressure’ the president of the Republic of Panama,” the company said.

The White House referred questions about the letter to the Trump Organization.

Unlike previous presidents, Trump has refused to divest from his business interests. His company has extensive holdings in foreign countries.Voters in Ireland headed to the polls on Friday to decide whether the country should repeal its restrictive abortion laws. Among those casting their ballots were thousands of Irish citizens living in other parts of the world who traveled back to Ireland for the landmark vote.

They chronicled their journeys on social media using the hashtag #HomeToVote, sharing thousands of powerful and poignant stories.

Most of those using the hashtag were planning to vote “yes” to repeal the eighth amendment ― Ireland’s near-total ban on abortion that only makes exceptions to save the life of the mother.

Some people covered relatively short distances from England, Scotland and parts of Europe, while others crossed oceans and continents to journey from places like Los Angeles, Tokyo and Sao Paulo.

The eighth amendment has been in place since 1983, granting fetuses and pregnant women the same rights. The campaign to repeal the amendment has been ongoing since its inception. This latest effort came about after 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar died from a septic miscarriage in 2012 after being denied an abortion at a Galway hospital.

A recent survey showed 56 percent of Irish voters said they were planning to vote “yes” to repeal the amendment, but the gap has steadily narrowed in recent weeks, perhaps due to a “no” campaign funded in part by American anti-abortion groups.

Some of those traveling back to Ireland to vote “yes” recalled undertaking trips in the other direction to seek reproductive services in other countries.

“All the # hometovote celebrating feels like a response to all the silent, secret journeys that went the other way,” one Twitter user wrote.

WASHINGTON ― The Hillary Clinton email controversy received an enormous amount of coverage during the 2016 presidential election, dogging the former secretary of state’s campaign for months amid allegations from Republicans that she broke laws and put national security at risk.

The apparent lack of security concerning President Donald Trump’s communications, meanwhile, hardly got any attention on Capitol Hill this week.

“I haven’t heard any discussion about it,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday.

Trump has been using a cellphone not equipped with top security features and has rejected repeated attempts by his staff to harden his devices against hackers, Politico reported Monday. The president reportedly uses two cellphones: one dedicated for his frequent Twitter use and another to make calls. The latter has a camera and microphone — features that security experts warn can be exploited by hackers.

According to the report, the GPS location trackers on both of Trump’s devices have been deactivated. But he has reportedly gone for as long as five months without getting his Twitter phone checked by security experts, posing additional risks of hacking.

The significance of compromised presidential communications could be enormous. Trump often uses his cellphone to speak with friends, advisers, former business partners and lawmakers about the Russia investigation and sensitive issues like negotiations with North Korea. His reluctance to secure his personal communications could have already exposed him to domestic or foreign surveillance efforts.

Most Republicans who spoke to HuffPost about Trump’s phone use on Tuesday said they were not aware of or had not yet read a Politico report concerning his cellphones. Some, like Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), acknowledged that secure phone lines are “something you need to be concerned about.”

Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, meanwhile, expressed confidence in the president’s ability to exercise good judgment about how and with whom he communicates.

“I suspect the president of the United States is sophisticated enough to know what he should or shouldn’t be talking about on an unsecured line,” he said. “We all have unsecured and secured lines, and in the business we’re in, it’s just common knowledge what you talk about and don’t talk about.”

Some Democrats also shrugged off questions about Trump’s cellphone use.

“I spoke to him quite a few times on the phone, so I’m sure people were listening in,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) quipped Tuesday.

He added that, as a rule, he doesn’t discuss matters over the phone “that I didn’t think I wanted people to hear.” But when asked by HuffPost if he was concerned about the possibility that the president discusses sensitive matters on an unsecured phone line, Manchin said, “I hope he doesn’t.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the foreign relations committee, said he found the lack of security of Trump’s cellphones “incredibly concerning.” Murphy succinctly summed up, however, why it barely registered in Trump’s Washington, where a new scandal or feud seems to pop up every day ― developments that may have consumed weeks in past administrations.A conservative host for a station owned by the embattled Sinclair Broadcast Group has resigned after threatening one of the teen survivors of the Feb. 14 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.

“I’ve been hanging out getting ready to ram a hot poker up David Hogg’s ass,” Jamie Allman wrote on Twitter on March 26.

The tweet by the host of “The Allman Report” on KDNL-TV, the Sinclair-owned St. Louis ABC affiliate, has since been deleted, but it caused advertisers to flee his show.

“We have accepted Mr. Allman’s resignation, and his show has been canceled,” a Sinclair spokesman told The Washington Post on Monday.

Allman, former spokesman for the St. Louis Archdiocese, also hosts a radio show on KFTK, a conservative station.

Since the mass shooting, Hogg has become an advocate for gun control, which has led to both conspiracy theories and personal attacks from the right.

On March 28, Fox News host Laura Ingraham mocked him for not getting accepted into four of the colleges he had applied to (one of which has since accepted him). That led Hogg to suggest a boycott of “The Ingraham Angle,” and since then, advertisers have fled her show as well, although she returned to the air on Monday night after a week’s break.

Allman had also mocked Hogg over the Ingraham boycott.

“You can’t say ‘Hey I’m just a kid,’” Allman said, according to the Riverfront Times. “We have to be allowed to refute what you’re saying... or to respond to it, you can’t be all the time grabbing your blanket when the going gets tough.”Former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford (aka Stormy Daniels) is cooperating with federal agents investigating a $130,000 payment she received from President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen, NBC News first reported Tuesday.

Daniel’s cooperation is part of federal agents’ broader investigation into Cohen, NBC noted.

Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avanatti, tweeted Tuesday afternoon that she would “fully cooperate with any search for the truth.” Avenatti didn’t immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

My client @stormydaniels and I will fully cooperate with any search for the truth regarding the threats, cover-up and lies concerning the NDA and $130k payment. Unlike others, we don’t require the presence of the fine members of the FBI in order to speak honestly. #basta — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) April 10, 2018

The FBI raided Cohen’s office and hotel room on Monday. Investigators retrieved documents related to several topics, including the payment Cohen made to Daniels, reported The New York Times.

The FBI is investigating Cohen for possible bank fraud and campaign finance violations, sources told The Washington Post.

Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 days before the 2016 election, reportedly in exchange for her signing a nondisclosure agreement, stating that she not discuss her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. Some have speculated that such a payment would violate campaign finance laws.

The White House has repeatedly denied that Trump had an affair with Daniels. Trump said last week he was unaware of the payment.Rachel McAdams has reportedly welcomed her first child ― a baby boy ― with boyfriend Jamie Linden.

In a photograph published by The Hollywood Pipeline, McAdams was spotted with what appears to be her newborn son and Linden, headed out to lunch with the “Dear John” screenwriter holding the baby. The new parents were overheard talking about what a “good sleeper he is” and saying “he’s a good baby,” according to the outlet.

A representative for McAdams hasn’t responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. No additional information about her pregnancy has been revealed.

News of the “Mean Girls” actress’ pregnancy, which she kept completely under wraps, was first reported less than two months ago, when E! News confirmed she was expecting.

McAdams and Linden have been linked since April 2016, when they were spotted together on a stroll in Los Angeles holding hands. The two have kept a low profile ever since, save for a single Instagram picture at a friend’s wedding.

A post shared by @vatobknyc on Jun 11, 2016 at 10:32pm PDT

McAdams hasn’t been seen at a public event since the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, noticeably skipping the press tour and premiere for her latest comedy film “Game Night” in Hollywood in February.

Linden is best known for penning the scripts for “We Are Marshall,” “10 Years,” and “Money Monster.” He also co-wrote the upcoming sci-fi thriller “Chaos Walking,” starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland.

McAdams, meanwhile, has stayed mum on her personal life, though she has dated celebrities like her “Notebook” co-star Ryan Gosling, Josh Lucas and most recently actor Michael Sheen.

“I’m sorry but I don’t talk about my personal life,” she told People when asked about her dating history in 2009.

She has been willing, however, to discuss her desire for starting a family on multiple occasions, explaining that her own mother is a big inspiration.

AdvertisementActress Amber Heard is being recognized for donating quite the pretty penny to the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, as she makes good on her pledge to donate money received from her divorce settlement.

The “Justice League” star’s name was included on the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles’ recently released 2017 donors list honor roll in a category for donations between $1 million and nearly $5 million for the fiscal year ending in June 2017.

The contribution appears to be proof the 31-year-old is following through on her promise to donate her $7 million divorce settlement from ex-husband Johnny Depp to charities such as the American Civil Liberties Union, specifically to prevent violence against women, and CHLA, where Heard works as a volunteer.

“As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves,” the actress said.

Shortly before Heard filed for divorce in May 2016, the actress accused Depp of striking her in the face with a cellphone and pulling her hair.

The couple released a joint statement not long after, calling the relationship “intensely passionate and at times volatile but always bound by love,” adding that “there was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.”

The two, who were married for 15 months, had an exceptionally bitter divorce. In the wake of Heard’s highly publicized claims of domestic abuse against Depp, one of the actor’s friends, comedian Doug Stanhope, wrote a column for The Wrap in May 2016 that claimed Heard was lying about the abuse allegations in an attempt to blackmail the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star.“Even though I’ve had the best people helping me, I’m still healing and not quite looking the same,” Underwood told her fan club in a letter in January. “I honestly don’t know how things are going to end up but I do know this: I am grateful. I am grateful that it wasn’t much, much worse.”

She added: “And when I am ready to get in front of a camera, I want you all to understand why I might look a bit different. I’m hoping that, by then, the differences are minimal but, again, I just don’t know how it’s all going to end up.”

Last week, Underwood shared a photo of herself in the studio that showed half of her face, which was a welcome sight for fans.This year, big companies in the United Kingdom were forced to do something amazing: actually reveal the difference in how men and women are paid.

Thanks to a law passed last year, businesses in the U.K. that employ more than 250 workers are now required to report gender differences in both hourly wages and bonus pay. More than 10,000 companies reported data by the April 4 deadline.

The numbers were bleak, though hardly surprising. As they do all over the world, women in the U.K. make less than men. Women’s median pay is close to 10 percent less than men’s, the data showed. At 80 percent of businesses that reported data in the U.K., men outearn women.

But the numbers revealed something else. By breaking things down by wage level, the data reveal what percentage of the best- and worst-paying roles are held by women. In doing so, they show a major reason for the pay disparity: Women are making less not because men earn more for the same work, but because women aren’t getting the best-paying jobs.

At the granular level, the numbers were truly eye-popping. Men earn more than double what women make at some companies, demonstrating that when it comes to equal pay, women aren’t just facing a “gap,” they’re staring down a vast, dystopic hole of inequity.

The male-dominated finance industry was one of the worst offenders. At Goldman Sachs in the U.K., women earn 55.5 percent less than men, according to data the company submitted. Other global finance firms in the U.K. reported similar numbers. Women at Barclays make 48 percent less on average than men. At HSBC, the gap is 59 percent. JPMorgan reported paying women 36 percent less on average.

At Goldman, 83 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men, the company’s data showed. At Barclays, men represent 81 percent of the bank’s top earners. Even at the U.K. outpost of Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour, where women are a majority at every pay level, men still outearn women by 36.9 percent on average because of a few highly paid men sitting at the tippy top.

“Women don’t stand a chance at pay equality if they’re not making it to the top.”

The revelations from the U.K. shine a light on the key issue when it comes to the gender pay gap. Women don’t stand a chance at pay equality if they’re not making it to the top.

And the findings are worth paying attention to in the U.S., especially this Tuesday, a symbolic day of the year for women. It’s Equal Pay Day, the day women finally “catch up” in earnings to what men made in 2017. It’s also when everyone who cares about gender equality will be offering up their take on why the pay gap exists ― women earn 80 percent of what men make on average in the U.S. ― and how to fix it.

The companies that reported data in the U.K. offered mostly toothless solutions.

In a letter to its employees, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and its president and CEO heir apparent David Solomon acknowledged that there aren’t enough women in senior roles. They’re totally working on it, they said. The company is committed to having women make up 30 percent of the jobs at the vice president level and above by 2023 (that’s not equality, btw). Blankfein and Solomon also are looking to have women make up half of its entry-level workforce in three years.

Those goals are somewhat laudable ― though awfully late in the making, since gender equality in banking is something that’s been talked about for decades. Mostly they seem like PR. Big companies have been launching “women’s initiatives” for a long time and still there’s been little movement at the top.

For the truth about who holds the power at Goldman, just look at who was in the running to succeed Blankfein as CEO: Solomon and another man. Hardly a diverse slate of candidates. It’s likely there were few suitable female candidates internally, as there are only two female executive officers out of 11 at the company.

There are far too many women and men who think the reason women aren’t making it up the ladder lies with the women themselves: They “leave before they leave,” Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg once said, dialing down ambition because they want to have a family. Or they don’t “lean in,” as she famously put it, placing the blame more on women for not being aggressive enough.

And studies have shown clearly that women who become mothers face huge disadvantages at work because they do have to devote time to child-rearing.

However, that’s only part of the reason women aren’t making it up the corporate ladder. Many leave because they’re sexually harassed. Others quit because they’re not getting promoted by the boys’ club at the top. And those promotions aren’t coming, in part, because of stereotypes. The men in charge hold certain beliefs about what women want out of their careers ― and often they don’t bother checking to make sure their beliefs line up with reality.

When she was an investment banker at JPMorgan, Sacha Nitsetska, talked to more than 100 women there, asking them what the bank could do to keep women from leaving. “The answers were very similar: increased pay transparency, clarity on career progression and bonuses, and mentorship from the seniors,” Nitsetska writes in a post for the U.K. site efinancialcareers.

But when she told senior management about her findings, she said, they did not believe her.

“I was told that none of this was true and that in fact, the women are leaving because ‘they want to raise children,’” she writes.

At JPMorgan in the U.K., 78 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men. Presumably many of those men have children, but somehow they’re making it work.

April 27The head of programming at HBO says that the network has examined all of its shows and corrected gender pay disparities among staff, inspired by “Big Little Lies” star and producer Reese Witherspoon and the larger Time’s Up movement.

“One of the things that’s come out of thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese, who’s really at the forefront, is something we’ve done recently,” Casey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Monday. “We’ve proactively gone through all of our shows — in fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward.”

Bloys would not elaborate on which of the network’s shows required adjusting pay. A spokesman for HBO declined to comment further. Witherspoon’s representative did not respond to a request for comment.

Other popular shows and networks have had to address similar pay gaps. Netflix’s “The Crown” generated controversy when producers admitted that actress Claire Foy was paid less than male costar Matt Smith, despite Foy playing the central character.

Bloys said that pay would be commensurate with experience but that the network sought to eliminate “wildly disparate” pay, especially when a show is successful.

“When you’re putting a show together, people come in with different levels of experience and maybe some people have won awards or something that makes them stand out,” he said. “But when you get into season two or three of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers.”

Witherspoon has been an outspoken leader of Hollywood’s Time’s Up movement, which established a legal defense fund to assist women across all industries facing sexual harassment and other gender-related workplace injustices.Cosby, 80, is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University, in 2004.

Last week, on April 4, exactly 50 years after her father’s assassination, Rev. Bernice King, the youngest child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, picked up a gun for the first time in her life.

The white-handled revolver wasn’t as big as the rifle used to kill her father in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968. But in the half-century since his death, handguns were responsible for the vast share of the more than 1.5 million gun deaths in the U.S.

“It’s such a small thing that can be so destructive,” King said. “There’s something wrong when something this small has so much power over us.”

King, along with several families of victims of gun violence and police shootings, was attending an event at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, where activists and artists with the group Lead to Life showed how guns can be repurposed for good by melting them down into shovels.

The King Center gathering was the first large public demonstration for Lead to Life, a group launched by California-based activists Kyle Lemle, 28, and Brontë Velez, 24.

“It’s the ultimate transformational act, from something that takes life from the planet to something that gives life on the planet,” said Lemle. “We’re liberating the guns’ histories of violence and giving the metal a new purpose.”

The revolver King carried was meant for such a symbolic change. After walking past the crypt where her parents were laid to rest, she and the other family members came to an open area in which a furnace roared with bright orange fire. A man wearing fire-resistant coveralls and a welder’s mask approached King. She gave him the gun, which he affixed to a rod and placed in the heart of the flame.

Within moments, the weapon had melted away completely, disappearing into a ladle of molten iron. A team of metalworkers then poured the liquid metal into casts of a shovel handle and a peace sign.

The King Center ceremony was part of a week of events for Lemle and Velez dedicated to “healing justice” for communities and individuals affected by gun violence in the Atlanta area. Their inaugural campaign kicked off amid a much larger debate about firearms in the U.S. following the February mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.

In the nearly two months since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the tragedy has touched nearly every facet of the national discussion around guns. Much of the conversation has revolved around reforming gun laws and reversing the disturbing trend of mass shootings. There have been rallies and protests. And many of the movement’s most visible leaders are white, though the Stoneman Douglas students have championed inclusivity and diversity.

Lead to Life’s tactics and focus look a bit different.

“There are a constellation of ways people had been impacted by gun violence, all critical,” said Velez. She added that she is particularly interested in “centering families of color, and specifically black folks rooted in Atlanta,” in the discussion ― people whose experiences she feels sometimes get overshadowed.

Velez said she was pleased to have Kai Koerber and Tyah-Amoy Roberts, two Stoneman Douglas students who are black, speak at the King Center ceremony last week.

Lemle and Velez formed Lead to Life after meeting at a “Spiritual Ecology” fellowship program in 2016, when they decided to combine their interests in faith, community organizing, urban forestry, environmental racism, and racial and restorative justice.

The concept of turning guns into shovels refers back to Old Testament scripture that spoke of people who “beat their swords into plowshares,” thereby turning weapons into instruments that benefited human life. Other groups and artists have replicated the symbolic act, including the Mexican artist Pedro Reyes, whom Velez has worked with in the past.

But Lead to Life’s real work begins after their tools harden. Lemle and Velez want people affected by gun violence to be able to use those shovels to turn their pain and loss into new life.

Over the weekend, Lead to Life hosted a series of tree plantings at sites of violence around Atlanta. They also organized a garden action day, in which volunteers used the shovels and other tools to improve a Westside Atlanta resident’s community “food forest.” Many attendees had never done this sort of farm work before, and Lemle and Velez said it provided a way for people to build positive relationships with nature.

One planting, in particular, was deeply personal for Velez. In 2013, she lost a friend, 21-year-old X’avier Arnold, to a fatal shooting during a robbery attempt on a local bike path. The 14-year-old perpetrator and his adult accomplice were each sentenced to serve three life sentences in prison. Yet Velez said the idea of such a young person spending the rest of his life behind bars offered little sense of closure.

On Sunday, Velez gathered at the spot of Arnold’s shooting with his family and loved ones and planted a redbud tree. They scattered Arnold’s ashes, along with soil that Velez had gathered from the site of an early 20th-century lynching along the Chattahoochee River.

“There was a lot of joy, and we had time to be intimate with one another and to reflect on what it meant to plant there, at the site where he was killed,” said Velez.

It takes time and space to grieve and work through trauma, said Velez, but those are luxuries not afforded to many people touched by gun violence.

“With folks who have lost their children, to feel this process as one that is actually seeding something is really profound,” she said.

Velez attended another tree planting on Sunday for Jamarion Robinson, a 26-year-old black man shot 76 times by U.S. marshals in 2016. Lead to Life also returned to the King Center to plant a cherry tree in Coretta Scott King’s Peace Garden.

The guns involved in Lead to Life’s recent events had been donated to the San Francisco Police Department through a buyback program organized by United Playaz, a violence prevention and youth development organization. Minnesota-based metal artist James Brenner helped transport the weapons to Atlanta, along with his furnace to assist in melting and recasting them.

Although Lead to Life had wanted to work with the Atlanta Police Department, Georgia state law forbids law enforcement from destroying guns that are seized from criminals or voluntarily turned in through buybacks. A number of other states have passed similar laws in recent years, and as a result, many law enforcement agencies are forced to sell those firearms back onto the street.

“We couldn’t actually get weapons from [the Atlanta Police Department] because of politics,” said Lemle.

In the future, Lead to Life plans to work directly with people who want to turn over their guns. The organization has seen increased interest in the wake of the Parkland shooting, said Lemle.

“We’ve already had folks reaching out to us inspired by the work, wanting to get rid of their guns for good,” he said. Lemle added that gun owners must first disable their firearms by making cuts to weapons before shipping them to Lead to Life or a partner organization. But he advised people to reach out for instructions before doing anything.

With an estimated 300 million firearms in civilian hands in America, Lemle and Velez understand this sort of project alone won’t make a meaningful dent in gun violence, a nationwide epidemic that erupts each year in around 11,000 homicides, 22,000 suicides and tens of thousands of other nonfatal shootings.

“It’s a drop in the ocean to turn a gun into a shovel,” Velez said. “We’re more about what we as a people need to do to be well and together with one another to heal, because we can’t wait for the state to do that for us.”

But if Lead to Life’s first round of events is any indication, Lemle and Velez believe they can at least shift participants’ consciousness in ways that may help disrupt the cycles of violence. By offering time and space to process trauma, as well as a place to foster healthy relationships with nature and each other, Lemle and Velez hope to turn people away from apathy and eventually toward political change.
