In a galaxy far, far away, an ominous-looking spaceship prepares for landing. Clouds of smoke pour from exhaust ports as the craft slowly descends, its foreboding features coming into focus. But something’s not quite right. Is that a handle on its hull? Is that even smoke? What kind of alien contraption is this?

Apparently, it’s the clothes-ironing kind.

In a scene transition from the latest “Star Wars” movie “The Last Jedi,” what initially appears to be a spaceship ready for touchdown is soon revealed to be something far less imposing ― an iron ready for household duty. We were watching the First Order press its laundry the whole time.

To most fans, the scene is just an innocuous sight gag. Laundry is hilarious, amirite? But to devotees of a cult 1970s parody called “Hardware Wars,” the iron cameo has a lot more steam.

@rianjohnson any confirmation of the ironing scene in #LastJedi being a tribute to 'Hardware Wars'? I loved that movie when I was a kid. Just one more reason to love this new film! — Josh Pattison (@Zozmachine) January 7, 2018

Director Rian Johnson confirmed last year that the iron scene in “The Last Jedi” is an homage to “Hardware Wars,” the first-ever “Star Wars” parody.

San Francisco-based filmmaker Ernie Fosselius created the trailer-style spoof back in 1978, lampooning the big-budget spectacle of what later became known as “A New Hope” with a 13-minute, intentionally hokey short film. Whereas “Star Wars” features special effects-driven spaceships, droids and stormtroopers, “Hardware Wars” features mundane household appliances like irons, vacuums and steamers buzzing around space.

“May the Farce be with you,” the obscure film beckoned about a decade before “Spaceballs” hit theaters.

But what was initially a small parody project has since grown into an unprecedented tour de Force. Thanks perhaps to its endearing cheesiness, and the persistent popularity of “Star Wars,” “Hardware Wars” became one of the most successful short films of all time, reportedly grossing around $500,000 in the first year of its release. It’s still revered by supporters today.

And that’s why so many fans loved the “Hardware Wars” reference built into “Last Jedi.” It’s just that ... the film’s creator didn’t.

It’s true that reactions to “Last Jedi” have been mixed overall. Some audience members loved Johnson’s update of the franchise, some hated it, and some are just professed members of the “alt-right.” As for Fosselius, he’s decidedly not a fan, and he’s been carrying around his arguably legitimate reason for decades.

A NEW GRUDGE

Over the course of an hourlong interview last month and a few subsequent email exchanges with HuffPost, we attempted to unpack Fosselius’ feelings about Johnson’s “Hardware Wars” reference ― and Fosselius’ broader, “Star Wars”-related grievances.

His story began with a few phone calls.

Following the release of “The Last Jedi,” Fosselius said he was “flooded with calls” congratulating him on the “Hardware Wars” allusion. Many of these admirers even supposedly told him they had no intention of seeing “Last Jedi” until they heard there was a “Hardware Wars” reference in it.

Sounds pretty good, no? Uh, no.

“This is the phrase that got me: ‘Aren’t you happy that you finally got into a “Star Wars” film?’” Fosselius said of the various well wishes he received.

“No, I’m not,” he explained. “I did the parody. Why would I want to get into an actual ‘Star Wars’ film?”

Let’s clear some things up: Fosselius didn’t just get into a “Star Wars” movie. He’s already been in a number of them. According to the filmmaker, “Star Wars” sound designers Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom were early fans of his work and they brought him into their studio to do character voices, sound effects and miscellaneous vocal grunts for “Empire Strikes Back,” “Return of the Jedi” and even Lucasfilm’s “Indiana Jones” movies. Fosselius said he wound up rearranging a John Williams piece in “Return of the Jedi,” too. (Burtt and Rydstrom did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.)

Still, Fosselius harbors an even bigger issue. Fans misconstrued his parody as a tribute to George Lucas’ movie, he says, rather than a full-fledged spoof. And as a result, he believes he’s been miscast as “the number-one fan of ‘Star Wars.’”

“That’s how things work,” Fosselius said. “You get absorbed into the thing you’re spoofing because it’s revised. Your intentions are revised.”

So when people told Fosselius they’d spent money on “Last Jedi” tickets just to see the “Hardware” reference, he was annoyed.

“I thought, oh, great. I’m doing business for [‘Last Jedi’]. I’m bringing in customers for their movie,” Fosselius said. “Look, you got to understand. ‘Hardware Wars’ was a parody. It wasn’t a fan film. Oh, god. I’m never going to live it down. It was turned into a fan film.”

“It really sort of pissed me off,” he added, “because I spend my entire life trying to make a name for myself in a very obscure profession, because it’s what came naturally to me, and I consider [my parodies] art. I thought everyone was going to have fun with it.”

THE FARCE AWAKENS

Back in San Francisco in the late 1970s, Fosselius and his team certainly had fun putting together “Hardware Wars.”

Their parody style was simple: create “a really crappy version of something that was huge.” With “Star Wars” being “big budget,” “big box office” and “technically so advanced that you can’t even imagine how they did it,” it was the perfect target.

“I was surrounded by a lot of people who were Trekkies, and [‘Star Wars’ mania] was the next huge leap over ‘Star Trek’ worship, you know?” said Fosselius. “And there were already rumors out about how amazing [‘A New Hope’] was and people had that glazed look in their eyes saying this is the best thing that has ever happened in movies. That’s a call to me. Yeah, let’s put things into perspective.”

The parody’s creator described the project that followed as “a spontaneous group effort.” He delivered the initial pitch to producer Michael Wiese in a Chinese restaurant in 1977.

“For props, he used what was available,” Wiese told HuffPost. “A soy sauce bottle was a spaceship. He just had me on the floor. Of course, the people in the restaurant were like, there’s a crazy person in the booth.”

But the antics worked; Wiese was onboard.

From there, Fosselius recruited an eclectic group of friends and a number of co-workers from the animation company Imagination, Inc., where he worked on “Sesame Street” cartoons.

Their budget was nearly nonexistent, reportedly only $8,000. But that worked for the purposes of mocking a big budget blockbuster with an intentionally chintzy production.

“Everyone said, ’I got the camera’ or ‘Let’s do this and borrow that’ and ‘I work at a place so let’s get in there at night and shoot in there,’” he said. “It was probably the last thing that I know of where that was possible.”

Pretty soon, steam irons and toasters were soaring through space on obviously visible fishing line, while droids 4-Q-2 and Artie Deco traversed desolate landscapes complete with suspiciously earthling-like sunbathers in the background. Heroes like Fluke Starbucker (Scott Mathews), a Luke Skywalker knockoff with a lopsided wig; Princess Anne-Droid (Cinthia Freeling), a Leia wannabe with stale bread buns for hair; and Ham Salad (Bob Knickerbocker), a Han Solo-esque “ace mercenary pilot and intergalactic wise-guy” were teaming up to save the galaxy from evil ne’er-do-wells like Darph Nader.

It was tacky. It was corny. “It was magic,” Fosselius said.

According to the filmmaker, even the short movie’s casting sort of worked itself out. For example, Imagination, Inc. animator Jeff Hale seamlessly slipped into the Obi-Wan-Kenobi-type role of Augie ‘Ben’ Doggie because he had the voice for it.

“I said, ‘You have a British accent. You gotta play him,’” Fosselius said. “He had a beard, so it was perfect.”

And legendary voice actor Paul Frees ― a friend of Imagination Inc. co-founder Walt Kramer ― somehow consented to provide narration for “Hardware Wars.” At the time, he was the go-to guy for everything from voice-overs in movie trailers to playing the voice of God in different projects. (He reportedly narrated the original “Star Wars” teaser.)

“This guy makes more money than anybody ever made in the voice-over business. He’s the main guy. So for the balls to go over there and say, ‘Oh, we need a couple of voices,’” said Fosselius, recalling how Kramer convinced Frees to do the lines in exchange for some maintenance work on his recording equipment.

Fosselius said Frees called him one day after “Hardware Wars” was released.

“I answer the phone and [Frees] says, ‘Are you Ernie?’ And I go, ‘Oh no, he found out something. The unmistakable voice of God!’ And I was like, ‘Yeees, sir,’” Fosselius recalled. ”[He goes], ‘How did you get my voice?’ I said, ‘Well, remember Walt Kramer fixed your machines and you agreed to read a couple of lines?’ ‘Oh right. Never mind.’ Click.”

“He’d forgotten about it,” Fosselius said. “But it scared the crap out of me. I thought I was gonna get sued.”

The film was said to be initially available on 16 mm through Pyramid, a nontheatrical distributor known for educational films. Students watched “Hardware Wars” in classrooms and it gained a grassroots following from there.

Pyramid sent the film out to festivals where it won various awards, including the Most Popular Short Film of the Year at the 1978 Chicago Film Festival. Eventually it was enlarged to 35 mm and played in theaters across the country.

“For years, it ran with ‘Rocky Horror’ every Saturday night at the UC Theater in Berkeley [California] among other ‘cult film’ venues in other cities,” Fosselius said.

THE LUCAS EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

Though Fosselius’ film was a financial success, the “Hardware Wars” creator said he didn’t see a lot of profits from the movie. Still, he mostly laments the fact that his original goal ― to create a belittling spoof ― has been lost.

Today, “Hardware Wars” is one of the most revered “fan films” ever, and Fosselius thinks George Lucas might be partly to blame for it.

Over the years, Lucas has apparently spoken openly about “Hardware Wars,” listing it as one of his most-loved parodies in a 1999 interview on “The Big Breakfast.” He’s also reportedly referred to it as a “cute little film” and his favorite tribute to “Star Wars.” In 2003, Lucasfilm gave “Hardware Wars” a Pioneer Award at the Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards.

The award, in Fosselius’ mind, passed down a misleading verdict: If anyone thought “Hardware Wars” was making fun of “Star Wars,” they were wrong. It was a fan film. It won a Pioneer award, after all!

“It was upsetting,” said Fosselius, “because it wasn’t like Lucas was saying, ‘Oh, that was fun and everybody likes it, and no harm done. That was a parody. It was a spoof. It was fun. It was satire,’ No, he has to make it that I did it because I love the film so much I had to imitate it. That’s how I took it. And if George says that, then that’s the law, and everyone is now thinking that’s what happened.”

Further dismissing any notion that he envisioned “Hardware Wars” as a “Star Wars” tribute or fan film, Fosselius added, “I’ll say one thing. I’ve been in a room with George Lucas about five or six times ― I mean, over 40 years ― and he never talked to me. He never said how he felt about [‘Hardware Wars’].” Representatives for Lucas did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

A few years after “Hardware Wars,” Fosselius parodied Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” with a short 1980 film called “Porklips Now.” Whereas Lucas had virtually ignored the parody artist, “Porklips Now” allegedly earned Fosselius a 3 a.m. call from Coppola himself.

“[Coppola] said, ‘Ernie, I’m gonna be doing some work with Jerry Brown. Come over to my house tomorrow at 10 o’clock,’” Fosselius said of the phone call. “I go, ‘Oh shit. Wait a minute.’ That’s the first thing he said. He didn’t say anything about [‘Porklips Now’]. And it’s Coppola, so I’m thinking ‘Godfather,’ you know? Like, ‘Oh shit.’”

The filmmaker took some precautions. He called a friend to tell him he’d be going to Coppola’s house the next day. He gave the address to the friend and said, “If you don’t hear from me, something bad happened.”

Once there, the director quickly got to the point.

According to Fosselius, Coppola said, “You know, I didn’t like that you made fun of me and the film. It sort of pissed me off. But you got a right to do a parody, so be it. Whatever. Now I’m asking you to help me work on this campaign.” That campaign was Jerry Brown’s 1980 presidential run.

“I love this guy for this, and I respect him,” Fosselius said of Coppola. “He told me and he was honest about it. So that I thought was much better than never talking to me and figuring out some way to discredit me.”

Coppola told HuffPost he couldn’t remember whether or not he asked Fosselius to work on a project for Brown, but he said, “I like and admire Ernie Fosselius and so it could be possible.”

Ernie Fosselius

Ultimately, Fosselius said that the “Hardware Wars” reference hidden inside “The Last Jedi” isn’t the end of the world for him, but “people are making money on this,” he reiterated.

“You can call it a tribute, but a real tribute would pay my rent for a month, or buy me some art supplies,” Fosselius said, “or say something nice about me in the press.”

The “Hardware Wars” creator said he’s still trying to figure out why Johnson wanted to add the tribute at all.

“That’s all I wanted to find out,” he said. “Are you a fan? Why’d you put that in there? Because it might have just been to gather in all the ‘Hardware Wars’ fans that might not have gone and to convert them to being ‘Star Wars’ fans because, ‘Look! We’re cool. We put this obscure reference in here, and everybody showed up.’” Like Burtt, Rydstrom and Lucas, Johnson did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Next time, he’d appreciate a heads-up.

“If you call it a tribute, wouldn’t you want to find out if the person wanted a tribute like that or what that would actually mean?” he said. “It does cement in the idea that I’m a fan, that I’m the number-one fan because I got the number-one award, and all that stuff, which is completely bogus.”

Fosselius still hasn’t seen “The Last Jedi,” and he probably never will. He doesn’t like the digital films and special effects of today ― it “physically bothers” him. He’s nostalgic for classic parodies, too.

“Satire’s probably dead by now,” he said. “It’s pretty dangerous. It’s not something people do.”

With that spirit in mind, Fosselius is able to look back on his film fondly, regardless of those who misread it.Sean Hannity isn’t a fan of Barack Obama, and he’s not fond of the former president’s new portrait either.

Hannity on Tuesday tweeted a remark claiming the portrait had “secret sperm” hidden within the image.

The tweet was deleted, but many on Twitter preserved it and shared screenshots:

Hannity first tweeted this ridiculous, if not racist, thing about Obama's portrait. pic.twitter.com/2ZJivkbY2K — Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) February 13, 2018

Hannity’s tweet linked to a story on his website written by “Hannity Staff” detailing the location of the supposed secret sperm.

Hannity later removed the article, blamed his staff and deleted the tweet. He did not give an explanation on Twitter.

However, Fox News sent a statement from Hannity to the Daily Beast: “Earlier today my web staff posted content that was not reviewed by me before publication. It does not reflect my voice and message and, therefore, I had it taken down.”

Hannity has railed against major news outlets, claiming they are inaccurate and insisting that he checks facts first.

“Liberal sheep think I should run wild with @nytimes anonymous sources and not confirm myself,” he said last month.

Apparently, in this case, he didn’t confirm his own website himself.

BuzzFeed notes that the “secret sperm” theory was circulating on 4chan before it hit Hannity’s website.

Although the interview originally aired in March 2017, Hanks’ comments about his wife, actress Rita Wilson, make it the perfect Valentine’s Day treat.

At the tail end of their conversation, Robinson mentioned that Hank’s wife of 29 years is hot, prompting him to respond like this:

“By the way, she is.”

But the Oscar-winning actor didn’t stop there.

“Sometimes I look at that lady in the morning looking all tousled and warm from bed in her sweats and her hair all piled up on her head … smokin’ hot.”

The couple met in 1981 when Wilson appeared on an episode of Hank’s ABC comedy “Bosom Buddies.” The two got to know each other a little better when they co-starred in the 1985 film “Volunteers.”

Hanks once told GQ (per Good Housekeeping) that he instantly felt a spark with Wilson.WASHINGTON ― Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the CIA, says the agency shouldn’t have used its infamous enhanced interrogation techniques, a week after she repeatedly refused to take a stand on the program’s morality at her Senate confirmation hearing.

In a letter sent on Monday to Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Haspel said that the controversial methods that sought to gain information from terrorism suspects in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks “did damage to our officers and our standing in the world.”

“While I won’t condemn those that made these hard calls, and I have noted the valuable intelligence collected, the program ultimately did damage to our officers and our standing in the world,” Haspel said in the letter, first obtained by CNN. “With the benefit of hindsight and my experience as a senior agency leader, the enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken.”

Warner on Tuesday said he now plans to support Haspel’s nomination, virtually assuring her confirmation by the full Senate.

At her confirmation hearing, Haspel told lawmakers she would not restart the agency’s torture program ― which included waterboarding ― if confirmed as the CIA’s director. But she repeatedly dodged the question of whether it was appropriate.

According to CNN, Haspel refrained from doing so in the public portion of her hearing because “she did not want to be seen as publicly criticizing her colleagues at the CIA.”

Haspel’s reluctance to condemn the interrogation techniques spurred Republican Sen. John McCain, who was tortured while in captivity during the Vietnam War, to announce his opposition to her nomination. McCain made the announcement from his home in Arizona, where he is battling brain cancer.

McCain’s move, in turn, prompted an embarrassment for the Trump administration when a White House aide at a private meeting jokingly dismissed the senator’s opposition because “he’s dying anyway.” The White House has resisted calls for a public apology over the remark.

In her Monday letter, Haspel said that she would refuse “to undertake any proposed activity that is contrary to my moral and ethical values.” The statement appeared to be aimed at skeptical senators who asked Haspel whether she would restart the program if ordered to do so by Trump.

The letter comes ahead of Wednesday’s committee vote on her nomination ― which she is expected to clear, thanks to the support of at least one Democrat ― Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Warner had been facing pressure from liberal activist groups to oppose Haspel. But he has praised her qualifications, and said last week during the public portion of her confirmation hearing that she needed to make the kind of disavowal of torture she made Tuesday.

Warner told reporters on Tuesday that Haspel’s disavowal of the program gave him more confidence about how she would perform as CIA director.

“The letter better reflected some of the conversations that I’ve had with her on an individual basis,” he said. “I wanted to make sure where she [stood] in terms of that this program won’t happen again and that she would stand up against this president if he tries to [engage] the country in an illegal or inappropriate matter.”

In a statement announcing his support for Haspel, Warner said, “I acknowledge that this has been a difficult decision.”

While saying he wished she “had been more open with the American public during this process,” he added that he had been impressed with the backing Haspel enjoys “among rank-and-file members of the intelligence community and from intelligence community leaders who served” under President Barack Obama.

Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), another member of the intelligence committee, told HuffPost that Haspel’s letter did not change his view that she should not be confirmed.

Read her letter below:

Warner’s announcement of support for Haspel and comments by him.So it is written in the pop-culture bible: No heroic quest is complete without a dark night of the soul, that pivotal moment when a costumed crusader questions his or her ability to protect the world or else reaches an impasse about how to do so.

This crossroads occurs in Marvel’s newest chapter, “Black Panther,” but it feels more like a “Lion King” homage than a comic-book cliché. After the titular warrior T’Challa has been crowned ruler of the African nation Wakanda, his late father appears to him against the violet twilight, just as Mufassa materialized in young Simba’s hour of need. “I am not ready to be without you,” the mourning T’Challa tells his papa, who gently promises that T’Challa has spent his life training for this precious juncture. He’s gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware.

A mighty king indeed, one whose story vastly outshines the 22 movies and 10 television series logged since the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe began in 2008 and the DC Extended Universe launched in 2011.

Like many a franchise, “Black Panther” steeps itself in well-trod mythology ― Arthurian folklore, James Bondian valor, and, yes, a fitting dose of “The Lion King,” which itself borrows from “Hamlet.” In most instances, particularly when it comes to the mind-numbingly homogenous superhero craze, listing the tropes we’ve seen a dozen times over is a dispiriting exercise. Not here.

Thanks to the careful work of director Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the “Black Panther” script with “American Crime Story” scribe Joe Robert Cole, the movie’s familiar elements are comforting instead of tiresome. That’s because what bookends them is fresh and more invigorating than anything this genre has produced in the 21st century.

Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan in "Black Panther." Walt Disney Studios

Of course, a lot of that is owed to the fact that no superhero flick has ever looked like this. None has had an almost exclusively black cast, and most are likelier to take place in the far reaches of outer space or some version of New York City than they are a fictional utopia in Africa.

And even the brightest spots in the Marvel and DC catalogs don’t feature characters as nuanced and interesting as the ones seen in T’Challa’s homeland, where muscular women are heroes, warring with other nations is not the answer, armored rhinos act as guards and everyone’s attire glitters so spectacularly it might as well have catwalked straight off a Wakanda Fashion Week runway.

As the poised but restrained T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman, our de facto biopic master thanks to his roles as Jackie Robinson (“42”), James Brown (“Get On Up”) and Thurgood Marshall (“Marshall”), once again proves himself a sturdy leading man. He’s aided by a choice ensemble that includes Lupita Nyong’o as a charitable operative and well-rounded love interest, Danai Gurira as the captain of a female squadron, “Get Out” breakout Daniel Kaluuya as T’Challa’s right-hand confidant, MVP Letitia Wright as his quippy tech-whiz sister Shuri, Angela Bassett as his royally robed mother, Forest Whitaker as an Obi-Wan-esque archbishop who oversees the crowning of Wakanda’s monarch, and Martin Freeman as an American CIA envoy who joins T’Challa in protecting his paradise.

In an inspired casting choice, it’s Michael B. Jordan, a stud among heroic studs after “Fantastic Four” and his previous Coogler collaborations (“Creed” and the fantastic 2013 indie “Fruitvale Station”), who becomes T’Challa’s foil. Sporting a mean mug and a gritty dreadlocked updo, Jordan plays Erik Killmonger, a fallen angel who returns to the birthplace that exiled him with one mission in mind: overthrowing T’Challa and bandaging the emotional scars hardening his superpower-hunting soul. Killmonger seeks vengeance that would demolish Wakanda’s isolated, technologically rich culture ― the very culture that has avoided colonialism and relieved its inhabitants of the systematic racism blanketing the globe. Jordan brings a grizzled vigor to the screen without losing what makes good villains so potent: a tangible sense of the injustices life has brought upon them.

T’Challa and Killmonger’s conflict yields a smattering of battles, as is routine for any comic-book spectacle’s third act. And the action itself is far from perfect. Like too many films of this ilk, it’s smothered in gaudy computer-generated renderings and edited for maximum velocity, detracting from the intimate character beats Coogler has laid out. However judicious it is overall, “Black Panther” further proves these movies would be better with less capital. Even our craftiest filmmakers can’t resist hitting that extra VFX keystroke when allotted, in this case, a reported $200 million budget. Jumping from the lush flora and fauna of Wakanda ― that resourceful land where sunrises and sunsets punctuate unfathomable sci-fi beauty ― to the overcooked culminating fight sequences is like a rude jolt in an otherwise smooth roller coaster. (Credit for the aforementioned beauty goes to director of photography Rachel Morrison, whose work on “Mudbound” just made her the first woman nominated for the cinematography Oscar.)

To its benefit, “Black Panther” isn’t overflowing with these gangbuster action scenes. In fact, a couple of its most thrilling moments are ritualistic hand-to-hand skirmishes set atop a multihued mountain where onlookers’ uniforms form a rainbow of colors.

Even down to those onlookers, this is far more character-driven than anything Marvel has done, and I don’t mean “character-driven” in the vein of, say, “Thor: Ragnarok,” a romp that tried oh-so-hard to reinvent the wheel via canned, quirky humor. Here, everyone is steeped in the mythos of their ancestry but committed to a more diplomatic future. Their wisecracks are grounded in the politics of Wakanda and its relationship to other regions, as when Shuri says of Freeman’s agent, “Great, another broken white boy for us to fix.”

To wit, “Black Panther” thawed my superhero-agnostic heart, which, with all due respect to the objectively well-made “Dark Knight” and the first “Spider-Man” go-round, hasn’t truly adored one of these movies since Tim Burton was making Batman. Until now, at least.

“Black Panther” gives voices to people we rarely see in big-budget, mythology-heavy Hollywood productions, and it does so with just enough serenity to avoid feeling like a factory-produced cog in the interconnected Marvel wheel. No superhero tale is apolitical, but this one’s social undercurrents, about protecting neighbors and banding together to furnish a better society, are especially resonant as our government tells us how to make America great again. Coogler is among the best in his class: All hail Wakanda, where history bridges the past with all that’s to come.

“Black Panther” opens in theaters Feb. 16.In Pennsylvania, there is Goofy kicking Donald Duck. In Maryland, a “broken-winged pterodactyl.” In Illinois, there are earmuffs.

To the naked eye, these districts are the smoking gun of gerrymandering. But experts say that while an unusual outline can indicate something is amiss, evaluating the unfairness of a gerrymander runs much deeper than looking at shape.

The complexity of diagnosing a gerrymander is currently on display in Pennsylvania, where top Republicans released a proposed fix for the state’s congressional map on Friday.

In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that the state’s congressional map “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s constitution, and the plan put forth on Friday contained districts that looked a little tidier.

Goofy kicking Donald Duck was gone, but analysis of the new plan shows that the redrawn districts would benefit Republicans. Brian Amos, a redistricting expert at the University of Florida, found in his analysis that President Donald Trump would beat Hillary Clinton in 12 of the state’s 18 electoral districts ― the same results that would have happened under the old plan. Under the map currently in place, Republicans control 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats, despite winning about 50 percent of the statewide vote. There are more than 800,000 more registered Democrats in the state than Republicans.

Pennsylvania Republicans drew the state's 7th congressional district to maximize the influence of GOP voters. The odd shape of the district, often referred to as Goofy kicking Donald Duck, was infamous for being one of the worst examples of gerrymandering in the United States. United States Department of The Interior

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) rejected the Republican proposal on Tuesday, saying it still amounted to an unfair gerrymander that benefited Republicans. Now, the state Supreme Court is likely to draw a fairer map. What those maps will look like is still to be determined.

To be sure, some lines will zig and zag in order to preserve certain communities. The important question is not what the districts look like, but whether there is a legitimate reason they look like that.

Keith Gaddie, a political science professor at the University of Oklahoma who helped Wisconsin Republicans draw the state’s legislative map in 2011, said trying to determine a gerrymander using shape alone was like trying to diagnose cancer just by looking at one’s skin.

“It can be a melanoma, [or] you could just have an ugly mole,” he said in an interview with HuffPost.

Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who closely follows redistricting issues, criticized efforts to name misshapen districts after strange creatures. He says communities just aren’t organized in neat, geometrical shapes. When you superimpose districts on a Google Map, Levitt says, you can sometimes see that they’re drawn to follow highways, rivers and other barriers that provide a rationale for why districts look really weird.

“You shouldn’t only look to squiggly districts as the bad ones,” Levitt told HuffPost. “You should look below some of the good-looking ones too. And you should dig a little bit deeper into the squiggly ones to see if they’re actually bad.”

To Levitt, one has to look beyond shape and to lawmakers’ rationale in order to assess a gerrymander. Advances in technology and statistical modeling now provide a powerful set of tools that can be used to study electoral districts.

In Pennsylvania, for example, an expert for those challenging the congressional map used computer software to randomly draw hundreds of maps that were more fair than the one Republicans put in place. The analysis offered concrete evidence that Republicans were concerned with partisan advantage over other factors when they drew the state’s congressional map.

“If you can explain why Goofy is kicking Donald Duck, and if that’s a real community with real profound distinct representational interests, maybe it doesn’t matter that Goofy is kicking Donald Duck,” Levitt said. “And if you can’t, maybe that indicates that there’s something more nefarious in mind.”

During oral argument at the Supreme Court, lawyers for Pennsylvania Republicans didn’t attempt to offer an explanation for their congressional map other than partisan intent. In North Carolina, a Republican in charge of the redistricting process openly admitted that the reason they drew the map to give Republicans a 10-3 advantage in Congress was because it was not possible to draw a map that gave Republicans more seats.

While partisanship underlies some of the country’s most oddly shaped districts, there is a reasonable explanation for why a district has a weird shape.

In Illinois, Republicans have pointed to the earmuff-shaped 4th congressional district as an example of an egregious gerrymander drawn to preserve Democratic representation.

The Voting Rights Act prohibits lawmakers from drawing lines that dilutes the influence of minority voters, and the 4th congressional district is drawn that way to preserve the influence of Latino voters, said Michael McDonald, a redistricting expert and professor at the University of Florida.

The district looks like earmuffs because Latino voters live in two pockets separated by a largely African-American community, McDonald said. The odd earmuff shape ensures that the African-American voters don’t dilute the influence of Latino voters and vice versa.

“The question that was faced back in 1992, when the district was first created, was, ‘How do you simultaneously give representation to African Americans and to Latinos?’ You can’t do it by just drawing a district that would be in compact form. You couldn’t do that. That would cut through the African-American community,” McDonald said.

The unusual shape of the district appears to have its intended effect. In 1992, the voters in Illinois’ 4th district elected Luis Gutierrez to represent them, making him the first elected Hispanic member of Congress from the midwest.

The way we draw districts is about something much deeper than shape, Levitt said. It’s about how Americans can expect their elected representatives to advance their interests.

“When you only look to shape, I think you’re losing why we lose representation in the first place,” he said. “When you have a representative who’s in a legislature and they represent the tech industry, or the farm industry, or the north side of town or the south Side of town, then you can hold your representative accountable because you know what they’re supposed to be doing.”

Lacking a common interest can increase partisanship, Levitt says, because people begin to fall back on party affiliation as they only way to gauge whether or not their representative is doing a good job.Oscar Isaac became synonymous with eating Flamin’ Hot Limón Crunchy Cheetos with chopsticks, when a photo of him doing just that went viral in 2016.

The “Star Wars” star seemed to be caught mid-act in the photo, wearing a black beanie, a red sweater and a thick mustache while enjoying his snack. It was a simple yet perplexing scene, and it spawned memes and copycats across the Internet:

Isaac finally broke down the story behind the viral photo Tuesday night on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The actor first explained the counter was littered with medicine because he had “a bad cold,” and he said that he had a mustache because of his character in the HBO mini-series “Show Me A Hero.”

“I really was into flaming lime Cheetos, which at the time you couldn’t get on the East Coast, it’s just from here” he told Kimmel, whose show is filmed in Los Angeles. “Chili-lime, it’s a very Latino kind of thing.”

But why the chopsticks? Because the internet’s boyfriend likes to keep it classy, of course.

“I’m a sophisticated gentleman, so I didn’t want to get the powder on my fingers,” Isaac said.

Chalamet’s interview with the magazine, written by Daniel Riley, discusses how he came up in the acting world, scoring roles in two of the hottest films of 2017 (“Call Me by Your Name” and “Lady Bird”), and reveals an adorable interaction with his grandmother. Riley describes the 22-year-old as “brimming” with “exuberance that’s reined in by a sober conscientiousness.”

GQ’s article also includes this lovely image of Chalamet offered by “Lady Bird” writer-director Greta Gerwig: “He’s Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio. A heartthrob but with thoroughbred acting chops. Everyone else will be amazed by what he grows into, but I won’t — I’ve always known that he’s a unicorn.”Like father, like son.

Donald Trump Jr. used Twitter to launch an unprovoked attack on U.S. Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon on Tuesday night.

President Donald Trump’s eldest son responded to a report in The Hill that said Rippon, 28, didn’t want his experience at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to be defined by his stance against Vice President Mike Pence.

Really? Then Perhaps you shouldn’t have spent the past few weeks talking about him. I haven’t heard him mention you once??? https://t.co/8lcCsoyBsq — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 14, 2018

Trump Jr. overlooked one key detail. Pence mentioned Rippon on Twitter just last week, and also reportedly asked to meet with him before the Winter Games.

.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Don’t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get ‘em! — Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) February 8, 2018

Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics, helped Team USA win a bronze medal in the figure skating team event on Monday. Last month, he called out Pence’s intolerance toward the LGBTQ community, and blasted the vice president’s decision to lead the U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. The athlete also said he’d rebuff a White House invite to a post-Games party.

Rippon has not commented on Trump Jr.’s tweet.

Some respondents suggested the skater should leave politics out of the Olympics. The majority, however, called out Trump Jr.:

But for others, there’s a new dark, yet fun, dating app inspired by the Netflix sci-fi series waiting for you to play with it.

Netflix has created its own iteration of the dating system used in the Season 4 episode, “Hang The DJ.”

For those who haven’t watched the show, the app in the story allows couples to see their relationship expiry date.

The new IRL app allows you to go to coach.dating, gather a link to send to your partner, and simultaneously click a button to determine how long your love will last.

Just like on the Netflix show, the function only works if both people agree to reveal the expiration date. Both you and your partner have to push a button to reveal the date within five seconds of each other.

I tried it with a friend, and we learned the app expects us to be together for 11 years. We figure we wouldn’t make it 11 minutes together romantically, so we can’t guarantee this app’s accuracy.

Another feature of the app that matches the show is that should you back out of the reveal at the last second, the expiration of your relationship will “recalibrate” in a punitive way.Barack and Michelle Obama always come up with the sweetest ways to celebrate major milestones in their relationship ― and this Valentine’s Day is no exception.

Talk about a “swagalicious” husband.

Take a look back on some of the couple’s sweetest moments together below:Jan-Kristòf Louis and Kellan Mansano

How did you two meet? How long have you been together?



My high school friends were his college friends. We met on Jan. 20, 2006, at Hunter College. I went to Cooper Union at the time but hung out on the third-floor bridge at Hunter with my former high school friends where I met Kellan. We are going on 12 years together this year.



How do you define black love, and how does your relationship exemplify that?



I wasn’t aware of being black until I moved to this country [from Haiti]. Kellan is a caseworker working on his master’s to become a social worker, and I am a fifth-grade teacher in the East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn. We both work with underprivileged and impoverished communities. However, that never stopped us from seeing the enrichment in the communities that we ourselves are part of. My students don’t see a lot of the traditional relationships that children in wealthier districts are accustomed to. When my students hear about my relationship with Kellan, that we dated, that we are planning to get married and that we want children and build a family, it opens up a door of wealth to them that they never thought possible for them. Black love tends to be either nonexistent or broken around them. I had a student once ask me if I was gay because I was too nice to girls. I wasn’t out to my students at the time. Now they ask frequently about Kellan and have actually written cards for us to wish us the best for the wedding and on. Last year, all my girls wanted to be flower girls and all the boys wanted to be our best men. They didn’t just see it as gay love. They saw two men they could look up to, capable of loving one another fully despite the adversities that they have faced.



In which ways do you see your relationship as a queer couple represented in conversations about black love, if any?



Kellan and I speak about this often when it comes to our parents, our friends and the media. We are the only black gay couple our friends know. They tell us quite often. There are no television shows with a black gay couple in the lead or in any type of supporting role. There are no romantic comedies with black gay couples. When black gay men are represented in the media, they tend to be accessories to the heterosexual woman or going through a tragic stage of their life. There are no quirky posters about gay black couples. Instead, we see warnings to inform your partner of your HIV status but not an advertisement for Match.com. We may ignore it as a society, but it is ingrained in our society to the point that as queer black people, we tend to not see relationships evolving into marriage and family possible for us. I still speak to some of my former students who have divulged to me that when they think of Kellan and I, they know black, queer love is real. If we can move the children, we can surely move the world.



How can we ensure queer couples are included in conversations about black love?



When it comes to involving queer couples in conversations about black love, we need to be inclusive. The LGBT community is a wide spectrum of brilliant types of people, and they simply cannot be being ignored. Let’s talk about the couples that we know. Let’s make that effort to believe that we can change the narrative about love by taking part in it ourselves. Let’s remember why it was so difficult to say “I love you” because they knew how important it was and what it meant for the future. There are plenty of stories out there about black love that are not being represented. We can make the effort to push them in the forefront.Michael Cohen, personal attorney for President Donald Trump, told The New York Times on Tuesday that he paid Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. porn star Stormy Daniels)$130,000 in 2016. However, he insisted that the money was his own.

“Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,” Cohen told the newspaper. “The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”

He did not explain what the payment was for.

Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Daniels had an affair with Trump in 2006, the year after he married Melania and a few months after the birth of their son, Barron. Daniels was reportedly paid $130,000 just before the 2016 election to sign a nondisclosure agreement and keep silent about the matter.

The White House has denied the affair, and Daniels has released statements also rebuffing the reports.

“Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t cause you harm or damage,” Cohen told BuzzFeed. “I will always protect Mr. Trump.”

Last month, InTouch magazine printed a previously unpublished 2011 interview with Daniels in which she spoke at length about the alleged affair. The conversation was conducted before the nondisclosure agreement.

The $130,000 payment came under scrutiny after watchdog group Common Cause filed a complaint to determine if it ran afoul of campaign laws as an in-kind contribution.A mystery some 3,000 years in the making may have just been solved.

While many Egyptian mummies look serene, one mummy has baffled scientists for the pained expression on his face.

“The gruesome mummy of Unknown Man E, also known as the ‘Screaming Mummy,’ has long puzzled scholars,” Egyptologist and former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass told Al-Ahram Weekly.

Now scholars believe they finally know why the mummy looks so anguished: There’s at least some chance he was, in fact, screaming at the time of his death.

Hawass said DNA tests have confirmed a leading theory that the mummy was likely Prince Pentewere. He was sentenced to die and likely hanged for his role in the assassination of his father, Ramses III, who ruled in the 12th century BC.

The screaming mummy was unusual for more than just the agonized look on his face.

“We found this mummy covered in sheepskin,” Hawass told National Geographic in 2008. “In the mind of the ancient Egyptian… to cover with sheepskin means he was not clean, he did something [bad] in his life.”

The mummy also had no grave marker, which according to custom at the time, would deny him a role in the afterlife. His hands and feet were bound and he wasn’t given a traditional mummification process.

“He was not even mummified, but was merely left to dry in natron and then had some resin poured into his open mouth,” Al-Ahram Weekly reported.

Yet the mummy was found buried with other members of the royal family.

“Two forces were acting on this mummy: one to get rid of him and the other to try and preserve him,” Bob Brier, an archaeologist at Long Island University who has examined the body, told The Sun. “For some reason, there was an attempt to make sure that he didn’t have an afterlife, and in another attempt, somebody cared about him and tried to override that.”Smashed Tesla Model S after Utah crash. Courtesy Sotuh Jordan Police Department

The Tesla Autopilot system was engaged when a Tesla Model S sedan was crushed as it rammed into a stopped truck at 60 mph in Utah last week, the driver has told police. The driver luckily escaped with only a broken foot, though the car suffered extensive damage.

When interviewed by police, the Tesla’s 28-year-old driver “said that she had been using the ‘Autopilot’ feature,” and was looking at her phone shortly before the accident in South Jordan, near Salt Lake City, according to a statement Monday from South Jordan Police Sgt. Sam Winkler.

Winkler told The Deseret News that the diver, who hasn’t been identified by police, had entered an address into the car’s GPS and was looking on her phone for possible alternate routes. She “looked up just as the accident was about to happen,” he said.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to the accident in a tweet Monday, saying that it was amazing the driver wasn’t more seriously injured. He also complained that the crash was being unfairly covered by the media, which he said often overly focuses on the Autopilot system while ignoring regular fatal highway accidents.

What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018

It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018

But Musk also admitted that the system “certainly needs to be better.”

It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018

The semi-autonomous Tesla Autopilot system is supposed to maintain certain speeds, automatically brake when necessary and even change lanes. But Tesla emphasizes that “every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active when using Autopilot, and must be prepared to take action at any time.”

There was no indication that brakes were used when the car crashed. “Based upon witness information, the driver of the Tesla did not brake or take any action to avoid the collision,” Winkler said in his statement.

The Tesla driver could face charges for failing to maintain the safety of her car, which would be a traffic infraction, Winkler told The Associated Press.

Police are “currently working with technicians from Tesla to gather and review data stored within the vehicle, which may take several days,” said Winkler. Police have contacted the National Transportation Safety Board about the accident, but the NTSB has not yet launched its own investigation.

The NTSB is already investigating the Autopilot system in a crash of a Tesla Model X in California in March in which the driver was killed. The NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are also probing a fiery crash of a Model S earlier this month in Florida that left two teens dead. Officials are reportedly investigating the emergency response to the serious battery fire that occurred.New Jersey Synod Bishop Tracie Bartholomew blesses Rev. Peter Beeson at St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church's baptismal font. Jennifer Nilsen/St Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church

Many Bible stories recount how God changed followers’ names to recognize their new identities. In Genesis, Abram’s name was changed to Abraham to reflect his new identity as the father of the Jewish people. And in the Christian gospels, Jesus changed his follower Simon’s name to Peter to symbolize that the apostle would be the “rock” upon which the church was built.

Echoing that tradition, a Lutheran congregation in New Jersey recently marked a milestone in the life of its pastor with a renaming ceremony. On Sunday, parishioners watched their transgender pastor take on his new chosen name ― Peter.

It was a sacred way for Hoboken’s St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church to acknowledge and bless the Rev. Peter R. Beeson’s gender transition.

Beeson told HuffPost that it was also important for the congregation to demonstrate the “expansiveness of God’s compassion.”

“The renaming ceremony provided an opportunity ... for us to show the broader world that there are faithful Christians who support LGBTQ+ people and offer a counter message to the one of fear and hate so prevalent today,” Beeson told HuffPost. “Particularly for people who may be pondering their gender identity or sexual orientation ― particularly young people ― this provided us an opportunity to say that God loves you, and that all people are created in the image of God.”

“Particularly for people who may be pondering their gender identity or sexual orientation... this provided us an opportunity to say that God loves you.” - Rev. Peter R. Beeson

St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a mainline Protestant denomination. The New Jersey Synod of the ELCA has a history of affirming and welcoming LGBTQ clergy members and lay leaders.

Halfway through the traditional Sunday service, Beeson and the New Jersey Synod’s bishop, Tracie Bartholomew, walked over to the church’s baptismal font. Bartholomew spoke about the ways that God changed people’s names in the Bible. A church leader then asked the congregation a series of questions about supporting Beeson in his transition and being a welcoming Christian community.

Bartholomew blessed Beeson with water from the font and welcomed him by his new name.

“It was powerful to hear the congregation re-commit to their long history of inclusion and promise to be a safe and welcoming congregation for all people who are seeking a Christian community,” Beeson said about the ceremony.

Daniel Stoll, a church council member, told HuffPost that the ceremony was “beautiful.” The church was packed with three times more visitors than is typical for a Sunday service, he said.

However, Stoll said the congregation has also received “a lot of negativity” online and through office calls from those who “think they can judge for God.”

“[Gay and trans individuals] have every right to be their authentic selves as anyone. God didn’t make a mistake,” Stoll told HuffPost. “Jesus teaches us to love every individual. The hate has to stop.”

Rev. Peter Beeson has served as pastor of St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church since October 2014. Jennifer Nilsen/St Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church

Beeson told HuffPost that he has long felt a calling to be a minister. Growing up, his fundamentalist, evangelical Christian parents often had missionaries stay over at the family home in Arizona. In the tradition he belonged to, women were only permitted to be missionaries or Sunday school teachers. As a child, Beeson thought he would one day become a missionary as well.

Coming out as queer in his late teens forced Beeson to wrestle with his Christian faith and eventually leave his parents’ religious tradition. Years later, he said he was drawn by the Holy Spirit to return to the church. He joined an inclusive ELCA congregation in Phoenix.

“With time, I fell in love with the Lutheran emphasis on grace and divine action ― that means God finds us, rather than the fundamentalist interpretation that we have to find or earn God’s forgiveness by being holy,” Beeson said.

As he became more involved in the life of that congregation, the ministerial calling from childhood resurfaced. Beeson’s mentors also encouraged him to go to seminary and become a pastor.

Beeson has served as pastor of St. Matthew Trinity since October 2014.

He said one of his favorite passages in the Bible is the story of how Jesus broke the social norms of his time to speak with a Samaritan woman at a well. To Beeson, the ancient Bible story has personal implications.
