When Franz Ferdinand released “Take Me Out” in 2004, the song came in hot, to say the least.

The track, which appeared on the Scottish band’s self-titled debut album, became a radio favorite in the U.K. and soon made its way to the United States. It eventually topped a number of year-end lists, with The Village Voice’s popular Pazz & Jop poll naming it the single of the year. NME magazine ranked “Take Me Out” No. 16 on its 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever list, and in 2010, Rolling Stone put “Take Me Out” on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time tally.

“Take Me Out” put Franz Ferdinand on the map, and the Scottish rockers have been at it ever since. Now they are just days away from releasing their fifth album, “Always Ascending.” Described as an album filled with “catchy, dance-floor-friendly songs,” the upcoming set marks a step forward for the band.

Franz Ferdinand has a new lineup, too. Guitarist Nick McCarthy left to raise his family, so Julian Corrie (keyboards, guitar) has stepped in to join frontman Alex Kapranos, bassist Bob Hardy and drummer Paul Thomson. Dino Bardot (formerly of the Glasgow three-piece group 1990s) has come on board as well.

I caught up with Kapranos by phone in January ahead of the new album release.

Are you in New York right now?

I am, I’m actually backstage at “The Tonight Show.” We’re doing Fallon tonight, so yes, I’m just sitting in the dressing room here.

Do you ever get nervous about that kind of thing, doing a big national television show?

I hadn’t got nervous until you put it like that. [laughs] No, I actually really enjoy the buzz of doing these kind of gigs, because it’s so intense. There’s a big buildup and it’s all day, you have in the back of your mind. You know there’s millions of people watching and all that. Then when you actually do it, it quite contrasts to a regular gig, where you spread out the adrenaline over 90 minutes or whatever and it’s just over in four minutes at the most, and man ― it’s like afterwards, your body is literally shaking with the adrenaline. It’s great, it’s really good fun. I’d recommend it to anybody... It’s like sprinting versus the 1,500 meters.

I got an early listen of [the album], and I’m really enjoying what you’re doing here. You called it a little bit “futuristic and naturalistic”... Can you elaborate on that in terms of the sound you were going for on this record?

I guess, like, we were searching for the sonics, like trying to widen the sound, go to places that haven’t been to before, [and] with the songwriting as well, to write in ways that we hadn’t, to cover subject matters that we hadn’t. Even lots of technical things. I always worry I’m very boring talking about the chord progressions or scales... It’s like, you don’t need to understand how a clutch works to drive a car. You just need to know when you press that pedal down and it works. I feel the same with songwriting as well. You push yourself into places that you haven’t been to before. I guess that’s our idea of being futuristic, looking to the future...

It’s a rejection of what’s going on around about you right then and what you’ve done before, and trying to take yourself to a new place... That’s the futuristic side of it. But the naturalistic side is while you embrace the capabilities of technology, and there’s a positive rejection of being subservient to your technology or the technology of the studio... That’s at the heart of it. We’re not trying to make a record that sounds like something of the past, something of the future, but it’s performed in the way that human beings have been doing for thousands and thousands of years, I guess.

You mentioned earlier about tackling a different subject that you haven’t tackled before. Can you talk a little bit more about what specifically kind of inspired you this time?

Sure, yes, I’m telling a different story. Some songs, like a song like ”Lazy Boy”... I was literally lying in my girlfriend’s bed while she’d been at work for a couple hours, and just thinking about how lazy I am and embracing my laziness. Kind of like hugely embracing it, sitting and thinking. Because I do believe that some of it you should embrace. If you’re going to be lazy, you should be properly lazy and not feel guilty about it. Enjoy and embrace, make the most of laziness, because as a creative person, laziness is a great opportunity and a great gift because it loosens the fluidity of your mind.

The way that song is different ― I guess the music was different. I feel almost loath to talk about it. When you talk about it, you hear it when you listen to the music. It’s in a funny time change. Everything counts in fives rather than fours or twos, which is what most Western music is written in. I guess I had this idea that so much dance music, you refer to as four-to-the-floor. You’ve got four beats to the bar, sort of four beats to the floor. We wanted to write something that was five beats to the floor.

Franz Ferdinand

I like the song “Lois Lane.” I was going to ask you about that one.

Great. That was an example of a song where [bassist] Bob [Hardy] and I sat down and created characters. There’s two protagonists in the song. We created two personalities, two characters, and a backstory for each of them and how they integrated, in the way that we would if we were writing a screenplay or a short story or a play. Which we hadn’t done so much of in the past. I’ve always drawn upon either our personal experiences or characters that we knew, characters that we’d observed through life. This is the first time we’d sat down to create somebody or a couple of characters who are completely fictional and still searching for that human truth, the understanding of the human condition, but doing it via fictional characters...

We wanted to write characters that were completely opposite from each other... She is a real optimist. He’s not. He thinks altruism is motivated by selfishness, whereas she thinks journalism can change the world. We both liked her a lot more.

After all these years you’ve been so consistently making music, but now you’ve been in the game for a while. How does it feel now, being that this is your fifth album?

It’s our fifth album. Six even ― include the FFS one [a side collaborative release with the band Sparks] as well. It’s a long time... We played our first gig in 2002. That’s 16 years, shit. That’s crazy. It’s great that people are into it, people are loving it. Yes, it’s the best buzz in the world playing a song and seeing people lose their shit over it. It’s really cool. Yes, but we had a lot of fun writing it. We had a lot of fun making this record. If you enjoy making something, the chances are people are probably going to enjoy listening to it, or they’re more likely to enjoy listening to it.

Take me back to the time when your debut came out and “Take Me Out” was all over the place. What was that like for you, being at that height?

It was a rapid flip. Our first single, “Darts of Pleasure,” came out at the end of 2003 and it got to No. 44 on the U.K. charts. We were blown away. We were so happy to chart, never mind right up to the heights of No. 44. And then a month or two later, at the beginning of 2004, “Take Me Out” came out, and I guess everything went quite surreal for a while.

“So if you're lonely / You know I'm here waiting for you / I'm just a crosshair / I'm just a shot away from you.” - Franz Ferdinand, "Take Me Out"

What did you think about when you were writing that song then, versus when you play it now?

I was going to say I don’t think of any songs as being special, but there are certain songs I enjoy playing live ― like, there are certain songs that I look forward to in the set. I always look forward to playing “This Fire.” Some songs come back into the set that you haven’t played for a while. Well, like our third album, “Lucid Dreams.” We hadn’t played it for a while. Now, we played it in rehearsal the other day with a new lineup of the band... It was like, “Man, this is intense.” I’m just really enjoying it. That’s the song that I’m looking forward to at the moment. And “Take Me Out” is one of the songs where people go nuts. It’s a fun song to play. We’re lucky to have it. It’s cool.

You don’t get tired of playing it, then?

I’ve never written a song, we’ve never written a song as a band or recorded it thinking it was any more special than any of the others. Actually, Philippe [Zdar], our producer, he adheres to this theory. He expressed it to so beautifully. He said, he refused to talk about singles when we were recording. We wouldn’t talk about singles either. I think that’s such a healthy attitude. You’re a band and you have a bunch of songs. Afterwards, you decide what the single might be, if you’re going to choose a single. His theory was you don’t talk about it because the other songs will get jealous.

I love that.

I love that idea that the other songs are going to get jealous... It’s funny because I knew that “Take Me Out” was a pretty cool song. But I also kind of knew that “This Fire” was a pretty cool song. I knew that “Come on Home” was a pretty cool song from that record as well... I thought “Tell Her Tonight” from our first album was going to be our biggest single. It ended up not being a single at all. I don’t know, you’ve got no idea. When you write songs, you just write songs because you enjoy writing songs. That’s it.

Dave Edwards

In 2016, you put out the song “Demagogue,” an anti-Trump track. We’re a year into Trump as president... Does it still speak true today, a year and a half later?

Well, he is a demagogue, so of course it rings true... Somebody asked me recently, “You wrote that song making fun of Trump.” It’s like, I wasn’t making fun. It wasn’t humorous. We wrote it because we’re fucking terrified... We wrote and released it very, very quickly because it was pertinent to that time...

We talked about it: “This is an election for a leader that we have no part in. None of us are U.S. citizens.” Immediately, you think, “We’re not U.S. citizens, but that election is going to have an impact not just on the citizens of America but the citizens of every country around the world, us included.” Hey, something’s going to have an impact on you, you’re allowed to have an opinion on it... I just had this horrible feeling of dread right from the beginning of the primaries. You just saw this spectacle in the background and thought, “He is fucking dangerous, that guy.” He’s dangerous because he plays upon the most primal fears and prejudices...

He’s a con man. The most powerful of con men know how to trigger and manipulate people’s fear and prejudice. And that is the definition of a demagogue. That’s what he is. That’s what he’s still doing.

I wanted to ask you, also, how the new lineup has infused the music and kind of given you a jolt of energy and how it’s changed things for you?

It’s been great having Julian in the band, and then Dino joined us after the record was made and joined the tour. Julian’s an incredible musician, such a lovely guy... He played electronica. He’s an instrumentalist. It’s great, because the ideas that we had of making dance music, he really allowed us to execute that in a way that maybe we hadn’t before, because the kind of arrangement that a lot of the songs were written in uses sequences... He’s playing them live. I love that. And Dino is a very different character. Dino is a proper rock star. I love having Dino onstage. It’s like being onstage with Jimmy Page or something. He’s a very cool guy.

Would you consider yourself a proper rock star at this point?

Oh yeah, that’s funny, isn’t it? When you fly into different countries, when you fill out the customs forms and the immigration forms, you have to put an occupation. I always find it difficult filling that in. Then I started to put down “rock star” for a joke... Because it’s such a funny thing. Because I didn’t really consider myself ever to be a rock star. I don’t know. Maybe I’m an accidental rock star. I don’t know.

What Rihanna wants, Rihanna gets.

The singer has made education a philanthropical priority, and just hours after asking the Australian government for a large donation to a global education fund, the country’s foreign minister agreed.

Rihanna on Friday fired off a series of tweets to the leaders of Australia, Britain and France, imploring them to contribute to the Global Partnership for Education, whose annual conference is this weekend in Senegal. Rihanna asked the Australian government to contribute $200 million, tweeting at Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

hi @JulieBishopMP & @TurnbullMalcolm will you step up w/ a 🇦🇺 $200M pledge to #FundEducation at the @GPforEducation conference in Senegal tomorrow? Kick off your 1st year on the #HumanRightsCouncil by giving the universal human right to education! 📚🌏 @claralionelfdn @glblctzn — Rihanna (@rihanna) February 1, 2018

Just seven hours later, Bishop said in a statement that Australia would be contributing $90 million to the Global Partnership for Education ― less than what the singer wanted, but a sizable sum.

“Today I announce a pledge of $90 million by the Australian Government to support quality and inclusive education worldwide through the Global Partnership for Education,” the foreign minister said.

“This pledge forms part of Australia’s commitment to ensuring more children, particularly girls and children with disabilities, participate in school for longer and acquire the skills they need to build their future.”

The Global Partnership for Education, established in 2002, helps provide “quality basic education” for children in 65 developing countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia, Cambodia, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Rwanda.

Bishop didn’t mention Rihanna in her statement, and it’s likely Australia was preparing to contribute even before the “We Found Love” singer’s request.

However, News Corp. reported Rihanna’s tweet was part of a “last-ditch effort” to convince Australia to contribute more to the fund.

“We’ve been working for months but the news from Australia isn’t looking great so [we’re] trying to do one last push,” said Michael Sheldrick, director of policy and advocacy at Global Citizen, a social action group hosting Rihanna at the Senegal conference.

Online, Rihanna fans praised the singer following the Australian announcement.P-23 is gone. Courtesy National Park Service

A mother cougar has been found dead near Malibu Canyon Road after apparently being struck by a vehicle, officials have revealed.

“Unfortunately, her life came to an end prematurely due to the challenge of navigating the complex road network in this area,” Jeff Sikich, biologist for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, said in a statement.

We're saddened to report that mountain lion P-23 appears to have been struck and killed by a vehicle on Malibu Canyon Rd. We found her remains a few days ago near the road.

The nearly 6-year-old California mountain lion, dubbed P-23 by scientists tracking her, was the mother of two kittens (including P-54) born about a year ago, her third litter. Their fate is unknown, but they’re close to the age when kittens typically leave their mother to strike out on their own, said a statement by the National Park Service.

The death this week is the latest sign of the difficult battle for survival the big cats face in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana mountains of the Los Angeles area as housing and highways increasingly encroach on their habitat and inhibit their searches for prey and mates. Los Angeles is one of only two major cities in the world, along with Mumbai, that have big cats living within the city limits.

“Mountain lions are incredible animals that have adapted to live in California’s mountains, canyons and deserts. But these big cats are no match for the network of roads, highways, and sprawl that we’ve built with little regard for their impacts on lions or wildlife connectivity,” J.P. Rose, lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Huffpost.

The National Park Service has studied about 60 mountain lions in and around the Santa Monica Mountains. About 20 adult cougars are believed to live in the Santa Ana Mountains.

P-23 is the 18th mountain lion to be killed in a road collision in the region since 2002. Wildlife and environmental activists have been advocating for the construction of a wildlife crossing over U.S. 101, which would allow for safe, freer access throughout the area by the big cats. The Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing would create a 200-foot-long, 165-foot-wide overpass bridging U.S. 101 west of Liberty Canyon Road in the city of Agoura Hills, but the mission has lagged due to a lack of funds. The California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, released an environmental assessment in September and is reviewing public comments on the project.

The Center for Biological Diversity and other groups support use of state funds for the project. “The crossing is necessary to preserve wildlife connectivity in Southern California that has been disrupted by poor land use and transportation planning,” said Rose.

The center last month joined with the Sierra Club and the Mountain Lion Foundation in a lawsuit against the Altair housing development approved by the city of Temecula in the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California. The suit argues that the 200-acre development and a multi-lane highway would impede the only passage left in the area for wildlife to move between coastal and inland mountains.

P-23 had been a favorite of mountain lion watchers ever since she was spotted by a cyclist in 2013 astride a dead deer on Mulholland Highway in Los Angeles.

She's probably most famous for this incredible photo from 2013, when she was dragging a deer off Mulholland Hwy and a cyclist happened to ride by. Went viral on our Facebook page! pic.twitter.com/NcEkNKWY88 — Santa Monica Mtns (@SantaMonicaMtns) February 1, 2018

P-23′s first two litters were preyed upon by mountain lions or other wildlife. Two kittens from her first litter, P-36 and P-37, were photographed in 2015 being attacked and eaten by P-27, a dominant male in the Santa Monica Mountains. The other dominant male at the time was the kittens’ father, P-12.

Two kittens from P-23′s second litter were also killed by a mountain lion or other wildlife. But a third, surprise, survivor (P-53) was later discovered by researchers.

Here’s a 2015 video of P-53, making the characteristic “chirping” sounds of a mountain lion kitten.

P-23 was a prime example of what’s known as “first-order” inbreeding among the cougars of the area, another problem caused by territory constraints from housing developments and highways. Such inbreeding threatens the survival of the species. P-23 was the result of a mating of P-12 and his daughter. P-23 later also mated with P-12, who was both her father and grandfather, to produce P-36 and P-37. P-23′s half sibling is suspected of being the father of her latest litter.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife will conduct a necropsy of P-23.Twitter trolls best watch out. These NFL stars aren’t taking any of your garbage.

Activists took to the streets of Washington, D.C., this Tuesday to protest the immigration deal President Donald Trump revealed in January.

Immigration advocates from several organizations, including the National Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC), the Korean Resource Center and the Central American Solidarity Association, as well as several Dreamers, held a funeral procession for the “American Dream” on Capitol Hill after Trump unveiled a plan that would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers while harming other immigrants.

“With this funeral procession, we are seeking to stress the urgency of passing a clean DREAM Act now,” Sam Yu of NAKASEC told HuffPost in an email, calling on Congress to pass a plan without measures that would put other immigrants in jeopardy. “For so many folks in our communities, these matters are life and death; with this funeral procession, we are hoping that our legislators will understand that too.”

Protesters marched down the streets of Capitol Hill during the procession. Courtesy of NAKASEC

Dozens of protesters marched around Capitol Hill, holding a coffin with “American Dream” written on the lid, ahead of Trump’s State of the Union address. That evening, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) brought NAKASEC’s Jung Bin Cho, who is a DACA recipient, to the event as a guest.

Yu noted that Trump’s plan disproportionately targets communities of color. The plan includes steep border-security increases and an end to the diversity visa lottery program. It also calls for the end of what Trump calls “chain migration,” a term immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing immigrants to sponsor their family members to join them in the U.S. Immigration activists have long rejected the term, using “family reunification” instead.

The diversity lottery primarily affects immigrants from Eastern Europe and Africa, including those from some of the areas the president reportedly called “shithole countries” in a meeting last month. And the vast majority of Asian immigrants come to the U.S. through the family-based immigration system, reports show.

“This pillar in Trump’s plan makes it clear that he is trying to make America White Again by excluding non-European folks from the country,” Yu said.

However, Yu believes it’s important to continue pushing for a proper solution for Dreamers.A whopping $7.5 million settlement Steve Wynn reportedly reached with a former employee has a possible explanation: It involved a paternity claim, people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News.

The news comes on the heels of a Wall Street Journal exposé in which sources told the outlet the casino mogul engaged in serial sexual harassment in the workplace. The WSJ reported that Wynn reached the multimillion-dollar settlement with a former manicurist, who said Wynn pressured her into sex.

According to Bloomberg, Wynn paid the sum out of pocket in 2005. There is no evidence Wynn, now 76, actually fathered a child with the woman, the outlet reported.

Wynn has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement last week, he said his ex-wife, who is suing him over stock shares, orchestrated the accusations against him.

“The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” he said.

The WSJ story described how Wynn focused his unwanted attentions on his establishments’ service workers, who said their experiences ranged from vulgar comments and inappropriate touching to soliciting sex acts. As CEO of Wynn Resorts, the mogul operates two casinos in Las Vegas and two in China. Another project is under construction in Boston.

Wynn threw his support behind the Donald Trump in the 2016 election, and was hand-picked to serve as finance chair of the Republican National Convention. The WSJ report prompted him to resign from that position.Stephen Colbert has no time for President Donald Trump’s false claim that his State of the Union speech received the highest ratings on TV.

“First, that’s not true,” Colbert said on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.” “Second, it’s a lie.”

The comedian noted how former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all achieved higher viewing numbers for their addresses, but there was a bigger issue at hand.

“Look. It doesn’t matter how many people watched. But what does matter is that the president needs to lie about it. And then somehow get away with it. This is the new world we live in.”John Oliver returned to “Last Week Tonight” on Sunday to tear into Michael Cohen, the personal attorney to President Donald Trump.

Cohen is now embroiled in a scandal over millions of dollars in payments his shell company received in consulting fees, including $500,000 from a firm linked to a Russian oligarch. AT&T also paid Cohen up to $600,000, a move the company later called a “big mistake.”

AT&T told The New York Times that it was hoping to better understand the president’s thinking, but Oliver called that “just ridiculous.”

“If you want to understand this president’s thinking, simply have a donkey kick you in the head five times, and then watch Fox News for 72 hours straight,” Oliver said. “That’ll give you a pretty good idea about what’s going on in his mind.”Seth Meyers took some time out from covering Donald Trump’s presidency to get daytime drunk with singer Kelly Clarkson.

“With all the crazy stuff going on in the world these days, sometimes you just need to take a break and drink during the afternoon,” Meyers said on Thursday’s broadcast of “Late Night.”

Plenty of boozing ensued as the duo chatted, made their own cocktails and took the cognitive test that Trump’s doctor gave him in January. Meyers also offered a unique rendition of Clarkson’s 2004 hit “Since U Been Gone,” before they finished drunkenly screaming from a rooftop.

As Meyers noted, “This is by no means ‘A Closer Look.’”Carlos Barria / Reuters

Most State of the Union speeches get good marks, but fail to change many minds about the presidents who deliver them. President Donald Trump, for once, is right in line with historical precedent.

Trump delivered his first State of the Union address to mildly positive reviews, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, but left most of those who paid attention with the same opinions of his actions and temperament that they had when he started.

By a 9 point-margin, 51 percent to 42 percent, Americans who watched Trump’s speech or saw at least some news coverage of it say they approve. That’s a less warm reception than he received for his speech to Congress last year, which drew a 23-point net approval rating.

State of the Union addresses tend to be well-received for a simple reason ― people who already like the president are more likely to tune in. Trump’s speech, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll, was no exception. Nearly two-thirds of Trump voters said they’d watched at least some of the speech, compared to just 30 percent of Clinton voters and 31 percent of third-party voters and non-voters. Trump voters were about three times more likely than Clinton voters to say they’d watched the entire speech.

Overall, just over a quarter of all Americans say they watched the full address, 13 percent that they saw at least part of it, and 31 percent that they watched or read news coverage of the speech. A majority of Trump voters (88 percent), Clinton voters (78 percent) and everyone else (57 percent) said they’d heard at least something about the State of the Union. HuffPost asked everyone who’d paid at least some attention to the address for their thoughts, because even those who didn’t watch the speech directly are likely to have formed an impression. Research has found, media coverage of events like speeches and debates can be just as important as the content.

HuffPost

Despite the positive ratings, Trump’s address also followed another storied State of the Union precedent: It failed to change many minds. A 56 percent majority of people who followed the State of the Union say the speech had no effect on their impression of Trump’s actions, and a 61 percent majority say that it didn’t change their impressions of his temperament.

Nor was the speech seen as much of a pivot. Sixty-four percent say that the tone and content of the speech were similar to most of what he’s said and done since becoming president, while just 24 percent saw it as substantively different. And even among those who saw a difference, more than 60 percent expected that Trump would soon revert back to his usual patterns of behavior.

Views of the address, like views of nearly everything related to the current administration, are deeply polarized. Ninety-five percent of Trump voters who paid attention to the speech, but just 7 percent of Clinton voters who did, approve. Non-voters and third-party voters are somewhere in the middle, with 48 percent approving.

Most Trump voters say the State of the Union improved their views of Trump’s actions, and a 44 percent plurality say that it improved their views of his temperament. Some of that response could just be his already-staunch supporters reaching for a way to affirm that they like both Trump and what he had to say.

But it does raise the possibility that, by foregrounding the more restrained version of the president, the speech could help him hold onto the recent uptick in support he’s seen recently among his own voters.

HuffPost

People who paid at least some attention to the address say, 47 percent to 18 percent, that Trump’s speech was optimistic, rather than pessimistic. (For comparison, 40 percent felt his inaugural speech, which included references to “American carnage,” was optimistic.) They were split, 38 percent to 35 percent, on whether it was more unifying or divisive.

Those polled say, 44 percent to 34 percent, that Trump spent enough time on the issues they care about most. Asked to pick which two issues Trump focused on most in his speech, they’re most likely to name immigration (48 percent) and the economy (39 percent), with tax reform (23 percent) taking third place.

Other polling and data on the State of the Union:

CBS News: “Three in four Americans who tuned in to President Trump’s State of the Union address tonight approved of the speech he gave. Just a quarter disapproved.”

NBC News: “The majority of Americans who tuned in or followed news coverage of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday night thought that the president hit the right notes, according to the results of an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released Thursday.”

CNN: “Almost half of Americans who watched President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address ― 48 percent― say they had a ‘very positive’ impression of the speech, down from 57 percent of speech-watchers after his first address to match Barack Obama’s rating after his first State of the Union address, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. It’s the lowest net positive rating for a State of the Union address since at least 1998, when CNN first asked the question.”

Politico: “President Donald Trump earned high marks for his first State of the Union address, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll of Americans who watched the speech earlier this week.”

More from CNN: “During his first State of the Union address Tuesday, [Trump] mentioned the words ‘immigrants’ and ‘immigration’ more than any other president in the last 100 years since President Woodrow Wilson started the trend of delivering the State of the Union as a speech instead of a written report.”

Gallup: “President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union address Tuesday night. Here is a look at the public opinion context for eight themes that Trump emphasized in his speech.”

The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 31-Feb. 1 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

A manager known for his ability to market black actresses in mostly white Hollywood stands accused of offering to exchange his services for sex, according to a Washington Post report published Friday.

Nine women of color told the Post that Vincent Cirrincione has made unwanted sexual advances toward women over a span of two decades. Cirrincione, who is white, represented Halle Berry as she rose to stardom and now counts Taraji P. Henson as a client.

Although Berry and Cirrincione worked together for more than two decades, the actress said in a statement that her opinion of him changed after she heard a woman describe his reputation.

“Over three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry’s manager was her worst casting couch experience ever. That news literally stopped me in my tracks,” she said. “I immediately confronted Vince about it, and he denied it completely. But even with his denial, something didn’t feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship.”

Berry and Henson both told the Post that they had not personally experienced any sexual harassment from the manager. Henson said she hadn’t even heard negative rumors.

Year after year, studies show that the entertainment industry, already extremely competitive, affords even fewer opportunities to black women than white women. Berry remains the only black winner of a lead actress Oscar. According to the Post, all nine of the women wanted Cirrincione to represent them specifically because of his skill in advancing the careers of women of color.

Three of the women said Cirrincione would not represent them if they declined to sleep with him. Another said he would help her career if she had sex with him monthly, and another said he frequently masturbated in front of her during their meetings.

While the manager said he pursued affairs, in a statement he specifically denied ever exchanging representation for sexual favors.For those still confused by the singular “their,” Merriam-Webster is here to help.

The dictionary publisher broke down the term as one of its quirky “usage limericks” this week. The site’s editors have been producing the popular poems, intended to help writers avoid language and grammatical errors, for some time.

The use of the singular “their,” Merriam-Webster noted on Twitter Wednesday, seems like a grammatical error, but is in fact appropriate.

If you're a stickler for grammar, prepare

to be irked by the singular 'their'

Tho it seems a mistake

The position we take

Is if the word is in use we don’t care https://t.co/2oiLJwJHd4 — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 31, 2018

The tweet included a link, which elaborated further.

“There is a long tradition in English of using plural pronouns (such as ‘they,’ ‘their,’ or ‘them’) for a singular character, rather than ascribing gender in a seemingly indeterminate fashion,” the site notes. “The habit of always using ‘he,’ ‘him,’ or ‘his’ began to be strongly advocated for after 18th century grammarians decided that indefinite pronouns should be singular.”

The editors conclude: “In recent years, the acceptance of gender-neutral third person pronouns such as ‘their’ is growing.”

Some people on Twitter responded gleefully to the dictionary’s embrace of “their,” and even offered their own poetic takes.

Merriam-Webster has, of course, taken an increasingly progressive stance on Twitter as of late.

Last year, the dictionary added the definition of “shade” as it was popularly used in the queer black and Latino ballroom scene: To express contempt or disrespect for someone publicly especially by subtle or indirect insults or criticisms. (Thanks to “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and the “Real Housewives of Atlanta,” this use has become increasingly mainstream.)Bradley Cooper, shown here in "Silver Linings Playbook," is a diehard Philadelphia Eagles fan.

Nobody scored points, except perhaps host Alex Trebek for his comments about the three contestants’ lack of gridiron knowledge.

As the final clue was revealed, Trebek capped the Hall of Fame-worthy sports trivia fail with yet another dig: “If you guys ring in and get this one, I will die.” Watch below:A Texas baker is giving kids a safe alternative to a dangerous trend.

Mexican-American baker Joe Andy García, 23, recently created a Tide Pod-inspired concha, or pan dulce, that’s decorated with an orange and blue swirl to resemble the concentrated laundry detergent packs.

García told HuffPost he made the Tide Pod concha as an edible and safe alternative to the viral and very hazardous “Tide Pod challenge,” a YouTube dare prompting teens to take videos of themselves eating the detergent packs. Tide Pods contain toxic materials that, if ingested, can cause seizures, pulmonary edema, respiratory arrest, coma, and even death, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers.

A post shared by Cakes By Jandy (@cakesbyjandy) on Jan 30, 2018 at 2:42pm PST

“You can use pictures and platforms to remind people that Tide Pods are not edible,” García said on Friday. “Eat this instead of an actual Tide Pod.”

The San Antonio-based pastry chef bakes at home and posts his creations via Instagram. On Tuesday, García posted a picture of his Tide Pod conchas with a warning in the caption: “I’m ready for laundry day... Tide Pod any one? *Warning: Please do NOT eat tide pods, thank you*”

García said he was inspired to make the conchas after seeing pictures of cookies resembling the detergent packs on Facebook. In fact, people have posted pictures online of edible Tide Pod donuts, sushi, pizza, and candy in response to the dangerous challenge.

García said his Tide Pod conchas have received mixed reviews, with many ordering the treats as gag gifts, and others complaining that his creations are insensitive or romanticize eating detergent. García told HuffPost he baked the conchas “as a joke.”The tacro is the latest foodie trend to take over Instagram.

Vive La Tarte debuted the part-taco, part-croissant creation in January. The San Francisco bakery offers three version of the tacro: pulled pork with pineapple, chicken with avocado, and barbecue jackfruit.

The bakery’s creative director, Jimmy Houghton, explained how the tacro was born in an interview with SF Gate published Friday.

“We took our regular croissant dough that we make and we tried to fill it with pulled pork or with chicken, and we found that the flavors didn’t combine well. The pastry was way too rich, way too buttery, way too sweet,” Houghton told the site. “We went back to the drawing board and we said it needs to be saltier, needs to be a bit more savory.”

A Vive La Tarte spokesperson told BuzzFeed the bakery will likely add more flavors, “including a potential breakfast version.”

Food mashup crazes have been constant since New York City’s Dominique Ansel Bakery created the uber-popular Cronut, a croissant-doughnut, in 2013. San Francisco responded with the cruffin, a croissant-muffin, in 2015. Now the Bay Area also has the tacro.

AdvertisementAn independent investigation will look into former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar’s serial sexual abuse, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) announced on Friday, after widespread calls from athletes and public officials for greater scrutiny of the institutions that many say enabled his years of assaulting young women.

An outside law firm, Ropes and Gray, will lead the probe, the USOC said in a statement, aiming “to determine when individuals affiliated with USA Gymnastics or the USOC first became aware of any evidence of Nassar’s abuse of athletes, what that evidence was and what they did with it.”

Last week, a Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to up to 175 years in prison after he sexually assaulted more than 140 young women, including many Olympic gymnasts.

Many survivors and their families, as well as lawmakers and other public officials, have called for investigations into the institutions where Nassar worked, questioning the extent to which members knew about his abuse and whether they tried to cover it up.

Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles said earlier this week that she was surprised that the USOC had not contacted her to discuss Nassar’s abuse.

“I was one of their top athletes advocating for not only gymnastics but for the Olympics and all of that,” Biles said. “I think it’s kind of crazy, but hopefully they’ll reach out.”

Shortly following his sentencing last week, the USOC issued an open apology to Nassar’s victims and announced that it would allocate funding to testing, treatment and counseling for Nassar’s victims. It added it would institute systemic changes.

“We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren’t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams,” the letter read.

It also issued an ultimatum to USA Gymnastics, the sport’s governing body, calling on its entire board to resign, or it would strip the organization’s certification.The “Charmed” actress made the announcement Friday on Twitter.

The incident took place Wednesday as McGowan was taking questions about her new memoir, Brave, from the crowd at the Union Square Barnes & Noble in Manhattan. At one point during the star’s appearance, a transgender woman, who has been identified in the media as Andi Dier, asked the actress to clarify controversial remarks she’d made about trans women on RuPaul’s “What’s the Tee?” podcast in July 2017.

After the podcast episode originally aired, some on social media deemed McGowan a TERF, or a “trans-exclusionary radical feminist,” for suggesting that trans women hadn’t “developed” as women even though they “felt like a woman on the inside.”

“That’s not growing as a woman, that’s not living in this world as a woman,” she said at the time, “and a lot of the stuff I hear trans complaining about, yeah, welcome to the world.”

At McGowan’s Wednesday appearance, Dier’s inquiry quickly escalated into a shouting match, and she was eventually removed by bookstore security.

McGowan, however, continued to shout in her direction.

“I’m not worried, I’m fucking mad with the lies,” the actress told the crowd, as seen in video footage of the incident. “I’m mad that you put shit on me because I have a fucking vagina and I’m white or I’m black or I’m yellow or I’m purple. Fuck off! All of us want to say it. I just do!”

“There was a plant last night at my first book reading … definitely a paid plant that got up and was screaming at me,” she told Farrow on Thursday, noting that she is scared of assassination.

A representative for Weinstein dismissed McGowan’s claims as “100 percent false,” telling Page Six, “It’s unfortunate that she is choosing to marginalize a community that is fighting to have their voice heard by claiming that the individual was a ‘plant’ of my client.”TIMOTHY A.

Holy fireballs.

On Saturday, Twitter was horrified when a user named “Give me liberty or give me donuts” shared a picture of a completely shaved Mario. And by completely shaved, we’re talking about a rendering of the iconic video game character void of his sideburns, famous mustache and even eyebrows.

After people questioned why someone would create such an abomination …

… “Give me liberty or give me donuts” passed the credit over to a Twitter account called “Justice for bald Mario,” which uses the nightmare-inducing image as its profile photo.

After eight competitive episodes of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” season two, and one episode of season three, finally, finally, fi-na-lly someone gets how to take advantage of the Lip Sync for Your Legacy format. It took Shangela Laquifa Wadley herself, queen of strategy in season three of the flagship show, to step up to the plate and start asking what the other queens will do for her if she saves them. Yes, at last, a contestant is looking at the eliminate-each-other format as a chance to build alliances, not as a burden. Now, hopefully, her fellow queens will follow suit.

Things look dismal when the episode opens, as BenDeLaCreme practically complains about sweeping the premiere’s challenges. “This sucks,” she says as she wipes away eliminated queen Morgan McMichaels’ lipstick mirror message. “It’s like not winning. It feels really bad.” Despite the $10,000 prize for winning the Lip Sync for Your Legacy, and an early positive impression in the judges’ minds, Ben’s too wrapped up in having to make a tough decision and sending home one of her sisters.

Thorgy Thor, who I agreed with maybe once in season eight, speaks sense in her confessional: “Wake up, bitch! You had to make a decision. Nobody envied you, but you made it. Move forward.” Because that’s the game. “All Stars” is not “Drag Race.” The difference in the format exists for a reason. The best of the best should be capable of making hard choices to get ahead. Ben is great at “Drag Race,” but as evidenced by her mealy-mouthed monologue when she had to eliminate Morgan, she may not be great at certain elements of “All Stars.”

Why the shift from original lyrics to a dance focus? It could be that Todrick Hall is now in charge, after the unfortunate public meltdown of former favorite Ru producer Lucian Piane. But that seems wrong, considering Hall is a prolific parodist, and his “Kardashian” was an original piece. Whatever the case, it gives queens relatively few chances to be funny or impressive — save Shangela, whose Mariah number is minimally about singing and more about camping it up, and Ben, whose hard-rapping Julie Andrews is perfect. Even a cold-hearted Ben skeptic like me can admit she utterly slays this challenge. Under “Drag Race” rules, she’d have been the sole winner (though, under the same rules, I think Aja would’ve been the champion last week).

Joining them in the top is 10th queen Bebe Zahara Benet as Diana Ross. She effortlessly proves why less is more: She has few lyrics to lip-sync to, but every movement, every facial twitch, and every affect is right. “Here’s the key that everybody should look at for that: You didn’t do much to embody Diana,” head judge Michelle Visage says. Subtlety won out for her. Still, it’d be tough to argue for her win, considering how little she does compared to Shangela and Ben.

Taking into account both the challenge and the redeem-a-bad-look runway, some of the other results are puzzling. Trixie Mattel is safe after a terrific Dolly Parton impression, I’d imagine because it’s too expected for her (though personally, I’d have put her in the top three over Bebe). Aja joins her; her Amy Winehouse is tame, but a spectacular reworking of her Princess Disastah runway keeps her in. Chi Chi DeVayne falls just outside the bottom two, even though her Patti LaBelle is a laugh riot. The problem seemingly lies with her reworked neon look, which judge Carson Kressley knocks as “basic.” Her dancing diva sister Kennedy Davenport is not as lucky, as a poorly executed Janet Jackson impression lands her in the bottom two.

Then there’s Thorgy, bless her heart. Thorgy was a fantastic competitor on “Drag Race” season eight, continually scoring high in the challenges, until her lack of wins and imagined rivalry with eventual champion Bob the Drag Queen got the best of her. When she started overthinking things, she sunk into a pile of self-doubt, and never fully recovered.

“All Stars” brings out all the worst parts of Thorgy. She’s a mess from the word go this week, questioning why her part as Stevie Nicks isn’t as funny as the others. (Having seen the full show: Girl, save Mariah and Julie, none of them were that funny.) In rehearsals with Todrick, she imagines herself focused and galvanized, but as Ben later points out in a confessional, she spends the whole time subconsciously self-sabotaging. It’s honestly distressing to watch a talent like Thorgy melt down like this. As a result, her actual performance is kind of a mess. She looks like Stevie, but her affects are twitchy and bizarre. Her insistence during judging that Stevie Nicks isn’t a gay icon — really, girl? — doesn’t help her case.

Said meltdown is ultimately her undoing, as Lip Sync for Your Legacy winner Shangela’s reticence to send home her Texas sister Kennedy trumps Thorgy’s offer of an alliance. Shangela is playing strategically, and she sees Thorgy’s weaknesses for what they are. An ally is only good to her if they’ll actually perform well. So the season eight queen goes home — or rather, to wherever Morgan is as they await a potential chance to Ruturn to the competition. If Thorgy wants to get back in, though, she’ll have to get through a lot of personal demons, and fast.

I’ve saved Milk for last, even though she’s just safe this week, because there’s a lot to say about the lactose queen. During the premiere, while Trixie, Kennedy, and Bebe seemed happy to be called safe, Milk looked annoyed. This week, she doubles down, whispering angrily to fellow safe queens Trixie and Aja at the back of the stage after her performance as Celine Dion registers as neither spectacular nor disappointing with the judges.

“This is fucking ridiculous,” she says. “I hate this.” She's mad not being in the top three, Trixie asks to clarify. “Yes,” Milk insists. “Those three? Really? Fucking stupid.” It’s unclear if any of the other queens hear her, but the Drag Race editors throw on subtitles to make sure the audience catches every word.

There’s clearly a narrative being built here of Milk as villain. But last week, I thought this was mostly playful — that Milk was in on the joke as she shaded the other queens in confessionals. Even this week’s sad humblebrag about doing her Celine impression for the Canadian singer’s wedding planner comes across as more pitiful than haughty.

Her sniping remarks after being called safe, however, as well as a breakdown during deliberations, make me think these are Milk’s true colors. She bursts into sobs over not being in the top — “I think that’s a lot of emotion for safe,” Trixie says in her confessional — and complains that she’s not being “commended” properly for her hard work. She basically throws a temper tantrum because the teacher didn’t give her a gold star.

I didn’t mind Milk in her season, and was even pretty impressed with her post-show modeling gigs. But her casting on “All Stars” confused me. I wasn’t sure she had more to offer in this arena. After all, being successful off the show does not automatically make you great at “Drag Race.” But seeing her complain that the judges didn’t properly “congratulate” her is a new low — a case of spoiled Milk. What’s more, it’s an off-putting display of her privilege.

Milk is a hot, white man out of drag. That does not make the work she does in drag any less artistically valid. But it does mean we have to keep perspective on why she’s able to do the drag she does. If, for example, Kennedy’s drag was half as outré as Milk’s, she’d be relentlessly blasted by fellow queens and trolls alike. We know this because Kennedy gets hate just for doing her drag as-is, much less something so unconventional. Milk receives the benefit of the doubt in a way someone less classically handsome (or non-white) would certainly not.

Again, just to be clear: This doesn’t discount the value of Milk’s drag. She is one of the most avant-garde thinkers “Drag Race” has ever seen, up there with Sharon Needles, Raja, and Kim Chi. As she reminded us in the premiere, she has literally inspired Drag Race challenges. But whining that she’s not getting kudos — and discounting her fellow queens’ performances while doing so — is ignoring the ways in which she benefits from her privilege. She gets to stay in the competition and continue to show her unconventional drag, despite her flawed execution of it.

Because therein lies the rub: “Safe” is honestly a generous placement for Milk. Her Celine is weird and frenetic (and in not-very-Celine ways), and her runway is bland. She probably deserves the bottom three spot over Chi Chi this week. She absolutely deserved to be in the bottom two last week. Rather than throwing a fit, she should be glad she’s still in this race — because if she continues performing as she has, she won’t be around much longer.

Final thoughts:

Ru specifically designates who the top and bottom three are, a change from last week, when Thorgy and Shangela floated in some nebulous middle ground after the variety show. Was Shangela in the top and Thorgy in the bottom? Were they both in the top? Were they all bottoms? This week’s distinction is much clearer, thankfully.

The Lip Sync for Your Legacy is much more evenly edited this week; thank you, “Drag Race,” for learning from the premiere’s Aja snub. I agree with Ru’s decision on the lip sync: Shangela pulls out all kinds of tricks on the Pointer Sisters’ “Jump,” while Ben mostly relies on the joke that she’s copying Shangela’s moves.

Trixie continues to be queen of the confessionals. Best line of the episode, on Milk’s paper dresses talent show performance from last week: “Your talent can’t be Velcro.”

Of the redemption runways, I most loved Kennedy’s (a reimagining of her infamous Death Becomes Her look), Aja’s (which shows how much she’s progressed in a year), and Ben’s (an elegant update). I admire Shangela for doing a full snowglobe look for her Queen Who Mopped Christmas Ru-do, but the execution was somewhat muddled.

Though Ben kills it as Julie Andrews, if you watch her mouth closely, you can see her dropping words in the lyrics. She did the same thing in the “Anaconda” lip sync last week. What distinguishes Ben from, say, Kennedy, who is called out for missing words, is that she covers well. That’s the mark of a smart queen.

They may not be funny, but some of the divas’ “covers” of Ru’s songs are bangers. The Dolly Parton “Adrenaline” and Amy Winehouse “U Wear It Well” are the best of them.

Bebe’s response to Ru asking her if she’s met the first lady of Cameroon — “I have not met her, but she’s heard of me” — had me cackling.

Forever adore Vanessa Williams, but she didn’t bring much this week, beyond a smart note about Janet Jackson’s “staccato” movement to Kennedy. Meanwhile, Todrick is always better as a choreographer than he is on the panel. The guest judges need to step up their game a bit. Perhaps Unreal’s Constance Zimmer and Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman will change the game next week?
