High school student Micheal Brown made headlines last week for a remarkable feat: He was accepted by all 20 colleges he applied to, and each institution awarded him a full scholarship to boot.

Video of Brown, screaming with excitement as he learned of his acceptances surrounded by family and friends, went viral. Four Ivy League institutions ― Harvard, Yale, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania ― want him, as do Stanford, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins and 11 more top-rated colleges.

MUST SEE VIDEO! This is what it looks like when a hard working, 3rd Ward student gets accepted to his dream college. BTW... he was accepted to 20! Including 4 #IvyLeagues.

While the exceptional senior, who earned a 4.68 GPA at Lamar High School in Houston was praised by many ― from reporters to readers to President Bill Clinton ― a local news team in Washington has come under fire for harshly criticizing the student.

On Fox 5 DC last week, morning co-anchor Holly Morris and contributor Sarah Fraser laid into Brown for applying to 20 schools, calling his decision to do so “obnoxious” and suggesting he was showing off.

“It’s a little ridiculous that this kid applied to 20, taking away a spot and basically waitlisting another kid,” Fraser said.

“I’m urging my kids not to,” co-anchor Allison Seymour said in an aside.

“It’s a little obnoxious because you can only go to one, you can only take one full ride, and you are taking a spot from someone else who worked really hard,” Morris said.

The backlash was swift and has grown over the past week as a Now This video criticizing the Fox 5 segment went viral.

Twitters users are laying into the journalists, saying their comments seemed racially motivated.

This doesn’t “take a space or a scholarship” away from ANYONE.



Yale isn’t going to suddenly enroll only 1,499 freshmen or only give $4,950,000 in financial aid if this kid goes to Stanford instead.



This is straight up, poorly coded, bigotry. https://t.co/ySdmNbml1x — Aditya Sood (@adityasood) April 9, 2018

Michael Brown, I wish you would’ve applied to 30 schools. Keep shining- you’re an inspiration to black and brown kids all over.

So to sum up: Ferguson's Michael Brown who was murdered by the cop was a thug who wasn’t trying to do anything with his life so he deserved to die.

In response to the backlash, Fraser tweeted an apology to Brown on Saturday, saying she learned a “valuable lesson.” Brown tweeted that he accepted her apology.

Bishop Talbert - I am sorry. I’m sorry to Michael b. I truly had no malice when I set this story up, we wanted to ask is 20 schools too much? But I see now that was petty. Michael is awesome and I have learned a lesson. — Sarah Fraser (@heyfrase) April 7, 2018

Thank you for your apology. I appreciate it and accept it. — Micheal Brown (@mbreezy101) April 7, 2018

Morris maintained that she was criticizing the act of applying to 20 schools, not Brown himself. She also said she would have had the same response if the student were white.

I just believe in a more targeted search. I think the common ap has changed the game and makes it too easy to apply to too many schools. Has nothing to do with privilege. Just my opinion. We can disagree... that’s ok. https://t.co/JsGsXAGTmV — Holly Morris (@HollyLiveFox5DC) April 3, 2018

I also said he is an amazing young man. This is not a racial issue. I would have the exact same opinion if the boy was white. https://t.co/gq8Edty0s8 — Holly Morris (@HollyLiveFox5DC) April 4, 2018

Brown said he had a Skype interview with Morris but has asked the station not to air it since the anchor has still not apologized.

This morning, I had a respectful Skype interview with @HollyLiveFox5DC , though I did not get an apology during the interview. I won't allow the interview to air until @fox5dc provides me with a public apology. Where's the #humandecency? — Micheal Brown (@mbreezy101) April 6, 2018

Fox 5 DC, Morris, Seymour and Brown did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Warning! “A Quiet Place” spoilers below. Proceed with caution.

It’s time to nail a few things down.

John Krasinski’s new horror movie, “A Quiet Place,” does a pretty good job of answering viewers’ lingering questions, but a few essential ones are still bothering us. For example, why would a couple risk having a baby in a world that’s riddled with sound-sensitive monsters?

(In this world, if you make a noise, “Stranger Things”-like monsters come after you, and it’s not cute. So risking going through labor, an activity that typically involves screaming, seems like a bad idea.)

Beyond that core dilemma, there’s another worrisome issue that sets in motion the harrowing events of the movie’s second-half, and it needs hammering out:

Why didn’t someone do something about that nail in the stairs?

The nail has been haunting us ever since we saw the movie (and we’re not the only ones), so we reached out to the “Quiet Place” producers for some answers.

But first, a little background on the nail. Here’s how a small metal spike became the movie’s most perturbing antagonist:

Early on in “A Quiet Place,” Emily Blunt’s character, Evelyn, is doing laundry and, in the process of bringing a laundry bag up from the family home’s basement, catches a nail in the steps. After she pries the bag free, the nail is left sticking up like a ticking time bomb just waiting for someone to step on it.

Skip ahead a bit and, with the rest of her family gone from the house, pregnant Evelyn’s water breaks.

She heads down to the basement seemingly in an effort to initiate a warning message to her absent husband and children (by hitting a switch, she can illuminate a string of red lights on the property, which the sound-sensitive-but-blind monsters can’t detect). And that’s when she steps on the nail (barefoot, because shoes would make sound), causing her to smash a picture frame she was carrying ― and signal to the monsters that it’s dinner time.

The noise draws the always-lurking creatures into the house and sets the stage for a number of close and deadly encounters between them and the family.

And through it all, no one does anything about the nail. It just sits in the stairs the rest of the film, taunting us, waiting to jab someone else.

Like when the kids come down the basement stairs before making a final stand against the monsters, and you’re just waiting for someone else to step on the nail and cry out. By the grace of the movie gods, no one does, but it drives everyone mad.

Hey, is someone going to deal with that frickin' nail in A Quiet Place 2? It's driving me crazy. #quietplace — X - JC (@jchliboyko) April 9, 2018

If you have seen A Quiet Place can we just talk a minute ab that dang nail. THE ANXIETY — Laura Ellard (@laura_ellard) April 9, 2018

In an interview with producers Brad Fuller and Andrew Form, we asked about the movie’s real villain, the nail on the stairs. First and foremost, they told us that the nail stayed where it was because it would have been too noisy for the family to remove.

“They can’t knock [the nail] down,” Form said. “It’s too loud. I can’t imagine a hammer trying to get it out.”

“They can put an orange cone over it, a little orange cone,” Fuller joked.

As you might’ve guessed, the producers seemed to enjoy how much the nail messed with people. “We do know when everybody sees the movie they’re expecting everyone to step on that nail every time they come down the steps,” Form added.

“I really felt that when the kids go downstairs in the third act and the nail’s there...” Fuller said, letting Form finish his sentence: “When the daughter goes down alone, the entire audience, they can’t even look at the stairs.”

So, yeah, there’s a practical purpose. The nail is there to mess with you.

As to how a nail could end up sticking straight out of the stairs like that, at least one fan of the movie said a similar thing happened to her family in real life.

@johnkrasinski loved a quiet place as a mom, the silo scene stressed me out just a bit and the nail actually happened to my sister as a kid- hope Emily had her tetanus shot — Paula Malcomson (@pmdental1) April 9, 2018

It’s probably safe to assume that situation was sans monsters.

And for anyone wondering if we’re going to see the return of the cast (and possibly the nail) in “A Quiet Place” sequel, Fuller told us, “I’d love to stay quiet with this cast for as long as possible.”

“Whatever that would take,” he added.Snoop Dogg appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Monday to promote his new gospel album, but the conversation inevitably got around to his weed worship.

The rapper and “Joker’s Wild” host said only one person has ever had a greater tolerance than him for smoking marijuana in one sitting.

“Willie Nelson is the only person who’s ever out-smoked Snoop Dogg,” Dogg said. “I had to hit the timeout button.”

It was a button he said he’d never had to push before.

Snoop, whose botanical bromance with Nelson is well known, has praised the “On the Road Again” singer’s greater grass appetite before. But Nelson no doubt will appreciate Snoop’s reefer-al, just the same.Want to keep the passion in a relationship? Try adding a robotic sex doll.

That’s the recommendation of Spanish inventor Sergi Santos, who created a sex doll equipped with the latest advancements in artificial intelligence. “Samantha” is designed to respond to gentle seduction.

As a result, the 39-year-old electrical engineer said the bosomy bot allows him to get sexual release when his partner of 16 years, Maritsa Kissamitaki, isn’t in the mood.

“A man wants to feel in general that the woman is desperate to have sex with him,” Santos told Barcroft TV. “And if a man feels like the woman will not enjoy [sex] fully, most men do not like the sex. And this is the cause of many sexual problems.”

As for him and his wife, Santos said, “I need sex some times of the day that my wife doesn’t want to, and I said, ‘Look, sex is breaking already many relationships because of lack of synchronism,’ and I would not put that pressure to my marriage.”

The couple, who are based in Catalonia, sells their randy robots for between $2,834 and $7,000.

Kissamitaki told Barcroft that she doesn’t see any problems with her husband having a robot on the side.

“With couples, I think as long as there is trust in the relationship and mutual respect, then introducing a doll is something that can help,” she said. “Even if you are compatible on so many other things but maybe not sex, a doll can be a complementary element and can be a solution.”

But Santos, who is planning to build a male sex robot, admits he worries how the reverse situation could affect their relationship.

“I think I would feel jealous if she used the male sex robot,” he told Barcroft. “If I found that she likes the male doll better than me, in the sense that she doesn’t want to be with me, I’d get divorced.”

Kissamitaki would be tempted to try it out.

“I do find the idea of making a man robot interesting. I would very much like to make one. If I would personally use it, I don’t know. Probably, out of curiosity,” she said.

WASHINGTON ― Congress sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk Tuesday intended to roll back regulations adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, weakening consumer protection and modestly increasing the risk of another banking collapse.

The bill’s passage marks the second major legislative victory for both Trump and the financial sector, following last year’s tax cut. The package will benefit banks both large and small, limit consumer remedies against credit reporting agencies including the scandal-plagued Equifax, curb the government’s ability to collect data on racial discrimination in the housing market, and allow large regional banks to rely on more risky debt to finance their operations.

Tuesday’s 258-159 House vote came as banks are posting record profits thanks to a stronger economy and lower tax rates. The U.S. banking industry posted a combined $56 billion profit in the first quarter of 2018, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its best three-month stint in history. Community banks ― smaller institutions in rural parts of the country that proponents of the bill claimed were in need of particular aid ― also posted billions in net profits.

Nevertheless, banks still need deregulation, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said.

“Big banks keep getting bigger,” Cole told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Small banks are being regulated out of existence.”

With Republicans in control of the House, the bill’s eventual approval was a fait accompli after 17 Senate Democrats voted for it in March.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law included a host of consumer protections and risk management rules that apply to all banks. But it applied tougher rules to the largest banks, since the failure of a large firm can have dire consequences for the broader economy. Banks with at least $50 billion in assets have to undergo frequent stress-testing by the Federal Reserve to determine whether they could withstand an unexpected financial shock. They must finance their operations with more capital and less borrowed money, and they have to keep more cash on hand.

The bill approved Tuesday would change the definition of what constitutes the biggest banks, freeing banks with up to $250 billion in assets from these tougher rules. Huge regional players like BB&T and SunTrust would be exempted, as would foreign conglomerates with trillions of dollars in global assets ― like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS ― that keep less than $250 billion of their assets in the United States.

“Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial system,” former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker wrote in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who voted against the legislation. Volcker in particular highlighted the risks posed by curtailing oversight of “several large foreign banks,” suggesting that a $100 billion threshold would be more appropriate.

When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation in March, it concluded that while the risk of another banking crash in any specific year was small, the odds “would be slightly greater under the legislation.”

The risk would be worth making it easier for small and intermediate-sized banks to provide credit, Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House financial services committee, said Tuesday. “Everything in life is a balancing act.”

Banking analysts also expect large regional banks to acquire more small community lenders as a result of the bill, since they will not be penalized with tougher regulations for growing past the $50 billion mark.

The subprime mortgage crisis revealed that banks had systematically steered families of color into expensive, predatory loans. Dodd-Frank sought to address this in part by requiring lenders to report a host of data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition to basic facts about loan approval or denial, lenders had to report a borrower’s age and credit score, as well as the property value of the home being purchased, the interest rate, loan terms, and other pricing features of each mortgage. The CFPB could use all of this data to determine whether families of color were being improperly overcharged or pushed into bad loans.

The bill approved Tuesday would exempt 85 percent of banks from those new anti-discrimination reporting requirements, in an effort to save paperwork costs. A host of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Urban League and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have all assailed the provision.

The bill also contains several provisions that are supposed to benefit consumers, such as by requiring credit monitoring firms to let people freeze their credit reports, which contain personal financial information that companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion collect without prior consent. Equifax proved a poor custodian of that information last year when the company announced hackers had stolen personal data relating to more than 140 million Americans.

Consumer advocates say the supposed benefits are actually a mixed bag, because some provisions would preempt more generous state laws and others could prevent consumers from joining class-action lawsuits.

One provision is a straightforward giveaway to Equifax and its ilk, since it would force government-backed mortgage companies to consider using their credit-scoring algorithm as part of the home lending process. Liberal and conservative groups alike, as well as other housing finance stakeholders, oppose the provision.

Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), another member of the House financial services committee, dismissed concerns about restricting consumers from being able to join class-action lawsuits, noting that they can still settle disputes by arbitration.The Me Too and Time’s Up movements have brought sexual abuse and assault into the national conversation as never before. Now, two victim advocacy groups are hoping to expand the public’s perception of what sexual trauma survivors look like with a harrowing new campaign.

In the video above, five women hold back tears as they read accounts of sexual abuse and assault. As the narrators prepare to offer their support to the authors of those accounts, however, they’re surprised to discover that each of the victims was a man.

The eye-opening, six-minute public service announcement was released by the national nonprofit organization 1in6 last week to kick off Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Produced in conjunction with No More, another organization for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and funded in part by the NFL, the video aims to highlight statistics which show that at least one out of six men have experienced sexual abuse or assault.

The PSA’s director, Andy Langdon, told HuffPost that he hopes the campaign will inspire viewers to deconstruct the taboos that exist around men ― gay, straight, bisexual and otherwise ― making sexual assault claims.

“When our culture demands that boys and men present themselves as invulnerable, independent and strong, we leave little room for men to express emotion, especially sadness, confusion and other difficult feelings,” Langdon, creative director of 1in6, said. The video, he added, aims to “share the truth” of male victims in an unbiased way by “temporarily removing this social construct.”

Meredith Alling, who is 1in6′s development and communications director, noted that male victims of sexual abuse may delay seeking treatment even longer than women who have had similar experiences given the lingering stigma.

Praising both the Me Too and Time’s Up movements for having brought attention to the abuse and harassment of women, Alling believes there is space for men within that dialogue, too.

“Men have a responsibility to use their privilege to engage in the movement to end sexual violence of all kinds,” she said. “We hope that men who have had these experiences will see this video and see that they are not alone, that help is out there, and that it’s never too late to seek it.”Janelle Monáe is dressed in hot pink pants that look like a vagina in her new video for “PYNK,” and people are here for the song’s whole vibe.

A post shared by Janelle Monáe (@janellemonae) on Apr 10, 2018 at 8:08am PDT

The song, which also features Grimes, comes from the Grammy-nominated singer, songwriter and actress’ upcoming third solo album, “Dirty Computer.”

Monáe told Beats 1 that the new album will be “extremely vulnerable” and that it’s “such an honest body of work and I don’t know how people are going to react to it.”

“I know that there are a lot of things that I haven’t discussed and I think this is the album that you’ll get an opportunity to get a closer glimpse into my mind and into my heart,” she said.

We’d say “PYNK” is pretty honest.

“Pink like the inside of your, baby (we’re all just pink) / Pink like the walls and the doors, maybe (deep inside, we’re all just pink) / Pink like your fingers in my, maybe / Pink is the truth you can’t hide,” she sings.

A cotton candy-colored confection, the video features incredible female-centric visuals ― think booties popping, synchronized desert dancing, neon “Pussy Power” signs, close-ups on saucy underwear ― with a diverse cast. Most scenes feature Monáe and/or actress Tessa Thompson, who have been rumored to be a couple since the release of Monáe’s “Make Me Feel” video that Thompson also stars in.

Of their relationship, Thompson has said that she and Monáe “have been really close.”

“We’ve been really good friends at this point for about three and a half years,” Thompson continued. I’m so lucky to have her in my life,” she said to ET Online.

In addition to wondering even more about Thompson’s and Monáe’s relationship status, fans on Twitter seem to be LOVING the video’s look, feel and sound:

(@korrahasami) April 10, 2018WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he planned to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un next month or in early June and hoped the discussions would ultimately lead to an end of the North’s nuclear weapons program.

“We’ll be meeting with them sometime in May or early June and I think there’ll be great respect paid by both parties and hopefully we’ll be able to make a deal on the de-nuking of North Korea,” Trump told reporters at the beginning of a Cabinet meeting.

“They’ve said so. We’ve said so,” Trump added. “Hopefully, it’ll be a relationship that’s much different than it’s been for many, many years.”

North Korea has told the United States it is prepared to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula when Kim meets Trump, a U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. and North Korean officials have held secret contacts recently in which Pyongyang directly confirmed its willingness to hold the unprecedented summit.

The communications, still at a preliminary stage, have involved State Department officials talking to North Korea, apparently through its United Nations mission, and intelligence officers from both sides using a separate back channel, the official said. Before that, Washington had relied mostly on South Korea’s assurances of Kim’s intentions.Pope Francis released his third apostolic exhortation, titled "Gaudete et Exsultate," on Monday. Alessandro Bianchi / Reuters

Pope Francis issued a scathing rebuke of Catholics who prioritize some church laws and doctrines ― including those condemning abortion ― over fighting for the poor and the oppressed.

In an apostolic exhortation released Monday, Francis lamented that some Catholics think of protecting many marginalized groups as a secondary or superficial issue. The pontiff said that while efforts to restrict abortion are crucial, it’s just as important for members of his flock to fight for the rights of the “already born.”

“Our defense of the innocent unborn, for example, needs to be clear, firm and passionate,” Francis wrote in his exhortation. “Equally sacred, however, are the lives of the poor, those already born, the destitute, the abandoned and the underprivileged, the vulnerable infirm and elderly exposed to covert euthanasia, the victims of human trafficking, new forms of slavery, and every form of rejection.”

“We cannot uphold an ideal of holiness that would ignore injustice in a world where some revel, spend with abandon and live only for the latest consumer goods, even as others look on from afar, living their entire lives in abject poverty,” the pope wrote.

He added that he’s often heard Catholics talk about the plight of migrants as a “lesser issue,” compared to certain “bioethical” concerns. In what looked like an admonishment of anti-refugee sentiment among Christians in Europe and the U.S., Francis condemned the idea that defending migrants should be a secondary concern.

“That a politician looking for votes might say such a thing is understandable, but not a Christian, for whom the only proper attitude is to stand in the shoes of those brothers and sisters of ours who risk their lives to offer a future to their children,” he wrote.

“Can we not realize that this is exactly what Jesus demands of us, when he tells us that in welcoming the stranger we welcome him?” he asked, pointing to Matthew 25:35.

An apostolic exhortation is one way the pope can formally counsel the Roman Catholic Church around the world. The document released Monday, titled “Gaudete et Exsultate” (Rejoice and Be Glad), is the third such exhortation of Francis’ papacy. It was signed March 19, The Associated Press reports.

The pope’s focus this time was calling on Catholics to live holy lives and be the “saints next door” ― ordinary, humble people who reflect God’s presence by living out the Beatitudes, key Christian teachings about mercy and spirituality. These “saints next door” may not be canonized and officially recognized, but they raise their children with love and work hard to support their families. They are patient, kind and charitable, using small gestures to share God’s love with others. Holiness isn’t necessarily about perfection, Francis explained, but about “living our lives with love and ... bearing witness in everything we do, wherever we find ourselves.”

The enemies of this everyday holiness are those who “worship” their own abilities and feel superior to others because they observe certain rules, Francis wrote. The fruits of that misguided attitude are, among other things, “an obsession with the law, an absorption with social and political advantages, [and] a punctilious concern for the Church’s liturgy, doctrine and prestige.”

Francis criticized those who focus only on doctrine without also demonstrating mercy and compassion.

“Not infrequently, contrary to the promptings of the Spirit, the life of the Church can become a museum piece or the possession of a select few. This can occur when some groups of Christians give excessive importance to certain rules, customs or ways of acting,” Francis wrote. “The Gospel then tends to be reduced and constricted, deprived of its simplicity, allure and savor.”

Francis is still facing backlash over his second exhortation, the 2016 “Amoris Laetitia” (The Joy of Love), which appeared to suggest that divorced and civilly remarried Catholics could potentially receive Communion. That would be a break from long-standing Catholic tradition. Conservative cardinals and bishops have been pressing Francis to clarify his stance on the matter.

Just last Saturday, several hundred Catholics gathered for a summit in Rome to discuss who may receive Communion. The participants rejected the idea of allowing divorced and civilly remarried individuals to do so and urged “the pope and the bishops to confirm us in the faith.” One of Francis’ fiercest American critics, Cardinal Raymond Burke, said during the summit that the pope should be corrected if he steps outside the traditional teachings of the church.

Francis hasn’t responded directly to those critics with a clarification of “Amoris Laetitia.” But in his latest exhortation, he said that within the Catholic Church, “there legitimately coexist different ways of interpreting many aspects of doctrine and Christian life.”Israel is accused of launching a barrage of missiles at an airbase in the Homs province on Monday morning. The airstrikes came just days after a suspected chemical attack on a rebel-held town in eastern Ghouta killed dozens of men, women and children, and prompted international condemnation.

The T4 military base was hit with “several missiles” early Monday morning, SANA, Syria’s state-run media network, reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, said 14 people were killed in the attack.

According to The Associated Press, SANA initially called the airstrikes an “American aggression.” However, Pentagon officials quickly denied any involvement in the strikes, telling reporters that the United States was not bombing Syria, as did France and the U.K.

“At this time, the Department of Defense is not conducting airstrikes in Syria,” the Pentagon told CNN in a statement. “However, we continue to closely watch the situation and support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to hold those who use chemical weapons, in Syria and otherwise, accountable.”

The Russian Defense Ministry and Syria accused Israel of carrying out the bombings, firing eight missiles from two aircraft. Syria shot down five of the missiles, they alleged, while the remaining three hit the base. Israel’s Defense Forces have yet to comment, although two U.S. officials told NBC News that the Americans were informed of the attack in advance.

More than 40 people died in eastern Ghouta on Saturday in the suspected chemical attack. At least 500 others were treated for “symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,” the aid group White Helmets said.

Graphic images taken in the region appeared to show entire families suffocated in their homes, some with foam coming out of their mouths.

Although aid organizations blamed the Syrian government under President Bashar al-Assad for the suspected chemical attack, state-run media in both Syria and Russia denied those reports.

“A military intervention under far-fetched and fabricated pretexts in Syria, where there are Russian soldiers at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is absolutely unacceptable and could have the most dire consequences,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement obtained by Agency France-Presse.

President Donald Trump issued a series of tweets following the incident and vowed that Syria would pay a “big price” for its involvement. He blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin and the government of Iran for backing “Animal Assad”:

Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018

....to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018

The White House has not ruled out military action in retaliation for the chemical attack ― if it is determined to be linked to Assad. The incident could also impact Trump’s proposal to withdraw American troops from Syria in the coming months.

“I wouldn’t take anything off the table,” Homeland Security adviser Thomas Bossert told ABC on Sunday. “These are horrible photos; we’re looking into the attack at this point.”A survivor of a 2013 Syria sarin gas attack said the entire world is guilty for not doing more to end the country’s drawn-out civil war.

Kassem Eid, a Palestinian Syrian rebel and human rights activist, called on the international community to “do something” to stop the conflict, which has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians since it began in 2011.

“My message to the international community is that you should be ashamed,” Eid said Sunday during an appearance on CNN. “You are as guilty as [Syrian President Bashar Assad] and [Russian President Vladimir Putin] and Iran on the atrocities in Syria.”

“I don’t know how anyone can just look the other way or say this is too graphic to watch,” he continued. “I know it’s too graphic to watch, but it’s real. Those people are real. Those children who suffocated are real. They have names.”

Eid called on President Donald Trump and other world leaders to intervene militarily after a reported chemical attack carried out by the Syrian government on Saturday killed dozens of civilians in the rebel-held town of Douma.

“You should do something right now to save whoever is left in Douma,” Eid said. “People are forced to flee, women will be detained and raped, men will be slaughtered, children will be killed ― just like they do each and every single time, because it happened in my town. I survived it.”

Eid described surviving a 2013 chemical attack outside Damascus in an essay last year in The New York Times. Hundreds of people were killed after Assad’s regime reportedly launched rockets containing sarin into the rebel-held region of Ghouta.

“Dozens of men, women and children writhed on the ground,” Eid wrote. “Others screamed out for doctors, wailing, praying, pleading for their beloved fallen to breathe again.”

Trump tweeted Sunday that there would be a “big price to pay” for the fresh attack, and condemned the Russian and Iranian governments for backing Syria’s oppressive leadership. Republican lawmakers have called for a swift military response from the U.S.. It remains unclear what specific actions Trump will take.

Eid encouraged U.S. military forces to destroy the Syrian airports that can be used to launch chemical attacks against civilians.

He also called on the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, to resign. He accused Haley’s office of ignoring him two months ago when he warned that the Assad regime was planning a “large-scale chemical weapons attack.”People help to rescue injured after a private school bus falls into a deep gorge in Nurpur, Kangra district, in India on April 9, 2018.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At least 24 children and three adults were killed when a school bus plunged off a mountain road in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh on Monday, police said.

Santosh Patial, a senior police officer in Himachal Pradesh, said they had recovered 27 bodies from the accident site. The adult dead included the driver

The tragedy occurred when the bus swerved off the road and fell into a gorge. The bus was transporting children, all below the age of 13, who were studying at a private school in Nurpur town, 300 km (185 miles) from Shimla, the state capital.

“We have identified all the children and parents have been informed about the disaster,” said Ram Nath Singh, a police officer at the accident site.

Singh said three children with head injuries were taken to a government hospital.

India has the world’s deadliest roads, with almost 150,000 people killed in accidents in 2015, the latest government data shows.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his deep anguish over the tragedy. “My prayers and solidarity with those who lost their near and dear ones in the accident,” he said in a tweet.U.S. President Donald Trump is shown in an official White House handout image meeting with his National Security team at his Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. April 6, 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The spokesman for President Donald Trump’s National Security Council plans to leave the administration, the White House said on Sunday, a day before Trump’s third national security adviser formally takes up his post.

Michael Anton, who also worked for former President George W. Bush’s National Security Council and is a former BlackRock managing director, is leaving after serving under Trump for more than a year, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

“Michael is one of the smartest and most talented individuals I’ve ever worked with,” Sanders said. “He will be greatly missed.”

Trump telephoned Anton on Sunday to thank him for his service, a White House official said.

The White House did not offer a reason for Anton’s departure or say exactly when he would leave. The departure is the latest in a string of staff changes in the administration.

Anton told Politico he planned to join Hillsdale College’s Kirby Center in Washington as a writer and lecturer. Anton did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Anton published a widely read essay in conservative circles before the 2016 election under a pseudonym that compared the presidential race to the doomed Sept. 11, 2001, flight that crashed in Pennsylvania after passengers charged the cockpit.

“2016 is the Flight 93 election: charge the cockpit or you die,” he wrote. “To compound the metaphor: a Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto. With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.”

Last month, Trump said he was replacing H.R. McMaster as national security adviser with John Bolton, a hawk who has advocated using military force against North Korea and Iran. A week earlier, Trump fired Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and nominated Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo to replace him.

Bolton begins work on Monday.

McMaster replaced Michael Flynn, who resigned soon after Trump took office following disclosures he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.

Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia.Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) will run for U.S. Senate, hoping to unseat three-term incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D) in what could become one of the most contentious and expensive Senate races this year.

The term-limited governor confirmed widespread speculation that he was planning to run in an interview with Politico published Monday morning, before making an official announcement in Orlando.

“You’re probably surprised, but I’m going to announce I’m running for senator,” he told Politico. “You’re shocked, right?”

Scott, a businessman and health care executive before he entered politics in 2010, has already raised more than a million dollars through his super PAC and met with GOP donors last month.

President Donald Trump has frequently urged Scott to run. Democrats, who hope to make November’s midterm elections a referendum on Trump, will undoubtedly tie the president to Scott, one of his major allies.

“If it’s good for us, I’m going to support what the White House wants to do,” he said Monday. “If it’s not good for Florida, I’m going to oppose. I’m not going to be a rubber stamp for anybody.”

Scott has frequently reversed his positions on top issues like offshore drilling and Medicaid expansion. Last month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee started running digital ads accusing him of “looking out for himself, not doing what’s best for Floridians.” Last week, the DSCC launched a website called SelfServingScott.com.

“While it’s clear that Rick Scott will say or do anything to get elected, I’ve always believed that if you just do the right thing, the politics will take care of itself,” Nelson said Monday in a statement.

Scott, 65, narrowly edged out Nelson, 75, in a prospective poll conducted by Clearview Research last month, CBS Miami reported. A poll of likely voters gave Scott 43.3 percent of support, two percentage points ahead of the incumbent.

“While it is still very early to make any predictions, it is clear that this off-year election could come down to two simple factors: turnout and gaining margins among NPA (no party affiliation) voters,” Steve Vancore, president of Clearview Research, told CBS Miami.

The governor’s announcement comes amid the turbulent aftermath of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Scott has endured an onslaught of criticism as teenage survivors advocate for public officials to cut ties with the National Rifle Association.

Scott’s past career in health care has haunted him in previous campaigns. From 1987 to 1997, he helmed Columbia/HCA, making it one of the country’s largest health care companies. He also was at the center of one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S. Under Scott’s tenure, Columbia billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that had not been ordered and falsely coded patient records to increase hospital reimbursements. A federal investigation went public in 1997 and Scott resigned four months later, according to Politifact.A survivor of February’s deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, says her classmates’ fight for stricter gun legislation is inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy.

Jaclyn Corin, junior class president at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, spoke about King’s influence at a memorial service for the civil rights leader at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church on Monday.

Corin said that she and other student activists at Parkland organized last month’s rally for gun reform, March for Our Lives, in honor of lives lost to gun violence in places like Chicago, Baltimore, and Newtown. But, she said, the march was also for people like King, “who lost his life to a bullet.”

“The past and the present [are] coming together to create a better future,” Corin said.

Corin and other activists spoke at a service held on the 50th anniversary of King’s funeral procession in Atlanta. After the service, thousands joined in a 1.3 mile March for Humanity led by the civil rights leader’s children Bernice King and Martin Luther King III.

Corin’s friend Joaquin Oliver was among the 17 people killed during the Parkland massacre on Feb. 14. Soon after the shooting, she and other Parkland students began organizing what would become a historic march for gun reform in Washington, D.C. The March 24 event drew support and sister marches around the country and the world.

Corin said that she keeps King’s sixth peace principle on her keychain. The principle assures activists that “the universe is on the side of justice.”

A post shared by Jaclyn Corin (@jackiecorin) on Apr 9, 2018 at 12:56pm PDT

During the March for Our Lives in Washington, Corin introduced King’s granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, to the stage. The granddaughter returned the favor on Monday by introducing Corin to the clergy members, politicians, activists, and relatives of the King family at Ebenezer Baptist, Dr. King’s former church.

Shanan E. Jones, Ebenezer’s former executive pastor, told the crowd inside the church that young people are taking up King’s mantle.

“The Lord is inspiring our young people to lead us forward,” he said.

Corin said that she and her friends were going to keep up the fight for gun reform “as long as we have to.”The “D.C.” in Washington, D.C., might now stand for “dirt collapse,” thanks to a sinkhole recently discovered on the North Lawn of the White House.

Voice Of America reporter Steve Herman first noticed the hole, and he says it’s getting bigger by the day.

“It was noticeably bigger between Sunday and Monday,” Herman told Quartz. “It’s more than a foot long right now.”

A second sinkhole has since opened up next to the first one, he said.

This week I’ve been observing a sinkhole on the @WhiteHouse North Lawn, just outside the press briefing room, growing larger by the day. pic.twitter.com/BsFUtxFqpB — Steve Herman (@W7VOA) May 22, 2018

Erosion and water drainage can cause sinkholes, which sometimes grow large enough to swallow whole buildings.

The White House did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment about the sinkhole.

However, the sinkhole’s location in D.C. ― a city described as a “swamp” of corruption ― did not go unnoticed by Twitter users.

Trump blames Obama for Whitehouse lawn sinkhole. Stay tuned. — chris atwood (@chrisatwood) May 22, 2018That’s been a rallying cry for fans of “Empire Records” every April 8 since the ’90s alternateen classic came out. In the 1995 film, April 8 is the day Rex Manning, a smarmy, overly manicured ’80s pop star played by Maxwell Caulfield, is scheduled to appear in the titular record store staffed by people who hate him ― and everything he stands for.

April 8 also happens to be the day that the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was discovered in his Seattle home.

This Rex Manning Day, actor Ethan Embry, who played the film’s loveably spacey character Mark, made the connection explicit.

“The reason we picked April 8th as the day to have the powdered/coifed Rex Manning visit Empire is because Kurt was found on the 8th of April, the day the music of the 90s lost its mascot,” Embry tweeted.

Embry’s co-star Johnny Whitworth, who played A.J., echoed the sentiment.

Cobain, a human being and not merely a mascot, killed himself on April 5, 1994. His death shook the rock world and signaled the beginning of the end of the ’90s grunge era, which was replaced later in the decade by the more polished pop sound of boy bands and Britney Spears.The federal government’s top ethics official says it’s time for the Environmental Protection Agency to address “extremely concerning” reports regarding EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s potential ethics violations.

David Apol, acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, called on Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s top ethics official, to investigate three areas of concern involving Pruitt’s living arrangements, use of taxpayer dollars and staffing decisions, according to a letter first obtained by The New York Times.

“The success of our government depends on maintaining the trust of the people we serve,” Apol wrote in the letter, which was sent to the EPA on Monday, according to the Times. “The American public needs to have confidence that ethics violations, as well as the appearance of ethics violations, are investigated and appropriately addressed.”

Here is the letter folks, courtesy of The NYT. Please credit pic.twitter.com/Y0B1aVKSa4 — Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) April 9, 2018

In his letter, Apol brought up reports that Pruitt lived in a Capitol Hill townhouse last year co-owned by the wife of prominent energy lobbyist J. Steven Hart, whose firm represents several fossil fuels companies.

Apol also raised concerns about Pruitt’s use of taxpayer dollars for travel, security and some of his employees’ salaries. Pruitt’s frequent and expensive trips to and from his home state of Oklahoma were the subject of an EPA inspector general probe last year. Pruitt has also been scrutinized over his security detail, which includes roughly 20 full-time, round-the-clock security guards ― three times as many as his predecessor had.

The EPA should also investigate whether employees were “reassigned or demoted” for challenging Pruitt’s potentially unethical behavior, Apol wrote. The Times reported last month that at least five EPA officials were “reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs” after raising questions about Pruitt’s “spending and management.”

“If true, it is hard to imagine any action that could more effectively undermine an agency’s integrity than punishing or marginalizing employees who strive to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that safeguard that integrity,” Apol wrote in his letter to the EPA.

Minoli responded to Apol’s request with a letter of his own, stating that EPA’s ethics officials lack “independent investigatory authority.”

“We referred your letter to the EPA [Inspector General],” Minoli wrote. “As always, the EPA’s office stands ready to assist the IG in any way.”

A representative from the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

The Office of Government Ethics does not have the authority to discipline Pruitt, the Times noted, though the agency can request that President Donald Trump punish a federal official found to be in violation of ethics rules.

Pruitt has come under fire for at least 23 ethics issues, and the White House announced Friday that it would conduct a review of Pruitt’s conduct. But Trump has defended his EPA head, tweeting Friday that Pruitt was “doing a great job.”

Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans, including Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), have called on Pruitt to resign in the wake of his ethics scandals.

On Monday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) requested a federal investigation into whether two top Pruitt aides’ raises violated multiple federal laws.Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), who is mounting a longshot bid against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in this fall’s midterm election, says he’s already seen enough evidence to support the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

“The answer is yes,” O’Rourke told a Texas radio host Monday, when asked whether he saw enough evidence to impeach Trump. “Because I want to be straight with you. I’ve seen an attempt, no matter how ham-handed, to collude with a foreign government in our national election. I’ve seen an effort to obstruct justice in the investigation of what happened in the 2016 election.”

But the Democratic congressman, who has shattered state fundraising records in his campaign to oust the conservative incumbent, quickly added that the opening of impeachment proceedings against the president ought to wait for the conclusion of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

“Impeachment as I understand it is tantamount to an indictment,” O’Rourke said. “It says that this should be decided by the Senate. As a prospective senator, we must await all the facts, all the truth, all the information forthcoming from the Bob Mueller investigation. The most important thing to me is to safeguard the independence and the integrity of the Mueller investigation.”

O’Rourke also said that enough Republicans must be on board with impeachment.

“Impeachment doesn’t make any sense right now, until you have reached the point that the facts are so compelling that a Republican colleague, it may be [Texas GOP Rep.] Jodey Arrington, it may be someone else, is able to come before their constituents and explain how they voted to impeach the president of their own party,” he said. “We are not there yet. So I’m going to stay focused on the issues that we can make a difference on right now. And we’ll leave this until we get the conclusion of that investigation.”

While few Democrats have gone so far as to call for Trump’s impeachment, Republican leaders have begun warning that Trump could face immediate impeachment proceedings if they lose the House in November, according to The New York Times. The tactic is reportedly meant to galvanize complacent GOP voters ahead of what is shaping up to be an extremely tough cycle.

David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama, urged Democrats “NOT commit to impeachment unless & until there’s a demonstrable case for one.”

Dems should NOT commit to impeachment unless & until there’s a demonstrable case for one.

It is not just a matter of politics. It’s a matter of principle.

Premise: A family of superheroes tries to stick together while fighting evil. As the mom’s stardom rises, the rest of the family has to reckon with their own lack of fame, along with missing having her around.

Is it good? This movie earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature and has a credible chance at winning (although “Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse” has the best odds). It also has a 93 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 80 on Metacritic. If you have loved Pixar movies in the past, this continues in that lineage of tone and quality.

Heads Up: Disney had to issue a warning that this movie might cause those with epilepsy to have a seizure. The movie has many flashing lights and colors that even those without epilepsy may find overwhelming.

AdvertisementLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - “A Quiet Place” was looking to make noise at the weekend box office, and it delivered.

Paramount Pictures’ thriller directed by John Krasinski soared past estimates to a massive $50.3 million opening in 3,508 theaters. That’s enough to land it the second-highest domestic opening of the year to date behind “Black Panther,” which opened in February with $202 million. Since its debut at South by Southwest, “A Quiet Place” has garnered rave reviews. It currently holds a solid 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, with a B+ CinemaScore.

“This much bigger than expected debut comes in an era of ongoing popularity for the horror genre that in North America alone last year generated over $1 billion in box office,” Paul Dergarabedian, a media analyst at comScore, said.

Paramount’s president of domestic distribution Kyle Davies, attributed the film’s success to positive word of mouth following SXSW.

“There was a lot of momentum going into the weekend that never stopped,” Davies said. “John Krasinski has emerged as an incredible filmmaker with a story that’s simple, but has clearly resonated with audiences.” At No. 2, Steven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One” made $25 million in 4,234 locations in its second weekend, bringing its total domestic grosses up to $97 million. The Warner Bros.′ film has been a strong contender overseas, where it has made $294.4 million.

Another weekend release, “Blockers,” secured third place at the box office. Universal’s raunchy R-rated comedy ― directed by Kay Cannon and starring John Cena, Leslie Mann, and Ike Barinholtz ― released in line with projections for an impressive $21.4 million debut in 3,379 theaters. “Blockers” has been another buzzy title from SXSW, earning an 83 percent on Rotten Tomatoes along with a B CinemaScore.

“We could not be more pleased with the result this weekend,” Universal’s head of distribution Jim Orr said. “Kay Cannon and her directorial debut knocked it out of the park. It really overperformed.” Meanwhile, the eighth frame of “Black Panther” landed at No. 4 with $8.8 million in 2,747 locations. Domestically, the Marvel film earned $665.4 million, making it the third-biggest release of all time behind “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and “Avatar.” Globally, “Black Panther” has grossed $1.29 billion.

Rounding out the top five is Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions’ “I Can Only Imagine,” with $8.4 million in 2,894 theaters. The faith-based film has been a force at the box office, making $69 million in four weeks.

Two other newcomers, “Chappaquiddick” and “The Miracle Season” premiered slightly above estimates. Entertainment Studios’ “Chappaquiddick” opened with $5.9 million at 1,560 locations, while LD Entertainment’s “The Miracle Season” saw $4 million at 1,707 locations.
