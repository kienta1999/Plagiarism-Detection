Last year during a home game against the Atlanta Hawks, Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers experienced his first panic attack.

The episode not only forced the NBA power forward to leave the game at halftime, it forced him to open up about his struggle with mental health.

In an essay for the Players’ Tribune published Tuesday, the 29-year-old athlete detailed what happened when he was hospitalized mid-game in November, how he suffered silently and why he’s speaking out about mental health now.

“It came out of nowhere. I’d never had one before. I didn’t even know if they were real,” Love wrote of his panic attack.

“But it was real — as real as a broken hand or a sprained ankle. Since that day, almost everything about the way I think about my mental health has changed.”

While Love detailed his panic attack in November, his essay didn’t mention what happened when he left a Jan. 22 game due to an undisclosed illness and later missed a practice. His teammates were reportedly upset over his absences, though things settled down once Love explained to the team during a meeting what was going on, ESPN reported at the time.

After Love’s essay was published, Cleveland.com reported Tuesday that Love had disclosed his panic attacks during that meeting.

Love said he had recovered from the November incident and performed successfully at a game two days later, but something else had begun troubling him: “Why was I so concerned with people finding out?”

Love eventually found help through therapy, which he said he had never thought he’d pursue. Through those sessions, Love wrote, he discovered issues beyond the pressures of the NBA that were weighing him down, including the death of his grandmother.

“In the short time I’ve been meeting with the therapist, I’ve seen the power of saying things out loud in a setting like that,” Love wrote. “And it’s not some magical process. It’s terrifying and awkward and hard, at least in my experience so far.”

I’ve never been comfortable sharing much about myself. I thought about mental health as someone else’s problem. I’ve realized I need to change that. https://t.co/355HcQw3Ei — Kevin Love (@kevinlove) March 6, 2018

Love said he was inspired to speak out about his mental health issues after the Toronto Raptors’ DeMar DeRozan revealed last month that he has been struggling with depression, feelings of loneliness and anxiety.

DeRozan hinted at his issues in a tweet in late February, then later expanded on his experience in an interview with The Toronto Star.

“This is real stuff,” DeRozan told the Star. “We’re all human at the end of the day.

The Toronto guard added, “My mom always told me: Never make fun of anybody because you never know what that person is going through.”

In his essay, Love said that men especially need to know it’s OK to speak up about their feelings ― something he had been uncomfortable with for most of his life.

“If you’re suffering silently like I was, then you know how it can feel like nobody really gets it,” Love wrote, before noting what pushed him to write his piece.

Partly, I want to do it for me, but mostly, I want to do it because people don’t talk about mental health enough. And men and boys are probably the farthest behind. I know it from experience. Growing up, you figure out really quickly how a boy is supposed to act. You learn what it takes to “be a man.” It’s like a playbook: Be strong. Don’t talk about your feelings. Get through it on your own. So for 29 years of my life, I followed that playbook.

The stigma around mental health is a very serious problem for men.

A 2015 survey found that men are more likely than women to hide thoughts of suicide. And, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, white men accounted for 7 out of 10 suicides in 2016, while the rate of suicide is highest for middle-aged men.

Love addressed this in his essay, calling it an invisible struggle men have to face.

“Look, I’m probably not telling you anything new here,” Love wrote.

“These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they’re everywhere … and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water,” he added. “They’re a lot like depression or anxiety in that way.”

Loves’ teammates, and other NBA players, have praised Love for being courageous enough to speak up about his struggles. Now, in response to all of the support, the Cavaliers’ forward is asking for others to share their own stories with him.

If want to share your story you can email me at kevin@playerstribune.com (yes I'll read it). — Kevin Love (@kevinlove) March 6, 2018Apache Dodson has lived in the working-class waterfront city of Vallejo, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area almost all her life. The 83-year-old takes pride in her two-story home on the city’s south side, which was built more than 100 years ago.

“It’s a beauty,” she says.

But change may be in the cards for Dodson and for the rest of her neighborhood. Orcem, an American subsidiary of Irish cement manufacturer Ecocem, has been eyeing the old Sperry Flour Mill site on the mouth of the Napa River to build a cement grinding facility, just blocks from Dodson’s home.

To support the factory’s operations, the Vallejo Marine Terminal – which owns the majority of the project site and would lease a portion to Orcem – is proposing to revamp a defunct commercial rail line and open an international shipping terminal.

While some residents and city officials are in favor of the cement project, opponents say the pollution from the factory, and from heavy truck traffic it would generate, would pose severe risks to the health of residents, especially the predominantly black community close to the facility.

A city of 121,000 people, Vallejo was once home to the Mare Island Navy Shipyard, which built tankers, destroyers, and nuclear submarines. After the shipyard was decommissioned in 1996, Vallejo became a bedroom community as its residents sought work elsewhere.

Orcem’s promise of employment, tax revenue, and a $1 million investment into local nonprofits is understandably attractive to some in a city that declared bankruptcy in 2008. The company says its facility would provide up to 40 full-time jobs and an additional 100 during the 15-month construction period.

Prominent Vallejo business owner Buck Kamphausen wrote in the Vallejo Times-Herald in May that Orcem would be the ideal business to replace the “decaying and dangerous” former flour mill. “Who is going to pay for a rotting old industrial building?,” he asked. “The state and federal governments are way out of money for this kind of project.”

But others are wary. “Vallejo suffers from low self-esteem,” says Diana Lang, a real estate agent and Vallejo resident of more than 17 years. “There’s some people who look back on the glory days of industry and see that this could replicate that.” Lang says the environmental consequences of the facility would outweigh the benefit of its few jobs.

According to the official project description, the cement facility would operate around the clock, with 189 trucks making trips to and from the site once it’s working at full capacity. The site is within 300 feet of residential zones, and about a quarter mile from Grace Patterson Elementary School.

“We don’t want it here,” Dodson says. “Our roads can’t take that kind of damage. Our bodies can’t take that kind of damage.”

Dodson, who has asthma, says she and her neighbors already suffer from a high rate of illness. Of the eight households on her block, six have someone with a chronic illness, she says. She fears a cement factory would worsen their conditions.

LaDonna Williams, a veteran of environmental justice campaigning in the Bay Area who has lived in Vallejo for 30 years, says of corporations: “They always come in on the south side or the black side of town and think it’s OK to put these kinds of polluting companies in.”

A recent study by Environmental Protection Agency researchers gives weight to Williams’ assertion. It found that refineries and factories emitting dangerous air pollutants disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color. Black people in particular bear the biggest environmental burden of any group, the study says.

Local activists are keen to stress this point to the Vallejo community in response to Orcem’s promises. “Do we really put that kind of job over people’s lives?” asks Williams. “No. I don’t even think that’s an option.”

Orcem, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, touts the site’s location as positive. On its website, it mentions the deep-water berth, railroad, and proximity to the highway as an opportunity to help “establish Vallejo as a center of international trade and commerce.”

But to others, the project is an inappropriate use of prime waterfront property. Lang, who has worked in real estate for 13 years, says the fact that homes are located downwind from the site should disqualify it from being used for heavy industry. “Besides that, it would be a really unattractive thing to have on the waterfront as people come in and out via ferry,” she says.

Peter Brooks, president of Fresh Air Vallejo, a grassroots group formed in opposition to the cement facility, says Vallejo is no longer as desperate for jobs, and should look for economic opportunities outside of heavy industry. He points to Factory OS, a company that manufactures modular homes, which recently opened a factory in Vallejo’s Mare Island neighborhood, providing hundreds of jobs.

“Vallejo is poised for greatness. We’ve paid our toxic dues. We have pulled ourselves out of bankruptcy. We are attracting businesses, good businesses,” Brooks says.

Orcem’s website says it would produce what it calls “green cement.” It would ship iron slag — a byproduct of steel production — from Asia, grind it into a powder, and mix it with other materials to make cement. This type of cement requires less energy and emits far fewer greenhouse gases during production than traditional Portland cement, which is manufactured by heating limestone at high temperatures.

Jeremy Gregory, executive director of MIT’s Concrete Sustainability Hub, says pollutants created by a cement facility are undoubtedly cause for concern, but California has strong regulations to help keep those risks in check.

One thing that’s certain, Gregory says, is that demand for cement ― a key ingredient of concrete for buildings, pavements, and bridges ― isn’t going away. “If you don’t have this facility there, you’ll still have to do this somewhere,” he says.

But environmentalists look to other communities that have housed cement production as warnings. In 2001, residents of Camden, New Jersey, unsuccessfully sued to block the opening of a slag grinding cement facility, similar to the one proposed by Orcem. A 2009 study for the state Department of Environmental Protection found that the facility contributed air pollution to the neighborhood in its vicinity.

And about 100 miles south of Vallejo, the town of Davenport in Santa Cruz County is trying to figure out life post-cement factory. For over 100 years, the plant there produced Portland cement. In 2008, cancer-causing chromium 6 was discovered on the factory property, and it closed in 2010. Cemex, the most recent owner of the plant, is looking for a buyer for the property who would work with the county to reuse the site for something else.

“It provided good jobs and tax revenue, but it had significant environmental impacts in terms of dust and pollution,” says Ryan Coonerty, the Santa Cruz County supervisor who represents the area. “It was, without a question, a mixed blessing for the community.”

The Davenport plant paid a significant portion of water and sewage fees in the town. After it closed, that cost fell on the residents, who now pay among the highest water and sewer rates in the country, Coonerty says. Still, he thinks he’d struggle to find even a half-dozen people in Davenport who would want the plant back today.

Back in Vallejo, the city planning commission rejected the cement facility proposal last March, but Orcem appealed, and in a 4-3 vote the city council sided with Orcem and ordered the completion of a final environmental impact report, which is expected in May.

Opponents of the cement facility agree the site should be redeveloped, but say they’d rather see mixed-use development with live-work lofts, hotels, restaurants, shops, educational institutions, and outdoor activities like kayaking and hiking.

Brooks, from Fresh Air Vallejo, says restoring the old flour mill this way could turn it into a symbol for Vallejo. “When you come by ferry from San Francisco, it’s the first thing you see,” he says. “It should represent the new Vallejo. It should represent the new economy. It should welcome you to the Napa Valley.”

"International Women’s Day to me is a way to celebrate and show gratitude to those who fought for gender equality across the world. And I see the best way to celebrate and thank these history makers is by having women everywhere make the most of the opportunities we have and really explore this unbridled potential we posses. Also not forgetting the countries where gender equality is not embraced and as a collective of people find ways to change this and support those that are fighting for this goal."Fox News host Tucker Carlson has announced a special series that will air on his show every Wednesday through the month of March. The “Men in America” series will focus on what Carlson described as a “crisis” facing American men.

As watchful Twitter users noted, March is Women’s History Month in the U.S. — a month meant to commemorate and celebrate the role of women in American history.

it's women's history month, so naturally tucker carlson has a series on men pic.twitter.com/mFikfihkds — John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) March 7, 2018

Carlson promoted the series on his show Tuesday and explained the rationale.

“We hear a lot about female empowerment in this country, and, of course, we’re totally for that — we’re for empowering all Americans. But for some reason, you almost never hear anything about how men are doing in America,” Carlson began.

After taking a “close look at the numbers,” Carlson said his team was so “stunned by the scope of the crisis” that they decided to devote the month of March to covering this “largely ignored disaster.”

“It is a disaster,” he stressed. “It affects every person in America.”

AdvertisementSen Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has a warning for his fellow Republicans: The party is in danger of losing both houses of Congress in November.

Cruz said the “extreme left” could turn out in big numbers, motivated to fight the agenda of President Donald Trump.

“We know that the left is going to show up,” Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “The extreme left, they’re angry. They’re filled with rage. They hate the president.”

Cruz also said that if the economy is booming and conservatives show up at the polls, his party could pick up as many as seven seats in the Senate and hold a “large, functioning majority.”

However, he also warned of the opposite scenario:

“If conservatives are complacent, and mark my words, we are going to see historic turnout from the extreme left in November, which means if conservatives stay home, we have the potential, we could lose both houses of Congress.”

If Democrats take control of the House, he predicted that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would become speaker again and immediately initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Closer to home, Cruz also warned of a possible blue wave in the Lone Star State.

“In Texas, if conservatives stay home, if we rest on our laurels, we could see Texas turn blue,” he said. “We could see every statewide official in the state becoming a Democrat.”

He added that he didn’t think that was likely.

Democrats are facing a daunting Senate map this November, defending more seats than Republicans, including several in states that voted for Trump in 2016, such as Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota and West Virginia.

Cruz himself is up for re-election. While his seat is considered safe, he’s facing a challenge from Rep. Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from the El Paso area.

O’Rourke raised $2.3 million in the first six weeks of 2018, or nearly triple the $800,000 raised by Cruz over that period, according to the Texas Tribune.The new analysis of fishing, tourism and recreation industry data comes in response to the administration’s sweeping offshore drilling plan aimed at opening huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans to oil exploration. The proposal, part of an ongoing “energy dominance” agenda, makes available for lease roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.

Diane Hoskins, a campaign director at Oceana, said the main takeaway from the review is that expanding offshore drilling is not worth the risks this activity would pose to coastal communities that rely on clean, healthy oceans.

“It’s time for [Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke] and Washington to listen to the millions of Americans who already made their voices heard on this issue,” she said. “They’re overwhelmingly saying ‘no’ to drilling off their coasts. And these numbers make it clear just how much is at stake.”

Take, for example, Massachusetts, where commercial fishing, tourism and ocean recreation support 110,000 jobs, according to Oceana. State lawmakers there are among those urging the administration to abandon its offshore plans, noting the state’s marine economy generated more than $17.3 billion in 2015.

“This puts at risk our economy, our vibrant and historic fishing industry, our tourism industry. It, of course, puts at risk our many thousands of miles of coastline in Massachusetts,” state Attorney General Maura Healey told reporters at an event in Washington, D.C., late last month. “We know the devastation, having seen one too many oil spills.”

Looking at economic data and federal resource assessments, Oceana concluded that the supply of undiscovered and accessible reserves off the Atlantic, Pacific and Florida Gulf coasts would meet America’s oil demands for only two years and natural gas demands for one year.

Florida, Zinke added, is “unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.”

The seemingly arbitrary decision came just two days into a 60-day public comment period. Some wondered if Zinke would give equal weight to voices from blue states; others suggested the move was a political stunt to help get Scott elected to the Senate this year. Democratic governors, lawmakers and other officials demanded that their states also be granted waivers.

The director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has since said that Zinke’s announcement on social media “is not a formal action,” meaning the waters off the coast of Florida are still being considered for oil and gas drilling.A Democratic candidate in Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race released a campaign ad on Tuesday that includes a shot of her breastfeeding while talking about her political achievements. Kelda Roys, a former Wisconsin state representative and entrepreneur, spends part of the ad discussing her role in the 2010 BPA Free Kids Act becoming law. As Roys talks about the measure to stop neurotoxin bisphenol A from being added to baby bottles and sippy cups, her husband hands her their 4-month-old child.

Roys holds the fussy baby and begins to breastfeed.

“Government should be about helping every person achieve his or her potential ― and Wisconsin used to do it so well,” Roys said in the video moments later. “Democracy only works when we all get involved.”

The powerful scene wasn’t planned, Roys told HuffPost.

“Anybody who’s ever had a baby can tell you that they are unpredictable,” Roys said. “I just did what I have been trained by her to do, which is to immediately grab her and feed her, and I just sort of didn’t think about it.”

“When they sent back the video and it was in there, I just said, ’What the heck, this is real life,’” she added. “I think, in 2018, people are hungry for candidates who are authentic and speak the truth. I don’t want to have to hide a really important part of myself in order to win an election.”

“What sets me apart from the rest of the field is not that I have a baby, but I have a track record of getting things done.” - Kelda Roys

Some internet users have attacked her over the ad, but Roys said the feedback has been mostly positive.

“I’ve had a tremendous amount of support and encouragement from people ― even Republican women,” she said. “Of course, there have been some haters and internet trolls. ... Some men just feel, I guess, entitled to comment on my body. But the story of 2018 isn’t about internet trolls. The story of 2018 is about women rising up.”

Roys is one of more than a dozen Democratic gubernatorial candidates hoping to unseat two-term incumbent Gov. Scott Walker (R), a climate science skeptic and proponent of controversial school choice programs.After going on a defiant media spree on Monday, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg said Tuesday that he would comply with special counsel Robert Mueller’s subpoena to appear before a federal grand jury regarding Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Though he’d bombastically claimed the opposite on multiple cable news shows, Nunberg did suggest to The Associated Press on Monday that he’d change his mind. And by Tuesday, he’d done just that.

Apparently, it was something he heard on MSNBC’s “The Beat with Ari Melber” that led him to reconsider his position.

Nunberg told The Washington Post that listening to fellow guest Maya Wiley, a civil rights activist, lawyer and New School professor who previously served as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s chief counsel, was the reason he changed his mind.

He described Wiley as “very, very smart” and said she “made a compelling case to me.”

Watch the moment @mayawiley convinced Sam Nunberg to comply with Mueller Grand Jury subpoena: pic.twitter.com/Aa5K5dfUAN — TheBeat w/Ari Melber (@TheBeatWithAri) March 6, 2018

Wiley, a racial justice expert, joined the MSNBC segment shortly after Nunberg noted that he had been fired from the Trump campaign following the discovery of racially charged Facebook posts that he’d allegedly authored.

She pointed out to him that if Mueller had offered him immunity, as Nunberg said, he personally didn’t have any reason not to testify. Then she noted that failing to testify would be a disservice to his self-described mentor, Roger Stone.

“It actually makes it appear that Roger Stone has something to hide because you will not go testify,” Wiley said.

As for Nunberg’s complaints about how much time complying with the subpoena would take, Wiley was incredulous.

“You’d rather possibly spend a year in jail than spend 80 hours going through emails?” she asked.

In a statement on Tuesday to MSNBC, Wiley said:

I joined the set after Sam Nunberg referenced his racially offensive statements that got him fired from the Trump campaign, dismissing their relevance because they wouldn’t have lost Trump a vote. Unspoken was his willingness to use the “N” word in reference to black leaders. That Nunberg actually recognizes the value and intelligence of a black woman is, I hope, a life lesson for him. I assume he has sought the advice and counsel of his lawyer. I hope what I gave him was a sense of humanity we need now more than ever in this country.When the Rev. David Meredith, an openly gay United Methodist pastor, told his Ohio congregation that two documents that affirmed his pastoral credentials were stolen from his office, his parishioners did what they’ve been doing ever since he arrived at their church six years ago.

They affirmed him in their own way.

Members did their best to ease the pastor’s sadness after he said an intruder sneaked into his office and stole his seminary diploma and ordination certificate in late April. Congregants plastered Meredith’s office door with awards and certificates of their own on Sunday, sharing handwritten notes about how he had changed their lives.

Some called him the “world’s best pastor,” and others wrote about how he restored their faith.

“I grew up going to church. I was so jaded by all the inequality and hypocrisy I saw in the institution that I stopped going to church,” one congregant wrote on a certificate. “Through his actions, warmth, and incredible kindness ... David has made me want to be part of this again.”

The United Methodist Church, the third-largest religious denomination in the U.S., with more than 7 million members, considers gay and lesbian relationships sinful. But Meredith’s congregation, Cincinnati’s Clifton United Methodist Church, is a welcoming and affirming community.

Given that the UMC is still debating whether he should be allowed to continue as a pastor, Meredith said, the theft of his diploma and certificate seemed like a “planned, purposeful attack.”

“It was a despicable act of intimidation,” he told HuffPost in an email.

Meredith said he believes the theft occurred in the last week of April. He said there were no obvious signs of an intruder going through drawers, shelves or closets. His laptop and other valuable church items were not taken.

The two missing items ― his 1983 ordination certificate and his 1984 diploma from the St. Paul School of Theology in Overland Park, Kansas — were of priceless personal value, however. Meredith said that none of the signers of the original documents are alive to provide him with copies.

He said he was profoundly sad and angered when he realized that he had lost these “outward and visible signs of a powerful, spiritual, and communal experience from my life and history.”

“My rage expanded from the one who did the crime to the ones who were complicit in it because of their silence and/or their fear-based and punishment focused theology,” he wrote.

He said that Cincinnati police have conducted an initial investigation into the theft. Lt. Steve Saunders, a public information officer for the department, said it is aware of the incident and is actively investigating.

While Meredith is saddened by the loss of the documents, he is heartened by the response of his congregants, who have been supportive of his relationship since he arrived at the church in July 2012,he said.

“They are a marvel as a United Methodist congregation,” he said. “Even when the denomination leans toward the suggestion that there is no place for LGBTQ persons, pastors, their families or congregations, this congregation steps in a little deeper.”

In addition to the homemade certificates, Clifton UMC and the Cincinnati interfaith community held a rally at the church on Sunday. Jewish and Muslim community leaders were among those who spoke up in support of Meredith.

The reported theft occurred during a pivotal moment in the UMC’s history. Church leaders are trying to prevent a schism in the church over whether to ordain queer clergy or allow ministers to officiate at same-sex weddings. Progressive members of the church are in favor of these moves, but conservatives and many UMC leaders from Africa and Asia oppose them.

UMC leaders are evaluating several proposed plans to try to keep the denomination together. It has dedicated a special February 2019 meeting of the church’s General Conference, the church’s top decision-making body, to try to resolve these issues.

Meredith told HuffPost that no matter what happens, Clifton UMC will remain committed to letting LGBTQ Methodists know that there is a place for them in the denomination.A screenshot from Tony Kao's Facebook video. Tony Kao / Facebook

A California college faculty member is facing backlash after she was caught on video telling an Asian-American man and his family to go back to their “home country.”

Tarin Olson is on leave from her career counseling position at Golden West College in Huntington Beach for the next two weeks, a spokeswoman for the Coast Community College District told HuffPost. The district said it is reviewing Olson’s past interactions with students and staff and determining what actions to take next.

“Administrators are working diligently to find a resolution to this issue and communicate to the community that the sentiments of Tarin Olson do not represent the values of Golden West College,” spokeswoman Letitia Clark wrote in an email.

Clark did not specify whether Olson was placed on leave or whether the leave was voluntary, saying that she couldn’t offer details because “this is a personnel matter.”

Long Beach resident Tony Kao, who is Asian-American, posted two Facebook videos on March 1 of an encounter he had with Olson while taking a walk with his wife and infant child. The recording starts mid-conversation, seconds before Olson realizes she is being filmed and starts walking away. She can be heard telling Kao and his family, “You need to go back to your home country.”

Watch one of Kao’s two Facebook videos below.

In the videos, Kao tells Olson that he and his wife were born and raised in the United States. They briefly follow Olson, asking for an explanation of her comments. She tells Kao, “It’s not safe because there’s too many people like you here.” She also says, “You’re making my culture extinct.”

Olson did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Earlier this week, she told a local CBS station that she didn’t want to speak about Kao’s video, but would be willing to talk about the “displacement of European-Americans.”

“I feel my perspective will be twisted if discussing the skewed video which cut out part of the incident,” she said in a statement to CBS2 News. “If you would like to have a full normal interview about the displacement of European-Americans, then I gladly am available to enlighten the public.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, Olson was still listed on the Coast Community College District website as a faculty member. Clark told HuffPost that Olson teaches a class on career planning, and that she has tenure and has been an employee at the school since 1991.

Clark said Golden West College is taking Kao’s video “very seriously.”

“The College leadership... understands that the sentiments made by the faculty member in public are hurtful and painful, particularly for the Asian-American community,” Clark wrote.

In a follow-up statement on Facebook, Kao expressed gratitude for the support he’s received. He said his family’s intention in going public was to express their sadness and surprise that such racist attitudes existed in their Long Beach neighborhood.

Kao added that he doesn’t mean Olson any harm.Arie Luyendyk Jr. might want to leave some reality TV fans off the guest list for his wedding.

The controversial star of “The Bachelor” got engaged to Lauren Burnham on Tuesday’s “After the Final Rose” episode, capping so much bitter drama.

Luyendyk invited internet scorn this week for the finale, when he dumped Becca Kufrin, the woman he originally proposed to, to pursue Burnham, the runner-up he had already rejected.

His much-debated switcheroo apparently worked out. Burnham decided to give Luyendyk a second chance when he visited her at her parents’ house in Virginia Beach, Virginia. That led to Tuesday’s TV proposal, in which he proclaimed, “I have made some bad decisions, but the best decision was running back to you.”

She said yes (well, it was “definitely!”).

Host Chris Harrison couldn’t resist a tiny dig at the previous betrothal betrayal, saying, “I hope this engagement lasts a longer time.”

As for Kufrin, she will be looking for love again as the new star of “The Bachelorette.”

Good luck to all.George P. Bush won the primary for Texas land commissioner on Tuesday after touting his continued support of President Donald Trump, a position that runs in contrast to the rest of his family dynasty.

Bush referenced his endorsement of Trump in 2016 in a recent campaign ad, and his spokesman Lee Spieckerman has said that Bush has “epitomized” Trump’s Republican party.

Bush “is his own man,” Spieckerman told the Houston Chronicle, referencing political differences among family members. “He represents a new generation of conservative leaders. The Republican Party is rigorous. It’s diverse, and it’s a party epitomized by President Trump.”

Bush is the son of the Trump’s presidential rival Jeb Bush― a frequent target of Trump’s mockery― and was the only member of his family to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign.

Trump endorsed Bush last week and appeared to hint at the tension.

Texas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn’t the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.

“I’m honored to be endorsed by my friend, Donald Trump Jr.,” Bush said in response. “I was proud to endorse Trump in 2016 and I have worked closely with the Trump administration to bring real conservative results to the people of Texas.”

Former first ladies Barbara Bush and Laura Bush also declined to vote for Trump, and several members of the Bush clan even supported Clinton.

Since the election, Jeb Bush and George W. Bush have been somewhat outspoken critics of Trump’s approach to governing in the past year. The former president― who had abysmal approval ratings during the end of his tenure― has also reportedly joked that Trump “makes me look pretty good.”

Other GOP candidates in the Texas race similarly played up their alignment with Trump in order to sway voters. Congressional candidate Kathaleen Wall released a campaign video featuring her own life’s parallels to Trump’s.

“One says ‘build that wall,’ one agrees in, well, his wall,” the video said.

In another campaign video featuring him standing in the middle of a swamp, a “Make America Great Again” hat sitting atop his head and a shotgun in his hand, Robert Stovall said he’s running for Congress to help Trump achieve his agenda.Greta Lindecrantz, a criminal defense investigator from Colorado, is jailed for contempt of court after refusing to testify in a condemned killer's appeal because of her faith. Arapahoe County Sheriffs Office

A Mennonite woman in Colorado has been jailed for refusing to testify in a condemned murderer’s death penalty appeal because of her faith.

Greta Lindecrantz, who was a private investigator for the killer’s defense back in 2009, has already spent nine nights at the Arapahoe County Detention Facility. She faces months more behind bars after she was charged with contempt of court for refusing to answer questions about former client Robert Ray, one of three men on Colorado’s death row.

Lindecrantz, 67, was subpoenaed by prosecutors fighting Ray’s appeal to testify about her work for his defense during the original trial. She says religious beliefs prevent her from testifying for the prosecution in a death penalty case.

“Ms. Lindecrantz is firm in her faith-based commitment that she can not be used as a tool for prosecutors seeking to kill a fellow human being,” her lawyer, Mari Newman, told HuffPost.

Lindecrantz told Colorado District Judge Michelle Amico in court Feb. 26 that she would have no problem testifying if “death wasn’t on the line.”

“I feel like I was handed a gun and I was told to point it at Mr. Ray, and the gun might or might not have bullets in it, but I’d have to fire it anyway. I can’t shoot the gun. I can’t shoot the gun,” Lindecrantz said, sobbing, according to The Colorado Independent.

Lindecrantz on Friday filed a motion seeking to testify as a witness called by the court, instead of by prosecutors. Amico ruled against her, and an appeals court unanimously upheld the decision, according to The Associated Press. Newman said she’s preparing an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court.

In the meantime, Lindecrantz will remain in jail unless she agrees to testify for the prosecution. She could be held for up to six months.

Jail is “extraordinarily difficult” for Lindecrantz, her lawyer said. She’s lost seven pounds and hasn’t been able to see her husband, a man in his 70s who needed help figuring out how to book visitations online, Newman said.

According to the Independent, Lindecrantz is a “highly respected, veteran investigator” who has worked on several death penalty cases and defended detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

Ray was convicted in 2009 for the 2005 murders of a Colorado couple, Javad Marshall-Fields and fiancee Vivian Wolfe. He and co-defendant Sir Mario Owens were sentenced to death.

Ray’s current defense team argues that his original legal team was ineffective during the 2009 trial. Prosecutors who want the death sentence upheld claim the original defenders represented Ray professionally. The prosecutors have already questioned other members of Ray’s team.

Newman said prosecutors don’t need Lindecrantz’s testimony for the appeal.

“Any information that could theoretically be elicited through her testimony is already in the court record. She provided her entire file to the prosecution,” Newman said. “The lawyers who directed her work and make all decisions about what was and was not done in the case have already testified and been cross examined.”

She added: “This is not about the truth-seeking process; this is about a prosecutor and judge ... punishing Ms. Lindecrantz for refusing to abandon her faith-based refusal to testify for the prosecution seeking to kill her fellow human being.”

The Denver-area Mennonite community has been rallying around Lindecrantz, organizing hymn sings and prayer protests outside the courthouse and jail. Lindecrantz was a member of First Mennonite Church for two decades and more recently joined Beloved Community Mennonite Church, the Rev. Vern Rempel told HuffPost.

Rempel explained that Mennonites’ objection to capital punishment stems from their beliefs about the nature of God.Striking school workers hold signs and chant inside the West Virginia Capitol in Charleston, March 2, 2018. Scott Heins/Bloomberg via Getty Images

West Virginia teachers and school personnel just ended perhaps the most significant American worker strike in years ― and they did it in a state where public sector workers are supposed to have very little collective strength.

The number of strikes per year in the United States is at a historic low, just like the share of workers who belong to a union. Massive strikes like the one in West Virginia almost never happen anymore. The work stoppage closed schools across the state for nine weekdays, and secured 5 percent pay raises for teachers and other public workers. It also provided a booster shot to the country’s weakened labor movement, and has prompted talk of similar teacher strikes elsewhere.

The state never intended for teachers to be able to flex muscle like that. West Virginia public sector workers don’t enjoy formal collective bargaining rights under state law. They do not bargain contracts spelling out wages and benefits for members, the way public sector unions do in most other states. The teacher pay scale is set by the state legislature, making teachers’ unions more like associations, lobbying lawmakers on members’ concerns. Strikes are supposed to be illegal.

Despite those institutional weaknesses ― or perhaps because of them ― the unions and their members found a simple yet radical way to force the state to hear their demands on health care and pay: Shut down schools in every single county for nearly two weeks. Had the teachers been working under a collective bargaining agreement, the strike almost certainly never would have happened, since any such contract would include a no-strike clause to ensure labor peace.

“There was two months of organizing here.” - Randi Weingarten, president, American Federation of Teachers

Greg Cruey, a teacher and union rep who went on strike, said the West Virginia walkout should serve as a warning to conservatives eager to further weaken public sector unions. The Supreme Court may soon make the entire public sector a right-to-work zone, in a case intended to drive down membership in unions. If that happens, Cruey argued, the country can expect to see more militant actions like those in Charleston.

“Every municipality will have this situation where they say, ‘Let’s strike for what we want,’” Cruey said. “It’s kind of a counterproductive process, where the right suppresses unions to a point where they get bigger instead of smaller. I don’t think you can push it past a certain point.”

The show of force from school personnel in West Virginia was unprecedented, driven by years of state belt-tightening. Teachers went on strike in West Virginia in 1990, but there were two key differences in that work stoppage: It did not include school personnel like cafeteria workers, and it only spread to 47 of the state’s 55 counties. The recent strike included all school workers in every county, under the banner #55strong.

Such solidarity gave the workers an especially strong bargaining position. Early in the strike, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) traveled the state in what was widely seen as an effort to convince certain counties to reopen their schools, as a partial reopening would weaken the teachers’ hand. If that was Justice’s aim, it was unsuccessful. The workers who flooded the Capitol daily from all corners of the state continued to chant “Fifty-five strong” and “Fifty-five united,” knowing not a single link in the chain had been broken.

Workers from each county coordinated to make sure they had bodies at the state Capitol each day representing their respective districts. The crowds appeared to be growing, rather than shrinking, as the strike carried on. With a line snaking along Capitol grounds on Monday, the state said the volume of protesters had “prompted a capacity concern” from the Capitol police and fire marshal. The sound inside the Capitol was deafening at times.

The strike drew its strength from that kind of grassroots planning. Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers, emphasized to HuffPost that the strike was anything but spontaneous. “There was two months of organizing here, including a daylong meeting of every single rep from all three unions from each of the 55 counties, where they came to the meeting with votes from all the counties to walk out,” Weingarten said.

A secret Facebook group for West Virginia public employees grew to include 24,000 members by mid-February, as Cathy Kunkel detailed in Jacobin. There were scattered one-day walkouts in 10 counties before the state unions scheduled what was initially going to be a two-day walkout across the state. Without a satisfactory deal, workers in all counties vowed to continue it beyond two days.

The bottom-up nature of the strike became even clearer once Justice and union leaders announced a tentative deal to end it last Tuesday. The governor said all school workers would receive a 5 percent raise and other public employees would get a 3 percent raise to reopen schools last Thursday after a “cooling off” day. But the workers didn’t like the lack of clarity on health insurance premiums, and they didn’t trust state Republicans to follow through on the raises that Justice promised.

In a stunning turn, workers broadly agreed to continue what would then become an extremely rare “wildcat” strike, carried out without a green light from their union. Not every teacher agreed that was the right course of action. But in another show of solidarity, all educators stuck together and all schools remained closed. As one teacher put it, “My school was willing to go back today, but we stand by our brothers and sisters and aren’t wavering in our support.”

It was clear then that rank-and-file members were steering their unions, not the other way around. Their lack of faith in the legislature to follow through on Justice’s deal proved prescient: Over the weekend, the state Senate added an amendment to the pay bill lowering teachers’ raises to 4 percent rather than 5 percent. The unions responded by saying all schools would be closed again.

“This was a village with a capital V.” - Jenny Santilli, high school Spanish teacher

All along, the teachers and other workers managed to build and use public support to their advantage. By and large, residents were sympathetic to the workers and their aims, more likely to offer a supportive honk than a middle finger when driving by picket sites. Jenny Santilli, a high school Spanish teacher, said the workers could not have pulled off the strike without the backing of their school superintendents, many of whom, despite being the bosses, shared the same goals as the teachers. “This was a village with a capital V,” Santilli told HuffPost.

That broad community backing bolstered the teachers’ argument that the strike was about more than just salaries or insurance premiums ― it was about filling a 700-position statewide teacher shortage, keeping qualified educators in West Virginia, and investing in the state’s children. It was that argument, more than anything, that convinced legislators to approve the 5 percent raise for all workers to get schools open again.

Santilli is proud that what her colleagues did has inspired teachers in Oklahoma with their own walkout planning. Indeed, governors and legislators in any state that’s spent money on tax cuts while telling public servants there’s nothing to give them should be concerned by the uprising they saw in West Virginia.Fans of the “Orange Is the New Black” actress hope so. A Change.org petition calling on Mattel to make its first trans woman Barbie has already fetched 100 signatures and counting — not to mention the support of Cox herself.

The trans star tweeted her approval of the online campaign, which comes after Mattel’s announcement that it’s releasing 17 new Barbies for its “Sheroes” line in honor of International Women’s Day. In addition to Kim, the new dolls are modeled after inspiring real-life women, from iconic artist Frida Kahlo to “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins.

Ah that's sweet. I would love to be a Barbie doll https://t.co/nAXX4w4gPL — Laverne Cox (@Lavernecox) March 7, 2018

“Laverne Cox is the definition of the ‘inspiring woman,’” the petition, started by a fan named Jason Preston, states. “To many young women and men around the world Laverne Cox is a symbol of what you can achieve if you are true to who you are. She epitomizes not only the messages of the Inspiring Women and Sheroes Barbie doll lines but that of Barbie herself. [She] brings its message of being who and what you want to be into our ever-changing world, from inspiring the limitless potential in every girl to inspiring the limitless potential in every person.”

It wouldn’t be the first major milestone for Cox. In January she became the first openly trans person to grace the cover of Cosmopolitan. She’s also the first openly trans actor to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy.

According to a lawsuit Clifford filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News, Trump didn’t sign a nondisclosure agreement with the former adult film star, which blocked her from disclosing their 2006 relationship. According to the suit, Clifford and Trump’s lawyer signed the document, but Trump did not, allegedly making the agreement “null and void.”

According to Tuesday’s suit, Clifford and Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen both signed what it calls a “hush agreement” and a side letter agreement on Oct. 28, 2016, just 11 days before the presidential election. The documents are appended to the lawsuit.

The 2016 “hush agreement” detailed that $130,000 would be paid to Clifford’s then-attorney in exchange for Clifford not disclosing any confidential information about Trump or his sexual partners. The suit claims Clifford and Trump’s intimate relationship started in the summer of 2006 and went “well into the year 2007.”

“This relationship included, among other things, at least one ‘meeting’ with Mr. Trump in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel located within Los Angeles County,” the suit claims.

Clifford’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, released a copy of the complaint for declaratory relief on Twitter on Tuesday.

Earlier today, we filed this complaint seeking a ct order voiding the alleged “hush” agreement between our client S. Clifford aka Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump. https://t.co/upa9u10MqR — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 7, 2018

In January, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clifford had an affair with Trump in 2006, the year after he married Melania Knauss on Jan. 22, 2005, and a few months after their son, Barron, was born on March 20.

The suit claims that Trump “aggressively sought to silence Ms. Clifford as part of an effort to avoid her telling the truth” through the intervention of Cohen. The report said Clifford was paid $130,000 to sign a nondisclosure agreement and not discuss the relationship.

At the time of the Journal’s report, Clifford’s lawyer released a statement from the actress denying the affair. But Tuesday’s lawsuit said Clifford was forced into signing that denial by Cohen through “intimidation and coercive tactics.”

Clifford also claims that Cohen had tried to block her from talking about the affair as recently as Feb. 27.

“Put simply, considerable steps have been taken by Mr. Cohen in the last week to silence Ms. Clifford,” the claim reads. “The extent of Mr. Trump’s involvement in these efforts is presently unknown, but it strains credibility to conclude that Mr. Cohen is acting on his own accord.”

After Cohen told The New York Times last month that he had in fact paid Clifford $130,000 in 2016, Clifford said she was free “to tell her story” because Cohen’s discussion of the agreement invalidated it. Cohen at the time did not say what the payment was for and said that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign reimbursed him for the payment.

The White House has denied the affair.

Attorney Avenatti told HuffPost late Tuesday: “We confirm all facts as alleged in the complaint.”Donald Trump's re-election effort is headquartered in Trump Tower, much to the benefit of the president's purse. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign last year spent over a half-million dollars for Trump Tower offices ― a choice that put donors’ money into the president’s pocket, but provided workspace for at most a handful of staff.

According to a HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission filings, the monthly rent was more than what candidate Trump had been charging from June 2015 to March 2016, back when he was largely self-funding his campaign and when there were, on average, several dozen employees in the midtown Manhattan office.

And while it is unclear why Trump’s re-election campaign has rented so much room for so few people, its decision to do so has helped fill office space that appears to have become much more difficult to rent out since Trump won the presidency.

Neither the campaign nor the Trump Organization would say how many square feet the campaign is currently leasing or what it is paying per square foot. On the commercial market, however, the building has been forced to drop its prices dramatically.

Trump Tower had been charging $120 per square foot per year in 2016 – about 50 percent more than the going rate in midtown Manhattan. Today, the asking price is down to $80 a square foot, according to a New York City real estate broker, and there is plenty of space available, including the entire 14th floor where Trump had his campaign headquarters for the 2016 general election.

“He is really unpopular,” said the broker, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.

“There’s nobody there. It’s like two guys. There is no campaign. There is no operation. It’s just a joke.” - A Republican consultant

One Republican consultant close to the White House who is familiar with the office and its workload laughed when asked about the expense.

“There’s nobody there. It’s like two guys,” the consultant said on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering the leader of his party. “There is no campaign. There is no operation. It’s just a joke.”

According to those FEC filings, Trump’s campaign sent paychecks to a total of 21 people over the course of last year. Ten left at the end of January 2017. Two more received their last paycheck in mid-March. Only six collected a paycheck at the end of December, and one of those now has an auto-response email stating that she left the campaign this January.

No one on the campaign staff at year’s end responded to HuffPost emails. The campaign’s phone number provided an email address for media inquiries, but emails sent there were returned as undeliverable. A security guard in the Trump Tower lobby turned away a HuffPost reporter who tried to visit the campaign office on Tuesday. Eventually, a public relations business owner in Northern Virginia replied to a query that had been sent to newly named campaign manager Brad Parscale’s social media and data analytics firm in San Antonio, Texas.

“Brad is not currently available for interviews,” wrote Mark Serrano of ProActive Communications. “He is working with the campaign leadership team to develop plans to engage in the 2018 midterm elections, providing support and endorsements for candidates, and engaging Trump supporters in districts and states throughout the country to support and vote for GOP candidates.”

‘It’s What You Signed Up For’

Trump opened his re-election campaign account on the day of his inauguration last year, which enabled him to continue using donor money to rent space in his own building. No other presidential victor has kept his campaign alive in this fashion. Barack Obama did not start his re-election campaign until April 2011. George W. Bush did not start his until May of 2003.

Stuart Stevens, a GOP consultant who worked on the campaign of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, said donors should not be shocked that Trump is spending their money this way. “This is the least surprising president in history. He’s exactly the same person he was in the campaign,” Stevens said. “It’s what you signed up for.”

Trump made a practice of spending donor money at properties that he owned from the time he locked up the GOP nomination in the spring of 2016. The rent on the Trump Tower offices nearly quintupled, from $35,458 to $169,758 a month by July 2016, even though the number of campaign staff remained about the same. Trump also spent hundreds of thousands of donated dollars at his hotels and golf clubs, where he hosted fundraisers for himself and the party.

That habit continued into the first year of his presidency. With control of the Republican National Committee’s purse strings, Trump started to personally profit from contributions to that group as well.

In 2017, the RNC spent $232,042 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, $3,000 at Trump’s golf club in Miami and $1,228 at Trump Café in Trump Tower. The RNC also took over the monthly $37,542 rent payment for the re-election campaign’s space at Trump Tower in mid-autumn, spending a total of $150,169 by the end of the year. In the same period, it began paying the salary for campaign staffer John Pence, nephew to Vice President Mike Pence, which amounted to $28,412 by year’s end.

The RNC did not respond to questions about why it took over the latter expenses. The move did coincide with the party’s decision to no longer pay the president’s legal expenses incurred as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia (the timing was first noted by CNBC).

Trump Likes To Pay Trump

Trump’s campaign has been even more generous at his properties in 2017 than the RNC. It spent $473,371 for rent at Trump Tower before that cost was shifted to the party, although about $150,000 of that was likely for the month immediately after his election, when the campaign was occupying more space in the building. The campaign also spent $58,686 at Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, and $14,860 at his hotel in Las Vegas. In all, the Trump campaign spent $774,163 in donor money at Trump-branded businesses last year.

What exactly the campaign has done to work toward Trump’s re-election is less clear. It staged several rallies in states that the president had won in 2016, including one in Melbourne, Florida, not even a month after he took office. It continued to pay Parscale’s firm an average of $474,000 a month.

The GOP consultant who believes there are only a few campaign staffers working at the Trump Tower headquarters said that Parscale was named to his new job last week only because the president hoped to draw attention away from the news that son-in-law Jared Kushner had lost his top-secret security clearance.

“They knew the bad stuff was coming. It was a media spin play,” the consultant said, adding that Parscale would certainly be replaced by someone else following the midterm elections this fall. “He’s a great guy. But he doesn’t know anything about politics. He knows about digital marketing.”
