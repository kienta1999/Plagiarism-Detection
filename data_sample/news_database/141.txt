Years-old sexual abuse allegations against a former Mormon missionary leader were published on a whistleblowing website this week, prompting a public pledge from the Utah-based church that it would discipline the alleged perpetrator if the claims were found to be true.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Tuesday that it is looking into “deeply disturbing” allegations against Joseph Bishop, who served as president of a Mormon missionary training center in Provo, Utah, in the 1980s.

A 55-year-old woman has accused Bishop of sexually assaulting her in 1984 while she was training to be a missionary. The woman claims Bishop raped her at the center, according to a Brigham Young University police report obtained by HuffPost. The woman’s name has not been disclosed in the press or in the police report.

Bishop was the president at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo from 1983 to 1986. An MTC is where the LDS church trains thousands of young men and women before they are sent out as missionaries to countries across the world.

“If the allegations of sexual assault are true, it would be a tragic betrayal of our standards and would result in action by the Church to formally discipline any member who was guilty of such behavior, especially someone in a position of trust,” the church said in its statement.

The church’s statement came days after a taped conversation between Bishop and the woman was posted to MormonLeaks, a website started by ex-Mormons seeking to increase transparency within the LDS church.

Last December, the woman posed as a reporter and secretly recorded an interview she had with Bishop in Arizona. During the wide-ranging conversation, she asked Bishop questions about the alleged assault and about other women he may have harassed. The Mormon leader, who is now 85 years old, can be heard saying he doesn’t remember assaulting the woman and muses that maybe it’s “because my mind doesn’t want me to remember that.”

At one point in the interview, the woman asked if Bishop molested another Mormon woman at the MTC. He admits that he gave one woman a back rub that got too “frisky.”

He apologizes repeatedly in the recording and says that for years he has struggled with a “sexual addiction.”

“I am very, very sorry and I am so sorry. I don’t know if I can even be forgiven on your side,” Bishop tells the woman in the recording.

The woman also contacted Brigham Young University police in November to report her alleged assault. According to that police report, Bishop denied the rape allegations but told detectives that he’d gone with the woman to a small “preparation room” and while talking with her “asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.”

BYU police relayed the facts of the case to the Utah County attorney’s office. Deputy attorney David Sturgill replied that he could not pursue criminal charges against Bishop because the statute of limitations had expired four years after the alleged assault.

“I have no reason to doubt the victim’s disclosure, and would have likely prosecuted Mr. Bishop, but for the expiration of the statute of limitations,” Sturgill informed BYU police, according to the police report.

BYU police closed their investigation into the assault on Dec. 23.

The woman told the LDS church-owned Deseret News that she first reported the assault to church officials around 1988. The church’s official statement on Tuesday claimed officials became aware of the alleged assault in 2010, when the woman informed leaders of a Mormon congregation in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where she was living.

The LDS church claims the leaders “listened carefully to the claims being made” and then relayed them to the Pleasant Grove Police Department. The church claims it received no further communication from the police about the matter. Church leaders also contacted Bishop, who denied the allegations. Unable to verify the woman’s claims, the church said it decided not to discipline Bishop at the time.

According to The Salt Lake Tribune, the woman made a threat about killing Bishop in 2010. Pleasant Grove police interviewed the woman and decided not to make an arrest.

In January, the woman’s lawyer forwarded the recorded conversation to the LDS church. The church claims both the woman and Bishop were then interviewed about the allegations. Both parties reaffirmed their positions and appeared to have “dramatically” different recollections of what happened in 1984.

The son added that when his father admitted to having a “sexual addiction,” he was referring to a lifelong battle with “controlling” his “sexual thoughts.”

“Those people who know dad don’t put much credence in these allegations,” Greg Bishop told the AP.

The church cautioned in its statement that it does not have the “investigative tools” available to law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough review of the matter, but pledged to keep Bishop accountable for any misconduct.The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an enormous area of floating garbage halfway between California and Hawaii, is already recognized as the largest accumulation zone of ocean plastic on Earth. Now, it turns out that researchers may have been vastly underestimating its scale.

The results of a three year mapping effort by international scientists, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, reveals that the amount of plastic this garbage patch contains is up to 16 times greater than initially thought.

According to the study, the patch takes up 1.6 million square kilometers (618,000 square miles), an area about three times the size of France. It contains 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic weighing in at 80,000 metric tons – equivalent to 500 jumbo jets.

Previous attempts to measure the Great Pacific Garbage Patch have mostly been done by single boats with trawls.

“We wanted to paint the entire picture,” said Joost Dubois, communications director of The Ocean Cleanup, the Dutch foundation which led the study. Their analysis was undertaken by a fleet of 30 boats crossing the patch and two planes fitted with sensors to measure larger items the vessels were unable to capture.

Around 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year – the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck’s worth into the seas every minute for a year. Once in the ocean, much of this waste is pulled into huge areas known as the five “gyres” – one of which is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – where circular currents allow the trash to accumulate, circulate and slowly break down.

As well as containing larger items, the garbage patch is also made up of microplastics (pieces of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters in size) that comprise around 8 percent of its total mass. Microplastics have increasingly come under the spotlight as these tiny fragments are thought to damage sea life. They are also entering the human food chain through fish and water ― impacting both tap water and bottled water. While the health implications aren’t fully understood, studies suggest that consuming microplastics could introduce toxic chemicals into the body.

Laurent Lebreton, lead author of the new study, said that while it wasn’t possible to draw firm conclusions on the persistency of the plastic problem in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the plastic accumulation rate “indicates that the inflow of plastic into the patch continues to exceed the outflow.”

George Leonard, chief scientist at Ocean Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit in Washington D.C. which wasn’t involved in the study, said that he was impressed with the extensive sampling and use of new techniques to try to quantify the problem.

“The one thing that really jumps out at me here is the fact that fishing gear makes up about half of the macro debris in the Pacific gyre,” he said. While microplastics pollution has been known for a while, bigger material in the ocean has been difficult to quantify, he said.

The debate about the global use of plastics is currently “largely focused on aspects of consumer plastic ― plastic bags and plastic straws and that kind of stuff,” Leonard added. “It’s pretty clear that if we really want to tackle this problem writ large, a focused effort on fishing gear and the loss of fishing gear in the global ocean has got to be a critical part of that strategy.”

The Ocean Cleanup has a bold plan to tackle plastic waste. “People expect [the garbage patch] to be like an island, or islands, of trash floating in this big area,” said Dubois. “The plastic is still spread out quite a lot over this big area so there is a lot of material but it’s also a very large surface.”

In an attempt to make collection economically feasible, The Ocean Cleanup is trying out a new technology involving autonomous booms like giant horseshoes, which float around the oceans powered by wind and currents.

“They basically follow the same pattern as the plastic does,” said Dubois, “but at a different speed, and because of the shape of the booms the plastic is being concentrated.” The plastic accumulates to a level “that it becomes economic to sail out, pick it up, bring it back to shore for recycling,” he added.

The first trial for the booms will happen in the next few weeks near San Francisco, before a planned trial in deeper water in May. The Ocean Cleanup hopes the system will be towed out to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the summer.

The organization estimates it can remove half of the area’s trash in five years, but admits microplastics will be too small for the new method to catch. “Although we won’t be able to collect the really bad stuff, we will collect an enormous amount of the stuff that will turn into bad stuff over time,” said Dubois.

The new study came out the day after another report predicted the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple by 2025.

That report, produced for the U.K. government, stressed that there are opportunities to be gained from the “ocean economy” if the seas are managed properly.

“The ocean is critical to our economic future,” Prof. Edward Hill, from the U.K. National Oceanography Center, told the BBC. “Nine billion people will be looking to the ocean for more food. Yet we know so little of what’s down there.”

AdvertisementDrew Barrymore verbally knocked out someone who thought she was knocked up.

The actress and mother of two explained to James Corden Wednesday night that while she’s filming her Netflix series “Santa Clarita Diet,” she eats a vegan diet and works out almost every day. But when she’s on hiatus, she’s “pigging out [like you have] a feedbag strapped to your face.”

So naturally, she puts on weight, which doesn’t go unnoticed by her mother, daughter and even a random stranger who stopped Barrymore as she was leaving a restaurant with her friends and all their kids.

“She’s like, ‘God, you have so many kids,’ and I go, ‘Well not all of them are mine, I just have two,’” Barrymore explained to Corden. “And she’s like, ’Well, and you’re expecting, obviously.’ And I just looked at her and go, ‘No, I’m just fat right now.’”

Barrymore admitted that the situation was pretty “rough,” but decided to eventually make light of it.

“I was, like, ‘I’ll just tell this story and make fun of myself,’ but she’s a bitch.”

The 43-year-old was also pretty blunt during another segment in the show in which Corden asked her to name her least talented co-star or eat a turkey testicle.“But also ask yourself, when it comes to this story ― when it comes to Russian behavior and U.S.-Russian relations, and Russian cyberattacks against the American people and the inability of the millions of the Russian people to have free and fair elections, or the attempted murder of a Putin critic on British soil ― is the leaking really the most offensive thing going on here?”The only woman candidate for Maryland governor shows herself breastfeeding her child in a new campaign ad.

Krish Vignarajah, one of eight Democrats vying to challenge GOP incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan in this year’s elections, uses the 30-second ad to highlight Maryland’s lack of women in statewide or federal offices. A woman in an elected position isn’t just about representation, she says in the ad.

“It’s about policy. States with women in government have better schools, better health care, lower incarceration rates. I want all of that for Maryland,“ Vignarajah tells viewers.

Vignarajah is at least the second gubernatorial candidate in this year’s elections to feature breastfeeding in campaign advertising ― a strong statement that women can be mothers and have prominent public-service careers. Kelda Roys, a Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor, began running ads this month that show her breastfeeding.

Vignarajah’s ad goes on to talk of her parents who immigrated to America with $200, and how she became policy director for former first lady Michelle Obama.

“Some say no man can beat Larry Hogan,” Vignarajah says in the ad. “Well, I’m no man. I’m a mom. I’m a woman. And I want to be your next governor.”

Hogan is only the second Republican to be Maryland’s governor in nearly 50 years, and his approval ratings have been high.

Roys’ ad in Wisconsin strikes a note similar to Vignarajah’s.

“I am a mom, and that’s a big reason why I am motivated to run for governor. I cannot have my children growing up in a world where we don’t value public education and we are destroying natural resources,” Roys says.

“What sets me apart from the rest of the field is not that I have a baby, but I have a track record of getting things done, of accomplishing progressive policies for people of this state.”A Republican candidate for secretary of state in Kentucky suggested shooting a Democratic congressman who is calling for more gun safety legislation.

Carl Nett, who made the threat, later apologized.

The ugly incident began on Monday when Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) tweeted that he proudly wears a pin with an “F” on it to show his rating from the National Rifle Association:

I’m so proud of my @NRA rating, I’ll wear it on my chest. I invite my colleagues to join me in wearing our F ratings every day until the GOP finally stands up to the gun lobby and helps us pass common sense gun safety legislation. Find me to get a pin. #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/sOECS54QOK — Rep. John Yarmuth (@RepJohnYarmuth) March 19, 2018

Nett, a former Secret Service and CIA officer, implied on Tuesday that he could use that pin as a shooting target. Although his tweet was later deleted, you can read it here:

Shooting “center mass” is a term often used by law enforcement and others to mean shooting a target in the chest.

The FBI said it was looking into Nett’s threat.

“FBI Louisville is aware of the tweet and is working with our law enforcement partners to determine the best course of action,” spokesman David Habich told the Louisville Courier-Journal. “The FBI takes seriously all threats of violence.”

Both the local and state Republican organizations took Nett to task:

Our politics have grown too divisive over the last 10 years. In regard to the Tweet by Secretary of State candidate Carl Nett this AM, we condemn that tweet, in the strongest of terms, as well as any suggestion of violence against anyone, much less a member of Congress.

Nett (@realCarlNett) March 20, 2018WASHINGTON ― During the Barack Obama years, Republicans in Congress grew accustomed to kicking around one particular organization that advocated for the poor ― a group they claimed had been involved in a nefarious conspiracy to steal the 2008 election.

After nearly a decade, lawmakers are still at it, even though Obama is gone and the organization no longer exists.

On Thursday, Congress approved a 2,000-plus-page government spending bill. One small item in the legislation bans federal funds from being spent to support a group called the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN.

Republicans loathed the group. They accused it ― baselessly ― of engineering a campaign of mass voter fraud and thus rigging the 2008 election in favor of then-candidate Barack Obama. Republicans hated ACORN so much that they effectively killed it all the way back in 2009 by blocking federal funding to the organization, which helped poor people register to vote and advocated for social services like affordable housing. Many Democrats also voted in favor of the original ban.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the committee that drafted the spending bill, was unaware of the provision. He said it might be leftover language from previous bills that staffers had inserted.

“I don’t remember this ever being discussed one time,” Cole told HuffPost. “It wasn’t discussed at a hearing. I don’t remember it being discussed at any meeting with my Democratic colleagues and counterparts who negotiated the bill.”

A Republican aide said leftover provisions like this one are often carried forward automatically until lawmakers decide to remove them. Congress has repeatedly approved similar provisions that specifically target the group in the years since ACORN disbanded.

The section says: “None of the funds made available under this or any other Act, or any prior Appropriations Act, may be provided to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, allied organizations, or successors.”

ACORN, of course, has no affiliates, subsidiaries, or allies because it does not exist. “Successors” is not a legally defined term in corporate or nonprofit law.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), another member of the House Appropriations Committee, which drafted the so-called omnibus bill, pointed out that ACORN does not currently exist. “They did it in!” she said.

“Banning funding for ACORN? That was like eight fake conspiracy theories ago,” one former Hill staffer told HuffPost.

The bipartisan attack on ACORN’s funding in 2009 came after right-wing con man James O’Keefe aired a selectively edited video featuring the group on Fox News. The video appeared to show ACORN employees helping O’Keefe deal with paperwork problems associated with running an underage prostitution ring. Multiple government investigations ultimately cleared ACORN, and O’Keefe eventually agreed to pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit from one of the people he filmed. Under the settlement, O’Keefe formally acknowledged that he did not know that the man involved ― who had been portrayed as a willing abettor to O’Keefe’s fictional illegal operation ― had in fact called the police shortly after speaking with O’Keefe.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who led the 2009 congressional attack on ACORN from the House Oversight Committee, said it made sense to continue to ban ACORN’s funding.

“It was proven to be a criminal enterprise,” Issa told HuffPost on Thursday. “Is there any reason to continue to fund it?”

HuffPost pointed out that ACORN no longer exists, but Issa noted that the legislation also targets affiliates or successors of the organization.

“Plenty of organizations change no one in the hierarchy, none of the tactics, but change the name,” Issa said.

But he said he was unaware of any ACORN successors.WASHINGTON ― The revelation that British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica collected and maintained data on 50 million Facebook users to influence U.S. elections has prompted calls for oversight, investigation and possibly regulation of the social media giant.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made clear this week that he is open to the government regulating Facebook in some way. “The question isn’t, ‘Should there be regulation or shouldn’t there be?’ It’s ‘How do you do it?’” Zuckerberg told Wired.com.

Members of Congress signaled Thursday that they might be up to the challenge. The chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission, which could impose stricter regulations on Facebook, called for Zuckerberg to testify on Capitol Hill.

“That will be the first step in gathering the facts,” Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told HuffPost.

But it’s not clear if Zuckerberg will accept the invitation, and Walden and other lawmakers said they’re not sure what sort of regulations they would ultimately consider.

“The controversy with Mark Zuckerberg is just starting to percolate,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), a member of the commerce committee. “I don’t think there’s any strong direction that anybody favors. I think people think that something’s got to be done, but I don’t know what that is yet.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), whose district includes Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, told HuffPost, “This is the time for Congress to step in.”

On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and subcommittee chairmen Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) had sent a list of questions to Zuckerberg on Monday. So did Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a high-profile critic of government surveillance.

The letters point to the most plausible approach that lawmakers may take to imposing regulation on Facebook. Back in 2011, Facebook signed a consent decree with the FTC after the agency determined that the company had lied to users about protecting their privacy. Facebook promised to obtain the express consent of users in the future to transfer their data to outside parties and to undergo routine audits about its privacy practices.

Wyden asked Facebook to explain how the company could have allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain the data of 50 million users while still complying with that consent decree. Thune, Wicker and Moran also wanted to know, “Does Facebook believe it complied with its obligations under the 2011 order?”

The FTC has already announced an investigation into whether Facebook violated the consent decree. A violation could lead to fines or increased regulation. By looking into the Cambridge Analytica problem in hearings, lawmakers could suss out information helping the FTC to show that Facebook needs increased regulation ― even if Congress fails to pass any legislation.

Barry Lynn and Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that supports vigorous antitrust enforcement, said that the FTC needs to do more than just issue fines if Facebook did violate its consent decree.

They laid out a range of steps that the agency could take to rein in the social media giant: The FTC could move to break up Facebook by forcing it to spin off its advertising network, which is the main driver of the company’s massive collection of user data, or to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook could be prohibited from making any new acquisitions for the next five years. Regulators could demand that Facebook adopt open standards that would make it interoperable with other social media sites, as the FTC required of AOL Instant Messenger in 2001 (that’s an idea Stoller has floated before). Regulators could take Facebook to court if it violated the consent decree and seek sanctions. The FTC could even impose strict data privacy controls on Facebook ― perhaps similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which will go into effect in May.

“Facebook has too much power over America’s communications infrastructure,” Lynn, the executive director of Open Markets, said in a statement. “This is a direct threat to American democracy, and the government must act now.”

But even if the FTC steps in and regulates Facebook, that won’t solve the problem. Issues of data privacy extend across the entire digital industry. Google collects even more data than Facebook through its search, video, browser, ad blocker, mapping, phone, GPS and personal assistant products. Tackling all that would require some kind of legislation.

Khanna, the congressman who represents Silicon Valley, thinks that the new European data protection rules provide an added incentive for Congress to do its job and enact laws to protect user privacy. Although Khanna said the EU rules go too far, he noted that since companies are now preparing for those changes, they could get ready for a new privacy regime in the U.S., too.

“Why doesn’t Congress act and maybe we can have a more reasonable framework than the European framework?” he asked.

What Khanna said he’d like Congress to consider is an internet users’ bill of rights that sets out a framework for digital privacy. He floated two ideas to HuffPost: requiring companies to obtain affirmative consent from people to collect and use their data and mandating that companies disclose any breach of user data.

“It’s Congress’ job to put a regulatory framework in place,” Khanna said. He added that he still believes social media and digital platforms are “a force for good,” even if they have “been subject to gross abuse.”

As for breaking up Facebook or other tech companies, Khanna, a co-founder of the Congressional Antitrust Caucus, said that the FTC needs to take a closer look at tech industry mergers and that Facebook’s purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp should have been examined with much greater scrutiny. “We need to increase enforcement” of antitrust law, he said.

Others have suggested that Facebook should be treated like a water or electric utility. Steve Bannon, the former adviser to President Donald Trump, reportedly endorsed the idea on the grounds that Facebook is essentially a necessity in modern life.Queen Latifah is mourning the loss of the “love of her life” after her mother, Rita Owens, died on Wednesday.

“It is with a heavy heart that I share the news my mother, Rita Owens passed away today,” Latifah said in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE magazine on Wednesday. “Anyone that has ever met her knows what a bright light she was on this earth. She was gentle, but strong, sweet, but sassy, worldly but pragmatic, a woman of great faith and certainly the love of my life.”

“She had struggled with a heart condition for many years and her battle is now over. I am heartbroken but know she is at peace,” she said. “Thank you for your kindness, support and respect for our privacy at this time.”

Latifah signed off on the statement, writing, “Much Love, Dana Owens (aka Queen Latif‎ah), forever Rita Owens’ daughter.”

Latifah opened up about her mother’s struggle with heart failure, which is a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body, in a blog for HuffPost two years ago.

“It affects nearly 6 million in the U.S., including my mom,” the entertainer wrote. “It’s estimated that 1 in 5 people over the age of 40 will develop heart failure in their lifetime.”

She recalled the day that her mother was diagnosed with heart failure in her 40s and spoke about what it was like to be her mom’s caregiver and “advocate-in-chief.”

“Caring for the woman who not only raised me, but made me who I am, is not the type of thing that I take lightly,” Latifah said. “It also comes with its own unique set of challenges. But I realized that as with most things in life, it’s all about attitude and gratitude.”

Throughout the time she spent taking care of her mother, Latifah said the two learned as much as they could about heart failure to manage her mom’s symptoms and teach others about the condition. Her mom’s health battle taught Latifah a lot about her outlook on life.

“As my mom says, ‘You can’t change the past but you can change your future. You get only one shot at this body, so take care of it,’” Latifah wrote. “I know I’m going to do just that, and I hope you will too.”

AdvertisementA crowd of protesters ― backed by a killer mariachi band ― hooted, chanted, and serenaded Manhattan attorney Aaron Schlossberg outside his home on Friday in response to his hate-filled rant against Spanish speakers earlier in the week.

The “fiesta” protest featured a mix of music, tacos, some outrage and mostly high spirits. A Mexican flag flew from the top of Schlossberg’s Upper West Side apartment building.

“We will speak Spanish,” said Carlos Jesus Calzadilla, president of Young Progressives of America. “The reality is we contribute a lot and we are part of this American experience, and we will not allow racists to silence us.”

Schlossberg did not make an appearance.

The lawyer was caught on video in a Manhattan restaurant on Tuesday yelling about restaurant staff speaking Spanish with customers. “They have the balls to come here and live off of my money I pay for their welfare,” he complained. “The least they could do is speak English.” He threatened to call the authorities, claiming he was convinced the restaurant workers were in the country illegally.

The mariachi band was originally scheduled to play outside Schlossberg’s law office, but his landlord evicted him from the space after his diatribe went viral, so the protest moved to his home.

Two local politicians have filed a misconduct complaint against Schlossberg, and his legal business has been trashed on Yelp.

An opinion piece in The Washington Post suggested on Friday that perhaps it’s time to back off just a bit from “internet vigilantism” ― even for a “viral racist lawyer.”YouTube is expanding restrictions on videos featuring firearms and accessories in the aftermath of the mass shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. Carlos Garcia Rawlins / Reuters

YouTube is tightening restrictions on videos featuring firearms and accessories, entering the intensifying gun control debate.

The move, announced this week, has already been condemned by some firearm enthusiasts as overreaching censorship. Others applauded the company ― the world’s largest video platform ― for taking a stand in the wake of last month’s Parkland, Florida, high school massacre.

YouTube, a division of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, outlined the new guidelines on its website Monday without fanfare. Bloomberg was first to report the shift on Wednesday.

Under the new rules, to be enforced starting in April, YouTube will prohibit videos that link to sites selling firearms or gun accessories. Instructional videos containing information about how to build guns also will be restricted.

A YouTube spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal the company several years ago banned videos explicitly promoting the sale of firearms, but recently decided to expand the restrictions.

“We routinely make updates and adjustments to our enforcement guidelines across all of our policies,” the spokeswoman said.

YouTube in October began removing videos showing how to modify firearms with bump stocks following the massacre in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and hundreds injured. The shooter used the gun attachment on his rifles, allowing him to fire much more quickly.

A cursory search on Thursday revealed tens of millions of videos on YouTube teaching viewers how to make guns (both real and toy varieties) and firearm accessories like silencers.

The expanded restrictions are provoking an outcry from gun advocates, according to conservative media outlets. Some accused the site of “Big Brother” censorship, while others criticized the guidelines as vague.

“Their policies are not very clear-cut and they are arbitrary,” Karl Kasada, co-owner of InRange TV, a YouTube channel featuring firearm videos, told the Journal. “You never know when you are going to get hit by them.”

InRange TV said on Facebook this week that the channel will be moving its content to the porn website PornHub following YouTube’s change.

“PornHub has a history of being a proactive voice in the online community, as well as operating a resilient and robust video streaming platform,” InRange TV’s post said.Model Gisele Bündchen put the power in power couple by holding up her 225-pound husband, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, with her hands and feet.

U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement denied a humanitarian appeal to keep David Chavez-Macias in the United States, deporting him back to Mexico despite the fact that he suffers from a rare genetic disorder.

After years of what his attorney Dee Sull said was misguided legal advice, Chavez-Macias was pulled over in 2013 for a routine traffic violation, which led to a deportation order. He was granted a stay on his deportation last August but was told in February that he had one month to prepare to leave the country. ICE officials placed an ankle bracelet on him, and he showed up at the ICE office in Reno, Nevada, last Friday to turn himself in. He was on a plane later that day, Sull said.

His wife, who is currently petitioning for U.S. citizenship, and four children, all of whom are beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, will remain in the U.S.

Sull, who began representing Chavez-Macias last spring, hoped that she’d be able to appeal his deportation on humanitarian grounds, given the severity of his condition and the difficulty he may face in finding treatment near his hometown of Aguascalientes, Mexico. The closest urban medical center, she added, is three to four hours away.

Chavez-Macias suffers from Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that has caused him severe heart complications for many years. Following an examination earlier this month, his doctors recommended he undergo heart surgery, Sull said. She even had his doctors explain to ICE just how dire the situation was.

“Unfortunately, ICE did not value their opinion,” Sull said.

She believes that their determination to carry out the deportation stems from Chavez-Macias’ decision to seek sanctuary in a church last April, an attempt to evade deportation. He lived at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship until the deportation order was lifted several months later.

“I believe that penalized him,” she said. “ICE does have this jurisdiction and they chose to exercise it. But that’s not what America is about.”

ICE didn’t comment on the humanitarian situation, merely pointing out that the six-month stay he was granted had expired.

“He was ordered removed by an immigration judge in November 1996,” ICE spokeswoman Lori K. Haley said in a statement. “A request for a stay of removal was granted for six months, which concluded Feb. 12.”

But people in Chavez-Macias’ community are concerned for his life.

“Despite my repeated efforts to prevent this tragedy, the Department of Homeland Security refused to keep David with his family where he can receive the medical support he needs,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) wrote in a Facebook post Monday.

“Did our government just put a timeline on his life?” - local activist Alejandra Hernandez-Chavez

“Did our government just put a timeline on his life?” asked local activist Alejandra Hernandez-Chavez at a protest at ICE’s Reno office last Friday against Chavez-Macias’ deportation.

His prospects of being able to return to the U.S. aren’t favorable, Sull said. Because none of his family members are U.S. citizens, he isn’t able to petition for citizenship. His two brothers are lawful permanent residents who are currently petitioning for citizenship, but even if it’s granted to them, the process for Chavez-Macias to then petition for citizenship could take as much as 20 years.Stephen Colbert said CNN’s coverage of the scandal involving porn star Stormy Daniels and President Donald Trump is getting a little steamy.

“The Stormy Daniels story just won’t go away, no matter how many photos of her bustline Anderson Cooper slowly zooms in on every night,” Colbert said of Cooper’s show, “Anderson Cooper 360.”

“They’ve actually renamed his show ‘Anderson Cooper 36DD,’” the “Late Show” host cracked.

Colbert wasn’t done yet.

On Thursday, the controversial White House aide spoke about drugs at Generation Next, a White House-sponsored forum for millennials, and offered a bizarre suggestion for people at risk of abusing opioids.

“On our college campuses, you folks are reading the labels,” she said. “They won’t put any sugar in their body, they won’t eat carbs anymore, and they’re very, very fastidious about what goes into their body. And then you buy a street drug for five or 10 dollars, it’s laced with fentanyl and that’s it.”

Her advice: “Eat the ice cream, have the French fry, don’t buy the street drug. Believe me, it all works out.”

As head of Trump’s opioid task force, Conway has edged out drug policy officials and turned to political staff instead, Politico reported in February. Her comments come shortly after the president laid out a three-pronged plan to deal with the current drug crisis: build a wall, launch a “just say no”-style campaign, and allow capital punishment for drug dealers.

Conway’s simplistic advice struck a nerve with Twitter users.

Some long-declining small towns and farming and manufacturing counties are adding people as population growth in large cities cools, according to a Stateline analysis of census estimates released Thursday.

“This seems to be the beginning of a return to population dispersal after a decade or so of clustering into cities and the biggest metropolitan areas,” said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Steady improvement in the economy and recovering housing markets may be prompting employers and job seekers to look again at areas that were growing before the Great Recession — suburbs, exurbs and small towns, Frey said.

Rural areas, defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as counties outside cities and their suburbs, gained population between 2016 and 2017 for the first time since 2010. They grew by about 33,000 residents nationwide, after losing more than 15,000 residents the year before.

One of those growing areas is Jackson County, Georgia, a rural county that is convenient to Atlanta and Athens, where farm-equipment manufacturing and distribution center jobs have helped fuel a population increase of more than 2,500, almost 4 percent, after a population loss as recently as 2012. In the years since, the county’s population growth has been on a steady upward trend. The county added 428 people in 2013 and 1,603 people in 2016, leading up to this year’s larger boost.

“There’s a good bit of growth here. Things are finally starting to heat up,” said Jackson County Commissioner Tom Crow, who has a family farm where he raises catfish and evergreen trees. Foreclosures caused most of the population loss earlier in the decade, Crow said, but now those homes are occupied again, and hundreds of new homes are being built every year.

Heavily agricultural areas also have started growing in the last two years after years of declines. Those areas likely still have fewer jobs, but may be attractive to people looking for low-cost areas to retire or cut costs, said Doug Farquhar, program director for rural development at the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Population decline has hit most rural areas hard since 2010. States such as Nebraska and Kansas have tried tax incentives to attract movers. Many small towns have had to cut back services or deliver them in combination with neighboring towns as the number of taxpayers has dwindled.

John Cromartie, a USDA geographer, said he had expected the census numbers to show that rural population loss had slowed, but he was surprised at the increase. Cromartie has documented the six-year trend of population loss in rural areas.

It’s the bigger rural counties, those with a town of at least 10,000 people, which have turned the corner fastest.

Those counties as a group grew by almost 40,000 or about 0.1 percent, while smaller counties continued to lose population, though at a much lower rate than last year. The smallest counties as a group lost about 6,100 people, down from annual losses of more than 50,000 between 2012 and 2015.

At the same time, growth is beginning to moderate in the most urban counties. After leading the nation’s population growth for a decade, with annual growth of more than a million, growth in those counties dropped back to about 900,000 between 2015 and 2016 and to a little more than 700,000 for the period covered in today’s release of census data.

Some urban counties lost population between 2016 and 2017. Cook County, which includes Chicago, lost more than 20,000 residents, its largest loss since 2010. The counties that include Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Detroit and Brooklyn also shed residents between 2016 and 2017.

Cook County, where population has dropped for three straight years, is actually undergoing a boom in apartment construction, up 61 percent between 2015 and 2017, said Ed Zotti, an urban planning consultant at the Chicago Central Area Committee, a coalition of businesses and nonprofits.

“Downtown Chicago housing has been experiencing an extended boom, driven by rising downtown employment,” Zotti said. But the city’s black population is in long-term decline, he said, which is likely to offset gains in population.

Alameda County, home of Oakland, Berkeley and other communities across the bay from San Francisco, had the nation’s biggest increase last year in multifamily housing, according to census building permit data.

The booming regional economy in the Bay Area is driving more demand for housing in Oakland and other Alameda County cities, said Darin Ranelletti, Oakland’s deputy director for planning and building.Tennessee awarded a man $1 million after he spent nearly 32 years in prison for a crime that DNA evidence cleared him of.

Lawrence McKinney, 61, was imprisoned in 1978 for rape and burglary before freed in 2009. The Tennessee Board of Claims granted him the compensation on Wednesday.

Nashville Attorney David Raybin, who has represented McKinney for the last six years, described the outcome as “bittersweet” for McKinney who was only formally exonerated from the crimes within the last three months.

“I’ve been a criminal defense attorney for 40 years, this is probably one of the most moving events I’ve ever experienced,” he told HuffPost on Thursday. “To have someone in prison that long and to fight for years, for six years to get him some justice, it has just been an enormous undertaking.”

Lawrence McKinney, 61, was awarded $1 million on Wednesday for a 1978 conviction that was overturned in 2009. WTVF

The payment is divided into one $353,000 upfront payment, which is to cover attorneys fees, debts and the cost of a vehicle, followed by $3,350 monthly payments for a minimum of 10 years. If he should die before those 10 years, either his wife or his estate will be eligible to collect the following monthly payments, the Tennessean reported.

The $1 million compensation is the highest permitted by the state, as well as the highest it has ever granted due to the length of time McKinney served. That’s not to say that everyone is calling the amount sufficient.

“The board of claims at the hearing said that they thought it was an inadequate award,” Raybin said.

He pointed out that the $1 million maximum was set about 10 years ago and doesn’t consider adjustments for rising costs of living.

Still, if you ask McKinney, he might say that the closure of this chapter of his life is a blessing enough, Raybin said.

“The board of claims at the hearing said that they thought it was an inadequate award."”

After being released from prison nine years ago, he endured a yearslong legal battle for both monetary compensation and exoneration.

The parole board twice refused to formally exonerate him, even though the Shelby County Criminal Court and district attorney general found that DNA evidence failed to link McKinney to the crime he was convicted of. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) also declined to clear his name when given the chance, Raybin said.

It wasn’t until December 2017 that current Gov. Bill Haslam (R) completed the task for McKinney, an act that then made him eligible to seek compensation from the state.

“In the eyes of the judicial system, Mr. McKinney is innocent,” Haslam said in a statement at the time. “While I appreciate the hard work and recommendations of the Board of Parole, in this case, I defer to the finding of the court charged with determining Mr. McKinney’s guilt or innocence.”

Raybin shared McKinney’s gratitude to the board and the governor.

“He was obviously very moved by all of this,” Raybin said of McKinney’s reactions, saying he expected the exoneration would come sooner or later. “He has infinite patience, and he is also a very religious person and has extreme faith in God.”

As for that $1 million maximum, Raybin said some of the board members told him that they will revisit the cap next year.

“Many other states have much higher amounts,” he said.

According to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal organization that fights to exonerate those who have been found wrongly convicted through DNA evidence, 18 states do not have laws that would grant compensation to individuals incarcerated for a crime they did not commit

Those states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

The Innocence Project stresses the need for adequate compensation to those who are wrongfully convicted. Recently released individuals often find themselves without family, friends, housing, transportation, insurance and retirement money.

Reese Witherspoon’s birthday should be a national holiday, and at least her longtime friend Jennifer Garner is acting accordingly.

The “Wrinkle in Time” star turned 42 on Thursday and Garner showed her some social media love by sharing a video of herself in full marching band regalia playing “Happy Birthday” on a saxophone.

In the Instagram clip, Garner pivots toward the camera before launching into a very passionate performance of the birthday song. After it’s over, she flashes a big smile before marching off into the distance.

Garner is a proud former “band geek” and played alto saxophone (she dubbed hers “Sally the Sexy Saxophone”) in the John Adams Middle School marching band when she was a teenager.

She reunited with the instrument for Vanity Fair back in 2016 to show off some of her secret skills and busted out a rendition of “Mary Had A Little Lamb.”

Garner even tipped her hat to her musical past when she attended a Texas A&M football game in October, declaring, “Once a band geek, always a band geek.”

“John Dowd is a friend and has been a valuable member of our legal team,” Sekulow said in a statement. “We will continue our ongoing representation of the President and our cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel.”

Dowd felt Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice on how to deal with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia, sources told The New York Times and The Washington Post.

“I love the president, and I wish him well,” Dowd told NPR on Thursday.

Dowd, who took over Trump’s legal team when attorney Marc Kasowitz departed in July, had encouraged Trump to cooperate with Mueller. Instead, Trump has repeatedly attacked Mueller’s credibility on Twitter in recent weeks.

Trump was “pleased” with Dowd’s decision to step down, according to the Times and Post. He had been upset with Dowd’s media appearances over the weekend in which he called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel’s investigation. Dowd initially said he was speaking on behalf of Trump, but later backtracked and said he was only speaking for himself.

Dowd’s resignation comes just days after Trump added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. The addition of diGenova, who has accused the FBI and Justice Department of trying to frame Trump in the Russian collusion probe, marks a more aggressive legal strategy in the handling of Mueller’s investigation.

Rumors of Dowd’s imminent departure have been swirling for several months. The Times reported earlier this month that Trump hoped to add to his legal team Emmet Flood, a veteran Washington attorney who represented President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s during his impeachment hearings. Trump immediately denied the report and tweeted that he was “VERY happy” with his legal team.

A representative for the White House declined to comment, while a request for comment from Dowd was not immediately answered.How excited should you be? Amazon doesn’t have as many British crime shows as Netflix, so adding this highly stylized detective thriller should be a welcome move for fans of that genre. Malkovich elevates everything he stars in (even with a ridiculous accent this time around) and Grint looks nothing like Grint in this role, so that’s kind of fun. Although this show wallows in grimness, clever moments of humor peek through occasionally.

Any reasons to be skeptical? This show plods along at a glacial pace. During multiple scenes, I wondered if my internet had slowed down and I was watching this at half-speed. The poor direction and dialogue make this hard to get through, so you really have to love detective thrillers to find enjoyment here. Sometimes I watch shows with hourlong episodes that feel too long, but it’s hard to say what should have been cut. That’s not the case here, as the show decides to spend a laughable amount of time focusing on shots of sinks and typewriters and other uninteresting inanimate objects.Charlotte Pence, daughter of Vice President Mike Pence, says she bought the gay parody of her book about the family bunny unveiled on “Last Week Tonight” on Sunday by John Oliver.

“I have bought his book,” she told The Hill. “He’s giving proceeds of the book to charity, and we’re also giving proceeds of our book to charity, so I really think that we can all get behind it.”

Pence wrote and her mother, Karen Pence, illustrated Marlon Bundo’s A Day in the Life of the Vice President about the family rabbit and Instagram star.

In the “Last Week Tonight” version, penned by show writer Jill Twiss and illustrated by EG Keller, Marlon Bundo is gay and persecuted by a stinkbug with a strong resemblance to Mike Pence, who is notoriously hostile to LBGTQ issues.

Proceeds from the Pence family book will benefit Tracy’s Kids, an art program for children with cancer, and A21, which fights human trafficking. Sales of the “Last Week Tonight” version will fund the Trevor Project, which supports LGBTQ youth, as well as the AIDS United charity.

“I also want to support those charities,” Charlotte Pence told The Hill. “I really mean that.”

The “Last Week Tonight” book shot to #1 on the Amazon children’s books bestsellers chart and as of early Wednesday, remains in that position despite being out of stock. The Kindle version is #2 while the Pence family’s book is at #3.

Pence said there was room for both Bundo books.WASHINGTON — John Bolton, who on Monday replaced H.R. McMaster as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, is a polarizing pick, even by Trump administration standards.

Bolton is a notoriously hawkish former United Nations ambassador whose views don’t even align with the isolationist foreign policy platform on which Trump campaigned ― although it is difficult to tell what the president actually believes.

Bolton has had Trump’s ear, both as an informal adviser and as a commentator on Fox News, for a while. As a presidential candidate, Trump called Bolton “a tough cookie [who] knows what he’s talking about” (although the president apparently is not a fan of his mustache).

Here is a brief history of the new national security adviser’s career in foreign policy:

Bolton fiercely advocated for the Iraq War and promoted the false justification for it.

While serving as a top State Department official under President George W. Bush, Bolton was a chief promulgator of the administration’s justification for the Iraq War: that U.S. intelligence showed evidence of Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Famously, this claim later turned out to be false.

But Bolton continued to insist that he was right in calling for war, even years later.

“I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam [Hussein] was correct,” he told the Washington Examiner in 2015. “I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, ‘Oh, things would have been much better if you didn’t overthrow Saddam,’ miss the point that today’s Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone.”

“You can’t assume if he had stayed in power, sweetness and light would prevail in the Middle East today,” he added.

He has called for bombing Iran and North Korea.

This does not bode well for diplomatic efforts, such as Trump’s apparent plan to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In fact, Bolton said on Fox News earlier this month that he predicts the meeting will fail ― which he suggested would likely lead to military action.

And last month, Bolton made a strong case for a strike on North Korea. In an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal titled “The Legal Case For Striking North Korea First,” he argued there were no legal reasons against a pre-emptive strike by the U.S.:

The threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times. Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute. That would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.

Bolton also intensely opposes the Iranian nuclear deal.

He damaged the United States’ foreign policy reputation while serving as the ambassador to the U.N.

Bolton has a history of speaking about international organizations with derision. While at the U.N., Bolton criticized it as “a twilight zone.” His extreme views and brash manner alienated many U.S. allies.

He has aligned himself with anti-Muslim hate groups.

He joked that former President Barack Obama was a Muslim.
