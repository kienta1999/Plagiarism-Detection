New York City workers removed a Central Park statue on Tuesday commemorating Dr. J. Marion Sims, a 19th-century surgeon who made significant advances in gynecology at the expense of enslaved black women.

Sims, widely regarded as the “father of modern gynecology,” established the first hospital for women in New York City in 1855. He invented the speculum and pioneered a surgical technique for repairing a vesicovaginal fistula, a complication of obstructed childbirth.

But Sims’ advancements were developed after performing experimental surgeries on female slaves without anesthesia and, some experts say, without consent. These trials were grave ethical violations, according to many historians and social justice activists.

“While some may have thought Dr. J Marion Sims was a pioneer, we know that his work was highly unethical and deeply racist,” New York City Public Advocate Letitia James tweeted Tuesday. “A monument to recognize a serial torturer of enslaved black women has no place in our city & today action is being taken to finally remove it.”

The NYC Public Design Commission on Monday voted unanimously in favor of moving the Sims monument from Central Park to his burial site at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. The bronze statue, previously held upon a granite base in the park, will rest on a low pedestal in the cemetery, The New York Times reported.

The commission’s decision came roughly eight months after Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a review of all “symbols of hate” in the city following a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Sims’ statue was the target of a protest in August organized by Black Youth Project 100, an activist group founded in 2013. A photo of four women protesters wearing bloody hospital gowns to symbolize Sims’ disturbing experiments went viral.

“Black women continue to suffer worse health outcomes than white women,” Seshat Mack, an organizer of the protest, told HuffPost in August. “The institution of reproductive health was built on the exploitation of black women, but this very institution continues to underserve black women.”Prairie View Elementary School music teacher Nathan Etter, right, addressed members of the school board on Monday, April 16.

Parents and students at an Illinois school are rallying in support of a music teacher who says Valentine’s Day flowers from his husband sparked a monthslong controversy.

Nathan Etter, who teaches at Prairie View Grade School in Burlington, Illinois, said his first grade students reacted negatively after he received a vase of flowers from his husband, Philip Etter. The 30-year-old told The Chicago Tribune that he opted to use the interaction as a “teachable moment,” explaining to students that some families have two moms or two dads.

“When the kids asked, ‘Are those flowers from your wife?’ I said, ‘No, they’re from my husband,’” Etter recalled. “There was [a] first grade response, such as ‘Ew, gross.’ I said, ‘Oh no, friends, we’re not going to have that response, because that’s not showing respect.’”

That “teachable moment,” however, apparently backfired. Etter was summoned to the principal’s office after a parent contacted the school about his comments, according to an April 13 statement issued by the Illinois Education Association and sent to faculty and staff.

In that meeting, the statement said, he was told that the parent felt he was “using Valentine’s Day as a means to celebrate his lifestyle choices.” The principal, he said, advised him to “stick to the curriculum.”

“The way the situation was handled has brought me great personal concern,” Etter said, “and continues to cause me to question my security in my teaching position in the district.”

Philip Etter agreed. “This would have never happened if Nathan received flowers from his wife,” he told NBC.

About 100 students, parents and faculty members appeared in support of Etter at a standing-room-only school board meeting Monday where the incident was discussed, the Tribune reported. Some carried placards that read “We support Mr. Etter” and “Respect for all.”

After Monday’s meeting, Jeff Kellenberger, president of Central Community Unit School District 301, said that the district “had no further concerns and considered the matter resolved,” adding that Etter’s employment “was never in jeopardy.”But to many, he’s most famous for his long-running stint on “Wait Wait... Don’t Tell Me!” where his voice was a key prize for contestants: He would record phone messages for the winners. He recorded more than 2,000 personalized voicemails before retiring in 2014 at the age of 80, NPR reported. Listeners can hear some of Kasell’s most noteworthy and hilarious messages on NPR’s website.

The newsman, who turned into an unexpected comedy star late in his career, previously said that his favorite time at the news organization had been when he worked on the quiz show.

In honor of his retirement, NPR flipped the script and invited loyal listeners to leave voicemails for Kasell. By the time he stepped away from the mic, he boasted a 50-year career in broadcasting. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2010.

Peter Sagal, host of “Wait Wait” who worked with Kasell for nearly two decades, spoke of the radio man’s humor. “As soon as he had the chance, Carl dropped his serious newsman persona, because what he really was, and really wanted to be, was funny,” Sagal said.

“He was, and remains, the heart and soul of our show,” Sagal tweeted Tuesday afternoon.Robert De Niro took a stab at absurdist comedy on “The Tonight Show” Monday, and we still don’t know what to make of it.

The bit begins with De Niro walking the hall and telling Fallon about his Tribeca Film Festival. He then comes upon an adorable pooch. “What’s that?” the actor asks, beginning a line of goofy questions about the pup.

“I don’t trust things that lay eggs,” he says.

It gets weirder.Beyoncé’s mom says she “stands corrected” after her daughter’s history-making performance at the first weekend of the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

Tina Knowles Lawson shared a sweet story on Instagram Monday about a conversation she had with the “Lemonade” singer ahead of the show. The former House of Deréon designer admits she was worried that the overwhelmingly white Coachella audience “would be confused by” the deeply referential show. Beyoncé is the first black woman to headline the festival.

The nearly two-hour set was heavily rooted in black Southern tradition, featuring a marching band, step dancers and majorettes, as part of a loving tribute to historically black college and university culture. In one interlude, Beyoncé performed “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” is considered to be the black national anthem.

The “Formation” singer, of course, was very much aware of the message she was sending.

“I have worked very hard to get to the point where i have a true voice and At this point in my life and my career i have a responsibility to do whats best for the world and not what is most popular,” Beyoncé said, according to her mother’s Instagram caption.

Beyoncé’s hope for all those watching, according to Knowles Lawson, was that they would “research this culture and see how cool it is” and that “young people black and white would listen to LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING and see how amazing the words are for us all and bridge the gap.”

Days after her Coachella performance, Beyoncé announced plans to give $100,000 to four historically black schools ― Xavier University of Louisiana, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University and Bethune-Cookman University ― as part of her new Homecoming Scholarship Award Program, the second scholarship created by the singer.WASHINGTON ― Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may appear on the big screen in a cameo for an upcoming biopic on her early career.

Stephen Root, an actor in “On the Basis of Sex,” told The Hollywood Reporter that the high court justice recently filmed a brief appearance on a set of courthouse steps. The filming occurred in November, according to The Associated Press.

The movie, directed by Mimi Leder and written by Ginsburg’s nephew Daniel Stiepleman, stars Felicity Jones as a young Ginsburg, working on what would become a landmark gender discrimination case. It also chronicles Ginsburg’s relationship with her late husband Martin Ginsburg, played by Armie Hammer.

A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court declined to comment. A spokesman for Participant Media, a production company for the movie, said the film is unfinished and wouldn’t elaborate.

The movie, out later this year, is one of two recent big screen projects featuring the justice and cultural icon sometimes dubbed “the Notorious RBG.” An eponymous documentary about her, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, will land in theaters in May before airing on CNN.Detainees at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Ga., are suing CoreCivic, the private prison company that operates the facility, over pay. Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe via Getty Images

A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Georgia accuses the country’s largest private prison contractor of forcing detained immigrants to work for between $1 and $8 dollars per day, in violation of the federal minimum wage law.

The civil lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of three immigrants detained at CoreCivic’s Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, says that those who decline to participate in the voluntary work scheme face threats of retaliation, including criminal prosecution.

The lawsuit was jointly filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Project South and the law offices of Andrew Free and Burns Charest.

“Under these circumstances, no labor is voluntary,” the complaint says. “It is forced.”

Federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

The lawsuit marks the latest attempt to challenge the legality of obliging immigrants to work while detained for wages that fall well below the federal minimum wage. A separate lawsuit was filed against CoreCivic by immigrant detainees in California in December. The second-largest prison company in the United States, the GEO Group, is also facing multiple lawsuits over its pay of detainees: one filed in Colorado by immigrants in 2015, and the other from the state of Washington last year. The GEO Group has disputed claims that it is violating the law.

Similar lawsuits have challenged work schemes in U.S. prisons, without success. But the lawsuits challenging the low pay for immigrant detainees contend that those detained under civil infractions like immigration violations should be entitled to receive the federal minimum wage.

Obliging detainees to work for such low wages subsidizes CoreCivic, which should either pay minimum wage or look to the local labor market for employees if detainees refuse to work, the lawsuit adds.

“CoreCivic’s economic windfall, and the profitability of its immigration detention enterprise, arises from its corporate scheme, plan, and pattern of systemically withholding basic necessities from detained immigrants to ensure a readily available, captive labor force that cleans, maintains, and operates its facilities for subminimum wages under threat of solitary confinement, criminal prosecution, and other sanctions,” the complaint says. “Without this nearly free labor, CoreCivic’s windfall from immigrant detention would be substantially decreased.”

CoreCivic spokesman Jonathan Burns said that the company does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy. He added that “all work programs at our ICE detention facilities are completely voluntary and operated in full compliance with ICE standards, including federally mandated statutory reimbursement rates for Voluntary Work Program participants.”

“We have worked in close partnership with ICE for more than 30 years and will continue to provide a safe and humane environment to those entrusted to our care.”

““When I arrived at Stewart I was faced with an impossible choice — either work for a few cents an hour or live without basic things like soap, shampoo, deodorant, and food.” - Wilhen Hill Barrientos, an immigrant detained at Stewart

Detainees at CoreCivi’s remote detention center commonly work in the kitchen or carry out cleaning or custodial work, for which they earn approximately $1 per hour. Those who work double shifts can make as much as $8 in a day.

Wilhen Hill Barrientos, a Guatemalan national detained at Stewart who is seeking asylum, routinely works eight-hour shifts in the kitchen, seven days per week, according to the complaint. On days he works 12 or more hours, he makes $8, which is paid in the form of a credit to his commissary account. If he refuses to work, he faces expulsion from his two-person pod to the overcrowded open dormitories, according to the lawsuit.

Stewart’s commissary, where detainees buy food or calling cards, is also run by CoreCivic.

“When I arrived at Stewart I was faced with an impossible choice — either work for a few cents an hour or live without basic things like soap, shampoo, deodorant, and food,” Barrientos said in a statement. “If I didn’t work, I would never be able to call my family.”

Shoaib Ahmed, a Bangladeshi detainee held at Stewart from August 2016 to February 2018, also worked eight-hour shifts in the kitchen for up to seven days a week, earning him $4 per day. After refusing to go to work, guards placed him in solitary confinement for 10 days, the lawsuit says. Ahmed was later deported.

The lawsuit seeks damages for all immigrants who participated in the voluntary work scheme for the last decade.

Immigrant detainees have complained of poor conditions and treatment in general at Stewart, some of them documented in a 2017 report from the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general.

Several detainees at Stewart were punished with solitary confinement there in 2015 in response to a hunger strike over conditions that led to a protest in which property was damaged.

The Trump administration has sought to expand capacity for immigrant detention as it ramps up efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.

AdvertisementMark Zuckerberg addressed members of the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday, continuing an apology-and-explanation tour the Facebook CEO kicked off last month when he testified before the U.S. Congress.

The European and U.S. inquiries concern the same fundamental questions about the social media giant, triggered by the news that Facebook permitted Cambridge Analytica to harvest the private data of 87 million users and that Facebook failed to take action when it became clear in 2016 that foreign actors were using its platform to spread disinformation and undermine democratic processes.

Here’s Zuckerberg’s defense, in short: “Oeps! Het spijt me!” That’s Flemish for “Whoops! I am very sorry!”

In his opening statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg reiterated what’s become a common refrain, acknowledging both that his company failed to properly safeguard its users’ data and that it was caught unprepared to counteract political meddling during past elections. As he’s done before, he assured the European politicians that Facebook now takes both issues seriously, but he stopped short of promising they won’t arise again.

Zuckerberg was originally scheduled to speak privately, but agreed to have the questioning streamed online under pressure from European Parliament President Antonio Tajani.

Some of the sharpest queries came from Belgian member Guy Verhofstadt, who called out Zuckerberg for Facebook’s long history of apologizing for its mistakes and then failing to actually correct them. He noted the similarities between Facebook and the global banking system, which assured watchdogs in 2006 that it was doing a great job of self-regulation. A historic global recession soon followed, set off by banking malfeasance.

“I really think we have a big problem here and it’s not solved by saying, ‘We’re going to fix it ourselves,’” Verhofstadt said.

Then he asked Zuckerberg directly if he wants to be remembered, together with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, as having “enriched our world and societies” or if he wants to simply be “the genius that created a digital monster that is destroying our democracies and our societies.”

The meeting constituted Zuckerberg’s sole address to European politicians ahead of the May 25 implementation date for strict new data privacy rules under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Zuckerberg declined an invitation to separately address lawmakers in the U.K., where Facebook is under fire for its role in the country’s 2016 vote to leave the EU.

Unlike his testimony in the U.S., where members of Congress took turns questioning Zuckerberg and hearing his answers, the European politicians all spoke first and then Zuckerberg addressed their questions in one long statement at the end. That format proved problematic, as several members objected when he ignored the specifics and stuck to discussing their “high level” concerns.Michael Avenatti, attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, predicted that Michael Cohen will turn on President Donald Trump within six months of being indicted.

“I think Michael Cohen is going to be indicted in the next 90 days,” Avenatti said on MSNBC on Monday night. “There’s little to no question in my mind that’s going to happen.”

He added:

“I think those charges are going to be serious. They’re going to potentially carry decades in a federal penitentiary. I also predict within six months thereafter, maybe sooner, he’s going to flip on the president.”

Avenatti made a similar prediction last week, warning the president that Cohen wasn’t tough enough to handle the pressure of an investigation.

AdvertisementWASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s sudden decision not to impose tough new sanctions on Russia left many lawmakers dumbfounded this week and led some to question whether Trump had seriously undermined Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who had announced the sanctions just a day prior.

Haley made headlines during an interview on Sunday when she announced that the Trump administration would be rolling out new sanctions against Russia as punishment for its continued support of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.

“[Treasury] Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday, if he hasn’t already,” Haley said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” when asked whether Assad’s patrons will see any consequences in the wake of a horrific chemical weapons attack in Syria. “And they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons used.”

“And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message, and our hope is that they listen to it,” she added.

Less than 24 hours later, however, after the Kremlin denounced the sanctions as “international economic raiding,” Trump decided to put them on hold “because he was not yet comfortable” with executing them, according to The Washington Post. Haley’s comments, the paper further reported, had “caused consternation” in the White House on Sunday.

The cleanup continued the following day after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters the administration is considering slapping additional sanctions on Russia and that it will make a decision in “the near future.” Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic adviser, meanwhile, pinned the blame on Haley by stating that she “got ahead of the curve.”

“There might have been some momentary confusion about that,” he told reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday.

“With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” Haley later responded in a statement of her own.

“With all due respect, I don't get confused,” Nikki Haley said in a statement @DanaPerino just read on Fox News. https://t.co/5RdHwmkpQU — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 17, 2018

The Trump administration’s sharp reversal on sanctions ― as well as the unusual public contradiction between top aides ― left lawmakers of both parties scratching their heads on Tuesday.

“It’s really disheartening to, one, have passed sanctions that haven’t been implemented, and two, to have the White House say, ‘All right, we’re going to do it’ and then move away from it,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) told HuffPost. “That’s just not a good signal to Moscow or any of our adversaries or allies.”

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said he was not surprised by how the administration handled the matter. Corker was an author of a sanctions bill that Trump signed in August ― but also called “seriously flawed.”

“You know, two weeks ago we were moving out of Syria, and then the next day we weren’t, so it’s just sort of standard confusion,” he told reporters.

The Trump administration’s public rebuke of Haley, in particular, could undermine her standing around the world, said Keith Michael Harper, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council under President Barack Obama.

Trump has been reluctant to criticize or take punitive measures against Russia, despite its meddling in the 2016 presidential election, support for Assad, the annexation of Crimea and likely poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.

Trump was reportedly furious with his top aides last month after he learned the U.S. had expelled more diplomats and suspected spies ― 60 ― than European allies like France and Germany to punish Russia for its suspected role in the poison attack. “There were curse words,” one official told The Washington Post. “A lot of curse words.”

The U.S. president has offered effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and has expressed a desire to work with him to solve many of the world’s problems. He has also declined numerous opportunities to denounce Russia for election interference, leaving open the possibility that other foreign actors were responsible.

Yet Trump has also taken some recent steps to call out Russia. “To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children?” he asked in a speech announcing U.S. missile strikes against Syria last Friday. Earlier this month, his administration also announced it was hitting 24 Russian oligarchs with sanctions over “malign activity,” including election meddling.

Republicans had few good answers on Tuesday as to why Trump has been hesitant to criticize or take action against Russia.

“I don’t know,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) told HuffPost. “I think he has criticized Russia and called them out, but, you know, I don’t know. He has long-standing relationships there.”

“I would support sanctions, definitely,” she added.

Asked why he seemed unwilling to criticize Russia, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told HuffPost, “I think he’s criticized them every day when he bombs their chief ally in Syria.”

Democrats, meanwhile, questioned Trump’s commitment to punitive actions against Russia given his reversal on new sanctions.

“The White House shouldn’t have to drag the president kicking and screaming to do the right thing when it comes to punishing Vladimir Putin and Russia,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday.

“Nikki Haley must be so embarrassed today,” he added. “That she forthrightly says, we’re going to be tough on Russia and do additional sanctions one day and the president contradicts her the next. Do they talk to each other? Do they have a set plan? Or is it just up to the president’s whim, day to day, moment to moment?”Gov. Jerry Brown (D) predicted California will win a legal battle with the Trump administration over auto fuel and emissions standards. Lucy Nicholson / Reuters

WASHINGTON ― California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) on Tuesday expressed confidence his state would prevail in a looming legal battle over the Trump administration’s plan to weaken auto fuel economy and emissions standards.

“The idea we’re going to roll back the auto standards is absurd. We’re not going to do that,” Brown told reporters at an event hosted by the National Press Club. “We have the legal horsepower to block the immediate legal moves by the Trump administration.”

Two weeks ago, the Environmental Protection Agency rolled out plans to gut vehicle fuel and emissions standards after complaints from automakers. Those 2012 standards, a compromise between California and federal regulators, require vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly doubling today’s benchmark.

Brown argued that the world auto market, especially China and Europe, demands that U.S. carmakers reduce emissions, not allow more pollution.

“They’re not going to sell cars in China if they don’t have zero-emission vehicles,” he said. “This is just another temporary kerfuffle where the newsies play around with these things. But the hard facts on the ground are we have to intensify, increase, our vehicle emission standards and not weaken them and go in the other direction.”

U.S. automakers, reeling from the financial crisis and subsequent bailout by taxpayers, agreed to the 2012 rules in part because they set national standards, avoiding the need to manufacture one set of vehicles to meet California’s strict standards, and another set for looser requirements in the remaining 70 percent of the U.S. auto market.

But carmakers pushed for relaxing the rules under President Donald Trump, complaining that lower fuel prices were boosting sales of gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks, and that electric and hybrid vehicles encouraged by the regulations weren’t selling.

Automakers, their critics say, prefer to sell gas guzzlers because that’s where the money is. Each $73,000 Cadillac Escalade, for example, nets $35,000 in profit, according to The Detroit News. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, are only half as profitable as cars with combustion engines, a Daimler executive said last year. It’s no wonder that American automakers devoted much of their coveted Super Bowl advertising slots this year to pickup trucks and SUVs.

“They create demand,” said Daniel Becker, the director of the D.C.-based Safe Climate Campaign’s Center for Auto Safety. “They know how to market vehicles ― that’s what they do for their existence. They want to make the vehicles that they make the biggest profit on.”

Brown said he was disappointed that people in Washington and elsewhere seemed to be “consumed by nonsense” rather than by the threat of climate change.

“People are asleep,” he said. “When you pick up the paper or turn on cable news, you’d think its another planet. It’s all about the nonsense of Washington, and carbon emissions are growing, and we’ve gotta radically turn that around or the migrations you see now are going to be child’s play. We’re going to have more conflicts, more terrorism, more insecurity because of climate disruption.”

Brown, 80, is California’s longest-serving governor. He’s barred by term limits from running again, but promised it’s too early to “ride into the sunset.” But he seemed to dismiss the prospect of a presidential run in 2020.Comedian Michelle Wolf has thrown down the gauntlet by daring President Donald Trump to attend the 2018 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, which she is slated to host next weekend.

The WHCA said earlier this month that Trump plans to skip the April 28 event. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will represent the Trump administration instead.

On Monday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Wolf said her first thought when she learned of Trump’s impending no-show was that she’s grateful she won’t have to hear him eat.

“You know he doesn’t chew with his mouth closed,” Wolf joked to host Jimmy Kimmel. “He’s probably like a real smacky eater and like a mouth-breather at the same time.”

Wolf added, though, that it would be “real fun” to make fun of Trump while looking him “in the eye.” After a little encouragement from Kimmel, she issued a challenge to the president to turn up.

“I dare you, you poor little man,” Wolf said. “I’ll give you five dollars if you come.”

Officers in Cambridge, Massachusetts, responded Friday night after receiving seven emergency calls about a man acting erratically, The Washington Post reported. They encountered Selorm Ohene, 24, who had disrobed and allegedly taken an unknown drug, a woman friend of the young man told police.

The officers’ handling of the incident has caused controversy in the community, with Cambridge Mayor Marc McGovern terming what is shown on the video “disturbing.

In the video, which was released by police, Ohene is seen talking to three officers. As he turns his back to one of them, the officer tackles him. Ohene can be seen flailing as officers try to hold him down and one of them begins to strike him.

Ohene was punched five times, according to a police report. He was charged with indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assault. The extent of his injuries was not immediately clear.

“Cambridge affirms that Black Lives Matter, but it must be true in practice as well,” McGovern said in a statement. “Policing is Cambridge is far ahead of many communities across the country, and yet we can always strive to do better.”

McGovern has called for an investigation into the incident.

Ohene’s lawyers said in a statement that the incident “continues to be a trying ordeal for Selorm and for his family.”

“The video speaks for itself,” the lawyers said. “At this time, our focus is on Selorm’s health and well-being.”WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain underwent surgery in an Arizona hospital on Sunday to treat an intestinal infection and was in stable condition on Monday, his office said in a statement.

The 81-year-old Arizona Republican was diagnosed with brain cancer in July last year.

He received chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and in December was treated at a military hospital outside Washington for side effects of cancer therapy.

“My husband @SenJohnMcCain is doing well after his surgery,” McCain’s wife Cindy said in Twitter post, adding that he was looking forward to getting back home.

The statement issued by the senator’s office said McCain underwent surgery at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix to treat an intestinal infection related to diverticulitis.

“Over the last few months, Senator McCain has been participating in physical therapy at his home in Cornville, Arizona, as he recovers from the side effects of cancer treatment,” the statement said.

McCain, who lost the 2008 U.S. presidential election to Barack Obama, is serving his sixth term as a senator.After “Night Court,” Anderson co-starred as columnist Dave Barry in the CBS comedy “Dave’s World,” which ran for four seasons. Anderson moved to New Orleans in 2000 to open the nightclub Oswald’s Speakeasy, where he performed a mix of comedy and magic, and a magic and curio shop dubbed Sideshow.

Anderson logged a guest shot in FX’s “Son of the Beach” in 2002 and a 2008 appearance on NBC’s “30 Rock.” But for the most part he stayed away from Hollywood. He moved to North Carolina in 2006 after New Orleans was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina.

Anderson, born in Rhode Island, reportedly had a difficult childhood and moved frequently with his mother, who he once described in an interview with Playboy as “a hustler.” He moved to California at the age of 16 to be with his father. He became a street performer and reportedly ran a lucrative shell game on the streets of San Francisco for a time.

Anderson made his way to L.A.’s famed Magic Castle in the early 1980s where he connected with an agent, according to TCM.com. He made several appearances on “Saturday Night Live” around this time.

Friends, colleagues and fans took to Twitter on Monday to mourn his passing:“It was beautiful,” the actress said. “It was very sudden, but it was, I was sobbing the whole ― his vows were stunning. It’s when two people really love each other and they really mean it, it shows, and it was a beautiful ceremony and an amazing time. I couldn’t be happier for them.”

As for those who were wondering why Schumer and Fischer got married so fast, the comedian explained in her vows that it was “because I truly cannot wait another second to be your wife. I love you.”Jim Carrey is back with another epic shade-throwing portrait.

In a public service announcement created by Peele and BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti and disseminated on social media on Tuesday, Obama appears to be giving a sincere but stern address.

“We’re entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time — even if they would never say those things,” says “Obama.”

“So, for instance, they could have me say things like, I don’t know, [Black Panther’s] Killmonger was right! Or, Ben Carson is in the sunken place! Or, how ’bout this: Simply, President Trump is a total and complete dipshit.”

You won't believe what Obama says in this video 😉 pic.twitter.com/n2KloCdF2G — BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) April 17, 2018

The video reveals about halfway through that it’s been Peele’s voice from the start. Digital manipulation was used to make it look like Obama was talking, driving home the video’s warning to viewers that they should be careful about trusting information they find online.

That message ends with Obama/Peele saying, “Stay woke, bitches.”

According to BuzzFeed, the video was written by Peele and produced by BuzzFeed’s Jared Sosa with help from Peele’s company, Monkeypaw Productions. Peretti wanted the video to come to fruition because BuzzFeed has covered counterfeit news websites extensively.

“We’ve covered counterfeit news websites that say the pope endorsed Trump that look kinda like real news but because it’s text people have started to become more wary,” Peretti said. “And now we’re starting to see tech that allows people to put words into the mouths of public figures that look like they must be real because it’s video and video doesn’t lie!”

Peele cheekily acknowledged the video on Twitter, but did not say much else after it was published:

As for how Obama’s creepy manipulation came to be, it was done using After Effects, a motion-graphics program, and Fakeapp, an artificial-intelligence video-editing program. Sosa digitally pasted Peele’s mouth onto Obama’s, then replaced the former president’s jawline with one that moved in conjunction with Peele’s speech patterns. Fakeapp was then used to make everything more seamless, an effort that took more than 56 hours of automatic processing, according to BuzzFeed.

AdvertisementAriana Grande marked the first anniversary of the deadly bombing in Manchester, England, on Tuesday with a message of support for her fans.

A year to the day since 22 people attending her “Dangerous Woman” concert at the Manchester Arena were killed in a terrorist bombing, Grande tweeted:

thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 22, 2018

Grande also included a bee emoji in her post, in reference to the symbol of the city.

Last week, Grande told Time magazine that the bombing was “the absolute worst of humanity.”

“Music is supposed to be the safest thing in the world,” she said. “I think that’s why it’s still so heavy on my heart every single day.”

Grande released her first single since the attack, “No Tears Left To Cry,” in April:Why go to the prom alone when you can bring a cardboard cutout of your dream date instead?

Philadelphia high school senior Audeva Agyeman did just that. The teen took a life-sized cutout of “Black Panther” star Michael B. Jordan as her date.

On Tuesday morning, Agyeman tweeted some snapshots from prom night next to her delightful likeness of Jordan:

After not being able to get a prom date from procrastinating and waiting til the last minute, i spent 3 hours making my sexy prom date. I got on @TheShadeRoomm but now i need to MEET my man @michaelb4jordan @TheEllenShow pls help. RT FOR #GetDeetoMBJ pic.twitter.com/9y7Kt4MwsJ — Mrs. Chance & B. Jordan (@uhdeevuh) April 17, 2018

According to Essence, she created the Jordan cutout only because her initial date plans fell through.

“Well, I asked my friend Tyler and he couldn’t come because of college stuff,” Agyeman told the publication. “My other friend Dillon was going with someone else and everyone else said no because they thought it was weird to go to an all-girls school prom. So I decided, let me make a cardboard cutout because I’m always being unique so I knew this would stand out.”

When asked why she chose Jordan specifically, Agyeman told the publication her love for him began with his role on HBO’s “The Wire.”

Photos and videos of Agyeman at the prom with her cardboard Jordan have gone viral:

A lot of Twitter users have been really supportive of Agyeman’s story and celebrated her affection for Jordan:

As the teen tweeted, she’s eager to meet the actor in real life, and she doesn’t seem to be too far away from that goal.

Jordan commented on The Shade Room’s post of Agyeman with the cutout: “This is called commitment!”

Instagram

One of Agyeman’s classmates even posted a video of the teen’s emotional reaction to Jordan seeing her with the cutout:

Both Hitler and Trump have successfully attacked another group, turning it into an “artificial enemy,” in order to foster greater support among loyalists, Oakes, the CEO of SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, said last November.

He made the comments as part of a series of interviews that Emma Briant, a University of Essex lecturer, conducted with people involved in Britain’s campaign to leave the European Union about propaganda used during the Brexit referendum. Britain’s Parliament released the interview transcripts Monday.

“Hitler, got to be very careful about saying so, must never probably say this, off the record, but of course Hitler attacked the Jews, because... He didn’t have a problem with the Jews at all, but the people didn’t like the Jews,” Oakes said. “So if the people… He could just use them to say… So he just leverage an artificial enemy. Well that’s exactly what Trump did. He leveraged a Muslim- I mean, you know, it’s- It was a real enemy. ISIS is a real, but how big a threat is ISIS really to America? Really, I mean, we are still talking about 9/11, well 9/11 is a long time ago.”

Another one of the interviewees, former communications director for Leave.EU Andy Wigmore, compared the campaign’s own strategy to Hitler’s “very clever” propaganda machine.

“In its pure marketing sense, you can see the logic of what they were saying, why they were saying it, and how they presented things, and the imagery,” he said of the Nazis. “And looking at that now, in hindsight, having been on the sharp end of this campaign, you think: crikey, this is not new, and it’s just … using the tools that you have at the time.”

Cambridge Analytica said Oakes never worked for the company or the Trump campaign and said he was instead “speaking in a personal capacity about the historical use of propaganda to an academic he knew well from her work in the defence sphere,” according to a spokesperson.On Monday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show,” Noah asked his audience to “think about how unethical this is for a moment,” given how Cohen is currently at the center of a federal investigation.

“Hannity has been reporting on this Michael Cohen story from the beginning, from the beginning, but he conveniently never mentioned that Cohen was his guy, which even for Sean Hannity is pretty shady,” said Noah. “I mean, even Instagram models will have higher standards.”

Noah then aired clips from recent appearances in which Hannity railed against the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s home and offices.

“Now that we know he was working with Cohen, that looks less like a news show and more like a guy, really stressed, giving himself a pep talk,” Noah quipped.

Check it out above.Is Sean Hannity getting his legal advice from old episodes of “Breaking Bad?”

More than a few people suggested that was the case on Monday after the Fox News host insisted that he was never represented by attorney Michael Cohen. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer is currently at the heart of a federal investigation.

Earlier in the day, Cohen’s team of lawyers tried unsuccessfully to protect the identity of a “mystery” client, who turned out to be Hannity. After the news broke, Hannity said on his radio show:

“I never gave him a retainer. Never paid any fees. I may have handed him $10 once. I requested attorney-client privilege with him, and assumed our conversations would be confidential, but they have never involved any matter with him and any third party.”

The line about how he “may have” given Cohen $10 to gain “attorney-client privilege” was what captured people’s attention. While money is generally not a requirement for invoking that privilege, the notion persists in popular culture and has been used as a plot device on numerous TV programs, including “Breaking Bad.”

In the second season episode titled “Better Call Saul,” attorney Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) ― who would later star in his own show by that title ― urged Walt (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) to “put a dollar in my pocket” to ensure attorney-client privilege. That had people wondering if Hannity’s own legal notions came from TV shows:

“Predictably, without knowing all or frankly any of the facts, the media went absolutely insane,” Hannity said in the last few minutes of his program, echoing tweets from earlier Monday. “Let me set the record straight. Here’s the truth: Michael Cohen never represented me in any legal matter. I never retained his services.

“They never involved any matter ... between me, a third party, a third group at all,” he continued. “My questions exclusively almost focused on real estate.”

Earlier in the hour, Fox News contributor Alan Dershowitz chastised Hannity for failing to mention his link to Cohen before any of his many segments in which he covered the FBI raid on the attorney’s office, hotel room and home last week.

“I really think that you should have disclosed your relationship with Cohen when you talked about him on this show,” Dershowitz said.

“I have a right to privacy,” the Fox News host retorted. “It was such a minor relationship and it had to do with real estate and nothing political.”

Alan Dershowitz (!) says that Hannity should have disclosed that he was a client of Cohen before discussing the FBI raid last week.

Hannity was revealed as one of Cohen’s clients in court on Monday as part of a federal investigation into Cohen’s business and financial dealings.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ordered Cohen’s attorney Steve Ryan to share Cohen’s client list after hearing that Cohen had worked for 10 clients since 2017. Cohen reportedly did “traditional legal tasks” for three clients ― Trump, former Republican National Committee official Elliott Broidy and a third person who asked to remain anonymous.

“The client is a publicly prominent individual,” Ryan said, arguing that the then-unnamed person would be “embarrassed” to be identified, but another attorney representing media outlets said that was not enough cause to keep the identity private.

Wood then demanded that Ryan reveal the client’s name. Ryan identified Hannity as the third client to audible gasps in the courtroom, according to The New York Times.

AdvertisementSamira Wiley couldn’t contain her excitement at appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” for the first time Tuesday. However, the “Orange Is the New Black” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” star revealed that she’d had a previous encounter with the host.

“I met you, like, really briefly one time,” Wiley told DeGeneres. “I know you don’t remember it because you’re Ellen, but it meant a lot to me because you’re lord of the lesbians.”

When DeGeneres pressed her as to where they’d crossed paths, Wiley ― who wore Ted Baker and recently celebrated her one-year wedding anniversary with wife Lauren Morelli at Disneyland ― quipped, “Probably at a lesbian event. I go to those sometimes. I see you at those.”

Later in the interview, the Emmy nominee touched on the cultural relevance of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which returns to Hulu for its second season on April 25.Congratulations are in order for 2005 Miss America Deidre Downs Gunn, who tied the knot with girlfriend Abbott Jones in the former beauty queen’s home state of Alabama this past weekend.

The couple wed Saturday at the Birmingham Museum of Art in a ceremony with a “modern Southern romance” theme, People reports.

“Saying our vows in front of our family and friends and making that commitment to the love of my life was the most meaningful part of the day for me,” Downs Gunn, who is an obstetrician-gynecologist specializing in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, told the magazine. “I feel overjoyed to have found someone to share life’s adventures.”

Jones, an attorney and writer, felt similarly, calling her new wife “the most beautiful person I’ve ever met, both inside and out.”

“I have no doubt she will continue to be a role model to so many,” she told AL.com in a statement, “especially to young women who can look to her and see that regardless of who they love, they can be beautiful, intelligent, and confident in their own skin.”

The ceremony, captured by Kelli & Daniel Taylor Photography, was filled with pastels and candlelight. Downs Gunn’s 8-year-old son gave his mother away, and also acted as her best man.

The reception’s menu featured the couple’s favorite Southern foods, including chicken and waffles, fried green tomatoes and buttermilk biscuits.

By Sunday, the Miss America Organization had offered its congratulations...

On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign sent its well wishes to the couple, too.

The following year, she wore the crown as Miss America, and took up the cause of childhood cancer prevention during her reign.Two robbery suspects lost their loot to the wind after a holdup at a travel agent’s office, newly released police video shows.

Surveillance footage shows money dropping from the pockets of an unidentified man’s pants as the robbers flee the travel agency in Droylsden, northern England, on March 17, according to police.

Gusty winds then scatter the bills in the street and foil attempts to collect it.

Greater Manchester Police released footage of the bungled getaway online Friday. It is now going viral.

“This duo threatened innocent people working in the travel agents and should know their actions are utterly unacceptable,” Detective Constable Phil Scargill said via a statement.

“They took every step to secure the money in the shop, but left the stolen notes in their wake as they fled from the scene,” Scargill added.

AdvertisementDemocrats have launched a serious bid to win an April 24 special election for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, scaring national GOP groups into spending major money on a seat that was once considered safely Republican.

Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, 50, a physician and an advocate for cancer research, is taking on Republican Debbie Lesko, 59, a conservative state senator, to fill a suburban Phoenix seat vacated by Rep. Trent Franks (R). Franks resigned in December after it emerged that he had offered a female aide $5 million to serve as a surrogate mother for his children.

Although the odds of Tipirneni flipping the seat are not in her favor, her candidacy has excited the Democratic base, enabling the party to improve its chances in other races. In November, Arizona Democrats hope to take control of the state Senate and plan to mount serious bids for the governorship and an open U.S. Senate seat.

“The party is confident that 2018 could be a big year for Arizona,” said Drew Anderson, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party.

Democrat Hiral Tipirneni is running in an April 24 special election in Arizona's 8th Congressional District. Hiral for Congress

Arizona’s 8th Congressional District is composed of suburbs north and west of Phoenix. The district is home to a large number of retirees: More than one-fifth of residents are 65 or older.

In 2016, President Donald Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the district by 21 percentage points. That same year, the district re-elected Franks by an even wider margin, but his main opponent was from the Green Party, not the Democratic Party.

Other parts of Arizona, including adjacent areas of the Phoenix metropolitan area, have been trending more Democratic. Clinton lost the state by just 3.5 percentage points, and in Maricopa County, which encompasses greater Phoenix, voters ousted Joe Arpaio, the notoriously anti-immigrant sheriff.

Now, in a reflection of this year’s higher-than-usual Democratic enthusiasm, public polling indicates that the race for Arizona’s 8th is competitive. Tipirneni even leads Lesko by 1 percentage point in an Emerson College poll released Monday, although political strategists still see her as an underdog.

National Republican groups have responded in force, hoping to avoid another embarrassing defeat in solid-red territory. Three groups ― the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC ― have together spent nearly $1 million boosting Lesko’s bid.

The outside airpower aims to narrow the damage of Tipirneni’s fundraising lead over Lesko. Tipirneni has raised $740,000 compared with Lesko’s $564,000 haul. (Former Rep. Franks is among Lesko’s high-dollar donors, contributing the maximum of $2,700 allowed from an individual.)

And while the Arizona Democratic Party has pitched in for Tipirneni with a field office, staff and get-out-the-vote resources, national Democratic groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee, have not given her any cash directly.

The DNC has, however, used its email list to fundraise for Tipirneni. It also contributed a five-figure grant to the Arizona Democratic Party for voter outreach and registration through its State Party Innovation Fund, though the grant is not earmarked for use in the special election for Arizona’s 8th District.

Tipirneni’s biggest individual national booster may be Ady Barkan, an ALS-stricken activist who leads the progressive Center for Popular Democracy Action. Barkan, who played a lead role in Capitol Hill protests against the GOP tax cuts, traveled to the district to campaign for Tipirneni ― and press Lesko about her stances on cutting major social insurance programs.

The GOP candidate in the #AZ08 special election, @DebbieLesko, either doesn't know or won't admit that her party's leaders want to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.

Asked whether she was disappointed that the national party had not provided more support for her bid, Tipirneni responded indirectly.

“We have learned very clearly that every state is worth contesting and every race is worth investing in,” Tipirneni told HuffPost in an interview. “We’ve learned that repeatedly, so I don’t know why we’re even addressing it.”

An aide to Lesko said he would respond later this week to detailed questions about her policy stances and campaign. HuffPost will update this article accordingly.

It is hard not to see in the race for Arizona’s 8th some of the same elements that propelled Democrats to an upset victory in the March 14 special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.

Tipirneni is benefiting from the enthusiasm and mobilization of the district’s Democratic voters, particularly suburban women, in the wake of Trump’s election.

Recent policy battles in Arizona, one of several GOP-controlled states experiencing a backlash, including threatened teacher strikes, after years of fiscal austerity, have created a ready-made corps of activists primed to canvass for Tipirneni. Many of the same women knocking on doors for Tipirneni now had already mobilized against a bill in the state Legislature expanding private school vouchers. Lesko was a sponsor of the school voucher bill, which has since become a law that’s being challenged on the November ballot.

At the same time, Tipirneni is keenly aware that she needs the support of independents and Republicans to win. To this end, she has not made Trump a focus of her run ― or really spoken much about him at all.

“When people ask, I speak about him,” Tipirneni told HuffPost. Even then, Tipirneni does not dwell much on Trump as a person. She criticizes the president in the context of his work with congressional Republicans to pass policies Tipirneni opposes, such as the tax cut legislation, which she calls “atrocious.”

“It’s just unconscionable that on the backs of seniors they would pay for this huge corporate tax cut.” - Hiral Tipirneni, Democratic candidate for Arizona's 8th Congressional District seat

Indeed, Tipirneni has focused on the kitchen-table issues of health care, education and retirement security.

She supports creating a Medicare-like public option to compete with private plans that would be accessible to all Americans.

The proposal has prompted charges from Lesko that Tipirneni is too liberal for the district. “She’s for this socialized, Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all. And that’s not what our constituents want,” Lesko said in a televised debate with Tipirneni in late March.

In fact, while Sen. Sanders proposes replacing private insurance with Medicare, Tipirneni would simply permit people to buy into the program.

And she laments the pressure to cut Social Security and Medicare as the GOP tax cuts add $1.5 trillion to the national debt. (In an interview discussing his decision not to seek re-election, House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed regret that he had not accomplished “entitlement reform,” a euphemism for scaling back major social insurance programs.)

“A lot of my community are elderly folks, retirees. For them, Medicare and Social Security are their lifelines,” Tipirneni said. “These are earned benefits that they have paid into through decades of hard work.”

“It’s just unconscionable that on the backs of seniors they would pay for this huge corporate tax cut that puts billions of dollars into the pockets of companies like Exxon and Walmart, as opposed to folks who could really use that help,” she added.

In lieu of the current tax revision, Tipirneni proposes making the middle-class tax cuts in the law permanent and expanding them so they reach more people.

Although Tipirneni’s progressive policy stances put her comfortably in the Democratic mainstream, she identifies as a “moderate Democrat” and emphasizes her “data-driven approach” to policy.

“Show me the facts, show me the research. That’s what my science background brings to the table,” Tipirneni said.

For her part, Lesko has touted her conservative bona fides and devotion to Trump’s agenda, not least on the hot-button issue of immigration.

In a 30-second TV ad, “Built the Wall,” Lesko declares her support for Trump’s plan to build a wall on the southern U.S. border but also says it’s “not enough.”

“We need more Border Patrol agents and the best technology to stop this invasion,” she says.

Republicans have also accused Tipirneni of financially benefiting from the ACA. Her firm, CSRA, received a contract to assist with Obamacare enrollment. But Tipirneni said her research work is completely separate and that she has not profited from the landmark health care law in any way.

Tipirneni remains optimistic about her bid, but she also acknowledged the importance of her bid in increasing the Democratic Party’s reach in the state ahead of the November elections. The party’s biggest pickup opportunity is likely in the state Senate, where Republicans currently have a four-seat majority.
