Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) addressed his colleagues on Wednesday after a shooter opened fire at a South Florida high school, leaving at least 17 people dead.

Murphy, a fierce gun control advocate who had just been elected to the Senate when the Sandy Hook massacre took place in his home state, blamed congressional inaction for the events that unfolded in Parkland, Florida.

“This happens nowhere else other than the United States of America,” he said. “This epidemic of mass slaughter ... it only happens here not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction.”

Pointing to himself and his colleagues, he continued, “We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.”

Since 20 students and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, were killed in December 2012, Murphy has dedicated his legislative career to fighting for gun control. Congress has failed to pass any gun control reforms since Sandy Hook, but Murphy continues to push the issue. He told HuffPost last year that he wouldn’t consider himself successful until he delivered some progress.The lawyer for the parents of an 8-year-old girl with autism released a disturbing video that shows a California school bus driver taunting and manhandling the child.

“I’ve been doing work on behalf of physically and sexually abused kids for 17 years ― many times against school districts – and it’s beyond disturbing to me,” the attorney, Micha Star Liberty, told HuffPost.

The video, recorded on Feb. 6 by a surveillance camera on a Vacaville Unified School District bus, led to the arrest of Kim Cheryle Klopson, 64. Vacaville police have charged her with felony child abuse, to which she’s pleaded not guilty.

Liberty said the family plans to file a lawsuit against the district in the coming months.

Klopson, according to police, was transporting a group of students with special needs to Browns Valley Elementary School when the 8-year-old, a second-grader, was accused of blocking the aisle with her leg.

“If you stick your feet out again… you are going to be on the window,” Klopson can be heard saying on the video.

The incident appears to escalate when the bus arrives at the school. Klopson is seen on the video grabbing the girl’s backpack and ordering her to remain seated as the other students exit the bus.

When a paraeducator steps up to the bus, the driver is heard taunting the girl as she cries hysterically.

“She’s acting like she’s younger than her baby sister,” Klopson says. “She’s only two, how old are you? One? Oh no, a baby.”

Klopson can then be seen yanking the girl up.

“OK, so I get to do that again? Help you sit up? Get up,” Klopson says as she throws the girl down. “You wanna crawl, you can crawl.”

The paraeducator does nothing to intervene and after a few minutes Klopson closes the bus door, saying, “OK, we’ll be right there.”

Klopson can then be seen yanking the young girl around again as she continues to taunt her.

“Nah nah nah nah nah,” the bus driver says. “You done? Nah nah nah nah nah.”

Klopson then tries to force the girl’s backpack on her.

“Please stop it,” the girl cries. “I don’t want to. Stop it.”

Klopson replies, “No, I’m not gonna stop it.”

The video ends with Klopson dragging the young girl off the bus.

“It’s OK, I didn’t hurt her, guys,” Klopson can be heard saying to people outside the bus. “I mean you’re all like ― it’s OK. Bye… I’ll see you after school. That should be interesting.”

The incident left the girl with scrapes and bruises, according to Liberty.

“Instead of being taken to the principal’s office or nurse, she was taken to her classroom,” the attorney said. “She complained about physical pain and eventually she was taken to the nurse and the nurse reported it to the principal.”

Liberty said the family was not notified of the incident until the girl was back on the bus later in the day and on her way home.

“The parents asked what happened and they were invited down to the school to see portions of the video,” she said. “They were heartbroken, appalled and shocked.”

The Vacaville Unified School District claims they fired Klopson, but court filings indicate Klopson said she quit. The paraeducator who appeared to witness some of the alleged abuse is still employed by the district, according to Liberty.

“I don’t know how you can watch a child go through that and then allow the bus driver to shut the door,” she said. “It’s clearly despicable.”

Liberty said the bus incident has caused the young girl deep and ongoing mental trauma.

“She’s started therapy for the first time at the young age of 8 to try and work through the trauma that she’s experienced,” she said. “She’s having regressive behavior, nightmares and aversions to certain things. This has had a very significant impact on her.”

A phone number for Klopson has been disconnected. In a statement to The Reporter News, the school district said, “Please know that we take this matter very seriously and will continue to be forthcoming and collaborative with our families.”

Liberty called it “heartbreaking” that “this little girl was educated and trained to use her words and to say if she doesn’t want to do something. She was crying and she’s telling the bus driver, ‘I don’t like you’ and ‘I don’t want to’ because she was doing what she was trained to do to help herself. Yet this bus driver clearly wasn’t trained appropriately and didn’t behave in any sort of accordance with norms or standards.”Kiera Please loves what she does and understands the importance of cosplaying characters of color.

On Halloween, many people love to dress up as their favorite characters, but for others, playing the part of someone they admire is actually a lifestyle. Insert: the cosplay community — a group of creatives who are passionate about costume play. While it’s not traditionally known as a hobby in which people of color partake, there is one young black woman who is making a name for herself in cosplay.

Kiera Please is a cosplayer who has gained a massive following. She’s transformed into everyone from Canary of the Japanese manga series “Hunter x Hunter” to Winifred Sanderson from the Disney horror fantasy film Hocus Pocus. And every time she tries out a new character, her spot-on execution illustrates her incomparable talent.

Besides just playing characters she adores, the 23-year-old has made it known time and time again that she absolutely loves and understands the importance of playing characters of color. “Women of color can be seen in different realms, and I want to make sure people can take that in and realize that,” she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “If you see no one that looks like you that can be kind of frustrating.”

We caught up with the Georgia-based cosplayer to find out more about her amazing journey and how she’s changing the face of cosplay.

Yahoo Lifestyle: How did you begin doing cosplay? Did you have any formal training?

Kiera: It’s kind of a funny story. I always used to get compared to this character named Garnet from the animated series “Stephen Universe.” One day I was just like, “Hey, I’m going to dress up as Garnet” because everybody would constantly tell me how I remind them of that character. I decided to just piece it all together and was like, “Hey, guys, look who I am,” as a surprise and everyone received it pretty well.

Initially, I didn’t even connect that it was cosplay and was just really enjoying it, and I thought to myself, I want to do another character. That’s when I did my second character, Princess Kida, and from there I started realizing there was a whole community of people who do this. It didn’t even come across my mind at first.

Why is it important for you to cosplay women of color?

There was a time when I sat down just thinking of characters of color within cartoons, and I had a hard time. I struggled to name six! While there are more than six out there, it was kind of strange to me that it took a while for me to come up with that list. I believe it’s important to identify with characters in shows that you watch. It’s good to just highlight those characters so people know there are characters out there like that. They are important, and I feel like there should be more. Women of color can be seen in different realms and I want to make sure people can take that in and realize that. You want to empower people, and you want to be empowered by the things you watch. If you see no one who looks like you, that can be kind of frustrating.

Have you experienced any unique challenges or backlash from the cosplay industry?

Yes, definitely. A lot of it has been from people who aren’t necessarily familiar with that realm. A lot of the backlash mainly comes when I cosplay someone who isn’t black. People will say, “You don’t look like her,” “You’re a little too curvy to be that person,” or “This looks nothing like it — you failed.” It’s just heartbreaking because it’s not necessarily about looking exactly like the character; it’s about having a love for that character, their personality, maybe even identifying with them heavily, and putting your love into that character. That’s why you create the outfits, and that’s why you decide to dress up within them because something about that character touched you.

I try to just ignore the backlash and keep going so people can see it doesn’t bother me, and I’m still going to do it.

Does it ever bother you when someone who’s not of color plays a character that is? Why or why not?

It depends on how the person executes it. As long as there’s no yellowface or blackface or manipulating to look black, then I’m OK with it. Princess Kida is seen as a woman of color, and you can wear a white wig without adding brown to your skin. It also depends on if the character is wearing any garments that have any cultural significance. Personally, I don’t want to touch a character if in real life their garments actually do mean something. I’d rather just stay away from that character.

It’s important to be sensitive about how you clothe your character and recognizing those differences to make sure you’re aware and that you’re not offending anyone.

Have you you ever gone out in cosplay on a regular day?

Oh my God, I have! It’s so funny. Sometimes it looks like people are thinking, Is that what she’s really wearing? Then there are some people that come up to me like, “Um, I don’t want to bother you, but are you blah blah blah from this show?” I never say anything when I do it to anybody. I just go out and see what happens. It’s cool to see people’s reactions.

Cosplay costs can add up with all the supplies needed. How did you get around that? Any tips?

Yeah, sometimes I do get sponsorships from companies that have cosplay items. I actually usually like to change my hair, so there are times when I’ll coordinate it with the characters I may want to play and get wigs to try from different companies.

As far as cutting costs, it’s usually just going through and manipulating clothes at a thrift store or your closet. I definitely suggest going to a thrift store and looking for fabric there on 25 cent or $1 days. Joann Fabric and Craft Stores is a good place to try. They always have text coupons with items up to 50 percent off.

Many characters wear outfits you would wear in everyday life, but their outfit just may be very iconic to their personality. I’ve had some people come up to me saying, “Yeah, I didn’t realize I could do it that way too.” It’s very touching to hear, “I don’t have a lot of money to spend all the time on this, so it’s good to know that there’s other characters that don’t have extravagant outfits that I can cosplay.” This allows you to save up to build for an extravagant costume you’ve been wanting to get.

What advice would you give to children of color or anyone younger who is inspired by you and wants to get into cosplay?

I would probably tell them to just go out and try it. Whether it comes out great or it comes out OK or you don’t like it, the first thing to do is just start. As cliché as that sounds, it’s true. I would also say try to find a friend to do it with you. It makes the process easier and more fun when you can go to the thrift store and have a buddy.

Another piece of advice would be to not care about what people have to say. If you’re embarrassed or scared to go into it, at the end of the day, they’re not in control of your life. To let someone control your life who has no impact on your future is just not worth it. You don’t ever want to live your life thinking, I wish I would have tried that. You’d rather live it saying, “I tried that, it didn’t work. OK, I’m going to move on” or “I tried that and found out I loved it.”

Also, don’t be afraid to start small. I can remember a lot of times in the past not starting a project because I felt like I needed so many things, but at the end of the day, you have to just start with something that’s doable. Don’t discount starting small, even if you can’t start where you want to be. It’s OK to start somewhere else. Let go of your ego of how it’s supposed to go, and just go into it any way that you’re able to.

What do your family and friends think about your love of cosplay?

They didn’t really know I was into it. To be honest, I feel like they found out through the internet. I didn’t explicitly say, “Hey, Mom, I’m doing this.” It’s kind of like they randomly saw it on the internet and then no one said anything. That’s the funny part. They’re just like, “All right, if that’s what she want to do.” Now it’s more of an open conversation where they’ll give suggestions. They were never unsupportive of it. They just saw and were like, “OK, well we love you. Do what you want.” Now it’s more so like, “Oh, you should do this character or can I do it with you?” It’s funny.

Why do you enjoy cosplay and continue to do it?

When I started doing it, I would consider each character just a little project I was working on. It would help me get through hard times. If I was struggling with something, it was kind of like my therapy. It wasn’t just about making these characters, but it was about doing something that I enjoyed that would help me get through situations, calm my mind, calm my thoughts, and just lower my blood pressure, in general. I really enjoy the process of it.

I also love when people come up to me in real life because of cosplay. They let me know things like, “I was scared to try it out or I never thought I could. I didn’t really know about it, and then I saw you do it and thought it was kind of cool, I want to try it too.” It feels good to know people are delving into realms they’re unfamiliar with and feeling completely confident about it. It’s not always easy to dive into something like that, so it’s nice to give that push to someone who may have needed it.

In the end, I just like seeing the end result of the characters. I like going to the conventions and seeing other characters or other people do it. It’s just nice to see people put in all that work and then see the finished product. You’re like, wow, they really created something that didn’t exist before and now here it is. They look wonderful.

This interview has been edited and condensed.PYEONGCHANG, South Korea—The volleyballs are flying high at Austria House, and the drinks are flowing. The music’s bumping a bass beat thick enough to rearrange internal organs, and the crowd throws up hands every time the DJ calls out MONSTER BLOCK or SUPER SLAM.

Oh, and it’s a balmy 35 degrees out. Perfect volleyball weather, right?

Beach volleyball has become one of the marquee events of the Summer Games, and now comes its snowy cousin with an eye on carving out a little slice of the wintertime sports pie. Snow volleyball isn’t anywhere near getting onto an Olympic slate, not even close, but at a demonstration event held on Valentine’s Day at the Austria House, within sight of the Olympic Sliding Centre, the energy was as high as almost any event this week.

The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) and the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) rounded up a handful of notable beach volleyballers: gold medalists Emanuel of Brazil, Vladimir Grbic of Serbia and Giba of Brazil, as well as bronze medalist Chen Xue of China and Olympians Stefanie Schwaiger of Austria, Kim Yeon-koung of South Korea, and Nikolas Berger of Austria. The Olympians threw on some thermals, gloves, and soccer cleats, and took a turn in the snow as perhaps a hundred fans around them cheered and danced.

“We like to play in the mountains, in the beach, outside, inside, with children, with men and women,” CEV president Aleksandr Boricic said after the demonstration. “With snow volleyball, we can cover volleyball every day of the year.”

The purpose of this little exhibition was to show snow volleyball’s viability as a sport, and on that score, it succeeded just fine. But as an Olympic entry? That’s where it gets a little trickier.

Snow volleyball demands a different set of skills than the beach version, starting with the fact that, well, you’re on snow. Attendants with rakes chopped the snow into a fine powder, but by the end of the match, the stomping players, and dropping temperatures, had pounded the snow into slick near-concrete.

The altitude is a factor, as is the cold. Players in most snow volleyball events — though not this particular one — close off with a celebratory dip in a hot tub, but before then, the lower oxygen can tire even the best players.

It’s because of these inescapable factors — plus unpredictable ones, like the high winds savaging the Olympic Village at the same time the volleyball beats were dropping — that organizers from the FIVB and the CEV were preaching baby steps rather than big-picture dreams, “innovation” and “possibility” rather than expectation.

“What we do believe is that snow volleyball is great, it’s about engagement,” Azevedo said. “We want people to be playing volleyball. The future, who knows?”

The earliest snow volleyball could realistically make the Olympic slate would be 2026, following a stint as a demonstration sport in the 2022 Games in Beijing. But even that is no sure thing; the IOC historically has sought to keep sports confined to one season. (An attempt to bring cross-country running to the Winter Games in 2008, for instance, went nowhere.) Snow volleyball does have both a strong organizing federation and a ready availability of Olympic-level players, but even those might not be enough to get snow volleyball onto the Olympic slate.

In the short term, snow volleyball’s backers are focusing on smaller steps: a European Tour kicked off in 2015, and European championships will take place later this year. FIVB hopes to start a world tour in 2019, to be followed by world championships in 2020. Beyond that, well … we’ll see.President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke about the mass shooting that took place at a Parkland, Florida, high school the day before, claiming he will tackle “the difficult issue of mental health” in the wake of the massacre.

“No child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning,” the president said. “Each person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them. A life filled with wonders, beauty and unlimited potential and promise.”

Trump didn’t use the word “gun” once during his remarks and did not suggest he’d take up the issue of gun control.

It was Trump’s first public remarks about the shooting that left at least 17 people dead. Earlier Thursday, Trump ordered flags be flown at half-staff until Feb. 19 in honor of the shooting victims.

Trump tweeted about the shooting Wednesday, offering “prayers and condolences.” He tweeted again Thursday morning, saying the shooter “was mentally disturbed” and that “such instances” should be reported “again and again.”Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon arrives at a closed-door meeting with the House Intelligence Committee February 15, 2018 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.

WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Former White House adviser Steve Bannon met with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators for two days this week, even as he frustrated lawmakers by refusing to answer many questions posed by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former strategist and a key player in Trump’s 2016 election campaign, would answer only 25 questions approved by the White House.

Schiff called for the initiation of contempt of Congress proceedings against Bannon. Bannon had refused to answer many questions during his first appearance before the intelligence panel on Jan. 16, and has been negotiating with members about a return ever since.

Declining to discuss the weeks after the November 2016 presidential election and before Trump’s inauguration, or his own time at the White House, Bannon claimed executive privilege and special protections for presidential communications in refusing to say more, the two lawmakers said.

“He did not answer all the questions we’d like answered, so there was frustration among committee members with respect to that,” said Conaway, who has been overseeing the committee’s investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election.

U.S. intelligence agencies determined more than a year ago that Moscow sought to interfere in the campaign.

Russia has denied trying to meddle in the election. Trump, a Republican, has denied collusion between his associates and Moscow. Mueller has been conducting a criminal investigation of possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election.

“There was a refusal to answer any questions that would have brought out the full facts. That is not how privilege works. That’s how stonewalling works,” Schiff told reporters.

Schiff said Bannon’s 25 approved questions were written to mislead the committee. For example, they included a question about whether Bannon had met with a certain person, and Bannon answered no. But when Bannon was asked if he had spoken to the same person, he would answer yes, Schiff said.

Bannon’s attorney and White House aides did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Conaway, asked whether he would back a contempt proceeding, said the decision was not his to make. He said attorneys would have to consider the claims of privilege, and there would have to be discussions with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and other officials.

“I think he (Bannon) should answer our questions,” he told reporters.

Trump fired Bannon, the former head of the hard-right Breitbart News website, from his White House position in August. Bannon had been a close Trump associate since he joined the Trump campaign and helped the political novice defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

Separately, three sources familiar with the proceedings said Bannon was interviewed over two days this week by Mueller’s team, which had subpoenaed him to appear before a grand jury before he agreed to be interviewed.

Bannon met with the investigators for a total of about 20 hours.

Reuters reported last week that Bannon was expected to meet with Mueller this week.Amy Schumer married chef Chris Fischer earlier this week. Mario Anzuoni / Reuters

The winner will also be allowed to pose for a photograph with POTUS. Although it’s unclear exactly where the event will be held, Trump will be in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, for a campaign-style rally that day.

Unsurprisingly, the “sweepstakes” received a chilly reception online:

Reuters Staff / Reuters

Olympian-turned-NBC analyst Bode Miller caused controversy at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Thursday with his suggestion that Austrian skier Anna Veith’s performance at the games had been hurt by marriage.

Miller, who had been discussing Veith’s slow start in the ladies’ giant slalom event, later claimed his comment was “an ill-advised attempt at a joke.”

“The knee is certainly an issue,” said Miller, in reference to the anterior cruciate ligament injury that Veith, who won gold in the women’s super-G event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, sustained in 2016.

But Miller, a former alpine skier, then took a dumb turn:

“I want to point out she also got married. And it’s historically very challenging to race on the World Cup with a family or after being married. Not to blame the spouses, but I just want to toss that out there that it may be her husband’s fault.”

Five-time Olympian Miller later apologized on air for what he called his “ill-advised attempt at a joke” meant to highlight “how beneficial” marriage could be for an athlete.

“I know the support team you need. I relied on my friends and family. And if you have the luxury of relying on a spouse, I know they are inevitably your biggest supporter,” said Miller, per NBC.

“And on Valentine’s Day I didn’t mean to throw spouses under the bus,” he added. “Certainly, I’m going to be hearing it from my wife, I know.”

Miller later used Twitter in a bid to further clarify:

Damir Sagolj / Reuters

American figure skater Alexa Scimeca-Knierim broke down in tears following her routine at the Winter Olympics final in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday, saying she and husband Chris Knierim skated for the victims of the Florida school shooting earlier in the day.

The couple, the only U.S. team among the 16 finalists in the pairs figure skating free skate competition, took to the ice mere hours after 17 children and staff were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, about 15 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale.

“We wanted to skate for the 17 children that died in the Florida shooting. And today was much more than about us,” Scimeca-Knierim said in an interview following her performance, Time reported.

“We are so privileged and lucky to be doing what we are doing, and it’s so sad that 17 people died in the United States. I told Chris today he’d need to be so much stronger than me.”

The pair won bronze medals as part of the U.S. figure skating team event. On Wednesday, the pair scored 185.82 in the pairs competition, placing them toward the bottom of the field.

“I am disappointed with the way we performed today, but so many people at home are hurting because their children have died,” she said, according to The Associated Press.

“I was not focused on it while we were skating, but now that we are done, after we’ve skated, there’s an emotional hurt. I am overwhelmed.”

Scimeca-Knierim also published a tweet about the Florida shooting, sending sympathy to the victims and their families.

May the hearts of those who are mourning the loss of victims in the shooting today be lifted up. You are on my mind and on my heart. God bless you all. — Alexa ScimecaKnierim (@alexa_knierim) February 15, 2018

Her husband later retweeted it on his own Twitter account.

Despite saying they were affected by the sad news from back home, the pair managed to pull off an Olympic first, according to U.S. Figure Skating.

The 34-year-old cross-country skier set himself an amusingly low bar for success during a press conference in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday.

“The first step, finish before they turn the lights off; that’s number one,” the underdog athlete joked in a video that the Agence France-Presse shared online, above.

“Don’t ski into a tree, that’s number two,” added Taufatofua, who captured the world’s attention during Friday’s opening ceremony, where he wore a traditional Tongan ta’ovala waist mat as he marched with his country’s flag. He did the same at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic games, where he competed in the taekwondo event and was knocked out in his first bout.

Taufatofua noted how he’d only had “12 weeks on snow in my whole life” and almost certainly “won’t medal,” before giving an inspirational explanation about why he’d decided to represent his country at the games:

“In four years, someone from Tonga might (medal). In eight years, someone from the Pacific might, but more importantly people from the Pacific, these kids who are watching now, they’ll have access to something that they never knew existed before. And to me, that’s why I’m here.”

Taufatofua articulated a similar sentiment earlier this week during an interview on NBC:

“Its not about winning medals for me,” he said. “It’s about inspiring people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, to not fear failure, to fail and then laugh at it and then try again.”

Taufatofua doesn’t make his Winter Olympic debut in the men’s 15km free event until Friday, but his participation at the games is already having a major impact back in his South Pacific homeland, which Cyclone Gita battered earlier this week.

On Tuesday, he revealed that International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach had “offered to help rebuild sporting facilities” in the country.

Taufatofua wrote on Facebook how it was “a dream” to “build an Olympic facility for the children of Tonga to one day have the privilege of being an Olympian and waving that flag.”If the question of whether a robotic-sounding voice is saying the word “Yanny” or “Laurel” has been keeping you up at night, it’s time to breathe a sigh of relief. There is a definitive answer.

The recording is saying the word …

LAUREL!!!

Sorry, Team Yanny, but multiple news outlets have confirmed that the infamous audio clip comes from Vocabulary.com, where it serves as the pronunciation feature for the word “laurel,” defined as “a wreath worn on the head, usually as a symbol of victory.”

Vocabulary.com does not have an entry for the word “Yanny,” but HuffPost can confirm that, spelled a little differently, the definition is this:

The reason the audio sounds slightly distorted is because it’s a recording of the Vocabulary.com’s recording, according to Buzzfeed.

Reddit user RolandCamry posted a short video clip including the audio on the subreddit r/blackmagicfuckery this week. The clip was actually a video of an Instagram poll asking users to vote on which word they heard. It went mega-viral after popular YouTuber Cloe Feldman tweeted it on Monday — sparking the greatest debate of the past three years, right after The Dress debacle of 2015.

What do you hear?! Yanny or Laurel pic.twitter.com/jvHhCbMc8I — Cloe Feldman (@CloeCouture) May 15, 2018

Feldman admitted that she found the clip on Reddit. The person who posted it on Reddit turned out to be Roland Szabo, an 18-year-old high school student in Lawrenceville, Georgia, The New York Times reports.

But the origins of the Instagram poll itself are unclear, with the Times and Wired reporting slightly different stories.

According to the Times, Szabo recorded the voice from the vocabulary site himself and sent it to a friend, who posted it on Instagram.

But according to Wired, a student at Georgia’s Flowery Branch High School named Katie Hetzel recorded the voice from the vocabulary site, and posted the clip on Instagram. Her friend, Fernando Castro, then says he turned it into an Instagram poll. According to Wired, Castro’s poll is what Reddit user RolandCamry posted earlier this week.

Regardless of whose recording actually went viral, Wired did track down some interesting tidbits about the voice that helped ignite the Yanny vs. Laurel debate.

Vocabulary.com cofounder Marc Tinkler told the site that the man who recorded the pronunciation of “Laurel” is an opera singer who was a member of the original cast of “CATS” on Broadway. Tinkler did not reveal the opera singer’s name, saying he didn’t know if the man would welcome viral fame.

Oh, and in case you were wondering ― the real-life Yanni definitely did not hear “Laurel.”Radio personality Patrick Connor is out of a job after he called Winter Olympics gold medalist Chloe Kim a “little hot piece of ass.”

Connor made the comment on Barstool Radio’s Sirius XM channel, but it was another of his employers, San Francisco radio station KNBR, that fired him Wednesday, news outlets reported. Connor hosted “The Shower Hour” at that station.

KNBR program director Jeremiah Crowe confirmed the parting to the San Jose Mercury News without elaborating.

Connor reportedly remained employed by Barstool.

Former Major League Baseball pitcher Dallas Braden, host of the new Sirius XM “Dialed-In” show on which Connor made his crass remarks Tuesday, said Barstool understands the “severity and the seriousness of the comments made ... and that’s not who we are,” according to USA Today.

Connor apologized on Twitter, calling his words “lame and gross.”

While the world celebrated 17-year-old Kim’s spectacular victory in the women’s halfpipe, Connor said in audio captured by Deadspin: “She’s fine as hell! If she was 18, you wouldn’t be ashamed to say that she’s a little hot piece of ass. And she is. She is adorable. I’m a huge Chloe Kim fan.”Eric Radford and Meagan Duhamel compete in the pair skating free skating. XIN LI via Getty Images

Canadian figure-skating duo Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford went out in style at the Winter Olympics on Thursday.

The two cleanly landed the first throw quad salchow in Olympic history during the pairs free skate figure skating, NBC Sports reported.

The difficult maneuver enabled the two-time world champions to earn bronze as they presumably finished their Olympic careers.

Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany took gold with a record 159.31 points in the pairs free skate, and Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China won silver.

Duhamel and Radford previously helped Canada win gold in the team event and took silver as part of the team competition at the Sochi Games.Things are heating up for Jamaica’s women bobsledders at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

The team’s German coach, former Olympic champion Sandra Kiriasis, has quit, just days before athletes Carrie Russell and Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian were due to compete in the women’s bobsleigh event.

Kiriasis is now threatening to take the team’s bobsled that she rented for the games, reports the BBC. The sled threat may jeopardize Russell and Fenlator-Victorian’s shot at becoming the Caribbean island’s first Olympic female bobsledders.

Kiriasis resigned Wednesday after the Jamaica Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation told her “out of the blue” that it had changed her position from driver coach to track and performance analyst, she wrote on Facebook.

“(I) would have to leave the Olympic village, would lose my accreditation as part of the Jamaican team and was not supposed to have any more contact with the athletes,” she said.

Kiriasis, 43, said she’d “supported the team far beyond the call of duty at all times” by securing sponsorship, equipment and the rented bobsled ― but she could not “accept to be treated the way I have been treated.”

“I still do not know the reasons behind the decision of Jamaican Bobsleigh Federation and certainly will not allow to be used as the puppet on a string by the federation which have also saved a lot of money due to my commitment and contacts,” she added.

The Jamaica Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation initially thanked Kiriasis on Twitter “for her invaluable contribution” to the team:

But the federation’s president, Christian Stokes, later escalated tensions by describing Kiriasis as “a destructive force on the team.”

“Now that she is off the team synergy is much better, tension is down and athletes are now able to focus in a much healthier environment,” Stokes told Reuters. “If you come on the team you have to be a team player. There are no gods and goddesses here,” he added.

Training for the women’s bobsleigh event in South Korea begins Saturday. The opening heats begin on Tuesday.

Team coach Dudley “Tal” Stokes — a member of Jamaica’s famous men’s bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, which inspired the hit movie “Cool Runnings” ― insisted that Fenlator-Victorian and Russell would still compete in Pyeongchang.

“For sure we’re going to be at the top of the hill for the start of the race and we’re going to have a good performance,” Stokes told Omnisport.

“What I can say is that we don’t expect there to be any changes in equipment going into the games,” Stokes added. “In the unlikely event that we do have a problem what I can guarantee is that on race day we’re going to be at the start with very competitive equipment and those girls will be ready to go.”You have got to be kidding. It WAS reported again and again. Don't preach to the damn choir Donald when your own glass house is shattering around you. You are such a hypocrite. The NRA and Putin are controlling your every move. You can't be President when you are compromised.For Gus Kenworthy, being one of the first openly gay men to compete for the U.S. in the Winter Olympics is “a bit of a trade-off.”

The freeskier opened up about his role off the slopes in a Thursday interview with “CBS This Morning,” and said growing up in the closet made him “realize the need and the importance of” having openly LGBTQ athletes in sports.

“When I was a kid, I definitely think that my life would’ve been easier if I had someone that was in my position, that was out and gay and proud and successful in their sport,” he said. “So I want to be that person. I want to be able to be a beacon of light for young kids in sports.”

Kenworthy will compete with the U.S. slopestyle skiing team on Saturday. Along with figure skater Adam Rippon, he has sparked controversy for speaking out against President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in recent weeks. But he isn’t backing down, and he won’t be visiting the White House after his time at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is done.

“When we have people elected into office that believe in conversion therapy and are trying to strip trans rights in the military and do these things that are directly attacking the LGBT community, I have no patience,” Kenworthy said. “I am so proud to be from the U.S. and to be from a country where you are able to voice your political opinions and stand up for what you believe in.”Preparing for the Olympics is tough enough as it is. But performing your routine and having the perfect Valentine’s Day gift to follow it up?

It was no problem for Chris Knierim and Alexa Scimeca Knierim, U.S figure skating pair and husband and wife. Following the couple’s short program routine, Chris had a huge teddy bear and a “Will you (still) be mine?” heart ready as the couple met with the media.

It’s been a busy and emotional Olympic Games for the couple, who started skating together in 2012 and got married in 2016. Chris and Alexa wound up as alternates for the 2014 Sochi games after Chris broke his tibia during the preceding season. Still, they were able to respond with a national championship in 2015. But in 2016, tragedy struck again when Alexa suffered from a rare and life-threatening gastrointestinal condition. She needed several surgeries and dropped to 80 pounds.

Luckily, these Olympics are proving the story ultimately has taken a very happy turn. After winning another national title in January 2018, the couple helped the United States earn the bronze medal in the team skate Monday and got to skate together on Valentine’s Day as part of the figure skating pairs competition.

There’s love on the ice in PyeongChang, and giant teddy bears as well.

Our sports heroes are supposed to be a certain kind of person, act a certain way, fit a certain mold.

The women are ordered to wear pretty skirts, with laces if you can. Hair should be of ample length, none of that short “butch” stuff. Carry yourself like a lady whenever and wherever possible.

Oh, and be straight.

The men have their own instructions. Build ample musculature. Keep your hair clean-cut, but nothing too fancy. Men aren’t fancy. Speak with a deep voice, talk about family a lot, and pick a couple masculine interests — may we suggest beer and your love of sports — as go-to talking points.

Oh, and be straight.

So when an athlete like Adam Rippon comes along, breaking every single rule dictating how American athletes become American heroes, a caution flag gets waved. The TV networks pull back. Corporations shy away. Children must be protected, the very image of what it is to be a man in America suddenly at risk.

Except... not this time.

This time, NBC is talking about how Rippon “slays.”

This time, Sesame Street celebrated his accomplishments with an Elmo dance.

This time, marketing departments in corporate America are scrambling to figure out how to connect themselves to the gay kid.

This time, straight guys are talking about how they love Adam Rippon.

This time... is different.

This all quite nearly happened once before. In 2010, Johnny Weir was a Rippon-style quote machine... or should I say he was just typical Johnny Weir. Everything American audiences are seeing now in his figure skating commentary and his outlandish outfits for NBC... he was in 2010.

He even gave a performance in the individual free skate that, we wrote at the time, “brought the crowd to its feet.”

Just as many felt about Rippon’s performance in the team event Sunday night, Weir was equally “robbed” of better numbers by a scoring system that mandates bigger jumps, less fancy. A scoring system that mandates its figure skaters be masculine not feminine, athletes not artists... straight not gay.

Despite the list of similarities, Rippon has hit a nerve with American audiences in a way Weir never did, in large part because those American audiences have, forever, changed.

From the perspective of 2010, it’s hard to recognize American culture as it relates to the LGBT community today. Just eight years ago opposing same-sex marriage was standard operating procedure for your run-of-the-mill Democrat; Now it’s bigotry. Wrapping a TV show around a big, black drag queen was ghettoized to “gay TV”; Now it’s ratings gold.

The most glittery, gay athlete at the Winter Olympics is, after just a few days, our national hero.

To be sure, we are all still Americans in one respect: We want a winner. Rippon could be as outlandish, as over-the-top, as witty as his mind could spin. But if he didn’t perform athletically, if he didn’t bring home a medal, he’d be long forgotten already a few days after his debut Olympic.

Instead, on day three of the figure skating competition, this slim young man in the most sequined outfit any one costume designer could muster, he gave an emotional performance that was felt from Pittsburgh to Pyeongchang. Hours later there he was, snapping pics with a medal around his neck, Olympic-hero status firmly secured.

It’s so important for gay youth to see someone like Rippon being his authentic gay self. We’ve seen a bit of it before, from the likes of the aforementioned Weir and Ru.

Yet no one has put it all together into quite the perfect package as has Rippon.

The kicker is all of this is the importance to that gay youth of seeing the reaction to him. Entertainers, athletes and politicians have lauded him. Their friends and family are celebrating him. Dads are talking glowingly about that Olympic hero in that shiny outfit. The reaction — to Rippon’s emotional performance and his big personality — gives that young kid permission to let his big personality out too.

The next couple of nights will be telling. Rippon isn’t favored to win a medal, largely because of the current (I’d say flawed) scoring system.

Yet no one can ever take away the medal he’s already won. He will forever be an American Olympic medalist. His legacy, and America’s love affair with Adam Rippon, isn’t going anywhere.

If he is able to win an individual medal this week, the Internet, and our perception of the great American hero, will break forever.EuroPride 2018 organizers aim to give a literal voice to transgender people all over the world with a stunning radio and video campaign.

The “Voice of Change” ad follows a transgender person’s transition from female to male through the sound of his voice. The ad’s creators invited Alex, who identifies as trans, into the studio each time he received a shot of testosterone. The finished recording is a powerful, step-by-step documentation of Alex’s gender affirmation process.

“What you’re listening to right now is illegal in many countries,” he says in the clip, which can be viewed above. “Some people are born with the right to be who they are. Others, like me, have to fight for it. Let’s change that.”

2018 marks the first year that EuroPride will be jointly hosted in two cities ― Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden. Organizers from Stockholm Pride and West Pride pointed to a 2017 National Geographic study, which found that 67 countries had no legal provisions in place for changing gender, as the impetus for the new campaign.

“One of our most important responsibilities as Pride festivals is to put focus on the injustices and oppression that LGBTIQ+ persons still suffer in other countries and here at home,” West Pride President Tasso Stafilidis told HuffPost in an email. “By arranging EuroPride we can aim a spotlight on life-critical issues, like transgender people’s living situations, shape public opinion and make demands for change and respect.”WASHINGTON ― The Senate was supposed to spend the week discovering what it could pass to help undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

They got the results on Thursday: For now, at least, it’s nothing.

Multiple proposals fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate during a series of votes on Thursday afternoon.

President Donald Trump’s desired legislation received the fewest votes of all immigration measures considered by the Senate, going down by a margin of 39-60. Another Republican measure on so-called “sanctuary cities” failed by a vote of 54-45. And both bipartisan proposals failed by similar margins, one of them after a veto threat and an hours-long attack from the White House and Department of Homeland Security on both the amendment and its backers.

Now lawmakers will have to go back to the drawing board to find a way to help undocumented young people often called Dreamers, 700,000 of whom risk losing deportation relief because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. And they will have to do it with the knowledge that Trump isn’t willing to compromise to get Democratic support ― something that could doom the entire effort.

Or maybe it already has. Before the vote on Trump’s proposal, its lead backer told Democrats that if they want to help Dreamers, “this is it.”

“This is your last chance to vote for a path to citizenship for all of the people that we have been talking about giving justice to and being compassionate about and bringing out of the dark,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said on the Senate floor.

It’s unclear what’s next. Senate Republican leaders previously indicated they wanted DACA-related measures done this week. The “deadline” set by Trump when he rescinded the bill was March 5, at which point DACA recipients will begin to lose their protections in greater numbers.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Wednesday that he wants to resolve the issue sometime in March, and that Congress has slightly more time due to court rulings that temporarily opened the program for renewal applications. The House GOP leadership is counting votes on a bill led by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) that offers only temporary status to DACA recipients, along with other elements of Trump’s framework and many interior immigration enforcement measures beyond what the president asked for. Trump supports that plan as well, but it’s unlikely to have the 218 votes needed for passage.

The Senate might be able to add DACA-related plans to the omnibus spending bill, possibly a stopgap measure without a path to citizenship, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters after the vote. But he downplayed the idea of devoting considerable floor time to the issue in the near future.

The way the Senate debate shook out this week ― or didn’t ― isn’t a hopeful sign for the future. Trump backed a proposal that his allies repeatedly framed as a “generous” compromise and essentially told Democrats it was that or nothing.

Republican leaders seemed perfectly willing to go along, repeatedly saying that Congress needs to pass something the president supports. There’s logic to the statement, but it glosses over another element of making law: They need to find legislation that Congress can pass, too. Trump and White House officials balked at any bipartisan proposals lawmakers presented.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blasted Democrats after the vote for not supporting Trump’s framework, and even accused them of not reaching across the aisle ― even though they’d made up a large proportion of the votes for bipartisan measures.

“Once again, when the hour came to actually make law instead of just making political points, our friends across the aisle were either unable or unwilling to get something done,” McConnell said on the Senate floor after the votes. “After all the talk, all the talk, they hardly came to the table at all.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Trump to accept that his plan had failed and allow lawmakers to find a compromise.

“This vote is proof that President Trump’s plan will never become law,” he said in a statement after the votes. “If he would stop torpedoing bipartisan efforts, a good bill would pass.”

The White House and administration took pains to attack the bipartisan proposal from Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Angus King (I-Maine) with members of the so-called “Common Sense Coalition.” Within hours of its release Wednesday evening, the Department of Homeland Security put out a statement blasting the proposal as “the end of immigration enforcement in America.” Later, the White House issued a veto threat. And then officials convened a call with reporters to bash it some more, speculating that some of its sponsors might have signed on without actually reading it.

The amendment ultimately fell short with a 54-45 vote ― earning more support than the president’s plan.

White House and DHS officials said bipartisan measures did not wholly live up to Trump’s framework. The president said he would approve a bill to grant a path to citizenship to up to 1.8 million Dreamers, both DACA recipients and people eligible for the program. But only if he gets a slew of other measures, too: border funding; changes to asylum law; the ability to indefinitely detain and deport immigrants, including children; ending the diversity visa lottery; and dramatically reducing family-based immigration pathways.

The White House and Republicans allies say this is a “generous” concession because Trump, who has spent months saying he wants to help Dreamers, is supporting a bill to do so, and for a broader population than just DACA recipients.

Democrats have said they’re not willing to make certain compromises, although many have reluctantly said they would approve funding for a border wall and would make certain legal immigration changes. Immigrant rights activists, including many Dreamers themselves, have urged lawmakers to oppose legislation that would help undocumented young people while harming other immigrants.

That leaves Dreamers waiting and uncertain what their future will hold. If Congress does nothing, DACA recipients will continue to lose status each day, even though they are able to apply for renewal for now under temporary court orders. And when they do, they will lose their work permits and be at risk of deportation, because the Trump administration has argued it should detain anyone eligible for removal even if they’re not considered a priority.

“Their falling out of status would not trigger them into being an enforcement priority,” a White House official who declined to speak on the record told reporters on Thursday. “Of course, all of the laws of the United States are always enforced by DHS with individuals whom they encounter.”Hip-hop artist French Montana wants to help young undocumented immigrants achieve their college dreams.

The 33-year-old star joined forces with MTV and Get Schooled, a nonprofit focused on improving high school graduation rates and boosting college attendance, to launch “We Are The Dream.” The campaign seeks to help young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, go to college.

Rolling Stone broke the news of the initiative on Thursday.

“I am one of tens of thousands of first and second generation immigrants that are having a significant positive impact on the United States,” the Moroccan-American rapper said in a press release. “I am excited to lead others in this fight to ensure Dreamers connect with support they need to get to college and make their American Dream come true.”

The campaign will leverage social media and its WeAreTheDream.us digital hub to help undocumented students find resources and support. The website will include personal stories, information on scholarships, and the names of sanctuary colleges. Dreamers can text “we are the dream” to 33-55-77 with questions that trained counselors will answer and keep confidential.

Montana will lead the social media campaign, asking people to post selfies with the hashtag #WeAreTheDream to share stories, spread awareness and express solidarity with Dreamers. Get Schooled will hold a Twitter chat on Feb. 21 with experts, and will award grants (up to $1,000) to schools, colleges, and community-based organizations looking to support undocumented students’ access to higher education.

In a video for the campaign, Montana explains that he was born in Casablanca, Morocco, and emigrated the United States at age 13. “I was given the opportunity, I was given the chance, I was given a dream,” he said, adding that he wants to give undocumented immigrants the same resources.

Dreamers have been in a particularly precarious situation since President Donald Trump announced in September that he would rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. His decision will leave nearly 700,000 DACA recipients at risk of deportation.
