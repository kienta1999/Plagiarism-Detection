WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s effort to spotlight the nation’s crumbling infrastructure system went off the rails again this week due to a mix of self-inflicted errors and unforeseen events.

The rollout of Trump’s long-awaited infrastructure plan on Monday was quickly overshadowed by furor over spousal abuse allegations that forced the resignation of a senior White House aide, the president’s days-long silence on the issue of domestic violence, an admission by Trump’s longtime lawyer to paying $130,000 to a porn star, and another horrific mass shooting at a high school in Florida ― the 18th school shooting since the start of the year.

Trump’s self-proclaimed “Infrastructure week” had become a running joke in Washington, even before it was upended. Since Trump took office, administration officials promised over and over that they would deliver a plan to upgrade the nation’s roads, bridges, and waterways, but none materialized.

Trump’s first “infrastructure week” in June highlighted the need for air-traffic control privatization. But it was quickly eclipsed by former FBI Director James Comey’s blockbuster testimony on Capitol Hill and the president’s criticisms of his own Justice Department. The administration’s second “infrastructure week” in August focusing on reforms to the federal permitting process also failed to leave a mark after the president defended white nationalists protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trump on Monday released details of his infrastructure proposal ― which seeks to leverage $200 billion in direct federal spending over the next decade into an additional $1.3 trillion for infrastructure development with the aid of state and local tax dollars as well as private investment. The announcement was paired with a bipartisan group of mayors meeting with the president at the White House.

But the conversation in the press briefing room quickly shifted to the administration’s rapidly changing story on Rob Porter, who was the president’s staff secretary before resigning over accusations of domestic abuse by two ex-wives. White House press aides’ responses to questions about the Porter case ― including what White House Chief of Staff John Kelly knew and when ― dominated attention in what was supposed to be a time to discuss repairing the nation’s roads, bridges, and waterways.

Trump himself fed the feeding frenzy at the White House by ignoring questions on whether he stood with victims of domestic violence at several events on infrastructure and trade. His transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, even made an appearance in the White House briefing room to accept a check on behalf of her agency from the president that contained his fourth-quarter salary, but that, too, failed to keep the focus infrastructure.

Administration officials were thrown another curveball when Trump’s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that he paid an adult film star known as Stormy Daniels $130,000 out of his own pocket a month before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, supposedly revealed that she had an affair with Trump in a previously unpublished 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly ― an affair the White House has denied.

Clifford’s manager said Wednesday that she believes the porn actress is now free to discuss her encounter with Trump because Cohen breached the non-disclosure agreement by publicly discussing the payment. The admission would have rocked any previous presidential administration, but somehow it didn’t even manage to rank as the top news item of the week. But it wasn’t until Wednesday afternoon, when a teenager opened fire in a South Florida high school, killing at least 17 people and injuring 15 others, that the administration lost all hope of effectively messaging their infrastructure proposal. The White House on Thursday was forced to cancel Trump’s previously scheduled trip to Orlando, Florida, the following day, where he was supposed to pitch the infrastructure plan to the public, but not before the president himself bungled his response to the shooting by laying some blame on the gunman’s classmates.The National Rifle Association spent tens of millions of dollars helping to elect Donald Trump.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s newly unveiled budget would cut millions of dollars from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which gun dealers use to verify if someone is banned from buying a gun before selling it to them.

Buried on Page 719 of his fiscal year 2019 budget, released Monday, the president calls for cuts to the National Criminal Records History Improvement Program and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program. Both provide federal grants to states to help them improve their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database for background checks, including domestic violence records.

The two programs are currently budgeted at $73 million. Trump’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.

Trumps FY19 budget

(Why do the numbers in the infographic jump around so much from 2017 to 2019? A House Appropriations Committee staffer said it’s unclear, but notes the 2017 figure reflects what the Justice Department actually spent while the 2018 and 2019 figures reflect what Trump requested.)

Gun control advocates say these federal grants have been “critical funding sources” for states trying to routinely submit comprehensive records to the national background check database.

“President Trump claims that he wants to build ‘a safe, strong, and proud America’ but his actions do not live up to his words,” said Robin Lloyd of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011.

“Instead of strengthening the nation’s background check system to make sure it effectively keeps guns out of dangerous hands, he slashed funding to this critically important system, which will significantly undermine its effectiveness,” Lloyd said.

There are about 30 million reasons why Trump would want to weaken gun safety measures. That’s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.

The president’s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump’s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.

Trump’s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.

Mass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country ― and so is Congress’ inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018. Republican leaders in Congress routinely offer “thoughts and prayers” in response to each shooting but don’t follow up with any policy changes aimed at stemming gun violence.

Another mass shooting took place as this article was being written Wednesday. This one was at a high school in Parkland, Florida. At least 17 people died and many others were injured.A story from satire site The Onion that gets passed around after every mass shooting hit a little too close to home following Wednesday’s killing spree at a Florida high school.

The story, which was updated to include details of the latest shooting but was otherwise the same, featured the viral headline:

‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens

Former Onion senior writer Jason Roeder, who wrote the headline, said on Twitter that the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, actually occurred near his own home:

Bess Kalb, a writer for “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” is responding to each lawmaker tweeting condolences over the murders by listing how much they’ve taken from the National Rifle Association, which has consistently fought any move to tighten gun control laws.

Here are some of those tweets and Kalb’s replies:

Before she started replying to tweets she also shared a few other choice words about lawmakers collecting cash from the gun lobby:Shaun King, a prominent black rights activist and writer, announced Thursday that he is co-founding a political action committee to help elect “reform-minded prosecutors” at the county and city levels.

The Real Justice PAC plans to spend upward of $1 million to support campaigns by progressives running for district attorney offices this year.

The efforts should benefit from King’s enormous social media following, as well as the expertise of several veterans of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign who are the group’s other co-founders.

King views the initiative as an essential new stage in anti-racism and criminal justice reform movements in the era of President Donald Trump.

“No position in America, no single individual has a bigger impact on the criminal justice system ― including police brutality, but the whole crisis of mass incarceration in general ― than your local district attorney,” King said. “They are the gatekeepers of America’s justice system.”

The PAC hopes to eventually also focus on electing sheriffs and judges who, among other things, would support reducing the number of people imprisoned for nonviolent offenses.

The questionnaire the PAC distributes to candidates it may endorse will ask where they stand on issues such the practice of cash bail, which often deprives low-income suspects of their freedom; the use of diversion programs for drug-related crimes; and the pursuit of the death penalty, which progressives oppose.

The group also will gauge how a district attorney candidate’s track record on various criminal justice issues compares with that of the current officeholder.

“That’s a smarter way and a safer way for us to make an assessment,” King said. “Many people are running under the guise of being Democrats in these DA races and that has next to no value.”

Another priority for the PAC is electing more women and people of color to prosecutorial posts.

The country’s 2,400 district attorneys are notoriously non-diverse. As of 2015, 95 percent of them were white, 83 percent were men, and just 1 percent were women of color.

King likened the complexion and maleness of the group to the population at “any golf course in America.”

“I’m not saying white is evil and black is righteous,” said King, acknowledging there are examples of draconian black prosecutors and compassionate white prosecutors. “But it’s troubling when a system that primarily targets people of color has almost exclusively white men, and conservative white men at that, at the helm.”

“If we can activate exciting new candidates who stand for reform, we can make changes from coast to coast.” - Shaun King

The addition of King marks something of a reboot for the PAC, which existed in a more modest form in 2017. Becky Bond, who masterminded the Sanders campaign’s digital organizing operation, conceived of the group as a way to apply the “big organizing” technique she honed in 2016 to prosecutorial elections that ordinarily receive little national attention.

Last year, Bond’s group helped elect Larry Krasner as district attorney of Philadelphia, and re-elect Stephanie Morales as the commonwealth’s attorney for Portsmouth, Virginia.

In its reconstituted form, the PAC has already endorsed its first two candidates, both of whom are challenging incumbent district attorneys in Texas’ March 6 Democratic primary. Elizabeth Frizell, a state district judge, is running to unseat Faith Johnson in Dallas County. Joe Gonzales, a defense attorney, is hoping to replace Nico Lahood in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio.

District attorney races remain an untapped opportunity for progressive activists to leverage relatively modest resources for major policy wins, according to King.

That’s because the lack of awareness of the office’s power, even in some of the most progressive parts of the country, had allowed deeply conservative or otherwise problematic DAs to serve for decades. For example, in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance Jr. ran uncontested for a third term as DA in the Democratic primary in September. When it later emerged that Vance had declined to pursue possible criminal cases against film mogul Harvey Weinstein and Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., it was too late for another candidate to appear on the ballot for the general election.

Even a minor uptick in turnout for DA races could produce significant results, King maintained.

“If we can activate exciting new candidates who stand for reform, we can make changes from coast to coast,” he said.

The launch of the PAC occurs at a unique moment in the evolution of both the contemporary black civil rights movement and the national discussion about criminal justice reform.

The new black rights movement grew organically in recent years in response to controversial police killings of black men and women, the vast majority of whom were unarmed.

The July 2014 death of Eric Garner on Staten Island after police put a chokehold on him was King’s wake-up call. The killing, which resulted in no indictments despite video footage of the cops ignoring Garner’s pleas for his life, ultimately inspired King to leave his job at an environmental organization in Los Angeles and devote himself full time to combating police brutality and racial bias in the criminal justice system.

The movement for black lives has suffered a number of other frustrating setbacks, including the acquittal of, or failure to prosecute, police officers involved in the killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; and Minneapolis.

Meanwhile, the election of Trump and his appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general have dashed hopes for bipartisan federal legislation to liberalize sentencing and decriminalize drug use. Sessions’ Department of Justice has also signaled that it will be providing less oversight of local policing practices.

For King, that makes it the perfect moment for activists who engaged in street protests and acts of civil disobedience to put at least a portion of their energy into the so-called inside game of helping elect progressive politicians.An upcoming “Star Wars” standalone movie will reportedly focus on one of the franchise’s most popular villains: Boba Fett.

James Mangold, director and co-writer of “Logan,” will direct the yet-untitled film for Disney, The Hollywood Reporter noted. He will co-write it with Simon Kinberg, the screenwriter behind several “X-Men” films. Kinberg, who was a producer on “Logan,” will also be a producer of the Boba Fett film.

Disney has not yet confirmed the report and there is no information on release dates, cast or when in the “Star Wars” timeline the film will take place. A movie based on Boba Fett has been in development on and off for a number of years, with several names reportedly attached to it, including “Chronicle” director Josh Trank.

The bounty hunter played a small but key role in the original trilogy, helping Darth Vader track down the protagonists in Cloud City in “The Empire Strikes Back.” There, Han Solo was frozen in carbonite for Boba Fett to deliver to Jabba the Hutt.

Boba Fett is (apparently) killed early in “Return of the Jedi,” but his distinctive armor made him a fan favorite despite his limited screen time. The character’s backstory was touched on in “Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones” as well as “The Clone Wars” animated series. Boba Fett has been featured in various “Star Wars” books and comics, much of which is no longer considered canon.

The Hollywood Reporter also reported that a long-rumored film about Obi-Wan Kenobi was in development with Stephen Daldry, director of “Billy Elliott,” in talks to direct.

Disney is rapidly creating a new canon.Workers inspect a Sichuan Airlines aircraft that made an emergency landing after a windshield on the cockpit broke off, at an airport in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China on May 14, 2018. China Stringer Network / Reuters

A Sichuan Airlines pilot has been hailed a hero for landing an airliner safely on Monday after a windshield broke mid-flight and his co-pilot was sucked halfway out of the cockpit.

The captain, Liu Chuanjian, told reporters there was “no warning sign” before the front right windshield of the Airbus A319 suddenly “cracked and made a loud bang.”

“The next thing I know, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window,” Liu said, according to Reuters. “Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned ... and I couldn’t hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.”

The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back into the plane, reported Reuters. He suffered scratches and a sprained wrist. Chinese aviation officials said one other flight crew member was injured.

Sichuan Airlines flight 3U8633 was reportedly about 30 minutes into its journey from the Chinese city of Chongqing to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa at the time. The aircraft was about 32,000 feet in the air.

Passengers described a loud bang, and said they felt the plane go into free fall for a few seconds before it stabilized. One passenger told Xinhua News Agency the plane felt “like a stone falling from a height.” Video shared on social media showed passengers wearing oxygen masks.

In the cockpit, the broken windshield caused significant damage. The Wall Street Journal reported part of the flight control panel fell off, and the cockpit was exposed to the “freezing, low-pressure atmosphere outside.”

Despite the harrowing circumstances, Liu managed to safely make an emergency landing in Chengdu, a city about 250 miles west of Chongqing. None of the plane’s 119 passengers was reported injured.

Authorities said they were investigating the cause of the windshield failure.

Millions of people in China commented on the pilot’s actions on the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo, according to Agence France-Presse, with the most popular post titled “My Hero Captain.”

In April, a Southwest Airlines passenger was killed after an engine explosion caused a cabin window to shatter mid-flight. The passenger, Jennifer Riordan, was partially sucked out of the plane and died of impact trauma.

Another Southwest flight was forced to make an emergency landing in early May because of a cracked window.Here’s the tea. The 10th season of “ RuPaul’s Drag Race ” is underway ― two hours a week , to be exact. (Talk about werking).

Chances are you know someone who’s a die-hard fan, so before you sashay away, take a look below at some of our favorite gifts for your favorite ‘Drag Race’ super fan:As officials continue to investigate 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who is accused of opening fire on his former high school Wednesday afternoon, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than a dozen others, familiar details are already emerging about the weapon police believe was used in the massacre.

Police suspect Cruz was armed with at least one AR-15-style rifle and “countless magazines” in the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

This adds to a disturbing trend. In many of the most deadly mass shootings in the last several years, including the Las Vegas massacre on Oct. 1 and the shooting at a Texas church on Nov. 5, the lone gunmen were armed with assault-style rifles like the one reportedly used at the Florida school.

There’s plenty of debate over what constitutes a mass shooting — as well as what drives those who commit them. But it’s increasingly clear that individuals who want to inflict mass casualties are taking advantage of the widespread availability of weapons of war.

These weapons are meant for use on the battlefield.

Renowned firearms engineer Eugene Stoner developed the first AR-15, or ArmaLite Rifle (hence the “AR”), in the late 1950s, using advances in technology and materials to revolutionize battlefield weaponry. Stoner’s rifle was marketed to national militaries interested in a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range. Colt Manufacturing Co. eventually purchased ArmaLite and convinced the U.S. military to replace the M-14 with its M-16, which employed many of the advances in the AR-15.

Many modern AR-style rifles are modeled off of these rifles and their successors, which have been the standard issue for the U.S. military since the Vietnam War. But there is one key difference: Battle-ready assault rifles have a selector switch that allows automatic fire (a continuous spray of bullets with a single pull of the trigger), or semi-automatic (one shot with each trigger pull). Civilian versions are semi-automatic only.

The AR-15′s influence is apparent on the .223 SIG Sauer MCX rifle reportedly used in the 2016 Pulse nighclub massacre in Orlando, according to Mother Jones.

The SIG Sauer MCX is the assault-style rifle used in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016. SIG SAUER

Here’s how one reviewer described the SIG Sauer MCX:

SIG SAUER developed the MCX rifle for America’s special forces. Their goal: a firearm that’s as quiet as an MP5, as deadly as an AK-47, and more modular than anything ever designed.

The manufacturer touts the same qualities, saying the rifle is designed to be “silenced, light and short.”

These rifles are designed to kill as efficiently as possible.

These weapons are designed to fire off bullets very, very quickly. Some manufacturers boast that an experienced shooter could fire as many as 45 rounds in one minute. Magazines containing fresh ammunition can be swapped out in a matter of seconds.

The specifications of assault-style rifles vary depending on ammunition, but many tests put the muzzle velocity of a standard round from an AR-15 at 3,200 feet per second, making it accurate up to 500 yards ― more than a quarter-mile.

This makes rounds from an AR-15 or other assault-style weapons far more devastating than those fired from small-caliber handguns.

Here’s a video of a 5.56mm caliber round ― the kind used in many assault-style rifles ― being fired into ballistic gel meant to mimic human flesh. You can see how a single shot inflicts massive trauma, regardless of where it hits the target.

And that’s just one round. A standard AR-15 magazine holds 30 rounds. But in most states, the rifles can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines that can hold 60 or even 100 rounds. A gunman in Texas recently managed to fire off 212 rounds from an AR-15 during a standoff with police, though it’s unclear if he used high-capacity magazines. Six people were shot during this exchange, none fatally. If the shooter had chosen a more densely populated target, the outcome could have been much different.

AR-15 and similar weapons also are highly customizable, allowing for the addition of aftermarket sights, grips, suppressors and other accessories that make them more effective and easier to wield in combat situations.

Assault-style rifles are relatively cheap and easy to buy.

The average price of an assault-style rifle fluctuates somewhat with supply and demand. Online distributors currently offer versions for under $200, though the average price appears to be around $1,000. A SIG Sauer MCX like that used by the Orlando gunman retails for about $1,700.

In most states, anyone legally allowed to possess a handgun can also purchase an AR-15 or other assault-style rifle, with no further requirements. In Florida, for example, there is no waiting period for would-be buyers of rifles or other long guns.

Not even people on the terrorist watch list are barred from purchasing assault-style rifles. An attempt to close that loophole was voted down by Senate Republicans in 2015, and was blocked again shortly after the Orlando shooting the folllowing year.

These guns are already everywhere.

There are estimated to be millions of assault-style rifles already in civilian hands, according to recent manufacturer reports, with dozens of companies offering versions. Most of these weapons will never be used in crimes. But the threat is nonetheless present.

A suspect arrested in 2016 in Los Angeles had three of AR-15 rifles in his car, along with bags of ammo and explosive materials. He reportedly told police he was on his way to the city’s gay pride parade.

And it’s not just a matter of AR-15s and their higher-tech variants. Hundreds of thousands of new assault-style rifles flood the market each year. This includes high-powered weaponry like the AK-style rifles used in 2015 by the Planned Parenthood shooter in Colorado Springs, or the gunman who attacked a military recruitment center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Some states ban assault weapons, but manufacturers have found ways around the restrictions.

A number of states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, have laws limiting or banning the sale of assault weapons. California, for example, has banned AR-15s and other rifles with detachable magazines, which allow shooters to quickly reload. However a recent feature called a “bullet button” allows magazines to be quickly replaced, while still technically remaining fixed, rendering this law largely ineffective. State lawmakers attempted to close this loophole by introducing legislation prohibiting future sales of rifles with bullet buttons, but gun owners have found ways around the ban.

Gun manufacturers have also managed to easily circumvent other state laws by making small modifications to the weapons, such as replacing the grip or other components.

Federal attempts at banning assault weapons have been largely unsuccessful.

In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton signed a federal ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The law specifically banned certain semi-automatic weapons, including the AR-15, as well as rifles that could accept detachable magazines. That ban lapsed in 2004, when Congress did not reauthorize it.

There’s been debate about how well the ban actually worked. It didn’t apply to guns manufactured prior to 1994. According to NBC News, more than 1 million assault-style rifles and 25 million guns with high-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. A 2004 study by the University of Pennsylvania found that while the ban did result in a measurable reduction in crimes involving assault weapons, crimes involving non-banned guns remained steady or increased.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence,” concluded the study. “There has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury.”

Pro-gun activists say this shows a new assault weapons ban wouldn’t affect gun violence. But if the ban hadn’t expired, it’s difficult to imagine these guns proliferating to the point of becoming the weapon of choice of mass shooters.

After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut, some members of Congress sought to renew the assault weapon ban. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013, but was excluded from a vote by the full Senate due to Republican opposition. An attempt to re-attach the measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of the ban’s most ardent supporters, was voted down 40 to 60.

House Democrats again pushed for renewal in late 2015, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and Feinstein reintroduced it in 2017 following the Las Vegas and Texas shootings. There’s been no action on it since.

An attempt to ban bump stocks, a device used by the Las Vegas shooter that effectively turns semi-automatic rifles into automatic ones, also failed to gain traction in Congress. (Massachusetts, however, became the first state to ban the add-on stocks earlier this month.)

Every time a gunman carries out a massacre with an assault-style rifle, sales go up.

Gun sales, particularly those of assault weapons, tend to spike after each mass shooting, fueled in part by fears that lawmakers will crack down. Already immensely popular, AR-15s and similar rifles flew off the shelves after Sandy Hook. Gun shop owners saw a similar spike after San Bernardino.

This trend is so pronounced that gun industry executives have admitted mass shootings are good for business.

Families of gun violence victims are fighting back against this profit windfall. The parents of nine Sandy Hook victims and one person who survived the massacre are suing Remington, the manufacturer of the rifle used in that shooting. The suit accuses Remington of negligence in selling a military-grade weapon for civilian use, arguing that the guns were purposefully marketed to young men as personal weapons of war.

“Remington took a weapon that was made to the specs of the U.S. military for the purpose of killing enemy soldiers in combat ― and that weapon in the military is cared for with tremendous amount of diligence, in terms of training, storage, who gets the weapon, and who can use it,” the families’ attorney, Joshua Koskoff, told CNN in February of 2016. “They took that same weapon and started peddling it to the civilian market for the purposes of making a lot of money.”

Handguns are common in single-victim gun violence, but military-style rifles are becoming the weapon of choice for mass shooters.

Tens of thousands of people die in gun violence every year, and the overwhelming majority involve handguns, not assault-style rifles or other long guns. At least 64 percent of the gun-related homicides in 2016 were committed with pistols, according to FBI data.

When shooters do turn to heavy weaponry, however, the results can be catastrophic.

Weapons of war have been used in some of the deadliest shootings over the last several years. In addition to Las Vegas, AR-15 style rifles were used during mass shootings in California, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Texas and Colorado.

The gun industry is trying to convince you these weapons are just for fun.

Gun advocates insist assault-style rifles are ideal for hunting and target shooting. A fact sheet published by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in 2013 condemned the “assault weapon” label, claiming the term was “conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie.” The group has repeatedly argued that the guns are useful for marksmanship competitions and hunting large game. The NRA champions the AR-15 as ”America’s rifle.”

The industry has coined the term ”modern sporting rifles″ to describe assault weapons, and the term is used by major gun retailers like Cabela’s, and manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Remington.

That message may resonate with gun enthusiasts. The weapons are versatile and efficient, and if you like the idea of shooting things for sport, the appeal is obvious. Assault-style weapons look cool. Shooting one might even make you feel like a badass.

But the very same traits that have made them the preferred weapon for military personnel and sport shooters are what make them a natural choice for those who want to inflict senseless violence with maximum casualties.

It now seems the toll of mass killers is limited only by their choice of weapon, their training and their target. The political response to that terrifying reality has been to hope that people will choose not to kill. That plan clearly isn’t working.Scattered belongings remain at the site of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas.

The Clark County, Nevada, coroner released autopsy reports earlier this month detailing the deaths of the 58 victims of the Las Vegas shooting on Oct. 1.

The documents provide a window into the true horror of the massacre ― and of gun violence more generally. Looking through that window is admittedly uncomfortable, but doing so gives us a rare opportunity to honestly confront the graphic reality of a mass shooting. Shying away from that truth has only helped perpetuate a status quo in which many people have decided there’s nothing we can do to limit either the scope or the frequency of these tragedies. If that’s the path we continue to take, we should at least be willing to face up to the raw brutality of the incidents that we have accepted as an unavoidable feature of American life.

A number of the reports were difficult to evaluate due to inconsistencies in measurement, terminology and methodology, issues likely complicated by the sheer number of cases and the many different medical examiners who conducted the examinations.

HuffPost consulted with Arthur Alphin, a ballistics expert who specializes in the forensics of gunshot wounds and who has testified in a number of multiple shooting cases, to get his thoughts on a few of the cases. His comments are included in a number of the summaries below.

Case #1

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, creating multiple skull fractures and injuring multiple features of her brain, before reversing trajectory and exiting further down on the right side of her head.

Case #2

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s upper chest, coursing through his chest cavity and abdomen, before exiting on the lower left side of his back.

Case #3

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the left side of the victim’s back, coursing through his chest cavity before taking a slightly upward trajectory and exiting through his left chest.

Case #4

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, coursing through her chest cavity and causing injuries to the heart and lungs before coming to rest in the tissue of her right breast.

Case #5

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wounds to the chest and forearm.

A bullet enters the victim’s upper right chest, striking a rib, perforating her right lung, diaphragm and liver, before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her lower right chest. Another bullet enters through the victim’s back right forearm, passing cleanly through and exiting the front of her arm.

Alphin believes both sets of injuries were caused by a single bullet that struck the victim on an unstable trajectory, likely because the overheated barrel of the gunman’s rifle had expanded from shooting so rapidly, sending rounds flying out more unpredictably.

“Dollars to doughnuts, this is the same bullet that does all of this,” said Alphin. “The round was probably unstable, meaning it was wobbling slightly in free flight. That’s why you’ve got that slightly oblong entry wound, that indicates a bullet that was wobbling from that overheated barrel. It enters the forearm, then it goes through and has an irregular exit wound to the anterior right forearm. ... Now the bullet is beginning to tumble [as it enters her chest].”

Alphin added, “I would think she was standing, she realized there were bullets coming, she put her arm up and a bullet struck her.”

Case #6

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s lower right arm and passes cleanly through it into her chest, where it injures her right lung and ultimately strikes her vertebral column, shattering the bullet.

Case #7

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the right chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest, perforating multiple features of her right lung, before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her central back.

Case #8

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wounds to the head.

One bullet enters the victim’s left eye, injuring her eye and fracturing her skull, before coming to rest in the muscles on the side of her head. Another bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, causing additional skull fractures and injuring multiple features of her brain, before coming to rest in the back of her head. The victim also suffered a gunshot wound to the hand and a graze wound to the shoulder.

Alphin explained how two separate bullets could have struck the victim in the head.

“Both of those head wounds would be instantly fatal, which means the person would drop to the ground like a sack of rocks. There’s no way, even if the guy had kept the rifle stable and these are bullets that sequentially exited the muzzle, you’re still talking a couple tenths of a second between impacts and the body would have started to drop. I’m thinking one of these hit the victim standing and one of them hit her laying on the ground. Remember, all the shooter is doing is spraying bullets.”

Case #9

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between the ribs, perforating his liver, stomach and diaphragm, before entering his left chest. The jacket of the bullet is recovered in the victim’s left lung, while the bullet itself is found in the space between two ribs.

Case #10

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters through the right side of victim’s head, fracturing the skull, fragmenting the bullet and causing massive injuries to the brain.

Case #11

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s right back and passes through her shoulder blade and into her chest cavity, perforating her right lung, heart and left lung, before exiting from her left chest. Clusters of cuts and bruises suggest the victim was either dragged or trampled after collapsing.

Alphin believes the bullet was wobbling when it struck the victim but says it’s hard to tell from the listed measurements.

“Once the bullet travels down through the lungs, that’s a fatal wound,” he said. “Trauma and internal bleeding.”

Case #12

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s left chest between his ribs, fracturing one of the bones and likely fragmenting the round, leading to perforations of his left lung, spleen, aorta, liver and right lung.

Case #13

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left back around her sixth rib, likely fracturing a bone before passing through her left lung and piercing the major arteries of the heart.

Case #14

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters near the top of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and causing massive hemorrhaging of her brain. Contusions on the victim’s face were likely the result of her falling forward after being fatally struck.

Case #15

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between her ribs, taking an upward trajectory through her right lung, aorta and across her midline, where it perforates her left lung and comes to rest in the tissue of her left shoulder.

Alphin believes the bullet was stable in flight when it struck the victim but became unstable upon entry.

“It basically hit perpendicular to the surface of the skin,” he said. “The bullet, as it’s precessing, probably clipped one of the ribs, and that’s why it’s unstable within the body and broke apart. That’s why there are fragments recovered.”

Case #16

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters near the top of the victim’s head, coursing through his brain and into his neck before coming to rest in the tissue of his right shoulder. Additional abrasions suggest the victim fell after being struck and may have been dragged or trampled after collapsing.

Case #17

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s left upper chest at a downward angle, where it likely strikes a bone, which fragments the round, casting pieces throughout his left chest.

Case #18

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s right upper back, fracturing her third rib and perforating multiple features of her right lung and her aorta before coming to rest in the tissue surrounding her heart.

Case #19

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the neck.

The bullet enters the center of the victim’s neck, severing multiple vertebrae and major arteries before exiting through the left side of his neck. Abrasions on the victim’s arm and legs suggest he may have been dragged or trampled after collapsing.

Case #20

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the victim’s left cheek, fracturing her skull and passing through multiple features of her face before severing her spinal cord and coming to rest in the tissue of her neck.

Case #21

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s forehead, fracturing his skull, injuring his brain and shattering the round.

Case #22

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest, courses through his midline, passing through his carotid artery at the aorta and perforating his left lung before coming to rest in his lung tissue.

Case #23

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, injuring her right eye and brain before coming to rest in the left side of her brain. Another bullet enters through the back of the victim’s right forearm, injuring tissue but passing cleanly through.

Case #24

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wounds to the head and leg.

One bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and injuring multiple features of her brain while shattering the round. Another bullet enters the front of the victim’s left leg, injuring tissue before coming to rest in the back of her leg.

Case #25

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s central upper back, coursing through her vertebral column, shattering the round and sending fragments through her aorta and into her vertebrae.

Alphin says the autopsy indicates the bullet was in stable flight when it struck the victim perpendicular to the skin surface.

“The bullet began to break apart fairly quickly, and it completely disintegrated upon striking the vertebral body,” he said.

Case #26

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the neck.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s neck, coursing through the tissue of the neck and into the upper vertebrae, where the round is recovered.

Case #27

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters through the left side of the victim’s forehead, fracturing her skull and likely the round, before passing through multiple features of her brain.

Case #28

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters through the victim’s right upper chest, striking his right collarbone and coursing through his aorta and left lung before striking a left rib and coming to rest in the soft tissue of his left upper back.

Case #29

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, striking a rib and perforating his right lung, heart and left lung before exiting his left chest. Clusters of abrasions on the victim’s forearm suggest he was dragged or trampled after being struck.

Case #30

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the neck.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s neck, coursing through tissue in his upper neck and surrounding his vertebrae before striking his spine and coming to rest in the tissue of his left shoulder.

Case #31

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left back, coursing through the chest across the midline and exiting around her right breast.

Case #32

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and injuring her brain before exiting the left side of her head. Another bullet appears to have grazed the victim’s right wrist, causing damage to the tissue.

“That bullet was a .223 bullet, it was stable in flight and it was roughly perpendicular to the surface of the head,” Alphin said. “The only good thing is she didn’t suffer. She felt no pain at all. Some of those others, even though they died with the chest cavity wounds, they survived on the ground for 60 to 90 seconds, their heart continued to beat, the blood filled up into the pleural cavity and the thoracic cavity, their brain was still functioning and they knew they were dying and they were in pain. At least this poor woman, it was instant.”

Case #33

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest near the collarbone, coursing along the bone and through the body before coming to rest in the tissue of his upper arm.

“If a bullet enters or comes close to the long axis of a bone, the path of least resistance for the bullet is to skim along the bone, and so it actually follows the bone a little bit,” said Alphin. “As it’s dragging the side of the bullet alongside the bone that helps keep the bullet stable and nose on, and it’s easier to separate the flesh then, because it’s just being knocked away from the bone.”

Case #34

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

Bullet enters the victim’s left chest, striking and fracturing a rib, perforating features of the heart and right lung before coming to rest in the tissue of the right chest. Another bullet enters the back of the victim’s right elbow, passing through tissue and exiting the front of her arm.

Case #35

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left back, coursing through her body and coming to rest in the tissue of her left breast.

Case #36

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right front of the victim’s head, injuring multiple features of the brain and coming to rest in the back of his cranial cavity. Another bullet enters through the victim’s lower leg, injuring tissue and coming to rest in the calf muscle.

Case #37

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the back of the victim’s head, damaging multiple features of her brain and causing bruising around her eye. Abrasions on the victim’s forehead and extremities were likely suffered when she collapsed in the moments after she was shot.

Alphin explained why victims who have been shot in the head with military-style rifles, which typically shoot bullets around three times as fast as a handgun, will often have bruising around the eyes.

“It’s very, very common that the eyelids will be bruised, because the eyeball was trying to be forced out of the head,” he said, adding that it’s even possible for these wounds to lead to the eyeball being ejected from the socket.

Case #38

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, coursing through tissue, striking the right collarbone and perforating his right lung. Abrasions on the victim’s face and arms suggest he collapsed and may have been dragged or trampled.

Case #39

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, coursing through tissue, striking a rib, perforating the left lung, heart and right lung before coming to rest in the tissue of the right chest wall.

Case #40

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between ribs, perforating multiple features of her right lung, her right diaphragm and liver before striking a vertebra and coming to rest in the soft tissue of her back. Abrasions on the victim’s body were likely suffered after she was shot.

Case #41

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest near the shoulder, perforating his right lung, aorta and left lung, before coming to rest in the soft tissue between ribs in his left chest.

Case #42

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s forehead, fracturing the skull, fragmenting the round and injuring multiple features of his brain.

Case #43

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the left chest, perforating her left lung, heart, right lung and striking a right rib before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her right armpit. Abrasions and contusions to the face and extremities suggest the victim collapsed and may have been trampled or dragged after being struck.

Case #44

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, coursing through tissue, perforating her right lung, heart and left lung before exiting through her left back.

Case #45

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s right lower arm, passing cleanly through the tissue and exiting, before re-entering and re-exiting her arm and re-entering the victim’s body through her right chest. The bullet then courses through the victim’s diaphragm, strikes a rib, perforates her liver and strikes her spine before coming to rest near her lower vertebrae.

Alphin believes the bullet was unstable and tumbling when it struck the victim’s arm, which helps explain the strange path of the wound.

“I’m thinking that this person had their arm up at the shoulder but bent back at the elbow, as if scratching their ear or trying to shield their eyes or keep a hat from flying off their head.”

Case #46

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s forehead, injuring multiple features of his brain and ejecting a fragment of the bullet from the right side of his head.

Case #47

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left lower back, coursing through tissue and entering the abdominal cavity before perforating his left kidney and left adrenal gland and casting fragments of the bullet along the wound path.

Case #48

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left mid-back, perforating her spine and coming to rest in her right chest cavity. Rib fractures suggest CPR was attempted at some point after she was shot.

Case #49

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wounds to the back.

Two bullets enter the victim’s left lower back in close proximity, coursing through tissue and striking the lower spine, resulting in multiple fractures and shattering one of the rounds. The other bullet continues to course upward through the victim’s right lung before coming to rest in the right chest cavity.

Case #50

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, injuring vital structures in the chest cavity and coming to rest in the tissue of the right back.

Case #51

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters near the top left of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull, fragmenting the round and injuring multiple features of her brain before exiting the right side of her head.

Case #52

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, fracturing a rib and perforating her left lung before coming to rest in the space between two of her vertebrae.

Case #53

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.

The bullet enters the victim’s left upper chest near her collarbone, coursing through her chest cavity and exiting her back right shoulder.

Case #54

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the leg.

The bullet enters the victim’s right leg at the side of the knee, exiting slightly higher on the back of her right leg. The victim’s body is received with a tourniquet, suggesting a bystander attempted to stop the bleeding. Contusions and abrasions to the victim’s face, arms and legs suggest she may have been dragged or trampled after collapsing.

Alphin believes the victim was lying on the ground when she was struck.

“It’s very common with a bullet near the knee is that, as it breaks the knee and the tibial plateau ― that wider upper part of the tibia bone and lower end of the femur ― almost invariably a bullet doing that will sever the arteries and the veins that run through that part of the leg in order to feed blood to the calf and the foot. ... It probably hurt like hell. She may not have even known she was bleeding to death. Not uncommon. She feels down there, there’s a wound, there’s a little blood coming out. She says she’s hit. Ninety seconds later, she’s dead.”

Alphin added that the tourniquet may have been a sign that a veteran of either the Iraq or Afghanistan war attempted to stem the bleeding following a treatment protocol that has come back into favor in the U.S. military.

Case #55

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, perforating her lung and heart, where it comes to rest.

Case #56

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.

The bullet enters the top left of the victim’s head, fracturing his skull and injuring multiple features of the brain, where it comes to rest.

Case #57

Female

Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.

The bullet enters the victim’s central upper back, coursing through her spine and chest cavity, before coming to rest in the tissue of her chest. Additional lacerations and abrasions of the face, legs and arms suggest the victim may have been trampled or dragged after collapsing.

“As soon as the bullet gets through the skin and the subcutaneous, it strikes the spine, which destroys the spine, sends fragments through into the lungs and basically destroys the bullet,” said Alphin. “And that’s why you’ve got fragments that exit the thoracic cavity. There’s enough velocity in those fragments that they hit the far rib cage wall and are found.”

Case #58

Male

Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the head.When is enough, enough!?! How much bloodshed, how many more deaths!?!



My heart breaks at the news from Florida.



I mourn the senseless loss of life. This must not be normal, such carnage must not be routine.



Thoughts and prayers are not enough.



Our nation must act.“The last 50 years redefined womanhood: women were taught they can be anything. No commensurate movement for men who are still generally locked into the same rigid, outdated model of masculinity and it’s killing us.” he said.

He added that men need to be given the same space that women have to explore their identities and express their emotions.ferrantraite via Getty Images Chapultepec Castle with Mexico City's skyline in the background.

Mexico City has now become a major player on quite a few places-to-visit lists. International guidebooks, the most prestigious travel newsletters, chefs and designers have set their sights on this great city. Residents of Mexico City, also known as Chilangos, who simultaneously love and hate it, know very well why they stay and why they always recommend it to travelers from all over the world.

The Mexican capital has evolved without losing sight of its history, but the best thing it’s done is to simply be itself. The local cuisine is delicious, and the nightlife includes both interesting dives and luxury bars. Socially responsible fashion is booming, too, and there are more contemporary art offerings now than ever before.

The HuffPost Mexico staff chose locations and experiences —new and/or reinvented — that help keep Mexico City among the most attractive cities in the world.

1. Eat Like a Local

A post shared by Eat Like A Local Mexico City (@eatlikealocalmx) on Nov 11, 2017 at 4:03pm PST

The country’s culinary riches are in the markets, homes and streets. Eat Like a Local, a project by Rocío Vázquez Landeta, seeks to take travelers on a journey to discover Mexico City through its food, its traditions and its people.

Tourists can choose from several options that run from the most exclusive restaurants to tours through the markets, where they try typical Chilango munchies and taste delicious tacos, pulque, beer and mezcal in stunning locations, all while meeting new people.

“Eat Like a Local is not a tourism company, but a platform through which you discover the best and most original aspects from different areas of the capital, in the company of a good friend,” Rocío says. “My intention is to show travelers the day-to-day Mexico through the folklore of its markets and its people’s traditions. I don’t take them to the typical recommendations you find in travel guides; I design ‘culinary expeditions’ tailored to their tastes and interests.”

Since a big part of the tours involves public transportation and walking (because that’s how you really get to know a city, after all), the groups are generally small, 10 people max.

2. La Guerrerense

DONA SABINA Sabina Bandera of La Guerrense

La Guerrerense’s obligatory stand in Ensenada just opened a location in the Mexican capital.

This shellfish bar was established in 1960 by Alberto Oviedo and his wife, Celia Carranza. Now, pay attention: Their son was Eduardo Oviedo, who married Sabina Bandera. She is better known as La Güerita or La Guerrerense. Sabina says that she didn’t know how to work with seafood because, in her native state of Guerrero, she worked in agriculture and with dairy products. It was in Ensenada where her in-laws taught her about seafood. Step by step, Sabina innovated the business, creating more than 13 sauces, all organic and preservative-free. She grows some of the chiles they use at their stand.

Don’t miss the pismo clam tostada, and certainly don’t miss the sea urchin tostada, a delicacy.

3. La Casa Rivas Mercado

CASA RIVAS MERCADO

In the heart of the Guerrero district sits one of the prettiest buildings in Mexico City. Built during the 19th century by porfirista architect Antonio Rivas Mercado, it just reopened to the public after nine years of reconstruction. “Restoring the 6,350 square feet meant fighting the sinking and structural decay, while also being respectful of its eclectic style, with seven variations of cantera stones and its 50,000 types of encaustic mosaics, tiles and English floors,” notes the federal Department of Culture.

4. Petit comité accommodation

Casa Decu

In one of the most central and cosmopolitan neighborhoods, La Condesa, there’s a spot that takes travelers on an experience of luxury and comfort: Casa Decu.

Casa Decu is a 27-room boutique hotel that, immersed in the Mexican Art Deco scene, “has been conceived both to enjoy the area’s amenities as well as the facilities themselves and, of course, satisfy any traveler’s needs, like internet, continental breakfast and a laundry room.”

This gem, which stands out among the city’s hotel offerings, has rooms equipped with full kitchens, a 24/7 gym and a sensational rooftop that serves as a breakfast area in the morning and a relaxation spot with a panoramic view of the city during the afternoon and evening.

5. Take a ride through the chinampas

A post shared by Liliana López (@lilixlopez) on Jul 25, 2017 at 7:39am PDT

Going for a ride in a trajinera (a flat-bottomed boat) has been a popular and traditional activity for ages, but one way to improve the experience is to go through the chinampas, which are centers where they harvest vegetables that —depending on the time of the year and yield— are sold to renowned Mexico City restaurants, such as Pujol and Sud 777.

The chinampa is an artificial harvesting system built in areas in which water is the main natural resource; the aquifer is called “humedal” (wetland). They’re built for harvesting plants and vegetables.

This harvesting system is placed in the shallow areas of lakes and doesn’t require artificial irrigation or rain water, since its location means water is always readily available.

SALON LOS ANGELES

Go back in time, and don’t worry about bringing a dancing partner, because you’re sure to find one here. “This emblematic place, a flagship of urban life, opened its doors in 1937 and to this day, it hasn’t closed for any reasons,” reads the famous dance hall’s website, and now it would seem that new trends have breathed new life into it. In this venue for danzón, chachachá, swing and mambo, what stands out today is its authenticity.

7. Ruta de la Amistad

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Ruta de la Amistad (Friendship Road), a set of 22 large sculptures created by world-famous artists for the 1968 Mexico Olympics. The project was the brainchild of Mathias Goeritz, a German-born Mexican painter, sculptor and artist.

Wandering the 10.5-mile-long sculpture corridor means touring the southern area of the Mexican capital, an area that has had constant transformations, the most important possibly being the construction of the second floor of the Periférico, a beltway that borders Mexico City (but which also put some of the sculptures at risk).

For over 25 years, the sculptures in the Ruta de la Amistad have fallen victim to abandonment, but different conservation groups have helped repair them. Now, the Patronato de la Ruta de la Amistad (Friendship Road Board) aims to have this group of sculptures declared a historical monument to ensure its protection.

7. All the amazing restaurants

Caldos Ánimo is the creation of chef Antonio de Livier. Birriamen, the perfect combination of birria and ramen, is a hit among the locals of the Nápoles district at his restaurant Ánimo.

WanWan Sakaba is a small restaurant in which you’ll feel as if you were in a traditional Japanese tavern (izakaya) while having luscious noodles with beer and sake. There are no tables, just a bar.

Sud 777 offers contemporary cuisine with Mexican-grown ingredients. Chef Édgar Núñez designs the menu seasonally.

You can’t miss the food at Pujol, which has earned the fourth spot on the list of the 50 best restaurants in Latin America. It’s run by chef Enrique Olvera, who has two restaurants in New York City.

Quintonil offers a menu that strongly showcases the flavors and techniques of chef Jorge Vallejo’s contemporary Mexican cuisine.

8. Monumento a la Revolución

History, modernity and unforgettable sunsets: This is what you’ll get during your view from Monumento a la Revolución.

From the Monumento a la Revolución, you’ll be able to take in one of the best views of the city. You’ll also learn about the historical building whose construction stopped in 1912 due to a diversion of funds, which were owed to the revolutionary movement that was taking place. In addition, you’ll be able to have a coffee while enjoying this vista brimming with history.

Built in 1948, the house and study that belonged to Luis Barragán, one of the most famous Mexican architects in the world, has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The reason: “It’s the only individual property in Latin America that has earned such honor because it’s a masterpiece within the Modern Movement of architecture, creating a new blend of traditional and vernacular elements and different philosophical and artistic movements from all ages.”

With the eye-catching colors of its interior but restrained façade, Luis Barragán’s house was built on a small street in the old Tacubaya neighborhood and is surrounded by traditional houses, workshops and small stores.

The house, which you can visit by appointment, has also hosted exhibits by other artists. Last year this architectonic gem was the setting for the Mármol Rosa (Pink Marble) exhibit by Cypriot artist Christodoulos Panayiotou. His concept was to recontextualize and redefine personal household elements that evoke Luis Barragán’s spirituality, sensibility and sources of inspiration.

11. Lorena Saravia Boutique

A post shared by LORENA SARAVIA (@lorenasaravia) on Jan 4, 2018 at 6:04pm PST

This local brand is affordable luxury that wants to “be Mexico’s most important all-purpose fashion brand and secure the country’s untapped niche that falls somewhere between fast fashion and high fashion,” according to its creator, Lorena Saravia.
