When the bush located behind a stunning mural dedicated to Prince began to bloom on Sunday, the musician received a posthumous crown fit for a king.

4.1.18 - Our #Prince bush started flowering all of a sudden! Now there are hundreds bees buzzing and a few birds living in the bush! Happy #Easter Everyone! pic.twitter.com/preotBVKNY — Christine Stein (@ChristinesAArt) April 1, 2018

Sacramento, California-based artist Christine Stein created a mural to commemorate Prince that’s been in the front yard of her home for the last two years.

The mural took on new life on Easter Sunday when the bush just behind Stein’s mural flowered rapidly. Stein told Sacramento news station KCRA 3 that she didn’t even know the bush had flowers and that “someone accidentally dropped mulch in front of the mural, bringing extra nutrients to her yard.”

“Sometimes it snows in April,” she told the station. “Sometimes it blooms in hope.”

Stein wasn’t the only one pleased about the blossoming tribute to the “When Doves Cry” singer. Many on social media were touched by the serendipitous appearance of fresh flowers:

As for how big Stein plans to let the “crown” grow, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be cutting it anytime soon. Apparently, the flowers brought lots of bees. She told one person on Twitter that when she went to cut the bush and spotted the buzzing insects, she said “nope!”

AdvertisementNearly a year after Bill Cosby’s sexual assault trial ended in a hung jury, the comedian is heading back to court for a retrial.

Cosby, 80, is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault. He’s accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University, in 2004. In June, a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the charges and the judge declared a mistrial.

More than 50 women have accused the entertainer of sexual assault, with many saying he drugged and raped them. Cosby has denied all the allegations and is sticking with his not guilty plea from last year.

Cosby’s retrial is the first high-profile sexual assault prosecution in the Me Too era. Here’s a quick primer on a court case sure to capture the attention of the entire country.

When does the retrial begin?

Jury selection began on April 2, but opening statements and testimony (the part everyone will be paying attention to) starts April 9.

Where does the retrial take place?

The retrial will be at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, about a 40-minute drive north of Center City Philadelphia. Cosby’s first trial also took place there. The same judge will preside, Common Pleas Judge Steven T. O’Neill. Cosby’s mansion ― the scene of the alleged crime ― is in Montgomery County.

How long will the retrial take?

O’Neill told potential jurors the retrial will last “easily a month.” That would be twice as long as the first trial. O’Neill announced in March that he will allow five Cosby accusers in addition to Constand to testify for prosecutors trying to prove Cosby’s “prior bad acts.”

What happened during jury selection?

Jury selection in high-profile, high-stakes trials like this can make or break a case for both prosecutors and the defense.

The defense had a hard time finding impartial jurors who haven’t already heard of the allegations against Cosby ― especially since the entire country was exposed to his first trial. Of 120 potential jurors, only 10 told O’Neill that they had not heard of the 50-plus accusations of sexual assault and rape against the comedian. Sixty-eight potential jurors were dismissed right away because they said they had already formed an opinion.

“Fair and impartial ― those are the two most important words of the day,” O’Neill reportedly stressed throughout jury selection.

Another factor working against the defense is the rising Me Too movement. The reckoning has brought down big stars like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer, and has shifted our culture’s perspective on sexual violence. Even last year, when Cosby first went on trial, the climate around sexual assault was very different.

“Since Cosby’s first go-round, all courtroom participants ― jurors, attorneys, judge ― have been immersed in an intensive course on sexual violation,” Deborah Tuerkheimer, a Northwestern University law professor and former prosecutor who specialized in domestic violence cases, told The New York Times.

“The ways in which we evaluate the credibility of survivors has also shifted in important ways, from a default to doubt, to a greater willingness to believe,” Tuerkheimer continued. “And we have been newly schooled in the importance of consent. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out in the courtroom.”

Jury selection concluded on Thursday. Cosby’s jury will consist of 12 people ― 10 white and two black. “Six racially diverse alternate jurors were picked without incident” later in the day, according to The Associated Press. All 12 jurors and six alternates will remain anonymous throughout the trial.

After jury selection wrapped, Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for Cosby, told reporters he hopes members of the panel can be “fair and impartial” throughout the trial.

Who will testify?

In a big victory for prosecutors, O’Neill ruled in March that five accusers could testify because their stories closely resemble the claims made by Constand. Their testimony will be used as evidence of prior bad acts.

“As the number of victims reporting similar, drug-facilitated sexual assaults by [the] defendant increases, the likelihood that his conduct was unintentional decreases,” prosecutors wrote in court documents. “It is simply a matter of probabilities.”

The judge’s ruling was a sharp departure from last year, when O’Neill rejected prosecutors’ request to present 13 other accusers to show a pattern of predatory behavior. The judge allowed only one person to testify ― a woman named Kelly Johnson, who claimed Cosby drugged and assaulted her in the 1990s.

Johnson will not take the stand again because prosecutors believe the defense poked too many holes in her story during the first trial.

The AP was able to figure out which “prior bad acts” witnesses prosecutors intend to call at the retrial, based on descriptions in court documents:

Janice Dickinson is a former supermodel and TV personality who says Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. “The next morning I woke up, and I wasn’t wearing my pajamas,” Dickinson, 63, said in a 2014 interview with ET Online. “Before I woke up in the morning, the last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain.” Dickinson also has filed a civil lawsuit against Cosby, saying he defamed her with a statement calling her a liar. Janice Baker-Kinney is a bartender who came out in 2015 with allegations that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at a party in Reno, Nevada, in 1982. Heidi Thomas was a model and aspiring actress living in Denver in 1984 when an agent contacted her and said Cosby wanted to meet her and help her with her career. Thomas traveled to Reno, Nevada, where she met Cosby at a house. She says the two were reading a scene in which her character was drunk, so Cosby gave her a glass of wine. “Thomas says that when she woke up, Cosby was next to her in bed, naked and ‘forcing himself in my mouth,’” a 2015 CNN report reads. “Soon after, Thomas says, Cosby was getting on top of her again and referring to himself in the third person. ‘I’m your friend... your friend is gonna (ejaculate) again,’ Thomas remembers him saying.” Chelan Lasha is a former model who accused Cosby in 2014 of drugging and assaulting her in Las Vegas in 1986, when she was 17 years old. According to Lasha, she met Cosby in his hotel room at the Hilton because he had promised to introduce her to someone at the Ford Modeling Agency. Once the two were alone, Lasha says Cosby gave her two shots of liquor and a blue pill ― which he told her was an antihistamine. The next thing Lasha remembered was Cosby “humping her leg” and “grunting” before she blacked out, according to New York magazine. Lise-Lotte Lublin says she met Cosby in 1989 through her modeling agency, when she was 23. On their third meeting, Lublin says Cosby invited her to his hotel room in Las Vegas to help her with her acting. Once there, Cosby fixed her a drink and insisted she drink it, although Lublin said she was not a big drinker. Within minutes, Lublin said, she began feeling dizzy and disoriented, then blacked out. Lublin went public with her story in 2015, and says she believes Cosby drugged and then sexually assaulted her.

Court documents suggest prosecutors may call more than a dozen other people to the stand to corroborate the women’s stories.

Cosby’s defense scored a win when O’Neill ruled this week that Marguerite “Margo” Jackson would be able to testify. Jackson, according to court documents, worked with Constand at Temple University and is expected to tell a story of Constand saying she could make a false rape claim to get money. O’Neill did not allow Jackson to testify in the first trial.

What is the defense strategy?

Cosby’s defense team intends to paint Constand as a gold digger who lied about the assault to extort money from Cosby, a rich and famous man, according to reports. They plan to use Jackson’s testimony and the 2006 civil settlement between Cosby and Constand (which O’Neill also allowed as evidence) to bolster their defense.

District Attorney Kevin R. Steele called Jackson’s story “absurd” in his failed motion to prevent her testimony, adding: “This desperate move to introduce this highly-suspect, hearsay testimony reflects the defendant’s continuing strategy of inserting red herrings to distract from the relevant issues in this case.”

The defense retrial strategy is very different from last year’s, when Cosby’s lawyers attempted to portray Constand as a woman who consensually entered into a sexual relationship with Cosby, got angry with him and then lied about it. Constand is gay and was in a relationship with a woman at the time of the alleged assault.

What is the prosecution strategy?

The prosecutors will bolster Constand’s account with the five “prior bad acts” witnesses, intending to show a pattern of predatory behavior by Cosby.

The strategy is not without risks. Cosby’s lawyers are likely to aggressively cross-examine the women, and any slips could strengthen a defense argument for reasonable doubt.

Will this trial be much different from the first?

The retrial will likely be very different, mainly because of the additional accusers. Their testimony significantly widens the scope of the case beyond what happened between Cosby and Constand.Cardi B certainly has finesse when it comes to proposing threesomes.

The rapper’s new album, “Invasion of Privacy,” dropped on Friday morning and had a saucy reveal in one of its songs. On “She Bad” featuring YG, Cardi says: “I need Chrissy Teigen / Know a bad bitch when I see one / Tell RiRi I need a threesome.”

Come again, Cardi?! But also... get it, girl.

After Rap-Up tweeted the sexy lyrics, Teigen had to stop eating some truly delicious-looking biscuits:

Rihanna has not yet responded to the song or the proposal, but still fans on Twitter have gone wild about the whole thing:

This week Twitter totally ate up an old clip of another chef giving Gordon Ramsay the Gordon Ramsay treatment. In the segment from Season 5 of “The F Word,” the executive chef at London’s now-defunct Blue Elephant basically tells Ramsay his pad thai sucks.

The Thai chef, whom the host calls “Chef Chang,” takes just one bite of Ramsay’s version of the famous dish. But instead of saying definitively whether it’s good or not, he asks: “What do you want to know from me?”

When pressed, he said, “This is not pad thai at all.” But his face really did all the talking:

People on Twitter absolutely loved the Thai chef’s saucy burn.

Looks like toxic scum on a stagnant pool https://t.co/3Rf6s62Rgk — Gordon Ramsay (@GordonRamsay) February 19, 2017An employee at a Virginia-based hardware store has been terminated after allegedly blasting the Boy Scouts’ stance on gay participants and ejecting a scout from the store.

Carly Hamilton said she was visiting Nichols Hardware in Purcellville, Virginia, on Friday when she witnessed an employee kicking a Boy Scout and his father out of the store. The young man, who has not been identified, was attempting to raise money for an Eagle Scout project.

“I thought it was a joke,” Hamilton told local news station WUSA 9. “All of a sudden, the guy behind the counter interrupts the kid loudly, and says, ‘You need to get out of here. We don’t support organizations like you, or yours.’”

The employee, Hamilton recalled, then told the scout, “We do not support your organization. Your organization is not the Boy Scouts anymore.”

Immediately after the altercation, Hamilton said, the employee told her, “We don’t support homos. They allow homos in the Boy Scouts now.”

After the story broke on Monday, Nichols Hardware’s social media accounts were inundated with angry comments. “Bigoted homophobic employees,” one person wrote on the company’s Yelp page, which the site is monitoring. “Terrible staff and management. Hope to see this place out of business soon.” Wrote another, “Clearly you employ bigoted trash in your stores and call them employees ... Everyone’s money is green no matter who they love, support or vote for.”

In an interview with the Washington Post that day, a store manager acknowledged that the allegations were “costing us business” but seemed unaware of the controversy that had broken out online. By Tuesday, however, the store wrote on its Facebook page that the employee involved in the alleged incident had been terminated, adding that the company “deeply regrets any disrespect to any organization or person.”

In recent years, the Boy Scouts of America’s membership policies have undergone a series of revisions. This month, the 108-year-old organization announced it will drop the word “boy” from its Boy Scouts program, for 11-to-17-year-olds, calling it Scouts BSA instead. It will start accepting girls in February 2019, when the name change will take effect. Boys and girls will be divided into separate units.

The organization’s Cub Scouts program, for 7-to-10-year-olds, will admit girls for the first time this summer.

In 2015 the Boy Scouts lifted a longtime ban on gay adults serving as employees or volunteers in the organization. Its ban on gay youth participants had been scrapped a year earlier.

Not everyone is thrilled, however. A day after the name change was announced, Republican Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams blasted the organization for caving in to “left-wing social engineers who want to remove the concept of male masculinity from society.”

“Liberals tell us that masculinity is ‘toxic’ and that girls can be boys and boys should no longer be boys,” said Williams, who is a candidate in his state’s gubernatorial primary this month.

On May 9, the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced it would end its long relationship with the Boy Scouts, though it was unclear whether the name change played a factor.We are proud to welcome the creative staff of Onion Inc. to the Writers Guild of America, East.

On Thursday night, the “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host tore into Hannity for calling him an “ass clown” over jokes made on the show about first lady Melania Trump.

“What even is an ass clown?” Kimmel fired back during his nightly monologue. “I was thinking about it this morning. Is it an ass that’s a clown? Or is it a clown that actually lives in an ass, like a little bozo bird in your butt cheeks? I honestly don’t know. And more importantly, why is Sean Hannity openly fantasizing about clowns in the ass?”

Kimmel even allowed that he might actually be an ass clown.

“If I’m an ass clown ― and I might very well be ― you, Sean, are the whole ass circus.”

Kimmel was just getting warmed up.

The two also went at it on Twitter after the show:Michelle Obama attempted to explain President Donald Trump and his administration with a parenting metaphor on Thursday.

Speaking at the Simmons Leadership Conference in Boston, the former first lady said President Barack Obama’s time in the White House “was like having the ‘good parent’ at home.”

“The responsible parent, the one who told you to eat your carrots and go to bed on time,” she said, per MassLive.com.

“And now we have the other parent,” Obama added, in reference to Trump’s presidency. “We thought it’d feel fun, maybe it feels fun for now because we can eat candy all day and stay up late and not follow the rules.”

In a wide-ranging discussion at the women’s leadership conference, Obama once again dismissed running for president herself by admitting to “never” having “the passion for politics.”

“I just happened to be married to somebody who has the passion for politics, and he dragged me kicking and screaming into this arena,” she said.

Obama also explained why she believed Hillary Clinton was “the best-qualified candidate.”BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - China warned on Friday it would fight back “at any cost” with fresh trade measures if the United States continues on its path of protectionism, hours after President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods.

Trump said the United States has already lost any trade war, as he defended his proposed tariffs, saying the move might cause “a little pain” but the United States will be better off in the long run.

“We’ve already lost the trade war. We don’t have a trade war, we’ve lost the trade war,” Trumpsaid in a radio interview with New York radio show, 77 WABC’s “Bernie & Sid” early on Friday. In a Twitter message on Wednesday, he had said: “That war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.”

China’s commerce ministry was due to hold a media briefing at 1200 GMT on Friday.

In light of China’s “unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. trade actions, Trump upped the ante on Thursday by ordering U.S. officials to identify extra tariffs, escalating a high stakes tit-for-tat confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the world’s two biggest economies.

On Wednesday, China unveiled a list of 106 U.S. goods - from soybeans and whiskey to frozen beef and aircraft - targeted for tariffs, in a swift retaliatory move only hours after the Trump administration proposed duties on some 1,300 Chinese industrial, technology, transport and medical products.

Washington has called for the $50 billion in extra duties after it said a probe determined Chinese government policies are designed to transfer U.S. intellectual property to Chinese companies and allow them to seize leadership in key high-technology industries of the future.

Responding to Trump’s latest comments, the Chinese commerce ministry reiterated that Chinawas not afraid of a trade war even though it did not seek one, and accused the United States of provoking the conflict.

“If the United States disregards the objections of China and the international community and persists in unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Chinese side will follow through to the end, at any cost, and definitely fight back resolutely,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement on the ministry’s website.

The ministry has called for a media briefing on Friday night, in an unusual move on a public holiday.

Earlier in the day, Chinese state media had slammed Trump’s threat of more trade action as “ridiculous.”

“This latest intimidation reflects the deep arrogance of some American elites in their attitude towards China,” the state-run Global Times said in an editorial.

While Beijing’s claims that Washington is the aggressor and is spurring global protectionism, China’s trading partners have complained for years that it abuses World Trade Organization rules and propagates unfair policies at home that lock foreign firms out of some sectors as domestic champions are being nurtured.

China has repeatedly vowed that it would open up sectors such as financial services.

President Xi Jinping next week is expected to unveil fresh measures on reform and his country’s opening up at the high-profile Boao Forum, China’s equivalent of Davos, in the southern island province of Hainan.

LINGERING CONCERNS

While China has projected an image of multilateralism and restraint amid the escalating trade dispute with the United States, Beijing has been swift to respond to Washington’s rhetoric and actions.

So far, U.S. information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing, as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing 737.

Among the most affected by a trade war could be the U.S. technology sector, particularly chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor sector relies on China for about a quarter of its revenue.

It also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic travel backlash. When ties between Beijing and Seoul chilled, Chinese tourism to South Korea plummeted and Made-in-South Korea products were shunned by consumers in China.

On Chinese social media on Friday, among the most searched phrases were “China hasn’t grown up afraid” and “China will follow through to the end.”

DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES

Analysts at Oxford Economics warned that a full-blown trade war will have damaging consequences.

“Importantly, these threatened tariffs will be subject to negotiation, and therefore shouldn’t be considered as final,” the analysts wrote in a note to client.

“A (full-blown) trade war meanwhile would have a more pronounced effect. The U.S. and Chinawould suffer significant slowdown in real GDP growth – a cumulative loss around 1.0 percentage point,” and cut global economic growth to 2.5 percent in 2019 from 3.0 percent in Oxford’s baseline scenario.

The escalating tit-for-tat trade actions between the two economic superpowers have roiled global financial markets, as investors worried about the impact on world trade and growth, hitting equities, the dollar and a range of riskier assets such as copper and boosting safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold.

The dollar fell in Friday’s trade, while U.S. stock futures and most of Asia’s stock markets were in the red.

“This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start,” said National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay.

“We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,” Shay added in a statement, urging Trump “to stop playing a game of chicken with the U.S. economy.”There are a lot of great reasons to get out of town this month, thanks to cheap-o airfares, good eats and the inevitable budding of flowers. Plus, if you’re smart about where you place that pin on the map, you can even trade some rainy days for sunshine. Here’s both the best of the best in travel this month, whether you’re looking for experiences, deals or both.

1. Sonoma Valley, California

Some of our favorite things to do in the valley include hot-air balloon rides, olive oil tastings and exploring a museum dedicated to hand fans — yes, you read that correctly. But despite all these great activities, we all know and love this California wine region for its, well, wine, of course. When it comes to planning a wine-focused itinerary, you’ll want to sip and play croquet on the courts at Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards, tour the 140-year-old stone cellars — with a glass in hand — at Simi, or just savor the yummy Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays at the tasting room at La Crema.

Why you should go in April: With relatively low fares into SFO from across the country this month, according to SkyScanner, you can be enjoying wine country in no time. And then there’s the wine sitch. From April 6 to 8, the second annual Signature Sonoma Valley means a long weekend full of vino tasting events coupled with exclusive access to vineyards as well as the growers and vintners themselves. Guests who attend can taste hard-to-find vintages or wines from the private collections of legendary winemakers, get a behind-the-scenes look at the winemaking process or chow down on brunch paired with sparkling wines made in limited quantities. Couple that with access to private venues (read: hard-to-Instagram places) and homes not generally open to the public and we’ll happily raise a glass.

Where to stay: Located on a 50-plus-acre ranch, this tiny house-style cottage is a Sonoma steal, priced at $150 a night. Meanwhile, if you’re looking to splurge, the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa offers posh digs, a Michelin-starred restaurant and one of the Sonoma’s finest spas.

2. Guadalajara, Mexico

This large, landlocked city often gets ignored by travelers to Mexico, but its rich history and young, student-friendly energy and party vibe make it a must-visit. Explore the incredible and Instagrammable-at-every-turn Tlaquepaque craft market, bite into a torta ahogada and take in some authentic mariachi music — after all, this is where it was born. Guadalajara can also be a great starting point for travelers looking to visit Tequila Valley, which is just over an hour away. Here, you’ll want to stop by the distillery and tasting rooms of some of your favorite tequilas. You can even park it overnight at Casa Noble, where you’ll find agave views at every turn.

Why you should go in April: With no chance of rain, and temps creeping upwards of 90 degrees, you can start working on your summer tan — with adequate sunscreen, of course — a little earlier than usual. Also, flights from the U.S. are pretty cheap at the moment.

Where to stay: Speaking of deals, travelers to Guadalajara will be spoiled with luxe options under $200 a night (as of press time), like the Hotel Riu Plaza Guadalajara and the Hyatt Regency Andares Guadalajara, which both have plush, contemporary high-rise vibes.

3. Columbia, South Carolina

Everyone has Charleston on their bucket list, but there’s another South Carolina city that’s about to pop thanks to a recent urban revival. Known as Soda City (since it’s abbreviated as “Cola”), Columbia’s compact, walkable downtown has a small-city feel with big-city things to do — from upscale restaurants and shopping to art museums — making it ideal for a long weekend. Spend a morning here exploring the Soda City Market, tour the historic Robert Mills House & Gardens, grab brunch at former motor supply company aptly named Motor Supply Co. Bistro. But most importantly, do not leave town without planning a trip to Lula Drake, a cozy wine bar rich in history. (It has a blue cheese tasting plate on the menu, too, if you’re into that kind of thing.)

Why you should go in April: For one — flights are cheap, which usually isn’t the case when a destination is experiencing some of its best weather all year. (Read: Warm, comfortable days without humidity.) Plus, it’s a month for music lovers, with the River Rocks Music Festival happening on the Congaree River and the heavily anticipated Love, Peace, & Hip-Hop festival taking over downtown.

Where to stay: Aloft Columbia Downtown, a brand-new, trendy hotel within walking distance to everything, that has comfortable rooms and a communal bar that welcomes guests in the lobby each night.

4. Aruba

Unwind and slip your toes into the beautiful white sand of this Dutch Caribbean island known for its picture-perfect beauty. Once you’ve landed in paradise, you can spend your days on Eagle Beach or Manchebo Beach for a little R&R or explore the island by ATV or catamaran cruise around the island. There’s a fascinating farm that doubles as a butterfly sanctuary for nature lovers and lots of romance to be found — like at a Frank Sinatra-themed dinner show — if you’re traveling with bae.

Why you should go in April: This month marks the end of the busy season in Aruba, meaning better prices on flights and hotels, with the weather remaining a beautiful mid-80 degrees and sunny virtually every day.

Where to stay: The splurge-worthy Ritz-Carlton, Aruba is located on one of the most coveted stretches of beach on the entire island and just recently debuted a new restaurant, Casa Nonna, which focuses on old-school-style Italian goodness. At the more budget-friendly Hilton Aruba Resort & Casino, you can keep things interesting at the tables and slots after the sun goes down. There’s also a daily schedule full of ways to keep active on the property, like yoga, Zumba, and boot camp-style classes—should you want to get in a good workout on vacay.

5. Washington, D.C.

The nation’s capital is home to so much history, art and culture, and every year there is more to explore, like looking for President Obama’s Kehinde Wiley portraits at The Smithsonian or the Newseum’s Pictures of the Year exhibit (open April 6), which showcases groundbreaking photography from seven decades of award-winning images from the archives of Pictures of the Year International. When you’re done being all cultured, you can cruise the shops at Dupont Circle or visit nearby Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, a historic neighborhood with boutiques like the Penny Post, a paper store where you can take modern brush lettering classes.

Why you should go in April: The National Cherry Blossom Festival means ethereal pink-and white-hued-flowers coming into bloom all around you (and the million visitors they draw to D.C.’s Tidal Basin each year). It doesn’t get more dainty then following up your flower peeping with tea service at Park Hyatt Washington D.C.’s Tea Cellar, featuring small plates like cherry blossom macaroons in celebration of the season. While the Cherry Blossoms means slightly higher hotel rates, airfare and train tickets are relatively cheap, and it truly is the best time to see D.C.

Where to stay: Luckily, options abound at every budget level in this big city, from Airbnbs with Victorian-era details to more opulent digs at The St. Regis Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, at the moderately priced Hyatt Place Washington D.C./U.S. Capitol, visitors can even take advantage of a Cherry Blossom package, which includes a high floor room upgrade (ideal for blossom viewing), a discount on food, late checkout and a souvenir cherry blossom tote bag.“What he’s forcing people to do is have a conversation and people to band together and work together. Like, you can’t really address something that’s not revealed. He’s bringing out an ugly side of America that we wanted to believe was gone and it’s still here. We still gotta deal with it.”“You thought that you would marry your boyfriend and you thought that everything would work out how you had always imagined. I don’t blame you though. He’s great. You wanted everything with him, but you were just not right for him.

I wish I could say that I am sorry it didn’t work out for you, but I can’t. I can’t because he is mine now, and I get to cherish him forever. You didn’t do that right, and you were not meant to be together. You will find someone too, but I am happy that you were not the one for him.”Andie MacDowell’s imperial phase lasted an all-too-brief seven years, spanning “Sex, Lies and Videotape” (1989), “Green Card” (1990), “The Object of Beauty” (1991), “Groundhog Day” (1993), “Short Cuts” (1993), “Four Weddings and a Funeral” (1994), and “Michael” (1996).

It was long enough to make her a household name, and short enough to leave folks wondering, “What ever happened to that Andie MacDowell? I love her!” (To which someone should respond, “She was in ‘Magic Mike XXL,’ duh.”)

It’s an awkward question to ask: How does it feel to have lost your popularity? But MacDowell is a realist. Being around pesky Hollywood types ― even though she didn’t move to Los Angeles until 2013 ― has kept her self-aware. She knows she could have had Nicole Kidman’s career, but she opted to focus on motherhood instead of chasing after the industry’s brightest projects. (MacDowell has three children with former model Paul Qualley.) Now, days away from turning 60, the new drama “Love After Love” provides one of the finest roles of her life. And who doesn’t love a good comeback story?

MacDowell plays a theater teacher who observes her husband’s painful death and then grieves alongside her unsettled adult sons (portrayed by Chris O’Dowd and James Adomian) and their extended family. Intimate and elliptical, the film ― directed and co-written by Russell Harbaugh ― lets MacDowell do what she has always done best: look. She is a remarkable conversationalist onscreen, her expressions superseding the words that glide from her mouth, as if her eyes have their own dialogue.

We first saw that wisdom in “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” when she chuckled naively and covered her face while discussing masturbation. And again in “Groundhog Day,” when she leaned forward in the diner to describe her ideal man to Bill Murray. Or in “Michael,” when she winked at William Hurt while singing that silly ditty about pie. But in “Love After Love,” MacDowell’s looks are sadder, more inquisitive, reflective of a weathered existence. She wanders alone into a crowded dance party, and into the jittery arms of new relationships, and into the turmoil of domestic infighting. Watching her is like witnessing an actress reborn. How did we ever let that Andie MacDowell slip away?

In person, MacDowell’s face contains the same multitudes. She is so engaged that her Southern inflections are almost secondary to her attentive brown eyes. When I met MacDowell at her Manhattan hotel last week, the Golden Globe-nominated actress relished the richness of “Love After Love,” hailed the Me Too groundswell and detailed the peace she’s made with the career she didn’t fight to maintain.

How does “Love After Love” compare to the projects offered to you in recent years?

It’s so much better than anything I’ve been offered. It’s really hard to find something like that. And you also have to think, “Oh, if there is material like that out there, there’s a lot of people out there that it could have gone to before it came to me.” When I read it, I was like, I cannot believe I’m going to get to do this. I was so excited about it and so thankful that even during the process I couldn’t believe it was happening sometimes.

It was really fulfilling to have that creative vehicle. And [Harbaugh is] totally different than any director I have ever worked with. More sensitive. He’s probably the most sensitive man that I’ve ever worked with. That was amazing. Not afraid of it, either. No fear of his sensitivity. How unusual is that! It’s not that he’s feminine, though sensitivity —

It’s attributed to feminine sensibilities, unfortunately.

It is! Yeah. Maybe that’s going to change. Maybe it’s going to be a human trait, not a female trait. I feel sorry for men being told not to cry. What a horrible thing to tell someone, because it’s not natural. He cried one day, because so much of this script is personal for him. I mean, right in front of everybody! I was kind of blown away. It’s about the loss of his father, and he went through all of that. I was blown away. And he had watched a list of beautiful movies. We watched some of them together, and I watched all of them.

What were they?

″À Nos Amours” and “Loulou,” which are directed by Maurice Pialat. If you haven’t seen them, watch them. “The Godfather.” Bergman movies, “A Scene from a Marriage.” Cassavetes. I’m telling you, it was a long list. And I was excited about that. I think this is not uncommon with new directors, and it’s a wonderful thing that they’re doing. That was exciting because it was like going back to school. I’d done all that in my 20s — I had watched all those movies, and it was nice to do that again and get the feeling of what he wanted to do.

We set up scenes really slowly. There was no push. Say we’re sitting down at the table. He would want us, in character, to have regular conversations and then get into the scene. And then whoever had the first line would just naturally find the space to get up and go into it. At the end of it, we could keep going. Most of the movie is really just his words, but I think starting and stopping in that way made it real. Nothing was forced, and it was fine to go on top of each other. And there was improv. The whole first scene was improvised. When Chris asks me about what makes you happy, that’s all improvised.

And then it became the opening scene. That’s impressive.

Yes! It’s the opening scene! I think there’s a levity to it. There’s a brightness to it that’s really important, because the movie does have such a heavy heart. And it takes a while to become bright again. You see people struggling. It’s watching people grieve, and how crazy they grieve.

I understand relationships now really well, especially parenting. And though my issues are not the same as the issues in the movie, I understand how you do that — the boundaries you break with your children, and how you get in their stuff and how they get in your stuff. I loved that because most movies don’t allow you to show psychological issues with such care. And also, to expect people to understand what’s going on, you have to be smart enough to say, “Look at what they’re doing to each other.”

Knowing what you do now about relationships, do you look back at old performances and think how different they might be had you known more then?

Oh yeah. Sure. But I also think that there is something beautiful to being young and innocent. At the time that I played other characters, they were young and innocent. So I would guess that’s why it’s interesting to be where I am right now. I’m not that innocent anymore. I have to say, I know too much. It’s not like that means I’m a bad person; it’s just that I comprehend a lot more about humanity and the potential of people. I’m not naive.

So Rita, for instance, in “Groundhog Day,” would need to be innocent because she believed the world was beautiful. She wouldn’t need to know all that stuff that I know now. “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” the same thing. I would not have been as naive, and she had to be naive. But that’s what makes characters now, and the work that I can play now, interesting. It’s also what I think makes mature women sexy, just like it’s what makes a mature man sexy. It’s this knowledge.

It’s gravity.

Yes, and experience.

Since you singled out how sensitive this director was, have you encountered a lot of insensitive men over the years in your career?

It’s not just my career. I think it’s life in general. But yeah, this year has made us all think a lot. Before, if we were to complain, we were just seen as complainers or whiners expecting something we don’t deserve. I don’t think the shift is going to happen fast. I think there is so much psychological abuse that men are unconscious of that we have had to tolerate.

I’ve been saying — and it’s the truth — when I was in the process of Jungian therapy, one of my therapists understood how I felt as an independent woman struggling so much just to live in a society that kept putting on me things that I couldn’t understand. Because I was an independent woman, they always wanted me to play this person that I could no longer play. One of the things [my therapist] said was, “Don’t get upset when you read the chapter where Jung was basically saying women were insane to work outside of the house.”

So that’s the format which we have been playing with for such a long time. Change is not going to be easy, but at least we’re going to have change. I think we’re going to finally get it. In the end, I think we will all feel better. Men need to be able to cry, but we also need to be seen as equals, and not as housekeepers. I do think there’s still a layer in there, though men would say, “We’re not like that anymore.” It’s in there! I’m sorry! We are less than. And the fact that we haven’t had a woman president in this country really shows how slow progress is.

What do you make of this political moment?

You know what’s so interesting to me? Before the whole Me Too thing came out, I think there was something in the air. As soon as women put [President Donald] Trump in that box, a lot of stuff started coming up. Before Rose McGowan and all that happened, I confessed to a friend of mine something that happened to me — stuff that started bubbling up for me. And then that happened, and I was like, “I can’t believe this is happening.” There’s a whole feeling within women right now. It’s all coming up and coming out. We’re tired. We just can’t do it anymore. That’s the whole Time’s Up thing. We cannot pretend, we cannot wear this mask any longer. The mask no longer fits, and I cannot pretend to be submissive. Think about that word. Isn’t that an interesting word? Subservient. Submissive.

Less than.

Less than! Less than. To serve you. That has been our role. That’s the same thing I’m talking about that I was struggling with. I had made all the money, yet I would go into meetings with men and I would feel more comfortable if I could take a husband or a man, because I felt like they never really gave me credit.

You mean rooms with studio executives?

No, even just with business people, to go in and talk about my money I had made.

Oh, just to square away your personal finances.

Yes! And just at every level of my life, they’ve looked at me like an incapable woman. It’s insane. And how many people still say a woman is incapable of being president? You feel it — it sinks in.

Thankfully, the Me Too fallout seems to have hit such a fever pitch that we won’t regress back to where we were.

I don’t think so. There’s no way it’s going to disappear. We’re done. Time is up. And we can’t go back. We’ve got too far to go. It’s not going to happen overnight. We still have a lot of work to do to quit having to play that role.

I tell you, people say this to me all the time. They want me to be in a relationship. My daughters [actresses Margaret Qualley and Rainey Qualley] want me to be in a relationship. I will say to them, “I can’t do it again.” It’s going to take a really special man because I can’t play that role anymore. I just can’t do it. I can’t go back into a role with a man if he expects me to do that.

So you’re not dating?

I’m not dating. I wouldn’t mind it, but I don’t want to play that role anymore. I’ve done it before. You get in with a man, and they start expecting that. I can’t do it.

Have you thought about going public with the incident that happened to you?

What happened to me, I want to do some research about. I was young, and it’s a really big deal. I don’t want to go public with it. It was before I was in the business. I’ve thought about writing about it. I went to a friend of mine who’s a writer and said, “I would really love to do a Southern piece, and I would like to put this element in this woman’s history.” I would like to develop it.

As a fictional concept?

Yes, because I still have this idea of developing a TV show. I would love to do an ensemble piece sort of like the characters in “Love After Love” — that complex, but for a TV series. I went in to pitch this idea to her, and I told her what had happened to me and said I would love this to be a mature woman my age and for this to be part of her history. I had never told anybody this except for my daughters. And then the #MeToo happened and Rose came out.

That’s what I’m talking about: It had bubbled up to the point where I finally told someone. It was after the Trump thing, and I think psychologically it had something to do with it because I felt like, with what happened to me, these guys felt it was OK. The behavior that we’re talking about, men have been told that it’s OK. And they’ve supported each other. It is OK because they’re supported each other in treating women like that. It’s been all right.

Do you think you have more of a leg to stand on in terms of getting that project developed?

I think if I focused really hard on it I could make it happen. I just need to really set my mind to it. It’s like anything in life.

I look at other people, like Nicole Kidman and all these people, and look back and think, “At one point, I was a contender along with these people.” I feel like I lost my juice somewhere along the line.

Do you know when that happened?

I think it was important to me to have a normal life. I don’t know that you can have a normal life. It was a sweet idea, and I tried super hard. I lived in North Carolina and Montana, and I did not focus very hard on my career. I focused really hard on my children, and I had this concept that I wanted to give them something normal. I don’t know that people ever really allowed us to be normal. I think it’s super hard for people to allow someone in my position to be normal, because they like to see you as that. It’s more fun.

They want you on a pedestal.

Yeah, it’s interesting, right?

You become a figurehead for aspiration.

It’s part of the fantasy of the world.

“I know I won’t have her life, but there she is, so I can at least imagine it.”

Yes, that! They want you to be that. The good thing is, at the same time, I think I’m super ambitious. In getting out of that whole world, I did focus on my children, so there was a positive. They didn’t really know that much about what I did. It was not a part of our dialogue, and it did help me to just be a mom. But at the same time, it made me lose the inspiration, in a sense, to be more creative in my work. And it’s just a matter of finding that kind of levity and energy and making it happen when you haven’t been in the loop.

You’re right, though. Through a lot of the ’90s, you were one of the it-girls, so to speak.

I was in the mix. That would be the word.

You could have had Julia Roberts’ career if you’d wanted it.

I could have done a lot more. I could have started a production company and made more happen. But also, at the same time, there was one year right away when my success really took off and I did three movies. And I felt like I just didn’t see my children, and I didn’t like that.

I had read an article written by a man who was about my age, 60, and he had written about regrets. He said, “You’ll never regret not working. You will regret not spending time with your family.” I listened! I made sure that was my priority. But now they’re gone, so I do have the time, if I can just focus and connect.

I’ve never lived in Los Angeles, so I’m starting to make connections. I’m trying to reach out to younger people and keep my mind open. Maybe I can make it happen.

You sound fairly zen about the whole thing. Was there ever a moment when you were more resentful about how that panned out?

Hmm, I’m trying to think of what I said to a friend of mine. Not resentful. That’s not how I feel. I almost felt like, what did I do wrong? What could I have done more? That kind of thing. How did I not end up more connected? I’ll look at people who are making it happen and they’ve got it all going on, with the production companies, and think, where was the disconnect for me? And I think it was living in North Carolina and focusing on my kids. But I’m glad I did.

I know it’s kind of late in the day to spark that energy, but …

People love a comeback story.

It still could happen.

After all, you were the talk of “Magic Mike XXL.”

Well, that was another case. When you disappear like that and you feel so disconnected, like you’re just completely nobody, you’re excited for an opportunity. It didn’t matter how small it was. I just wanted to be in the movie, please, and work on a movie with [“Sex, Lies and Videotape” director Steven Soderbergh] and be with all these wonderful people.

And watch some hot men dance.

And watch some hot men dance! It was a lot of fun. Being in the room with those guys was hysterical. And I think they were happy to have me there. It was only three nights. Talk about changing time zones. I worked really hard to get into that time zone because we were working nights.

When you look back, do you think about doors that could have opened had you taken different roles?

Yeah, I think everybody thinks that, I’m sure. There’s a lot of things I could have done differently.

Were you offered “The Silence of the Lambs,” or is that just a rumor?

No, I wasn’t offered “Silence of the Lambs.” That’s a mistake. And it’s not only what you were offered, but I’ll look back at opportunities and say, “If I hadn’t been consumed with my personal life at that moment, I would have gotten that.” There are a lot of cases like that, and I’m not going to say which movies. But you’ve got to have a personal life, right? That is the hard thing to balance. It’s not an easy process. And I also had my kids young. A lot of people wait. I had my kids in the height of my career, so I had a lot going on.

At this point, how many scripts are you reading in any given year?

Not enough. [Laughs] And I would also be open to taking smaller roles, like “Magic Mike.” Sometimes I think, why am I not more connected with all these people that they would remember me and I could play quirky roles? What did I do wrong? I maybe didn’t befriend people enough or get close enough to people. How do I get in there and just play these offbeat characters? I’d be willing to do that.

Right as you were dipping out of the limelight, it seemed like people were starting to whisper more about the lack of roles for women of a certain age, which has since become a pressing topic in Hollywood.

Yeah, and they weren’t even whispering. They felt very comfortable asking that question: “How does it feel to know you’re not going to work anymore?” Isn’t that amazing? They’re not going to feel comfortable asking it anymore, you would think. They’ll look stupid. But everybody asked it. It was a normal question to ask.

You were asked that question specifically?

Oh, so many times! That’s what I’m talking about: It’s been so normal to treat us like that. It’s the same thing as thinking that women don’t age well. That’s a concept that women believe, too. I keep saying to them, “It’s not true, you guys. They age, too — they’ve just tricked us.” Think about it!

I told this to another guy the other day, and it’s true: If you put a man with a woman who’s 25 years younger on the screen, automatically he looks sexy. The concept keeps happening — it’s happened for so long that we project that energy onto him because we’ve been taught it. Men look alluring, they look sexy. If you did that with women, we, too, would look alluring and sexy.

And when women get to be older than their love interests, it’s treated as a punchline, like “Harold and Maude.” That’s an extreme example of an age difference, but it speaks to what you’re saying.

Right, and I’m just talking about a 10-year age difference. We would look like our power was sexy. “I’m a rich, powerful woman. Why can’t I be just like a rich, powerful man?” And it’s not so much that I even want it.

You want the opportunity.

I want women to be seen as as sexy as men, and I don’t want women to feel bad about themselves. That’s what has happened to us. We’ve been taught that we age out. Men become sexier, and we become trash. It’s not a good way to live. From 40 to 60, we could have such better lives. And mine’s gone! I’m turning 60, so I’m fighting for all those other people. I want my daughters to feel good about themselves.We’re unsure of what to expect when Darius pulls up in a U-Haul truck out front the mansion pianist Benny Hope shares with his brother Teddy Perkins. Darius, played by Lakeith Stanfield, had driven to the home, tucked outside the city, to pick up a free piano that had rainbow-colored keys.

As he goes to knock on the door, it creaks open on its own — a typical horror movie trope meant to put viewers on edge and hint that Darius is in danger. He enters the foyer slowly, looking around him, calling out for anyone who may be home. Lurking in the shadows is Teddy, who creeps out of the nook by the staircase and questions a startled Darius about the Stevie Wonder song he was playing in the truck just before he entered the property.

From there, Teddy Perkins — the titular character in the latest installment of Donald Glover’s “Atlanta” — drags Darius, and the rest of us, through a maze of horrific twists and turns uninterrupted by commercial breaks. It’s easy to write Teddy, a character bluntly based on Michael Jackson, off as weird or strange. But in reality he is a tormented, broken man who has experienced the worst incarnations of the childhood abuse and trauma often inflicted upon black children in the name of love. Every detail laced within the episode is carefully placed to make clear to viewers that the theme of the series’ second season, “Robbin’ Season,” is about much more than losing your possessions. Teddy represents the most malignant aspects of a generation of black people whose mental stability has been compromised in the name of success. Darius, on the other hand, symbolizes those who are next up and fighting to deconstruct old notions that the only way to keep black children on the right path is to beat it into them.

Taryn Finley and Julia Craven discuss this, how a number of black kids must sacrifice their childhood happiness for success, Sammy Sosa’s hat and more on this week’s “Run That Back.”

Warning: The spoilers below contain details about suicide.

After using a red Sharpie to make a Confederate flag “Southern Made” hat read “U Mad,” Darius drives outside the city of Atlanta and into the countryside. He pulls up to the gate of a mansion and hits the buzzer. A high-pitched, eerie voice comes on the speaker and asks Darius why he’s there. He’s come all this way to pick up a pretty dope piano with rainbow-colored keys. And it’s free, in a sense. He walks to the front door, which opens on its own, and meets Teddy Perkins.

Taryn: This episode was high-key deep.



Julia: It was very deep, almost as deep as Sammy Sosa’s hat was blended into his skin tone.



Taryn: See. I’m not about to play with you. Lmao.



Julia: Aight, let’s start from the beginning and walk through this one, because it’s a doozy of an episode. And I still don’t get everything that went down, but I’m here and I’m trying to get past just how fucked up Donald Glover got me this morning.



Taryn: Chile. Wasn’t it a doozy? First and foremost, I love that Darius finally got his episode. And honestly, I think he’s the only one in this show who could survive an afternoon at Teddy Perkins’ house.

Julia: Yes! The episode was very Darius ― it was dark, it was weird, it was deep and intellectual just like he is. And it was truly created for him, because, like the episode’s subtitle said, “Y’all know I woulda been left.” (I HOPE Y’ALL KNOW EYE WOULD HAVE LEFT, TOO.)

I did love how he took a red Sharpie to a “Southern Made” hat ― with a complimentary Confederate flag ― and made it say “U Mad” though. I loved it and I loved the white woman staring him down afterward more. Very Darius.

Taryn: Girl. Darius and that Confederate “U Mad” hat had me HOWLING! For me, it’s more like I wouldn’t have been there in the first damn place, because I don’t frequent message boards looking for free shit at strangers’ homes. Darius can have that. I’m going to Target.

Julia: I love a good message board post but I am also black so I def ain’t renting a U-Haul, driving out into the woods ALONE to get a piano. (The piano was dope af though.)

Taryn: It was. I feel like only niggas like Darius would come up on some shit like that for free lol.

Julia: Listen, ONLY niggas like Darius. So we get to Teddy Perkins’ house. And Darius goes to knock on the door, but it opens and Teddy is standing off to the side, by the stairs, in the shadows. That’s when I knew that it was time for Darius to get tf outta there. The way they’re using horror as a trope this season is interesting and very well done. I was actually SHOOK after this episode!

Taryn: So, I was really caught off guard from jump because of that horror aspect. Like Darius is unpredictable but WHEW! And the fact that he’s interacting with Teddy ― a Michael Jackson-esque figure who’s easy to label as “weird” on the surface, but whose story is too multi-layered to really dismiss as that ― is a really good juxtaposition. Darius is easily seen as a lil out there when just engaging with Al and Earn, but seeing this episode really cemented how level-headed and valuable he really is.

Julia: Yes! Darius isn’t just the high friend, the weird black kid. He’s someone with sound judgement and rationale. He also has quite the emotional IQ, which just makes me wanna marry him tbh.

It seems like in this episode, the horror aspects were used to dig into black people’s mental health and how fraught it can be. And, tbh, the Jackson family is the perfect model for how a man who may have good intentions, who may want the best for his kids, can damage them because he uses “I want the best for you” as an excuse for the abuse he’s inflicting.

When Darius noted that Teddy “must be depressed” from sitting in the dark all day, his response, “It’s not easy but maybe one day we’ll get a good album out of it,” was telling us early on that this is someone who’s broken (like the ostrich egg) and who believes that pain leads to greatness.

And that is something that so many black kids are taught to believe.

Taryn: Mmmhm. And I know that egg STANK lol. But for real, this episode was so sad. When Darius was looking at Teddy’s old photos of his brother Benny Hope (who EVERYBODY was initially convinced was made up, especially after Teddy mentioned his rare skin condition), he was very black as far as physical features go. Kinky hair, Jackson 5 nostrils, full lips. We didn’t see Benny’s actual face, but it’s obvious that Teddy, too, was born with those features. It made me really sad seeing Teddy with all of this plastic surgery and skin-lightening. This house that Teddy and Benny live in is a representation of the trauma they’ve always lived in. They’re prisoners to their own pain.

Darius has spent more time and energy learning about Teddy’s upbringing than he probably anticipated. Teddy shows Darius his in-home museum dedicated to Benny’s work. Behind the double doors of one room of the museum lies a tribute to the past abusive behavior that brought Teddy and Benny to this point: a fair-skinned, faceless mannequin of their father. Teddy tells Darius that he’s not mad at his dad for beating them, because it was intended to mold them into his vision of success. Teddy mentions that he wants to commemorate other great (read: abusive) fathers throughout modern history.

Julia: That pain became very evident when we got to the room he designated for his father. He called his father “the reason for all this” ― and he definitely was the reason for everything. His money, his pain, his loneliness, his flawed perspectives, everything. When Teddy laid out the “training” his father put him through, how getting beat was punishment for not excelling, how his father just “wanted the best” out of him and his siblings and that “great things come from great pain” ― it made me think about just how many black kids are sold that narrative. “I beat you because I love you.” “You have to be twice as good.” To prepare you for, like, “I’m going to deliver the licks early so that you aren’t killed, so that you’re successful.” And I’ve known for a while that we have to stop teaching our kids that, but this episode really drove that home. We cannot keep doing that shit to our kids.

“To make an omelet, you have to crack a few eggs” made me cringe. So many of us have heard something similar as a response to being whooped for something. I know me, I got whoopings for talking back and being mouthy. Do I know why my granny did that? Yeah. She didn’t want me to pop off at the wrong white person. And she wanted me to keep my mouth shut and work hard so that I could thrive. And, to an extent, those lessons helped me navigate Corporate America. But that doesn’t mean I agree with it or will perpetuate it with my children. It doesn’t mean I should. Beating black kids into submission ain’t the only way for them to succeed.

Taryn: It’s depressing, really. And unfair on a physical and emotional level. A lot of black kids grow up with these toxic lessons, because so many parents place survival above compassion. Lots of folks from older generations believe that whoopings are a rights of passage and the most effective means of teaching lessons to not only stay out of trouble but to succeed and escape the struggle. That mentality is why the replica of Teddy’s dad in his museum didn’t have a face. Like it was saying, “Why waste time emoting when there’s work to be done?”

Also, note the people that Teddy named when he said that he was turning the room into a hall of fame for great fathers: Joe Jackson, Marvin Gay Sr., Earl Woods (Tiger Woods’ dad), Richard Williams (Venus and Serena’s dad). These were all men who allegedly verbally, emotionally or physically abused their kids with intentions of turning them into the superstars they became known as. We talk about Joe Jackson’s abuse towards his kids, but we don’t always take the time to really dissect the real, long-lasting impact that had on his children, even as they became adults. Those kids, and so many other black kids whose names we don’t know, were hurting. And that pain begets real and serious trauma if we don’t heal from it.

On a second watch, this line from Teddy in reference to something another musician told him about Benny really got me: “He said, ‘Your brother plays pain better than anyone.’ Benny just played what he knew.”

If pain is all you know, pain will be how you see the world until real healing interferes.

Julia: Yeah, that stuck out to me, too. It was so real, so raw, so literal.

Taryn: You know what else I thought was telling? Teddy’s attitude towards hip-hop.

Julia: Do tell! Was it the respectability aspect of it or what?

Taryn: He low-key scoffed when Darius brought it up, said it hadn’t grown out of its adolescence. The essence of hip-hop is very anti-respectability and, though steeped in hypermasculinity, it is an amazing form of expressing emotions a lot of black people have been shamed for. Like, for instance, anger. It allows room for frustration and rebellion, something I’m sure Teddy and Benny’s dad frowned upon. It also creates a carefree space where we don’t HAVE to necessarily worry about the troubles of the world. It doesn’t have to be disciplined if it doesn’t want to be. Like Darius said, some people just want to listen to it and have a good time. Judging from their six-hour daily piano lessons, I’m sure their dad framed “having a good time” as something that lazy people do.

Julia: Wow, so what’s it like to be the smartest bitch alive?

Taryn: Shit, it’d be much better if I had a check to match.

Julia: I, too, am not playing with you today lmao.

Taryn: LMAO

Julia: Teddy’s thing about sacrifice was also telling.

Taryn: It really was!

Julia: Black kids are always told that we should sacrifice things we love doing in order to succeed. I think about the black kids who love art but major in chemistry and go to medical school because their parents won’t let them do what they love for a career. We see that with Teddy, and Darius makes note of it at the end when he asks him, “What if you had been good at something else?”

You see on Teddy’s face that he’s either never considered that or he hasn’t considered it in a really long time. He gives Darius a “what the fuck?” look. And there are so many successful people who are unhappy in their careers because it was never what they wanted to do. They were pushed into choosing it in order to buck the notion that all black people are poor, but we’re seeing now that we don’t have to sacrifice. Like Darius said, we can produce great things out of love. Sure, you have to labor for anything you want but it doesn’t have to be painful. It can be passion, it can be happiness, it can be love.

Once Darius finally goes to take the piano to the U-Haul, the elevator he’s on skips the first floor and takes him to the basement. He steps out of the elevator to discover Benny, who instructs him to get the gun from the attic and kill both him and Teddy. A confused Darius leaves to take the piano to his truck but Teddy’s car is blocking his. Darius goes back inside the house to ask Teddy to move his car. Teddy then holds him at gunpoint, revealing his plan to frame Darius for Benny’s murder. Darius tells Teddy that he’s sorry for what happened to him and that he deserved an apology from his father. He explains that good things can come out of love, too — a notion Teddy shuns as he regurgitates more of what his father taught him. The elevator dings and Benny, who has risen from the basement, grabs the gun and shoots Teddy before killing himself.

Julia: Shit, back in 2010 Joe Jackson told Oprah that he beat Michael Jackson and didn’t regret it. “It kept them out of jail and kept them right,” he said.

When we don’t let black kids be kids, we fuck them up. The world is already going to snatch their childhood innocence from them. Our parents, our elders don’t have to do it first in some sick attempt to keep us headed down the “right” path.

Taryn: The adultification of black kids is truly an epidemic and it’s doing us all a great disservice. I completely understand where it comes from. I believe I had to grow the hell up and sacrifice on my own accord when my parents started struggling financially when I was young — not because of them, per se, but more so because of the pressures of the world, and I was very aware of what it means to be black and try to navigate through struggle.

Though I understand it, I’m fully aware of the unlearning and healing that we all have to do when it comes to the lessons we teach black kids and have healthy and productive conversations with them about race. Also, we need to kill that “twice as good” saying. We know the educational, economic gaps that exist. We can teach black kids about them without limiting them and making them feel small.

The world will try to do that anyway, so we need to make them feel as big as they’d like to be while we also, as Tyler the Creator so eloquently put it, “tell these black kids they can be who they are.”

**steps off of soapbox**

Julia: The episode’s ending, a dark fraternal murder-suicide, gave us a realistic glimpse of what can happen when we don’t address this kind of mental suffering. Teddy and Benny were pushed to this point their entire lives.

It was all they knew and they both, in their own ways, had decided to end the suffering. Only Teddy wanted to maintain his pride and Benny didn’t want someone innocent to get looped up in it all. And I’m pretty sure Teddy was further abusing Benny ― evident from the blood on the piano keys after we saw the wheelchair at the piano earlier.

But Darius hit the nail on the head when he said, “Your dad should have said sorry.” We all have had our traumatic childhood experiences, but when you grow up you MUST deconstruct those ways of thinking.

And I know we keep saying this but, my God, YOU DON’T HAVE TO BEAT BLACK KIDS INTO SUBMISSION!!!!!

I think this episode, in a surreal, dark way, gives up a glimpse at what can happen when you do. Sure, they’re successful. But they aren’t happy. They can’t handle their problems. They’re emotionally stunted because you never let them grow, you never let them be kids. You didn’t let them be who they wanted to be. And that’s unfair.

I felt for Teddy and Benny, even though I wasn’t sure Benny existed. Even if Benny wasn’t real, if he was some made-up character .... he was created by Teddy as an escape from his horrific life.

Taryn: YOOOOO! You literally just read my mind. Teddy was definitely beating Benny. Teddy became his father. He wasn’t mad at him because he idolized him, not only evident from the statue, but also from his obsession with Benny’s talent.

He was even studying the video of his dad verbally abusing Benny while he was practicing. The way his dad hit the piano in the tape is the same threatening way Teddy hit the piano when Darius rushed him to get the tax documents earlier in the episode. Back to that line you mentioned earlier, “It’s not easy, but maybe one day we’ll get a good album out of it.” He was whooping Benny’s ass in hopes of what he perceived as perfection.

Julia: That’s just a tragic way to live. And, last thing — when Teddy said, “I love this song,” I think that was a clear siren that the character was based on Michael Jackson. You know that GIF I’m talmbout.
